	schema:reviewBody "Frank A. Cappello writer and director of He Was a Quiet Man is a man with something to prove having written the hilariously bad Hulk Hogan vehicle Suburban Commando and directing the wholly disappointing Constantine. He Was a Quiet Man whilst not an unqualified success is one of the underseen gems of 2007.The film is essentially an amalgam of A History of Violence Falling Down and Office Space with a pile of quirks to boot. Bob Maconel the hilariously disguised Christian Slater a despondent office worker decides that he is going to perform a murderous rampage at his work office yet before he can do so a fellow maniac beats him to it. However Bob in protecting the one person that he cares about the beautiful Vanessa Elisha Cuthbert guns down the assailant and inadvertently becomes a hero.Bob is unashamedly similar to Michael Douglas' DFens character from Falling Down kitted out in a shirt and tie and even further seeks moments of reflection in the great outdoors although in this instance there are no Mexican gangsters attempting to rob him. The similarities do thankfully stop there  this film is born of something else with its CGI traffic whizzing by at astronomical speeds as Bob dawdles along illustrating the drudgery of Bob's life without an ounce of subtlety. Whilst the film as a whole is overly reliant on visual curiosities such as this the animated talking fish which eggs Bob on to kill his colleagues is delightfully colourful and mildly amusing to boot.As one can gather from the above paragraph He Was a Quiet Man is very surreal in a hilarious sort of way. Essentially if you gave David Lynch a funny bone you'd probably end up with something remarkably similar to this. Despite the aforementioned reliance on visual effects the film is unquestionably carried by the barelyrecognisable Slater who despite his recent collaboration with tragically awful director Uwe Boll proves that he is still worth something in Hollywood with comic timing that is nothing short of spot on.Bob is essentially revered by everyone around him for his heroic actions  he is given a new job his colleagues no longer think of him as a schmuck and the sexy office bitch wants to have sex with him yet the film's real point of contention is Cuthbert's character. Vanessa is left paralysed following the shooting wishing that she was dead and moreover she wishes that Bob who saved her life would kill her.A surprisingly understated until the climatic scenes conundrum surfaces as an aside to this drama  Bob still finds those around him utterly repugnant and he considers whether or not to carry out what the other gunner started as well as putting Vanessa out of her misery of course. The film carries these questions very well  it is at times predictable and occasionally not so yet it never ceases to lose its sense of intrigue. The film's examination of the way in which humans operate is not intricate and verges on syrupy at times yet what is most entertaining about He Was a Quiet Man is its surreal spirit. Furthermore even in its sweetness the film explores the lives of disabled persons with a surprising level of insight and honesty . It may be exaggerated and at times even humorous yet its approach is undeniably refreshing particularly in relation to how the disabled manage to still engage in an active and healthy sex life.He Was a Quiet Man never remains comfortable constantly fidgeting and posing new questions for both ourselves and Bob to consider. The film follows through with an insane close yet it is the most manically reasoned and therefore perhaps the most realistic end possible although term realism is a very tenuous one in a film as twisted as this. The ending comes very abruptly and little is done to satisfy viewer curiosity yet we are given the vital answers even if they aren't wholly satisfying and are a tad questionable. We are left to ponder several things yet when the preceding ninety minutes are so intentionally devoid of poignance the film may simply leave your mind as the final frame does.Christian Slater's latest and greatest effort at least for a while is A History of Violence without the graphic violence Falling Down without the social commentary and Office Space without the sagacious humour. Yes it is a blend of all three films at the cost of diluting each of them. The film's worst crime may be never allowing us to particularly care for Bob or anyone as much as we did for DFens in Schumacher's film yet even despite its relative superficiality He Was a Quiet Man remains a thoroughly entertaining inventive and quirky film that will have nihilists the world over utterly dumbfounded myself included. Elisha Cuthbert pulls out a career best in that she is above tolerable and even good William H Macy plays the corporate yesman with glee and Slater with great aid from his fabulous makeup department looks and acts with great hilarity. It is unfortunate that this film embracing its flaws as it so flagrantly does has yet to find a large audience and as such it instantly becomes one of the indie staples of 2007.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is not bad visually. It breaks no new ground but it pulls off some musicvideo style imagery in a way that fits nicely into the film. Christian Slater's acting is actually pretty good. But the plot stinks.

Sort of reminds you of Milton from Office Space but taken so far over the edge there's just no looking back. He's mistreated at work he hates his job and he wants it all to end. The thing that really got me attached to this film was the observations of the inner workings of Bob. He talks to his goldfish and for crying out loud the thing talks back. This is obviously an unstable man. His stabilizer though found in the victim Vanessa played amazingly well by Elisha Cuthbert reminded me so much of CarrieAnn Moss from Memento. She carries him but teaches him to be a stronger man through essential ballbusting. The script was perfect for each of the lead roles. Both Cuthbert and especially Slater shocked me to no end with their talent. This was Slater's ideal role. Director Frank A. Cappello regained some status with this. It was quite the achievement. It's unfortunate that it had such a small release I would've never heard of it if it wasn't for the fact that I got an advance DVD. It's going to go overlooked for many.

This is the kind of film that excites the fevered brains of would be brilliant potential geniuses in their second year of film school. I know because I went there and we were all geniuses.But a film that twists and mauls the sensibility of its viewers and then makes no point at all because if nearly the whole film or you could say the entire film is a delusional misfit's fantasy prior to his suicide nothing in its content can be valid no matter how well done striking technically innovative or novel it may be...and this film is not novel Jacob's Ladder was a similar and far more meaningful film. Not innovative I would say something like BlowUp is a nohope movie that really makes a tremendous philosophical point without having to smirk in your face after you watch it all the way through He Was A Quiet Man does this just to show you the film makers like Bob's employers and superiors know how smart they are and how dumb you are. And they want you to know that too. BlowUp respects the audience is what I mean. This film hates its audience and wants to screw them up. And you well may be screwed up after watching this because you started to really car whether Bob is going to pull himself together and make it and whether this everyman gets to be a true hero in the face of all these rotten people but he is just a loser pretty much the way his superior played by Jamison Jones views him. If you're not a golfplaying harddrinking insincere prick you might as well shoot yourself and get it over with. This film is not striking technically by now we've seen all kinds of talking animals fronting for the delusions of a psycho think of Sam in the Summer of Sam. But Spike Lee loves his audience he is a film lover too. The mind behind this film hates its potential viewers we are too stupid to get it so we might as well be deceived the whole bloody way through.Same feeling I had after walking the railroad tracks to get to school as a short cuta hell of a long slog and rough on the footwear with a strong chance of getting blindsided in the end.

I like this guy's work.It's nice to see William Macy in a different type of role than I usually see him in but anyone could have done that turn  not much there for him to do but he ably supports which is a fine thing since that's what his role here should be...In some ways it reminded me of Fight Club.Saw this on an airplane today and now I'm kicking back and looking it up.

	schema:headline " This was a brilliant film";
	schema:reviewBody "It seems that every once and a while an occasionally brilliant film will catch my attention in the late hours of the night or the early hours of the morning as it was in my case I found that film in He Was a Quiet Man writerdirector Frank A. Cappello's brilliantly acted smartly written satire about that unlikely hero whose heroic act may not have been so heroic and in fact masked an inner rage that may actually make him the villain.A seriously understated Christian Slater stars as Bob Maconel a frustrated office worker whose first words in the picture have him counting the amount of bullets in his gun and who his intended targets are going to be. Bob lives alone and works as a drone in one of those big technology firms where it's never made clear what it is that they actually do or what everyone's jobs are. Bob's daytoday existence consists of him feeding his fish who he talks to and they occasionally give him bad advice fueling his murderous rage going to work rarely being acknowledged by his neighbors being picked on by his coworkers and working up the courage to go on his deadly shooting spree.Well just when Bob finally gets the courage to do the deed he is beaten to the punch by a fellow enraged office worker. In the middle of the carnage Bob and the shooter manage to strike up a casual conversation. When Bob asks why he's not going to shoot him the man replies Because you're the only person in this office who's more pathetic than I am. Bob takes this personally and guns down the assailant. Afterward he rushes to the side of the office beauty Vanessa Parks Elisha Cuthbert who was seriously wounded in the attack and is the only person Bob ever really liked. Her smile could light up a room we're told throughout the film.Bob is then branded a hero. The people he despised are now his best friends including the office bully and the office slut who would have never given the time of day before. She gets her comeuppance in one particular scene that is all of hilarious disgusting and disturbing. He gets a promotion a brandnew office next to the big boss Mr. Shelby William H. Macy and the company car. His neighbors finally acknowledge him when one of them asks when did he move in Bob replies I've lived here five years. He soon begins to visit Vanessa in the hospital whose spine was severed by a bullet and is now a quadriplegic. She begs him to finish what the shooter started. When he relents that's when the two begin a tentative relationship that begins to calm the deadly monster lurking within him. Later on in the film however troubling questions begin to arise about Bob's sanity and his grip on his new reality that he has found himself in.As many have mentioned He Was a Quiet Man seems to combine elements of past similarthemed features including Falling Down Office Space and A History of Violence plus a few of the artistically weird storytelling aesthetics of a David Lynch picture. Similarities seem to end fairly early in the picture after Bob first becomes a hero and a media darling. It seems that when you finally have a grasp on where it's all headed the picture does a 360 and winds up going right back to where it started both metaphorically and literally.Slater was pretty good in this film his performance here worked from his first seconds on screen his character of office drone Bob Maconel combining elements of the main characters from the films I mentioned earlier and hitting all the right emotive notes. For years he's been hounded by his Jack Nicholson obsession and I think here he seems to have finally come into his own as a seriously demented loner who is quickly losing his grip on reality.While by no means one of my favorite actresses it was a delight to see Elisha Cuthbert in a role where her gorgeous looks are only part of her performance and are not THE performance here is a beautiful woman who freely admits to using her sexuality as a means of getting ahead in life and now she's been reduced to nothing  a fact that she freely admits to having accepted  and finally having to take things extra slow because her most valuable asset has been taken away from her her own body. Maybe I'm overreaching or being overly critical  I did like her in The Girl Next Door 2004  she can act it's that I haven't liked too many of her film projects since '04. Anyway when she's confined to a wheelchair for the rest of her life for me it's almost like stepping back to truly appreciate a fine piece of art. Only then is she truly beautiful.He Was a Quiet Man is not a perfect film. The script is prone to occasional slips of the pen in certain places but the performances especially by Christian Slater and Elisha Cuthbert and Cappello's artistic direction and grip on the finer points of the material make up for it. He Was a Quiet Man is one of those brilliant movies that forces us to look at ourselves and see what makes us tick. It's funny it's dramatic and it's also occasionally quite disturbing but it is an example of allaround great latenight fanfare that deserves more respect from the moviegoing public.910".

	schema:reviewBody "This was a very surreal movie that had everything for the avid film fan. The performances from Cuthbert and slater were top draw and the script was excellent culminating on my opinion with a below par end. I feel i would have given a 10 if there had been a little more thought in the last 510 minutes.The story revolves around Slater he has a very mundane life and is treated like a piece of dirt by his work colleagues. He works in a cubicle and spends all day planning to literally shoot the office up until just as you think he will another colleague does. He then saves Cuthberts life and this is where the story really begins.There are various surreal moments on several occasions Slater is talking to his fish and they have some witty responses. Cuthbert looks great as always but nice to see her in a movie where some acting is required i would find it hard to criticise though as the film the girl next door is my favourite film of all time and Cuthbert can do no wrong. The Karaoke Scene is terrific and shows both the humour and serious message from this film.Slaters character was another complex part of the story you at the beginning don't really have time for him. He then starts to improve his life and his character becomes more likable but ultimately his character goes more and more into depression and looses his trust of everyone again and you start to dislike him again.On the whole this film will not set box office records alight but with all the rubbish rolling out of the studios recently this is a little gem that has snuck out. I would definitely recommend you see it at your earliest opportunity.".

	schema:reviewBody "A movie with serious and poignant themes that isn't afraid to let out the full force of human emotion and confusion. Brilliant in its ability to draw parallels between the mind of a very sick individual and our own lives. Various unpleasant modes of motivation are also explored in the screenplay via archetypal imagery and polarity. More than entertainment the movie is likely to touch a chord in the psyche of even the most jaded part of oneself encouraging hope for change while at the same time exploring the inevitable outcome pursuant to the present course as delineated by the characters personas. Let me try saying it this way. Intense themes of alienation lust power anger and confusion are painted with broad and overlapping strokes in this powerhouse of a movie. The canvas of the screen time and again extrudes into the mind of the viewer through imagery tone familiarity and by the commentary of a fish. Don't over look the fish. Likely should have gotten a nomination for some screenplay award and was well overlooked. And then there is the hummingbird. We aren't really asked to look to deeply at these two pivotal characters in the film yet they act as a prism regarding the various themes and characters in the film arguably helping to blend and mix them so we can more easily identify with the film itself. Then there is the use of black and white at the very beginning of the film one of the rare times I felt that it created more than mood or atmosphere the footage there was poetic and beautiful. And then the descent into the everyday. Bound to continue to work on the mind and possibly the psyche days after viewing. I'd see it again with a friend or as a film night kind of thing. I think that it would be interesting to listen to what other people thought of it how they interpreted it and also to listen to the naysayers of which there likely would be few. It deals with various taboos and foul motives. Not an upbeat movie I give it thumbs up.".

	schema:reviewBody "HE WAS A QUIET MAN echoes the all too familiar news item of irrational killings in public places  here in this country by seemingly 'normal indistinguishable people'. Writerdirector Frank A.

	schema:reviewBody "I was totally taken back by how good a small low budget movie like this really is. Christian Slater is unlike any role he has ever played as Bob McConnell and was just brilliant in this role. I think he was vastly overlooked in terms of honours and seriously could have merited an Oscar nomination at the very least for this role. He plays a sad lonely disgruntled office worker who harbors dark thoughts about his nasty co workers and is going to go on a shooting spree instead he ends up being called a hero for killing another worker who beats him to the punch and shoots up his office. A lot of the film deals with his relationship with a girl he fancies who ends up shot and paralysed Elisha Cuthbert and how he tries to be there for her and how he finds some happiness with her while never quite getting ahead with his life. This is a great little film which is quite sad gentle touching and very well written and directed by Frank Capello. Although there are a few cheap effects the movie has enough great ideas and shows some good skill in filmmaking.There was a lot of thought put in to this and the film pays off really well and the whole point of making films like this is that it doesn't matter how much it cost to make it's the idea that counts.What makes Christian Slater so good in this movie is that he plays Bob as a misunderstood soul and a person looked down on who is not a bad person but just confused and i thought he was phenomenal in this role if only he stretched himself and played more parts like this. Elisha Cuthbert was also very good in this and William H. Macy added good support as the slimy boss.Capello should get some bigger jobs after this because i think he did a great job in storytelling and had some vision in making this under rated gem.I'd put it in the same category as films like Secetary One Hour Photo Memento and others as a cult movie with a quite indie feel to it.

	schema:reviewBody "He was a quiet man features Bob Maconel Christian Slater who is a displeased man working in an office with orthodox 95 routine. He is a very lonely individual who gets bullied by his superiors and ignored by his coworkers he is nerdy looking and seems to have no charisma which makes him an instant easy target. This leaves him with no options to allow orders from people and let them treat him like a servant. This has brought him to a breaking point where he feels his life is no longer worth living and attempts a killing spree. However a fellow coworker named Coleman beats Maconel to the 'job' whilst going through a similar experience of his own. This occurrence leaves Maconel rising from a zero to a hero. Maconel manages to prevent Vanessa Elisha Cuthbert from dying and shooting killer Coleman! Vanessa is left almost completely paralysed and can no longer maintain her job. The job is appointed to Maconel by Gene Shelby William H. Macy. Maconel receives Vanessa's company car and an office with a view  something he's always wanted. People treat him differently after the incident and take interest in his life as he gets invited to parties and the opportunity to share his ideas with the company.Initially Vanessa was angry with Maconel for saving her life  as she felt she would be better off dead than being disabled. Maconel has fantasised being with Vanessa for years and still likes her the same way despite her condition. This brings Maconel and Vanessa together as they form a relationship. All of this seems like a perfect life but it leaves Maconel completely overwhelmed and he can't handle the situation he's in. Maconel starts to question himself and he finds himself in a situations that is changing for the worst. The music used in this film works very appropriately and is very well timed. I like it when I'm not distracted by a popular song in a film and He was a Quiet Man doesn't suffer from uniqueness. There is a few times where Maconel narrates and I have to admit Christian Slater's narration is pretty good. He gives a credible performance as he does with any film role that he portrays.My only one complaint was the running time at 95 minutes. I finished the film quite simply wanting more and the plot twist towards the end of the film seemed a little unoriginal and predicable. The film was written and directed by Frank A. Cappello. I have always respected authors who direct their own films. I suppose he was pensiveness of how he wanted the film to look and didn't want any other director to change that from him. This film had a very limited budget approximately in the region of 600000. There was no studio behind it making it a strictly independent production. It had theatre showings in a few cities for one week each and the main release was on DVD in USA on January 15 2008.So basically the film is well worth watching but it suffers towards the end  I felt it was capable of a lot more as there isn't a moment of screen wasted time. It is an enjoyable film to watch  but you need to pay attention to understand the plot twists.".

	schema:reviewBody "Its interesting now that Uwe Boll seems to be pursuing some sort of artistic intentions with his cinema to see this early work and realise that his mainstream offerings were never his first love that he had some sort of a plan all along. I've actually only seen one of his films the lamentable Seed so I have no comment on his general qualities but Amoklauf is a successful little film if not an especially entertaining or interesting one. Its a study in a private and dysfunctional personality in lonely obsession and ultimate bloody breaking point. Our nameless protagonist is a waiter but mostly he stays at home watching videotapes a German game show slaughterhouse and execution footage apparently from Faces of Death and finally a porno. He also fantasies about murder masturbates and philosophizes that man is a worthless creature who will suffer anything just to survive. Not a pleasant or stable individual in essence and the film puts us right there with him. We watch his TV through his eyes sometimes we watch his TV with him sometimes we watch his face as he watches his TV. We see his apartment as well sometimes we see him go about mundane rites and sometimes we see him just sit there. Its a fitting mixture of ennui and unpleasantness as the film goes a cold twitchy feeling accumulates and a bleak tension along with nagging boredom by the final ten minutes its hard not to fair pray for the guy to snap. And snap he does with memorably grim intensity in a skillfully stylised scene that uses changes in film stock slow motion and grainy close ups to highlight the alienation granting an almost lyrical mood. A classy cap off in other words and it pretty much makes the whole experience worthwhile. On the whole this is difficult to recommend though. Its a film that cares little for engagement nor poetry or depth in its subject. It works as an exercise in nihilism perhaps almost perfectly as unlike something like Angst it lacks visual fascination or genuine fear it doesn't transcend its subject matter with much in the way of added aesthetic value until the climax and that's just a fraction of the overall runtime. But this bare nihilism simply isn't that fulfilling it works somewhat as a curio but as cinema is frankly a bit lacking. Not that I actually disliked the experience I've just come to prefer work that has more to offer. A bit hard to rate this one as it does what it sets out to do isn't actually bad and may even be pretty worthy to some tastes. 510 oughta cover it I think.".

The movie feels a lot like this directors' works from the Eighties e.g. Benny's Video. The most distinguishing feature of Bolls recent movies the overemployment of annoying visual style elements is already present here as the entire finale of the movie is shot from two intercut camera angles and presented entirely in slowmotion. While I was quite happy with the dualperspective idea I could have done without all the slomo.There must have been a very tight budget and it shows I'm pretty sure that the amok victims are all Uwe's buddies from movie school and the long sequences where you don't see anything except videocopied episodes from a German TV show suggests that they had to try anything just to bring the movie over the rounds. Again this reminded me a lot of Haneke's style.In sum it's surprisingly good for what it is even though being a derivate of better directors' stuff.".

There's no real storyline and there's very little exposition as to why the killerwaiter is the way he is which was a bit disappointing. There were several drawnout scenes of him sitting around watching TV that would have been better spent explaining his motivations for his actions.

It's one of his earlier attempts and a whole different kind than his major releases. The way it was filmed did remind me of Schramm. Especially the scene's at the killer's home. The edition I have is full uncut. And it's not this short feature which clocks in at an hour that made it to be cut. It's the television that makes it really not for the squeamish. First of all there is footage visible of animal cruelty an some footage of a slaughterhouse. Further on the killer looks at someone being electrocuted but that looked like the scene from Faces Of Death. When he's watching the TV it all takes a bit too long. Just see the scene were he's looking at the German version of The Price Is Right. Others will be offended by the porn flick he's watching while he's masturbating and a victim is laying on the ground. The camera zooms in on the television what you see is not for pussies. Sucking fing two dicks in one pussy facial cum shots in gfact a summary of a porn flick. But if you left the television out of this feature then there isn't that much too see. When he becomes a mass murderer it's shown in slomo and again it's really a slow scene. But it does fit in the era being made the first German splatters and of course Schramm from 1994. Too slow for nowadays but still confronting what he's watching on the TV.".

	schema:reviewBody "Amoklauf is a German film from 1994 so this one will soon have its 25th anniversary and it was written and directed by Uwe Boll before the age of 30 so still relatively early in his career. It runs for about an hour so it certainly is not a long film at all and in the cast list you will find several actors that have worked with Boll on other occasions like Kahrmann who is probably the most known from the bunch. But he is not in the center of it. The main character is played by Michael Rasmussen not the cyclist and I cannot say anything about him really other than that I have not seen other works from him and he did not impress me in here. He plays the guy who runs amok here if he isn't busy watching role play porn or the German version of The Price is Right on his television set. At the end the outburst happens and with the exception of the very first scene perhaps it is all buildup. But it is all repetitive and even the better parts namely the contrast to the overthetop loud television show with its jingle and the protagonist's really calm and restrained physical state sitting there quietly was it a statement on television making us dumb and turning us into monsters? worked for so long. It certainly looked like Boll really was out of ideas which is fairly shocking here given the brief duration. Now Boll is by many considered one of the least talented filmmakers on the planet and this movie here is definitely not helping his case even if it seems to be a different approach to horror and missing the action entirely that defined his later works. This film looks more like an underground work you'd expect from Schnaas or Buttgereit maybe even and a couple others. I think many people who gave this a 110 or a 1010 maybe even did not watch the film as the high quantity of votes seems pretty absurd and just rated it because it was made by Boll. But the 110ers certainly aren't far off as the film is a failure from several perspectives especially as the devastating character study at its very core. A lot went wrong here and the outcome is very amateurish and I don't mean the genremovement with that. Highly not recommended and I am glad it was this short. If you want to see strong Germanlanguage films on amok watch Fassbinder's Herr R. or Kargl's Angst.".

Your typical hardboiled cynical chainsmoking trenchcoat wearing Italian detective stalks the street of New York. Only this one is openly gay and is famous for his enormous...schwanstucker. At the Hotel Quickie in his district an alarming number of men have lost theirs. Overeager hookers are first suspected but our hero soon discovers the truth when he goes to the hotel and almost loses his  to a condom with teeth! Who may be behind this fiendish creature and how is detective Macaroni going to convince others of the existence of this killer contraceptive before it strikes again? Unlike most Troma films this film actually have a rather good and coherent but extremely absurd plot. It is a satirical comedy that is actually played straight for the most part. For being a European film it actually had quite a big budget. It is also interesting to notice that lots of famous German actors and celebrities clamoured to get roles in this film that would have made Hollywood stars run away in terror screaming Career killer!!!. The bearishly handsome and openly gay actor Udo Samel who stars as detective Macaroni has previously played in famous German masterpieces such as Far Away So Close and Kasper Hauser. There is a tender but funny love story included too. There is no frontal nudity but there are some sex scenes that might offend. But if you are easily offended why are you here?The DVD version includes some nice animated menus some Troma extras and a great comment track by the director and special effects supervisor. There are lots of funny anecdotes about the directors claiming to be making a documentary so they will get permission to film in famous locations police officers closing off New York streets for hours stunts that went horribly wrong and all the gruesome scenes that were cut. For some reason they cut a closeup shot here of the condom on the floor after it had just...fed. I can't see why. I think it was a beautiful shot. At one point there is a nice fade from a flashback sequence into a reflection in a window and then a pan as the actor turns and walks away into the distance. The director explains how he did it and then with a big laugh adds But this was probably lost on the average Troma viewer! Alien designer Giger is included in the credits as a creative consultant but he joined the filming so late he could basically only say yes that looks good about the designs already made. The film is in German with English subtitles. Unfortunately you can't turn the subtitles off they are not on a separate track but for what its worth it is a very good translation. American viewers might find it amusing to see German actors speaking German pretending to be New Yorkers but as the directors point out that is what Hollywood does to the rest of the world all the time.The second half of the movie is unfortunately less polished relatively speaking of course than the first because the makers ran out of time and money. Lots of scenes were cut from the second half which makes some subplots a little confusing but the directors admit that the film would probably have been even better if some more stuff had been cut from the last half. However it is still a good film and I can recommend it if you are a fan of trashy entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "In New York four men have their penis ripped in room 308 of the cheap Hotel Quickie. The Sicilian homosexual smoker Detective Luigi Mackeroni Ude Samel is in charge of the investigation. While inquiring in the hotel Mackeroni has a crush on the prostitute Billy Marc Richter goes with Billy to room 308 and they have intercourse in the crime scene. Luigi uses the condom supplied as compliment by the hotel and it eats his testicle. The official version for the police department is that Billy torn Mackeroni's testicle and nobody believes in Mackeroni's version. After many other mutilations Mackeroni finds that a fanatic religious woman intends to destroy gays hookers travesties and other perverts using this weird specimen developed in the laboratory to castrate men. Killer Condom is one of the funniest politically incorrect trash cult movies I have ever seen. The story is narrated in off as if it were a filmnoir. Detective Luigi Mackeroni the hero of the story is gay the former detective Bob is now Babbete a travesty who sings in a brothel.

The Sicilian homosexual smoker Detective Luigi Mackeroni Ude Samel is in charge of the investigation. While inquiring in the hotel Mackeroni has a crush on the prostitute Billy Marc Richter goes with Billy to room 308 and they have intercourse in the crime scene. Luigi uses the condom supplied as compliment by the hotel and it eats his testicle. The official version for the police department is that Billy torn Mackeroni's testicle and nobody believes in Mackeroni's version. After many other mutilations Mackeroni finds that a fanatic religious woman intends to destroy gays hookers travesties and other perverts using this weird specimen developed in the laboratory to castrate men. Killer Condom is one of the funniest politically incorrect trash cult movies I have ever seen. The story is narrated in off as if it were a filmnoir. Detective Luigi Mackeroni the hero of the story is gay the former detective Bob is now Babbete a travesty who sings in a brothel. Babbete had a three minutes affair with a drunken Mackeroni in the past and has been in love with him since then. Billy is the boyfriend of Mackeroni.

The story is prettysimple maleclients of prostitutes are beingcastrated by peniseating creatures in a seedy New York Hotel amazingly not the Chelsea!. The protagonistcop has to discover what the attacks are and who originatedthem and why. It's quiteatrip to the ending and often hairraising especially if you're male.

His friend Bob Bobette is a former cop turned drag queen. And the love of the Inspector's life is  well you'll just have to see for yourself. All of this plus an international conspiracy to purify mankind...";

He's insulted by his coworkers loses a testical to one of the killer condoms and is caught in a love triangle. One's name is Billy and the other is Bob...Err...I mean Babette.The film is witty gross funnydark and not for timid or homophobic.

Just a few sensual moments and one gay sex scene that will make you go nnnnaaah but nothing graphic. Another thing is that the movie takes place in New York and everyone in this movie speaks German.

It runs for 105 minutes basically which I personally found way too long given that the film had nothing to offer. There are moments of horror moments of drama moments of mystery and sciencefiction but it does not deliver enough in terms of quality and quantity in any of these areas that I would say it is a fitting genre description. The only thing I can see it as is a comedy movie. The title character comes to life and does the unspeakable act when put where it usually belongs. No need to further elaborate on that. As a direct consequence a police officer tries to find out what is actually going on and runs into all kinds of bizarre people and situations on the way to finding the truth even something involving God at the very end. Oh well.. that has to happen when it is all about a carnivorous condom. How much you will like or dislike this movie has to do with and all comes down to how funny you will find the humor in here. I personally did not find it funny at all. And that is also why nothing stays apart from strange sexual frequently disturbing and disgusting references that make up this film. And the desperate attempt of being funny while not succeeding at all. Nothing worse than that. It says a lot that the cast includes mostly actors who usually score through charisma and not through range such as the incredibly overrated Iris Berben. Sucks to see Leonard Lansink in here though. He is much much better than the level of this movie. As a whole I give it a major thumbs down and ask... no beg you to watch something else other than this complete mess we have here. Watched it the second time today many years after the first and it was just as bad. The only somewhat good thing was Killing Me Softly but of course no credit can go to the filmmakers for this song.".

That reputation was obviously built on the opinions of critics who had not actually seen the movie but had referenced the illustration reproduced on the poster. It is not a still from the movie at all but a composite made up by the publicity department.Admittedly we do see the various dreams individuallyand they are even briefly reprizedbut even so they constitute but an extremely small part of the movie which mostly centers on the welloff but distinctly middleaged hero's sudden aversion to his young and extremely attractive wife.I realize that this was obviously not the scriptwriter's intention as it appears from the flashback that the three participants are roughly the same age. The casting however particularly of the 25yearold Weyher as well as youngish Jack Trevor makes nonsense of this supposition. We are forced to accept the movie in the way it appears on the screen not in the way it was postulated in the minds of the screenwriters.I suppose you could argue that the dreams are presented in an expressionistic fashion though I would disagree but you can't get away from the fact that they display little visual imagination. And in any event they occupy very little screen time.As the middleaged lead Werner Krauss does extremely well in conveying the domestic disparity he suffers with his young wife. He has obviously been married for at least five or six years and his attitude is not so much loving as reserved suspicious illtempered and even resentful. As said this was probably not the way Neumann and Ross intended but it's the way Krauss plays the role and more importantly the way Pabst has directed it. So what have here is not so much expressionism as a moderately gripping domestic drama.".

	schema:reviewBody "Freudian psychiatry was all the rage back in the 1920s. It was the first psychotherapy and did much to popularize the notion of individual therapy to cure mental illness. And not surprisingly it was particularly popular in the Germanspeaking world. So the fact that the German film maker G.W. Pabst would make a film based on Freud's theories isn't surprising at all. Just understand that since this type of therapy was the first much of his work today might be seen as quaint or even obsolete. This isn't a slam against Freudas he had to start somewhere. But the film's HUGE reliance on symbolism insight and longterm treatment are for the most part not part of most therapies todayso don't expect this is like therapy in the 21st century. It's because of this that the film makes a wonderful viewing experience for psychology studentsto understand the history of the treatment of mental illnesses. It brings to life Freud's ideas and shows the style of treatment he popularized.The story is about a couplein particularly the husband. For unknown reasons he's recent had a fantasy of stabbing his wife! Fortunately he realizes this is sick and is seeking help from a psychotherapist. After months of probing into his conscious and unconscious the man's deepseeded neurosis is uncovered and cured. And as a result the marriage is saved and the family has a happy ending.The film has some wonderful dream sequences and lots of deliberate symbolismand I thought this was all very clever. However as an expsychology teacher and therapist I was intrigued that the film makers did explore many common themes in Analytic psychology BUT a couple very obvious interpretations were never mentioned in the filmpossibly because they were much more sexual than the interpretations given in the movie though most therapists of the day would have seen them. First there was LOTS of phallic imagery but the film never went there to discuss them. Any analytic therapist of the day would have jumped at the thrusting of the knife scene by the patient as well as his feelings of impotence. Also his desire to kill her specifically with a knife is according to Freudians a VERY sexual sort of killingagain with STRONG phallic connotations! I thought this was pretty funnyalong with phallic images of trains and towers in the filmall of which again ACCORDING TO FREUDIANS would represent the sex act and sex organs. Now I am not saying I believe all this but classical Analytic theory is based on this sort of interpretation...really.Overall great fun for me as in addition to psychology I have taught history and this film is a great way to combine the two disciplines. I am sure this is not everyone's cup of teabut it was at least to the right audience quite interestingand one of the very earliest films to explore the FreudianAnalytic style of thinking and conceptualizing illness.By the way if you enjoy movies about phallic imagery dream interpretations and the like try watching the COMPLETE Hitchcock film Spellbound. I say complete because Salvador Dali helped create a Freudian dream sequence that is great fun to watch but which in some versions is truncated. Also Dali made an experimental film for Disney that was never released that is based on Freud's work that only recently has surfaced on the internet. It's wild and worth finding as well.".

	schema:headline " The knife";
	schema:reviewBody "I come to this as someone who thinks the presentation of dreams  much more than dreams themselves  imitates the ways we use to structure the self that presents the world to us. Charting the cinematic effort of that is exciting to me.And well this is an interesting film to say the least and from an interesting time. The backstory is that Freud himself approved of it and moreover sent two from his trusted Viennese circle to aid and supervise the UFA production on what would be a rational explication of psychoanalysis. You should know that his were radical  modern ideas in their time and for twenty years had been a sensation. And the Weimar public at large was struggling with deepseated nightmares of their own evidenced in Caligari and elsewhere so it was very receptive to the new science for sleep and probably every bit as confused about it as the somnambulist in Caligari.But oh boy haven't our narrative devices come far since Freud.In the film we have suddenly strange  unsettling urges followed by a puzzling nightmare and then a psychoanalyst sits us down to kindly explain and assuage irrational fear. Nevermind the obtuse focus on sex and symbolic interpretation of dreams that was Freud. The emphasis on phallic imagery the incidental aversion to knives linked to imaginary castration in the patient. Jung would make the transition to a characterbased dreamworld and we are growing out of that too. We are insanely more complicated beings these days than a logic like Freud's can explain our dreams much more layered and you can see that in contemporary filmmakers who are dabbling with dream. We are unsure these days where day begins that much night was certain then. Our dreams also come from movies and TV from tweets and instagram and we're beginning to understand what the Buddhist had been saying all along the mind's function is to project snippets of narrative around a fictional self and the most loaded dream is no different in mechanism to the most trivial thought. You are always at the center of an illusionary world you have set in motion but you won't know that without a center in emptiness.The trigger for it is something to consider though. A murder by knife has taken place the day before in the same street a wife killed by the husband. The same urge somehow surfaces in our guy.The actual nightmare has dated along with the logic behind it and German expressionism. It is this eerie confluence of semiconscious machinery that still carries power. It is this aspect of dreaming Pabst would cultivate in later works.".

	onyx:emotionText "I come to this as someone who thinks the presentation of dreams  much more than dreams themselves  imitates the ways we use to structure the self that presents the world to us. Charting the cinematic effort of that is exciting to me.And well this is an interesting film to say the least and from an interesting time. The backstory is that Freud himself approved of it and moreover sent two from his trusted Viennese circle to aid and supervise the UFA production on what would be a rational explication of psychoanalysis. You should know that his were radical  modern ideas in their time and for twenty years had been a sensation. And the Weimar public at large was struggling with deepseated nightmares of their own evidenced in Caligari and elsewhere so it was very receptive to the new science for sleep and probably every bit as confused about it as the somnambulist in Caligari.But oh boy haven't our narrative devices come far since Freud.In the film we have suddenly strange  unsettling urges followed by a puzzling nightmare and then a psychoanalyst sits us down to kindly explain and assuage irrational fear. Nevermind the obtuse focus on sex and symbolic interpretation of dreams that was Freud. The emphasis on phallic imagery the incidental aversion to knives linked to imaginary castration in the patient. Jung would make the transition to a characterbased dreamworld and we are growing out of that too. We are insanely more complicated beings these days than a logic like Freud's can explain our dreams much more layered and you can see that in contemporary filmmakers who are dabbling with dream. We are unsure these days where day begins that much night was certain then. Our dreams also come from movies and TV from tweets and instagram and we're beginning to understand what the Buddhist had been saying all along the mind's function is to project snippets of narrative around a fictional self and the most loaded dream is no different in mechanism to the most trivial thought. You are always at the center of an illusionary world you have set in motion but you won't know that without a center in emptiness.The trigger for it is something to consider though. A murder by knife has taken place the day before in the same street a wife killed by the husband. The same urge somehow surfaces in our guy.The actual nightmare has dated along with the logic behind it and German expressionism. It is this eerie confluence of semiconscious machinery that still carries power. It is this aspect of dreaming Pabst would cultivate in later works.";

	schema:reviewBody "Although I am no fan of psychoanalysis and Freud this film is worth a watch for the cinematographic techniques and the visuals. The story is a bit bland but it does give the viewer a taste of what psychoanalysis is.My favourite scene would definitely have to be the dream scene hands down. Every section of the dream is so well done that I wonder how Pabst filmed such things. There are some crazy things going on like a gate that grows really high the husband Krauss flying and then getting shot down a montage of his wife Weyher and friendwife's cousin and the baby coming out of the river are surreal. I really can't come up with another word to describe the dream scene. My personal favourite out of all these has to be when the bells turn into heads. I can't really figure out who the head on left belongs to I think it's either a nurse or someone who works in his house but the one in the center is his wife and the one on the right is his assistant Walther. When I first saw the scene I almost yelped because it creeped me out and it really must have been a terrifying thing to see because apparently the laughter was something that the protagonist the husband couldn't get out of his head. I wish that I can supply more screencaps from this film but then it would just crowd up the entry. Oh well. Going on the dream really brings together events from past present and his unconscious because the presents he received from his wife's cousin Trevor are in the scene the creepy dollbaby reflects the protagonist's want for a child but also reflects a scene from his childhood the totally crazy wifestabbing scene triggers the protagonist's fear of knives his jealousy over his wife's cousin and his odd impulse to kill his wife.Throughout the film there are various motifs repetitions and recreation of certain scenes and symbolism. The very first motif in this film would be knives. The very first shot of the movie is of the husband's razor and whenever there is a knifesharp object in the scene it is always emphasized with an insert shot. Most of the time the ones that usually have an insert shot are shown twice the first time is when the husband isn't scared of them and the second time is when the husband is afraid to touch or see them. So what could this mean? It seems silly to be scared of knives right? This is when the psychoanalytic part comes in. His fear of knives symbolize his insecurity about his masculinity. Out of all the knives the one that the cousin gives him is the biggest and longest one and his jealousy of his wife's cousin is exposed later in the film. This could be tied into him being insecure because he still does not have a child and of course the knife can be a phallic symbol. In Picture 3 the shadow you see is of the cousin and notice where his head is? Yes between the wife's legs! And then it cuts to the husband's face where he look uncomfortable to see the shadow. In addition to the whole knife  masculinity argument his fear of knives makes him even less masculine because he becomes a little kid who can't take care of himself. His mother has to cut his food for him when he isn't there and on top of that she cuts them into little pieces! Now that I think about it a lot of the motifs refer to the husband's want for a child and not having one which connects to his masculinity. I can list quite a few but I'll just discuss one more! The prison barsgates in the dream scene prevent the husband from going to certain places particularly places where his wife and her cousin are. Gates would prevent him from going near his wife and her cousin multiple times in the main dream scene and in his other one where his wife is part of an orgylike scene. In a scene of the present there is a scene when the husband returns home and the psychoanalyst says that he looks reluctant to go back to his own house. The gate is what separates him from his wife and her cousin inside the house. Maybe he doesn't want to go because he's scared that he'll see them together like he saw in his dream. Another thought I had was that the gate was also a symbol of how he will reach his cure. By meeting the psychoanalyst and having the psychoanalyst returning the key so that he can go home the psychoanalyst is opening the gate to his cure. Just a thought. And talking about symbolism see Picture 1 because the tree represents the couple's marriage and their hopes for a child but while the tree grows they don't have a real child.".

It is a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth I must say as I developed little interest in the story or characters and I would not say this is the actors' fault.

There are differing runtimes indicated for this one from slightly over an hour to slightly over 1.5 hours so parts of the film may be lost or it is just a case of differing frames per second. Overall I cannot say which version is best to watch because I just did not care about the film or the characters at all. It's a shame as there was definitely more potential here looking at the cast the director and basic story elements. But the premise was not fulfilled. Watch something else instead.".

Sitting in the cinema this film actually makes you roll of your chair a couple of times and has some really good gags  most of them drawing on ridiculous situations and confrontations. Although handicapped persons play quite a role sometimes wondered which were actors and which actually handicapped .. they are neither being made fun of nor exploited.

Alexandra Maria Lara is more beautiful than ever and will make male viewers shrink in their seats in awe. Christoph Maria Herbst Maria btw. can be a male or female second name in German offers a wild and extremely convincing role as a wheelchairconfined basket ball fan stay on for the snippet that comes up after the first credits at the end of the film!. Including one of the best dialogues I have seen acted in a long time Herbst having hurt himself badly is pensively picking a glass splinter from his shoulder when Denise asks 'are you hurt?' and he replies matteroffactedly 'how come you ask?' not even looking at her. Till Schweiger has been bashed quite a bit in Germany  which seems 'normal' with any actor having too much success. Jealousy I'd say. It can be said that he is not too much of a character actor and mostly 'sells' his good looks. In this film he actually does offer a fair performance. Playing the grumbly guy with a bad conscience fits him well. I've never heard of neither the director nor the script author but maybe we will be seeing some new quality work in German cinema soon?".

But having seen some of the Farrelly Brothers' movies I really wonder why. Although the subject of handicapped persons and how to treat them is not sufficiently dealt with it contains a few laughs. Once more I wonder how Til Schweiger of all people could become so famous definitely the worst part of the crew once more. Must be his looks. But the others compensate for it especially the little fat kid who wants to have the basketball. What makes this film worthwhile is the cast consisting of Jrgen Vogel who usually excels in more serious roles and Christoph Maria Herbst who embodies a real handicapped person and a real basketball aficionado. Alexandra Maria Lara looks good too granted. It would be pointless to give away the plot because you'll figure it out after 5 minutes.".

	schema:headline " Fred on his way to the right one";
	schema:reviewBody "Where is Fred? is a German film from almost 10 years ago starring Til Schweiger Alexandra Maria Lara Jrgen Vogel and some more wellknown actors at least in Germany. The story is about a man who ends up accidentally being perceived as disabled by the general public when he tries to catch a ball for his future wife's son. The film's director is Anno Saul. You may have heard of his films Die Tr or Kebab Connection and he directed Martina Gedeck and Jessica Schwarz in the past already and many more. The film is written by Bora Dagtekin Trkisch fr Anfnger Fack ju Ghte. He used a script from an American writer duo that was behind the Despicable Me movies and The Lorax. The American version of Wo ist Fred? was never made though in contrast to the German.Even before the plot really develops there are already quite a few references that this film will have a lot to do with disability for example how Fred almost drives over a disabled early on or how Kurt Krmer's character criticizes a building site for not being handicapped accessible. One of the main problems for me was that I found the love interest to Vogel's character simply more interesting than the one to Schweiger's. but that's just personal preference. I liked some of the supporting performances too. The initial love interest for Fred was truly one of the funny highlights with her psycho son and Christoph Maria Herbst delivers as always of course too. His fake attack fit the film nicely. A real one may have been too serious for a comedy movie. Also it was nice to see my favorite No Angel in a very small role. Honorable mentions to Gode Benedix works a lot with Schweiger and Martin Brambach one of my favs. Shame the two only play very minor characters. Still I felt the movie could have been kept at 90 minutes instead of clearly over 100 and without some of the weaker scenes not much would have been lost. Maybe this applies to when Schweiger invents a twin brother and constantly switches between characters. This has been done better in Hannah Montana The Movie actually. The funniest moment for me though was when he comes as the wrong role to the woman with the evil son and she asks him if he completely lost it now. The ending is sadly as predictable as it's cheesy. The whole love confession scene in the basketball stadium was truly cringeworthy.All in all it is a decent comedy and I would recommend it to those with an interest in German cinema. However those who are easily offended when it comes to jokes about disabled people may want to stay away as the humor is occasionally a bit rough here.".

Beware I must warn you that this film has some strong adult content matter that most people will find repulsing. But those who are open minded will find this movie an interesting and honest portrait of a madman. Lommel and Kurt Raab who also wrote the screenplay portray Fritz Haarman as a tortured soul who can never truly express himself or convey his emotions. In his twisted mind he sees no harm in what he does. Several Fassbinder stock players have supporting and minor roles in this picture including Fassbinder he cameos as a real shady slug. Kurt Raab does an excellent character study of one of Germany's most notorious serial killers.Highly recommended if you can stomach the content.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hans Beckert in M 1931 and Fritz Haarmann in Die Zrtlichkeit Der Wlfe 1973 Both films are based on the true story of the German series killer Fritz Haarmann 18791925.Comparing the two films one feels the 40 years that lie between them. Peter Lorre the Beckert of M. is not shown killing his victims. There is no blood and the story is told as if we would gather it by change through rumors in the street and newspaper reports. On the other side the magnificent actor Kurt Raab as Haarmann We see how he picks his victims up  exclusively goodlooking young boys. In M we are only told about missing little girls  perhaps the combination of series killer and homosexual would have been too much for the audience then. Tenderness of the Wolves is also in general much closer to the original Haarmann story  f.ex. when we see how Fritz sells sausages that he had made from the meat of his victims Haarmann owned a short time a butcher store. We see how Fritz lives drinks and sleeps with his victims and kills them. We also see him getting rid of their corpses in huge plastic bags which he sinks in the river. Nothing at all about the everyday's life of Hans Beckert All we see him do is walking up and then down the streets sometimes visiting an inn for a schnapps. From his apartment that the police enters twice we see his one table nothing more. In the case of Fritz we even meet his nosy and gossipy neighbors. So when Beckert finally get caught by the horde of the mob Lorre had to compensate all that what the director did not show us so that we could not make ourselves a picture about Beckert the human being. Therefore Lorre is not allowed to just break together and admit his murders but he is forced to cry also the motivations of his deeds into the jury. For me what he is doing is not convincing. It may have been more shocking in 1931 as it is now but I doubt that too.  On the other side Kurt Raab alias Fritz was allowed to broadcast all his lust that he had with his boys from the seduction via the intercourse up to his climax the lethal bite in the neck. At the end Fritz will say I give my life back in God's hands ... but I had them all the handsomest of the handsomest. We feel his lust and believe him  because he had a chance to show it during the movie we are his witnesses. But unfortunately nothing like that in M. so that Lorre's Beckert stays an isolated and widely artificially constructed figure not a human but a silhouette. On the other side Raab's Haarmann played by the selfconfessed pedophile homosexual Raab There are moments in the movie where one trembles if the actor has himself really under control  so good is his acting.".

Tenderness of the Wolves is also in general much closer to the original Haarmann story  f.ex. when we see how Fritz sells sausages that he had made from the meat of his victims Haarmann owned a short time a butcher store. We see how Fritz lives drinks and sleeps with his victims and kills them. We also see him getting rid of their corpses in huge plastic bags which he sinks in the river. Nothing at all about the everyday's life of Hans Beckert All we see him do is walking up and then down the streets sometimes visiting an inn for a schnapps. From his apartment that the police enters twice we see his one table nothing more. In the case of Fritz we even meet his nosy and gossipy neighbors. So when Beckert finally get caught by the horde of the mob Lorre had to compensate all that what the director did not show us so that we could not make ourselves a picture about Beckert the human being. Therefore Lorre is not allowed to just break together and admit his murders but he is forced to cry also the motivations of his deeds into the jury. For me what he is doing is not convincing. It may have been more shocking in 1931 as it is now but I doubt that too.  On the other side Kurt Raab alias Fritz was allowed to broadcast all his lust that he had with his boys from the seduction via the intercourse up to his climax the lethal bite in the neck. At the end Fritz will say I give my life back in God's hands ... but I had them all the handsomest of the handsomest. We feel his lust and believe him  because he had a chance to show it during the movie we are his witnesses. But unfortunately nothing like that in M. so that Lorre's Beckert stays an isolated and widely artificially constructed figure not a human but a silhouette. On the other side Raab's Haarmann played by the selfconfessed pedophile homosexual Raab There are moments in the movie where one trembles if the actor has himself really under control  so good is his acting.";

	schema:reviewBody "Back in the early 70's when his name wasn't yet a synonym for insufferably crappy handheld camera horror stuff Ulli Lommel actually was quite the promising and visionary young barely 29 years old director in his home country Germany. The powerful impact of The Tenderness of Wolves alone is already more than enough evidence to back up this statement. This is a thoroughly unsettling and disturbing dramahorror hybrid based on the true facts in the case of one of the most notorious European criminal figures of the previous century. Fritz Haarmann was a German pedophile and serial killer of young adolescent males during the Interbellum period and made nearly 30 victims in only five years of time. Haarmann makes his money by trades food and goods on the black market that he himself falsely confiscated by pretending to be a policeman. This is also how he picks up young lads in the train station and lures them to his apartment loft. Uncle Fritz probes for homeless boys and eventually murders them by biting their throats which gave him the nickname The Vampire of Hanover. The atrocities became even more inhuman when Fritz together with his loverpartnerincrime Hans Grans sold the hacked up flesh of the victims on the black market. The Tenderness of Wolves is definitely not an overly graphical or tasteless film but the subject matter is sickening and the whole portrayal of pedophilia is beyond disturbing. Haarmann pretty openly declares his affection for young boys and his entire surrounding either deliberately ignores this or even considers it to be the most common thing in the world. Only his neighbor from the apartment below suspects his psychopathic tendencies and attempts to alert the authorities but that fails as Haarmann actually had connections with the police where he worked as a rat.The sequences in which Haarmann is intimate with his victims are extremely discomforting but at the same time they make the film all the more powerful and hauntingly realistic. It seems unthinkable in this modern day and age but it was so easy for twisted perverts to pick up unsuspecting and youthful victims. Especially in times of poverty and despair like the case in Germany between the two World Wars. Every time Haarmann comes near a boy you can already assume the poor kid's fate is sealed like the runaway drifter at the railway station or the boy at the carnival. Whenever he approaches a kid your skin is guaranteed to crawl because his voice is so stern and despicable. The Tenderness of Wolves also benefices from a more than decent recreation of the depressing era and  of course  the incredibly brilliant and courageous performance of lead actorwriter Kurt Raab. He truly depicts Fritz Haarmann exactly like an emotionless and depraved monster ought to be depicted. This certainly isn't a film that is suitable for all tastes and even the most hardened cult fanatics need to feel in a certain state of mind to watch it but it's undeniably a unique experience and easily one of the top five most unpleasant yet fascinating things I ever watched. Moreover after witnessing the unforgettable tourdeforce accomplishment that is The Tenderness of Wolves it's all the more difficult to accept that Ulli Lommel is nowadays directing junk entitled Zombie Nation Diary of a Cannibal or BTK Killer.".

Haartmann was a gay child molester who enjoyed throttling his victims biting into their throats often through the Adam's apple before chopping them into pieces and throwing them into the Leine River. We don't see much of the murders but when they do occur they are filmed without sensationalism made all the more unsettling due to the fullfrontal male nudity of some of the film's underage actors something extremely rare in horror even today.Haartmann shavenheaded and ghostly pale manipulates his victims by posing as a police officer before drugging and overpowering them often making little effort to cover his tracks or dispose of the bodies discretely. This arrogance although it would eventually lead to his arrest makes him even more of a monster and Raab delivers a truly terrific performance. Without attempting to explain his actions or even offer a background of how Haarmann got into the criminal business and how he developed a taste for human blood Tenderness of the Wolves becomes more about the world he inhabits and the creepy characters who surround him. It's hardly a film to discuss over breakfast but it will no doubt stay with you for long after the credits have rolled.".

The movie explores 2 key questions  Why did Fritz Haarman brutally murder young men and perhaps more importantly why was he allowed to get away with it for so long?Kurt Raab is terrific is Haarman but deserves praise as well for his set decoration. The movie is filled with rich colors and textures and often breathtaking locations. Director Ulli Lommel creates a creepy atmosphere that's hard to look away from.";

There is a line in the film that makes a reference to the Nazi's their rise to power wasn't until nine years after Haarmann's execution and how difficult life is for everyone in postwar Germany. The character of Fritz Haarmann was used as a metaphor for the German people cannabalizing each other just to survive. The costumes language and vehicles also seemed to be of a later decade. Much like Werner Herzog's The Enegma of Kaspar Hauser Tenderness of the Wolves uses a real historical figure taken with some liberties as a criticism of society as a whole. Having said that the film is not particularly outstanding in any way. The concept is interesting and contains the leading actors of Fassbinder's Ali Fear Eats the Soul as well as Fissbinder himself. Still I would have to say the film is only slightly above average both as a Fassbinder film and the German New Wave.".

If they're lucky it's just a sexual thing but for dozens of young people they were lured back to Haarmann's apartment where they were murdered and eaten.Ulli Lommel's TENDERNESS OF THE WOLVES certainly isn't a film that's going to appeal to many for a number of reasons. For starters if you're expecting a horror film then you're barking up the wrong tree. I guess you could call this a crime picture with horror elements but if you're wanting the gory kind of story then you'll be disappointed because this is one of the most laid back thrillers that you'll ever see. Of course the subject matter itself is another thing that is going to keep most people away.Lommel certainly deserves a lot of credit for not delivering your average crime picture but instead he goes for more of a bizarre atmosphere. What's so strange about this picture is that you're watching a monster who murders and eats children yet you don't ever really hate him. What I liked about the movie is that it's really not that judgmental on its subject as it doesn't try to make him a villain a misunderstood psycho or anything else. Lommel basically just tells us the story and he really keeps all emotion out of the picture.Technically speaking this is an extremely wellmade movie. The camerawork is wonderful and there's no doubt that the director builds up a rather eerie atmosphere with ease. The subject matter is a very dark one yet Lommel never sends the material overthetop or into a graphic area. It should go without saying but the biggest reason the film works so well is due to the performance by Raab. He's rather remarkable at how good he is in the role and not for a second do you ever feel as if you're watching an actor. You really do feel as if you're watching a troubled mind work his way into the trust of these victims.TENDERNESS OF THE WOLVES has a lot of similarities with Fritz Lang's M another German movie about a serial killer. While this film doesn't reach the same levels of that one this Lommel picture certainly deserves to be better known than it is.".

This are 3 things that might already scare off some people from ever watching it. I had no idea what the overall tone or the story would be all about. In all honesty I was more expecting an homoerotic type of movie also because of its title perhaps. But it's simply a very accessible movie to just basically everyone. It isn't trying to be very controversial or groundbreaking with its subject which might also be one of the reasons though why this movie isn't that well known. Sure there is some male nudity in the movie but it's all fairly tame and toned down. It certainly isn't being presented as anything erotic or exciting so you shouldn't feel too uncomfortable with it.It's more a movie that tries to shock with its premise which does work out well.

	schema:reviewBody "Die Zrtlichkeit der Wlfe or Tenderness of the Wolves is a West German Germanlanguage film from the year 1973 so this one has its 45th anniversary soon. Of course it is in color and has sound. The director here is Ulli Lommel and he is seen by many only as the make of a whole lot of trash movies. So this one here is possibly his most acclaimed work by critics. This may have a lot to do with the fact that he has not written the script for this one maybe because it was very early in his career still. Lommel was still under 30 back then. The writer is Kurt Raab who also plays the main character. One of the producers is Rainer Werner Fassbinder which should not be too surprising as he worked with Raab on many occasions.This is the story of Fritz Haarmann a German mass murderer from the early 20th century. There are more films about him. Fritz Lang's M is also partially based on Haarmann and the recently deceased Gtz George plays Haarmann in the critically acclaimed Der Totmacher a more recent version. But back to this one here. It is a fairly short film closer to 80 than to 90 minutes. And the tender wolf here is Kurt Raab's character a sensitive man who ends up abusing and murdering several boys in order to satisfy his desires. He is working undercover for the police which makes it especially interesting as they really take a whole lot until they finally find out. This is also a reference to the real Haarmann. All in all it is Kurt Raab's stunning performance that carries the film nicely from start to finish without dragging. I thought for the entire film Raab looked like a vampire in here so the final scene was very appropriate. What a shame Raab did not end up playing Nosferatu or so in another movie. At least I think he did not. As for this one here it is a pretty decent watch. The lead performance and the parallel to real events certainly elevate the material. Go check it out.".

	onyx:emotionText "Die Zrtlichkeit der Wlfe or Tenderness of the Wolves is a West German Germanlanguage film from the year 1973 so this one has its 45th anniversary soon. Of course it is in color and has sound. The director here is Ulli Lommel and he is seen by many only as the make of a whole lot of trash movies. So this one here is possibly his most acclaimed work by critics. This may have a lot to do with the fact that he has not written the script for this one maybe because it was very early in his career still. Lommel was still under 30 back then. The writer is Kurt Raab who also plays the main character. One of the producers is Rainer Werner Fassbinder which should not be too surprising as he worked with Raab on many occasions.This is the story of Fritz Haarmann a German mass murderer from the early 20th century. There are more films about him. Fritz Lang's M is also partially based on Haarmann and the recently deceased Gtz George plays Haarmann in the critically acclaimed Der Totmacher a more recent version. But back to this one here. It is a fairly short film closer to 80 than to 90 minutes.

	schema:reviewBody "One thing I try to strive for is to watch as many movies from as wide a variety of sources and styles as possible. In doing so I might not like all of them but at least I've left myself open to seeing things outside of my comfort zone and exposed myself to things I might miss that are great and some that are the worst things imaginable.With that in mind I just watched TENDERNESS OF THE WOLVES a 1973 movie directed by UIli Lommell. Lommell was a protg of Rainer Werner Fassbinder and a part of the New German Cinema movement that ran during the early 70s. His career has gone up and down and he's delivered fairly mainstream films like THE BOOGEYMAN as well as several films that could be called art films before finally making his way to made for DVD movies that haven't fared that well. But there is always the possibility of his rising once more.TENDERNESS focuses on the true story of Fritz Haarmann a German serial killer who did most of his nefarious deeds right after WWI. As played by Kurt Raab Haarmann comes off as one of the most chilling murderers seen on screen. An out of the closet homosexual who preyed on young boys that he then murdered Haarmann then went on to cut up his victims and sell their bodies as meat to friends who were in need of fresh meat. While that alone might make for a terrifying killer there is more behind the man to make him even more horrific.Raab plays Haarmann as a slightly shy yet smooth talking con man who convinces friends to ignore his odd behavior from time to time. Not only does he get them to ignore it he talks his way out of an arrest by offering his services to the local police in helping them ferret out other criminals. With a fake badge in pocket he uses his influence to not only pass along information about his criminal competition he also uses it to persuade young runaway boys to his apartment where he beds and then kills them. Raab has chosen a bald headed look that at times reminds us of Max Schreck as Nosferatu a good comparison as Haarmann was also known as the vampire of Hanover due to his biting some of his victims on the neck.The movie takes on an odd feel for a number of reasons besides the pedophile serial killer at the center of it all. The people Haarmann associates with may belong to the lower criminal class but they are also seen as struggling to survive after their country has been beaten in war. There is a certain amount of sympathy to be felt for them and Lommell depicts that in subtle ways. The movie also has a bombed out feel in it's of settings and style of being filmed. The filmed world of Haarmann is a gray one lacking of color and life much as that Germany would have been at the time. The few glimpses of color involve either his associations in a local bar or during the murder sequences.The life and times of Haarmann are seen here in the latter part of his life rather than attempting to cover his entire career. In the end the number of murders he committed with his lover Hans Grans has been listed as anywhere between 24 and 50 people. That many are not seen here. He isn't depicted as a raging lunatic but as I stated earlier as a subtle and manipulative sort that isn't seen killing in the most brutal fashion of some movie killers but still in perhaps some of the most twisted ways.For a film coming out of the seventies it offers more full frontal nudity than most as well as touching on homosexuality that was still fairly taboo at the time. It doesn't condone or condemn the topic but instead uses it to develop its central character. If you find this offensive then the movie will do just that. I mention it so that those who might be are aware.In the end the movie is one I may have to watch a second time to fully understand or appreciate. While the story itself is interesting enough so that another more famous movie M was based on this same tale I found the pacing of the film to be slow and in trying to keep up with the translation of dialogue with what I was watching made me unable to fully appreciate what was on the screen at times. As a single viewing experience it was just so so for me. Perhaps my opinion will change the second time around. What I did find was an experience of watching a film from another country that didn't fit the Hollywood mold. That doesn't make it a good experience just a different one.For the average viewer I'm not sure I would suggest watching this. For foreign film fans you will love it. For fans of Lommell and Fassbinder I have little doubt you will add it to your collection. For me on the whole it was interesting but nothing stupendous.".

	schema:headline " Overly seriousand laughably ridiculousBrazilian sex movie";
	schema:reviewBody "This Brazilian movie somewhat resembles the soapy exploitative Brazilian pornochachada films of its era but is a much more serious and arty and pretentious period film. The fairly serious plot is certainly not helped by the atrocious English dubbing of the existing VHS version but the bigger problem is that the whole movie is even more laughably implausible than even the wildest most outthere pornochadas I've seen.The film is told in flashback as a fiftysomething man remembers a brief period during WWII where he came to visit an upscale brothel managed by his mother. As political intrigue swirls both inside and outside the brothel the twelveyearold protagonist is seduced by no less than three of the prostitutes. The serious historical intrigue notwithstanding it's very hard to buy even in Brazilthat adult women working daily in the sex trade could not resist bedding a boy whose testicles probably haven't dropped yet. Obviously the sex scenes between the nude adult women and the partially nude adolescent boy were and still would be considered controversial but I think this movie is much less guilty of exploiting the adolescent male body than it is of exploiting the adolescent male fantasies that most adult males still vividly recall. Besides if you're really looking at the twelveyearold actor in the presence of all these voluptuous Brazilian women I think it says a lot more about you than it does the movie.As other reviews have mentioned one of the prostitutes here is played Xuxa Menghel who went on to become a pretty big celebrity singer and kiddie TV host! in Brazil. She may indeed be the reason this rattling skeleton in her closet does not seemingly exist in any version with its native language. Still she is undeniably sexy whether stripping out of a ridiculous bear costume or rubbing her naked self against the barely pubescent protagonist. She and some of the other women including pornochchada regular Vanessa Alvesare really the only thing this overly serious and at the same time laughably ridiculous movie really has going for it.".

Predictably this is not successful. The many prostitutes take every opportunity to try and seduce the boy. The most successful is Xuxa Meneghel. Yes Xuxa the clothing optional blonde bombshell children's television hostess! This film is generally classified among the erotic Nazi exploitation films simply because it takes place in the 1930s. This was most likely the intention of the studio simply to fit into a category and attract an audience. However this film has as much to do with the Third Reich as 'Pearl Harbor' actually had to do with Pearl Harbor.SPOILER WARNING!!! Although Xuxa gets the closest to deflowering the 12 year old they are constantly interrupted by his mother whom wants him all to herself! And GETS HIM! Imagine the frustration! You're just about to get deflowered by Xuxa but your mom keeps walking in!".

Battleship had none of that  just a bunch of thickheaded do gooders doing what they do best and not really learning a whole lot about anything including themselves in the process. Another thing I like is that there is an appreciation for the warships and the people who serve on them. The timing of the ACDC music for the goingintobattle scene is perfectly done. You can't help but smile.The alien technology is actually pretty imaginative and the animation is good. It's not as over thetop as Battle LA  where there was so much going on you get overwhelmed. But when the aliens want something blowed up they do so with conviction. Mind you some of the technical deficiencies of the alien technology will leave you wondering how these creatures managed to cross a galaxy. But try not to worry about that  the writers sure didn't.The cast is OK. Neeson is decent as the admiral or whatever and even Rihanna does an acceptable job. We're not talking about Apocalypse Now kinds of performances but it wasn't horrible either. It was at least semibelievable.Look this ain't no Bedford Incident. But it's a pretty decent way to kill a couple hours and snarf down some popcorn. All the folks griping about the technical problems  well it's all true  but who cares? This movie doesn't pretend to be realistic. Hell in the credits it's Based on the game by Hasbro so go in prepared and enjoy.".

I came in with low expectations  I was expecting something horrible boring long and pointless but despite myself I liked it I laughed at the jokes I connected with the actors yes Rihanna too I was excited by the action and while clichs the plot held my interest 2. The actors did a good job with what they were given  Taylor Kitsch did a good job Rihanna wasn't that bad I dare say good in her role. She was there she didn't try to chew the scenery she did her job as an actorsecondary character and it didn't bother me. I give her kudos3. lost in translation?  you try to make a game into a movie and you want to put parts of them game in it? Not easy a little cheesy? Of course but fun? Yes fun enjoyable and in the end it was a part of the story that wasn't as forced as it could have been. So in conclusion Battleship is a fun corny typical summer movie that I like but as you see a lot of people didn't. I think it is a guilty pleasure something to be enjoyed by the few but annoyed by the rest. In the end I can only suggest this  go in with low expectations expect a little over the top patriotism like in Act of Valor  but not so heavy and don't think about it. The movie is not without its flaws or questionable logic but as it was said so well in another movie  I suggest you don't think about it and just enjoy the ride".

It is a noisy clichd and unbearable piece of trash that exploits the work of CG artists and paying customers who just want to be entertained.A simple way to describe Battleship is that it's basically a 200 million naval recruitment video that was made by a schizophrenic 8 year old who likes video games and things going KaBoom.The main heroes in this movie are indeed American navy sailors but the one thing the filmmakers really failed at is making these people likable and realistic. Taylor Kitsch plays the lead character he's basically some drop out loser who robs convenience stores to get girlfriends and joins the navy at his brothers behest and in what seems like no time at all he becomes a lieutenant with big responsibilities on a naval vessel with some few hundred men beneath him. The special effects are the only thing to keep you invested however they're all completely CG so it just likes a cutscene from a video game . Something that should be impressive like a ship sinking is made pointless because it's something clearly rendered on a computer.The soundtrack to the movie is okay composition wise but it's often loud and draws attention to itself and it sounds exactly like the Inception soundtrack on numerous occasions.This movie has the shadow of Transformers looming over it both in its marketing and tone. Battleship however is far far far worse than any of those three films and it could probably be used as a symbol for the decline of western civilisation.".

I am a total advocate of having fun at movies and suspending belief but in this movie even attempting to do that is interrupted by shocking characters with shocking lines. If people reacted in real life like many of these do in the movie you could be forgiven for shooting them on sight.The main character played by Taylor Kitsch is so annoying so arrogant so stupid so utterly imbecilic that for him to be allowed in uniform would be a slur on a nations entire armed forces. He seems to have adopted a role trying to emulate bad boy comes good Chris Pine as Kirk in the 2009 excellent movie Star Trek. But it doesn't work and he displays himself as a complete and utter loser in every respect and frankly the screen writers should not work again. Every clich possible is thrown in trying to make what is termed 'an extinction event' funny. As aliens battle to use an earth array radar to communicate with their planet and bring on the destruction of the planet the geek in charge of the array who knows everything about it says 'what! are they trying to phone home like ET'??? Shoot that man!I am saddened that Liam Neeson's bank balance is so low that he needed to take on his role in this movie. If he was that short of cash had he just put an ad on IMDb I am sure we would have all chipped in 5 each to keep him out of this disaster. The boys and girls in the CG room did an awesome job but it was so unoriginal with all the trappings of Transformers that whilst technically superb it was just all pointless. Just where have they spent 200 000 000 ? It must all be in CG or was it the fee for Rihanna? Whatever the budget for this movie would have been better spent on saving some third world country from economic disaster.At the end it becomes clear that whoever the military adviser was whatever their sins during the main part of the movie should definitely have been sacked and not paid. Our main character the man who has led a team of misfits to save the entire planet is awarded ...the 'Silver Star' the third highest award the military can give. Where was the medal of honour? the top banana they must have been limited as only one was given to our main mans dead brother who did nothing other than stand on the bridge of a ship and get blown up apart from also putting up with his cretin brother for which he definitely deserved the award.In summary totally disappointing. To base a movie on the Hasbro game of Battleships was always going to be a challenge are we now going to face movies based on snakes and ladders and 'frustration'? Too many agendas were hidden in this movie to ensure a politically correct Hollywood ra ra ra conclusion. There were many points in the movie where I totally wanted the Aliens to succeed and destroy the planet as it's occupants were proving that there was no intelligent life here. If you are dragged along to this movie then maybe just put your iphone on silent and play angry birds or some other garbage game to keep yourself entertained or better still play Battleships.".

This is not how action movies should be made and it is not fair to make bad movies just to cash some money because hey it's an action movie! I don't believe in low class genres is not a sin to enjoy an action movie but it should be a good movie anyway! Battleship has an horrible plot actually nothing happens but it does it in more than 2 hours. God if it was boring! I don't understand how you could ever make a movie with explosions and fastpaced editing sooo boring. There are elements that make to sudden apparitions and too much plot holes. There are some TERRIBLE comic scenes like the one where the guy is stealing a burrito for his bigtittied trophy. In that moment it becomes American pie the family guy epic movie. There's a LOT of FAKE lens flare. I don't understand why is it a fad now? In super8 they had a meaning but in battleship there are even more and they really make no sense. Every single clich you can find it in here. well we live in a postmodern period so that's okay we are used to see old clichs. The problem is that they use them like it is 1980 and it's the first time. If you care about that the aliens are really a bunch of pussies. They invade earth and the humans have to struggle a little to fight them. Yeah just because they use only THREE American ships actual war ships not space ships and a couple of airplanes. It's the lamest alien invasion ever! Don't watch this movie because is really really bad. What could I expect from a movie inspired by the eponymous game? The premise seems a parody from youtube actually.".

	schema:reviewBody "On a certain level there's no way I can claim that Battleship is a good movie in any conventional sense. The plot is incredulous and the script couldn't be riddled with more holes if you unloaded a shotgun at it. Even the idea that the movie is based on Hasbro's classic board game of the same name is rather disingenuous yes there is a battleship involved in the action almost all of which takes place at sea but other than that any resemblance to the game we all grew up playing seems purely coincidental.

Alexander Skarsgard plays Alex's older brother and mentor a Navy Captain to whom Alex feels he has been a shallow disappointment. The gorgeous Brooklyn Decker does an adequate job as Alex's girlfriend Samantha whose father just happens to be the Admiral of the fleet and played by the great Liam Neeson in a typically authoritative performance. The only real weak spot in the cast is singer Rihanna making her big screen debut and looking like it. One can only hope that if Rihanna pursues further acting roles she'll improvea lot.The plot isn't deep but it does have some positive aspects incorporating elements of personal redemption selfempowerment and selfsacrifice all concepts that more movies would be welladvised to advance. And while the movie is in a sense very violentonce the aliens arrive things start to blow up at a rapid clipthere's nothing especially graphic or bloody. The dialog isn't Oscarworthy but is sometimes quite witty.In the end Battleship is a prototypical summer actioner. It's nowhere nearly as good as The Avengers but as a very different type of film is still worth seeing if bigbudget mayhem is your thing. If you're okay with a movie that doesn't stimulate your brain and requires only that you go along for the fastpaced ride and enjoy the show Battleship is surprisingly entertaining.".

The plot is incredulous and the script couldn't be riddled with more holes if you unloaded a shotgun at it. Even the idea that the movie is based on Hasbro's classic board game of the same name is rather disingenuous yes there is a battleship involved in the action almost all of which takes place at sea but other than that any resemblance to the game we all grew up playing seems purely coincidental.

Why don't the aliens to more Bad things? We are supposed to hate them they are here to take over our world Right?Nope. And this is where this movie actually Shines and the reason it gets so many bad reviews is that people miss out on 2 very important facts.Aliens are the Good Guys Humans are the Bad Guys. The movie just makes quite a good job with camouflaging this in regular Blockbuster Cheesiness. The movie is a direct documentation about how hellish and pointless war is.1.Humans in the movie are very aggressive and dumb. Our Main hero is a guy who should never have been put in command of anything! And here he gets to greet our first ever contact with aliens using Guns Cruise Missiles and Torpedoes!2. Aliens never want to hurt anyone. The Aliens Are Passive Never firing unless first fired upon. The point is made extra clear with the scene where a DeathBall stops in front of a child replanning its route in order to destroy the highway without harming the child. How Much Clearer Can It Get?3. Aliens have no Military Grade Weapons. This is another point where people seem to watch this movie expecting the regular Blockbuster and then hate this movie because it isn't! The Aliens didn't expect a war so they didn't Bring Weapons!The SatchelBombs they fire of their ships are actually terrible as weapons the only reason they work at all is because we humans have such slow ships. This is probably because these bombs aren't designed for any sort of ship to ship battle but rather for clearing up debris. And what we see on a personal level is an engineering tool the aliens seems to use a lot more for setting up their generators than to actually fight with.This is NOT your classic race of Evil Aliens equipped with IndependenceDay Lasers or Corrosive Aliens Blood! This is a peaceful advanced race which came here not expecting to fight but to talk.Once you realize this the movie starts making sense. what our hero does is in fact to constantly seek out conflict. Doing everything he can in order to destroy these Aliens all because of some miscommunication and stupid decisions. If this movie teaches anything It would definitely be that when the time comes for humans to face another alien race. Make sure the ones we send to greet them aren't Military.So Basically what the movie is Really about is about a peaceful race of aliens who receive a message from an apparently peaceful race. We then greet them by firing upon them trying to kill them even if they aren't even firing at us. So when they realize their mistakes we do our best trying to prevent them from sending a Its a trap humans are evil message.Regular blockbuster movies often manage to build up a mountain of evil actions on the aliens account making the Heroes fight justified and true.Battleship doesn't do that It puts the regular Blockbuster Patriotism into a setting where it becomes totally destructive not only preventing the Aliens and Humans to communicate but also started a war that have already seen thousands of casualties and may see millions more before its over.I rate the movie 7 out of 10. Its a really fresh take on the whole Evil Alien Invasion theme.".

	schema:reviewBody "There may be some inadvertent spoilers in this review so beware! I went to see this movie with my girlfriend expecting an action movie with based on the previews really good special effects. After the first 5mins of the movie it became apparent that Battleship was going to mix in some comedy as well. Both my girlfriend and I were both laughing a lot at the beginning of the movie and it loosened our original perception of the movie. Now we were just there to have a good time.For the most part I was impressed. A good amount of the negative reviews I have read seem to not even be about this movie. I read one that literally stated Why did we have to slaughter these aliens that were just trying to get home? They were obviously not watching the same movie. These aliens were trying to use our satellites to bring more ships to earth to take over the planet! They were piggybacking on our technology because their communications ship crashed at the beginning. They weren't some well to do aliens who accidentally crashed and were trying to get home! This was an invasion! Another review said there were too many side stories... There were literally two. The main story arc deals with the main character fighting the aliens and then his girlfriend is helping an army vet who lost his legs and they get into some trouble. That's pretty much it.The one big problem I had was the super cheesy part towards the end when all of the old veterans working on the Mighty Mo are posing all over the ship and Hopper gives them the mini speech about asking them to do more for their country. Plus the idea of running a WWII era battleship with about 10 Navy Sailors and 10 60 year old vets is a little... unbelievable. I'm not 100 on this but the standard crew for a Missouri type battleship is over 2000. That was just way too corny for my taste but it didn't take away too much from the over all movie.All in all it was a lot of fun. The movie had great special effects the interplay between the actors was amusing and at times just plain funny. The story was okay there are a few things that were kind of left hanging but this isn't supposed to be some artsy independent film. I disagree with the reviewer who says that It's an action movie isn't a good excuse. I say it is. If you want moving dialog Oscar worthy acting and a swath of top name actors... This probably isn't the movie for you. If you just want to have a good time have some laughs see some great special effects and walk away from a movie with a smile on your face go see this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Turning a board game into a bigbudget summer blockbuster was always going to be a stretch. But Hasbro the company behind the cinematic juggernaut Transformers series thought they had locked on to a winning formula for their adaptation of their bestselling boardgame Battleship...namely ditch Michael Bay for the supremely talented Peter Berg add aliens and throw shedloads of money at the screen. And it almost works...The plot such as it is sees Taylor Kitsch play the lovable aimless reluctant hero. Drafted into the Navy after a drunken stunt to impress a girl goes awry he soon rises up through the ranks as his natural ability overshadows his confrontational nature. Meanwhile scientists have discovered a new planet lightyears away that might just contain intelligent life. Sending a message to this planet they are seemingly unaware of the potential consequences that ET might answer and drop by. Back in Hawaii the Navy is gearing up for a massive military exercise when our new friends decide to pay a visit. What happens next is man v alien in a spectacular battle of technology and wits for the control of the planet...So lets start with Kitsch. The poor boy never can quite get a script close to that of his breakout TV role in Friday Night Lights. He's a likable guy who does his best with the material and can handle the action sequences with aplomb. He is however overawed by Alexander Skarsgard who manages in a significantly smaller role to show why he's better equipped for leading man duties than his John Carter starring cohort. Liam Neeson gives another in his trademark gruff father figure performances. You never get the feeling that he's exerting himself but that's okay. Rihanna casts aside her singercumactress background and manages to give as good as she gets playing with the boys. Brooklyn Decker never equates to more than eyecandy and the rest of the actors are all given screentime but no background.As a feat of technical filmmaking Battleship is a tourdeforce. It's visually stunning with obvious state of the art effects and seamless CGI for the most part. The alien technology is beautifully rendered although the aliens themselves leave a lot to be desired. Likewise the movie slows to a crawl during the misconstrued slowmo weapon loading sequences which serve to remove the audience from the action rather than immerse them in the spectacle. Aurally the film is amazing way to loud but the sound design itself is full of merit. The soundtrack works well in places less so in others. The liberally used rock classics that magnify the action are well timed as is the wonderful interjection of the Pink Panther theme. Sadly it all comes apart when we get to the script. The story is woeful with under developed characters serving only to spout unnecessary exposition and act as the most needless array of clichs seen in many a year. Even by the standards of scifi films based on board games this is ludicrous. Berg has a good eye for action but even he can't help but channel his inner Michael Bay when it comes to blowing stuff up. Given a couple more months to develop the script a good edit job and 40 less decibels and we'd have a real contender on our hands here.As it stands Battleship is a completely mental completely bombastic completely stupid summer blockbuster. A missed opportunity perhaps but maybe just what the doctor ordered if you like your movies loud crass and Americatastic.".

The liberally used rock classics that magnify the action are well timed as is the wonderful interjection of the Pink Panther theme. Sadly it all comes apart when we get to the script. The story is woeful with under developed characters serving only to spout unnecessary exposition and act as the most needless array of clichs seen in many a year. Even by the standards of scifi films based on board games this is ludicrous. Berg has a good eye for action but even he can't help but channel his inner Michael Bay when it comes to blowing stuff up. Given a couple more months to develop the script a good edit job and 40 less decibels and we'd have a real contender on our hands here.As it stands Battleship is a completely mental completely bombastic completely stupid summer blockbuster. A missed opportunity perhaps but maybe just what the doctor ordered if you like your movies loud crass and Americatastic.";

Also think of all the alien movies we have had so far and what else can be done? You go to the movies to be entertained but I guess some people just can't let themselves go for 2 hours and enjoy whats on the screen because it wasn't written like they would of written it. I liked the aliens HALO type armor they wore and the wrecking balldrilling metal munching destroying things were the sickness. That was one hell of a way to chew up a ship and spit it out thought that was great. My kids loved it and my father got choked up over the veterans part. His father is from that era and fought in Guam I was just happy to get away from the busynasty daily grind we all sometimes endure and let myself go. I wouldn't see it again at the full price but will for sure go to the dollar movies and buy it when it comes out on DVD.".

All the other ships were destroyed and Earths only defense was an old steam battleship that was used. THE BEST part is that it was a museum and the veterans from prior wars all in their 80's and 90's helped the few soldiers that were left from the abandoned ships. I found my self giddy that the veterans were helping and it was right at the climax that was needed especially with a serious movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Sitting in the theatre last night a line from an old Tool song was  rattling around in my brain. One great big festering neon  distraction was used by the band to describe the state of California  but the description couldn't be more apt for Peter Berg's BATTLESHIP. A  deafening blue and orange military recruitment tool the film can't  even sustain its laughably simple premise and attempts to promote a  message so unappealing to its target audience I was left questioning  why it even exists.  Story is the least important element here so lets just say that in  between all the sweeping helicopter shots and blinding lens flare an  international Naval war games exercise is interrupted by alien  invaders and it's up to reckless officer Alex Hopper Taylor Kitsch  to save the day. Kitsch delivers solid character work early on but  soon gets lost in the cacophony of bangs and seizureinducing editing  which leaves little room for the human story. Inexplicably added to the  mix are pop star Rihanna seemingly here for no other reason than  well she's Rihanna and Liam Neeson collecting his paycheck for around  10 minutes of screen time. But as I said we're not here for the  story rather the spectacular action and special effects right? The bad  news is that when the aliens finally show up BATTLESHIP's pace  strangely slows to a crawl no doubt due to the limited options offered  by the source material and all potential excitement and interest  evaporates. Director Berg forces the idea of teamwork down the  audience's throats Japan and the US fighting together in Hawaii?  Wonders never cease and doesn't even try to disguise his recruitment  agenda. Indeed the film is little more than a hyperkinetic music video  oh that's why Rihanna is here designed to lure impressionable youth  into signing up so they too can fight the 'alien invaders'.  Herein lies the problem however young people today almost definitely  don't play Battleship. Basing a tentpole film on a board game seemed  like a daft idea from the outset but recent cinema history has seen a  theme park ride turned into a critically and financially successful  franchise so precedent is there in a way. Unfortunately for Universal  even those of us who grew up in a preinternetXbox Live world remember  Battleship as a desperately boring endeavour so how can it be expected  to compete in today's short attentionspan culture? The strange  metaphor that Berg attempts to craft in the film's third act  suggesting that we need to remember and reappraise the past just  won't fly with 21st century teens bred in our disposable constantly  updating world of technological wonder. BATTLESHIP's strange  juxtaposition of bombastic special effects framing ancient board game  mechanics simply doesn't sit right and it's hard to imagine the teen  audience so crucial for success at the summer boxoffice tearing  themselves away from the latest CALL OF DUTY to embrace the turnbased  'excitement' of this ridiculous film. No amount of explosions can  salvage a limp and underwritten movie and BATTLESHIP not entirely  unexpectedly is torpedoed by its own outdated inspiration.".

	schema:reviewBody "No one was expecting Hollywood would so be s out of ideas and turn a board game into a movie but in the end we have BATTLESHIP a movie based on the classic board game involving taking down your enemy's entire fleet through luck and grid reference. But this one has aliens which were strangely absent in the original source material.Ridiculous as it sounds on paper BATTLESHIP was made and here we have a passable summer time killer.The special effects in the movie are impressive I watched a regular screening so I can't say much for the 3D. The combat between Earth's naval ships and the alien machines was done well though it wasn't as tense as one could hope for. They're just nice to LOOK at there's no sense of urgency or dread when the guns are loaded or when the enemy ships arm their missiles. The editing in the action scenes was a bit choppy but thankfully this does little to hinder the fact that they're nice to look at.The movie wasn't advertised as having a thought provoking story or anything serious the crew behind the movie knew that they made it to be nothing more than a popcorn movie that doesn't take itself seriously which is why unlike CLASH OF THE TITANS the special effects don't seem to be a hindrance to the simple story. Though I just wish someone took the time to improve the alien design which looked like it was cheaply ripped off from a video game.But the story itself isn't even worth mentioning sure it's a simple alien invasion but that's about all it is there's nothing more to it. There's no character development it's extremely predictable and it seems amateurish. There were some good laughs here and there and bits of what could've been character development but never are they expanded. Even for a simple alien invasion movie the dialogue the characters said seemed forced never do they connect to the audience in some way so when someone goes down or when someone's in danger you don't feel anything. The writers tried to make things sound more intelligent than they have to and look at the end result you have a bunch of flat characters spouting unnecessary profound crap. The script is just bad it looks like it was written by a kid who thought that the cool stuff video game looking aliens cheesy dialogue meant to sound deep witty oneliners etc. should be added into the movie and that's why those were there. Cheap and cheesy dialogue makes the already flat cast of characters even more uninteresting try not to groan while watching any of the romantic scenes or the obligatory patriotic scenes as seen in any movie made involving the military. I'll admit I was expecting BATTLESHIP to be total crap but I'm slightly thankful it didn't turn out to be the complete waste of money and time I was expecting but that isn't saying much. All the movie turned out to be was a popcorn movie that couldn't even entertain me all through out its run time. In the end BATTLESHIP is a corny and clichd movie to describe it this way is being lenient that relies on action sequences to draw in an audience. This movie didn't really feel like an alien invasion summer flick it felt more like a 90 minute ad for a board game.".

Rihanna is acceptable but appears in parts of the film where you wouldn't expect her to be. The inclusion of the real WW2 veterans was touching but exposed the poor story line and plot even more. The highlight of absurdity came with the revival of the old battleship from a museum piece to all of a sudden being fully laden with ammo and able to fire up the engines at a moments notice. The adverts for the film gave you an entirely different idea of what was to come. In other words false advertising. This is yet another example of Hollywood relying on CGI and that feeling of being on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Finally if it wasn't for the fact that I had to write 10 lines I wouldn't have. As for the film don't bother.".

It has very little to do with the classic board game but that doesn't take away from the fun. This is truly a summer blockbuster. Alex Hopper is the lazy slacker brother of Commander Stone Hopper. When Alex gets arrested trying to impress the daughter of Admiral Shane Stone makes him join the United States Navy. Seven years later Alex is still a slacker but he must step up his game during the RIMPAC naval exercises. During the same time five alien spaceships crash land in the sea. They begin to attacks the ships. Alex is forced to become the leader and fight back against the aliens. Like I said this film is extremely actionpacked and worthy of a viewing. I highly recommend BATTLESHIP!!!".

A disabled man who walks with a cane and has artificial legs and a huge stomach can beat up a grizzly bearsize alien in full high tech armor. A geeky guy can hit a grizzly bearsized alien in high tech armor with a brief case and beat him up. We see giant square blocks with 100 rocket launchers pop up on alien battleships yet they only fire one or two at a time. The USS Missouri which is a floating museum is occupied by a dozen 90yearold WW2 vets who quickly spring into action instead of suffering massive heart attacks and strokes. The aforementioned 70yearold battleship was fully equipped with live rounds of ammo. The United States Military was too stupid to attack the alien battleships with aircraft as they did to the Japanese Navy in WW2. This film was the worst kind of garbage imaginable. It ranks up there with Battle Los Angeles as the worst alien invasion film of all time.On the plus side I liked those alien buzzsaw bombs that wrecked the ship but that's it.

	schema:reviewBody "There ain't no softhearted gunfighters says Matthew Sebanek Warren Oates to Clayton Drumm Fabio Testi late in Monte Hellman's lyrical western China 9 Liberty 37 aka Amore piombo e furore. The English title reflects the words on a crossroad's sign shown at the start of the film.Hellman fans will be happy to finally find this film available on DVD as a 2005 release by Mill Creek Entertainment. Although the IBDb does not yet link to it Amazon has it listed as China 9 Liberty 37Gone With the West. The second movie on the DVD Gone With the West aka Little Moon and Old Jug is a James CaanSammy Davis Jr. western best described as The Rat Pack on LSD. It is a horrible western made even worse by the condition of the print they used to make the DVD but it does feature one of the most intense catfights in cinema history.The print for China 9 is a bit better but suffers from a poor pan and scan fullscreen treatment and weak audio tracks. It also has some editing glitches which probably resulted from the need to cobble together a decent print for transfer to DVD. And I suspect the original release was longer than this 98minute version.Hellman and Oates also collaborated on The Shooting and if you enjoyed that effort you should really like China 9. In China 9 Oates plays a retired gunfighter mining gold on land he refuses to sell to the railroad. Testi the best of a long line of Englishchallenged prettyboy European actors who worked in the western genre in the 60's and 70's is hired by the railroad to kill Oates. But the two gunfighters hit it off and Testi refuses to complete the job. In the meantime Oates' wife Catherine Jenny Agutter comes on to Testi. They run off together believing she has killed Matthew but he survives and begins to hunt them down. To add additional complications to the story the railroad recruits a squad of gunfighters to kill both Matthew and Clayton.Clayton Drum is good western hero. Although he drinks a lot of cocaine based tonic he maintains his professional integrity and refuses to sell out to the wild west show promoters or the dime novelists. The world may be changing and making him irrelevant but he sticks to his principles. My life is not for sale.Fans of The Hunting Party will find a familiar storyline Fellini fans will find a nice homage to their favorite director and Sam Peckinpah fans will find an actual appearancewhile a small speaking part it is more than just a cameo.The action sequences are extremely well staged although the effects are on the cheap side. The action in the big final showdown scene is totally credible and leaves one wondering why other directors can't exercise their imaginations and come up with equally plausible shootouts. Plus there is an extremely nice twist to the story's resolution that you don't see coming. Finally Hellman goes out on a slick mise en scene shot that actually advances the story a final notch.China 9 is an absolute mustsee for fans of Jenny Agutter. Hellman liked to give his films an overexposed grainy look as if the film stock was pushed a couple of steps in processing. Combined with minimal makeup this gave his heroines a strikingly haunting and earthy beauty check out Millie Perkins in The Shooting and Ride the Whirlwind. Like Perkins Agutter has never looked better and is more than credible as the catalyst of this love triangle.Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

I was surprised by Katherine's decision to stay with Matthew though she really had little choice and that final scene must have looked amazing in the original Technovision 2351 frame. I think it symbolized that Oates was finally cutting his ties with his past completely. I think he was sincere when he told Catherine No one will hurt you again meaning he wouldn't. Fabio Testi's accent was thick but I give Hellman credit for not dubbing him and for adding a back story about Drumm coming to the USA after his grandparents' death to explain it.And yes I think the West was full of people with nearly indecipherable accents.

	schema:reviewBody "Named after a mysterious signpost in Beaumont southeast Texas set between U.S. 90 and the adjacent Southern Pacific railroad tracks that inexplicably reads China 9 Liberty 37 with the genre fading quick into obscurity in both sides of the Atlantic this Monte Hellman's and Warren Oates' final western seems to be trying to succeed despite itself setting pitfalls for itself and falling into them but still somehow remaining a formidable picture not just worthy of bearing Monte Hellman's name a vastly underappreciated American auteur with an incredible run in the early 70's that saddly never took off but doing justice to it.If the movie can work despite Fabio Testi's unintelligible Italian accent then it can overcome almost everything. I say almost because Pino Donaggio's score a jumbled mess of muzak apart from the fitting opening credits theme that seems to be consciously channeling Morricone defies overcoming and Hellman's inexplicable fixation to not only squeeze a heartfelt romance out of two actors Testi and Jenny Agutter who simply don't have it in them to look in love but to go ahead and film not one but two long making love scenes y'know the ones where the two lovers are lost passionately in each other's eyes kiss like fishes and rock back and forth in a rhythmic staccato all of which is played to horrible making love muzak threaten to throw the whole thing permanently off.But just when you think he's lost control all Hellman needs to do to suck the viewer back in is cut to Warren Oates. A man not only made from that late 60's mold of cinematic badass but also a naturally charismatic actor who gave some truly electrifying performances for Hellman COCKFIGHTER and TWOLANE BLACKTOP Oates as the grizzly homesteader fighting the railroad company he once worked for that is now trying to steal his land makes the movie has the gravitational pull to keep everything together. Even in his early 50's he has so much charisma he can spare some for bland hunk Fabio Testi.With the spaghetti western dead by 1978 the last major release was MANNAJA the previous year  and the Italian genre industry moving on to a notsoeclectic mix of MAD MAX and JAWS ripoffs to sustain itself in its waning years before the advent of home video and movies opening worldwide killed it off and Clint Eastwood continuing to carry the American western on his shoulders almost singlehandedly China 9 Liberty 37 is more of a throwback to Hellman's previous westerns a particular niche unto themselves that take from both national western schools but subscribe to neither than anything contemporary certainly not as violent and cynic as most 70's westerns. Seen with regards to an overall oeuvre China takes its proper place somewhere between THE SHOOTING and RIDE THE WHIRLWIND. More the sum of their author's fixations clearly works bearing a distinct auteurial mark Hellman's westerns seem like the late 60's equivalent of Budd Boetticher's Ranown westerns. The minimalism of the plot the isolated settings the lone female characters... but that's for another post.".

I say almost because Pino Donaggio's score a jumbled mess of muzak apart from the fitting opening credits theme that seems to be consciously channeling Morricone defies overcoming and Hellman's inexplicable fixation to not only squeeze a heartfelt romance out of two actors Testi and Jenny Agutter who simply don't have it in them to look in love but to go ahead and film not one but two long making love scenes y'know the ones where the two lovers are lost passionately in each other's eyes kiss like fishes and rock back and forth in a rhythmic staccato all of which is played to horrible making love muzak threaten to throw the whole thing permanently off.But just when you think he's lost control all Hellman needs to do to suck the viewer back in is cut to Warren Oates. A man not only made from that late 60's mold of cinematic badass but also a naturally charismatic actor who gave some truly electrifying performances for Hellman COCKFIGHTER and TWOLANE BLACKTOP Oates as the grizzly homesteader fighting the railroad company he once worked for that is now trying to steal his land makes the movie has the gravitational pull to keep everything together. Even in his early 50's he has so much charisma he can spare some for bland hunk Fabio Testi.With the spaghetti western dead by 1978 the last major release was MANNAJA the previous year  and the Italian genre industry moving on to a notsoeclectic mix of MAD MAX and JAWS ripoffs to sustain itself in its waning years before the advent of home video and movies opening worldwide killed it off and Clint Eastwood continuing to carry the American western on his shoulders almost singlehandedly China 9 Liberty 37 is more of a throwback to Hellman's previous westerns a particular niche unto themselves that take from both national western schools but subscribe to neither than anything contemporary certainly not as violent and cynic as most 70's westerns. Seen with regards to an overall oeuvre China takes its proper place somewhere between THE SHOOTING and RIDE THE WHIRLWIND. More the sum of their author's fixations clearly works bearing a distinct auteurial mark Hellman's westerns seem like the late 60's equivalent of Budd Boetticher's Ranown westerns. The minimalism of the plot the isolated settings the lone female characters... but that's for another post.";

In a modest Western like this it's a pleasant surprise to see ambiguous characters.  So that his conflict with Fabio Testi a younger gunfighter who steals Oates' wife is full of uncertainty.  For all the familiar trappings you're uncertain how it will end and that should keep you watching.

But it does hold one's interest.Some advice if I may for those reviewers who had a hard time following the dialog. I had no trouble even with Fabio Testi's accent once I enabled the subtitles option on my TV. I do that now as a general precaution for just such an eventuality. Surprising what a good job some captioners do providing dialog you don't even hear at all sometimes.Always great to see Warren Oates in one of his classic TV Western appearances so catching him here in a lead role was twice the treat. That was a cool move showing Clayton Drumm Testi how fast he was with a gun in that early set up. Made you wonder what would happen once the real thing came around. Worth the wait I would say.Where the movie takes a refreshing break from the hero getting the girl occurs at the finale here when Drumm simply rides off into the sunset  alone! What a heel!

We see him in a jail cell and out in the town square we see a hanging platform with three nooses a Chinaman and a China woman are bound and lined up below it we cut back to Clayton who is removed from his cell apparently to join the condemned. We cut to Clayton in the offices of a railroad company where some officials hand him a pardon with the stipulation that he is to go kill Matthew Sebanek who won't sell out his land at the cheap price offered to the RR. He has become a small obstacle to the tracks. We see two corpses hanging from the gallows as Clayton rides out of town.Matthew Sebenek Warren Oates is sort of a hardscrabble squatterhomesteader he is sitting upon land that has oil beneath it and knows it oldest of the Sebenek brothers he looks to be between 4555 years old his comparatively child bride wife Catherine Jenny Agutter looks between 2025 Matthew treats Catherine more like a slave than a partner she is unhappy and shows it. There are no children present that in most Hollywood Westerns that depicted these types of MayDecember relationships would cement the couple together with a common cause.Into this situation rides reluctant hired gun Clayton Jones and he gets his first eyeful of Catherine as she is bathing in the stream near the road to the homestead she doesn't hear him coming while she reclines in the water and is surprised when Clayton's voice asks which way to the Sebenek's but not embarrassed and she does not try to cover up in any way. In subsequent scenes we learn that Matthew who was a former hired gun of the railroad has Clayton pretty much pegged for what he truly is but that sort of binds him into a wary friendship with him that blossoms. We also see that love starved Catherine is attracted to Clayton by her demeanor and it is she who makes the first move to consummate an affair. Clayton who has come to like Matthew decides not to kill him and that he best get away from the dicey situation but Catherine gives it away on the day Clayton leaves and she and Matthew come to blows in the kitchen and she stabs Matthew and leaves him for dead.Catherine rides away to follow Clayton and Matthew and his brothers take off after them.Now this is an adult treatment of situations that are real I've know real life stories that have played out exactly so and have had similar ends. It's refreshing to see a Western with more mature themes that still has enough Western elements to keep it in Genre and interesting enough to keep you watching.There are some nice stylistic camera shot touches in a later whorehouse confrontation. If I have any complaint about the film it would be the overly intrusive soundtrack that in some scenes plays annoyingly over the dialog it doesn't help that it has a 70's sound to it. Other music is provided by the actors themselves and gratefully its recorded live not sound studio looping and sounds very realistic.Sam Peckinpah has a nice cameo as a seedy pulp novelist.Check it out if you can find it. The version I saw was almost full wide screen though it still had some side cropping where you could tell so when the credits were rolling. For the most part you wouldn't notice it however there is one scene where when Catherine is coming on to Clayton she stands in a open doorway in a nightgown back lit by a kerosene lantern and you can see she is plainly naked she is half cut off by the cropping which makes me suspect that there may be a few more scenes where we are not seeing the full potential of the cinematography.".

Clayton goes to do the deed but ends up falling in love with the man's wife Jenny Agutter which just adds more problems. This ItalianSpanish coproduction from cult director Hellman has a few decent moments but in the end this is a pretty boring affair from start to finish. I know Hellman has a strong cult following among some film fans but I can't say I'm one of them. This film here is yet another Spaghetti Western that tells a rather familiar story but Hellman puts his own spin on things and these spins actually hurt more than help. This film has a lot of problems including letting the viewer know who we should be cheering for. The film starts off with Testi being the bad guy and we're given Matthew to like. At around the thirtyminute mark we switch sides as it turns out Matthew is a real jerk who abuses his wife and the director has decided to put us in a love story. The love story between Testi and Agutter never works for several reasons. One reason is that the two have no chemistry and one can't help but roll their eyes at the love banter they give at each other. The screenplay mentions that Agutter is shy and changes her clothes in the barn but that doesn't keep her from being nude in this thing at least six different times. The nude scenes are only available in the Rrated cut most boots are of the TV print and are the main reasons to watch this thing. Agutter is an incredibly beautiful woman so seeing her nude is about the only thing that keeps this sucker moving. However even the sex scenes are messed up by Hellman as he decides to film them in a slowmotion fashion with an incredibly bad score over them and a couple even has some sort of weak pop song. Why on Earth Hellman decided to do this is anyone's guess but it doesn't work. I also didn't believe Testi in his role too much but then again this could be due to the fact that Hellman seemed more interested in showing off his body than anything else. Oates is always dependable and he turns in a good performance even though the screenplay does him no favors. Agutter's role is pretty thankless but she gives it all she can. Look quick for Sam Peckinpah as a writer.".

	schema:reviewBody "When the spaghetti genre was all but dead in the late 1970s the last gasps brought some of the most interesting examples of the genre including this one. Actually I am not sure if it qualifies as being a spaghetti western because it was helmed by an American director Monte Hellman instead of an Italian. It's probably because of this that the end results don't always play out like a typical spaghetti western. It's quite slow at times and its atmosphere instead of being actionpacked is pretty serious. In fact it's almost arty at times. The movie is also interesting in that the main character of the movie played by Fabio Testi is not all that sympathetic. Speaking of Testi his thick accent makes some of his dialogue difficult to understand. But the movie has some strengths as well as weaknesses. There's not much action but what there is is fairly exciting. There's a good musical score kind of a mix between European and American western music. And while the movie is slow it does get you interested in sticking around to see what will happen in the end. If you are into Italian westerns and want to see something a little different  and have some patience to sit through some slow andor clunky moments  this movie does have some interest.".

Actually I am not sure if it qualifies as being a spaghetti western because it was helmed by an American director Monte Hellman instead of an Italian. It's probably because of this that the end results don't always play out like a typical spaghetti western. It's quite slow at times and its atmosphere instead of being actionpacked is pretty serious. In fact it's almost arty at times. The movie is also interesting in that the main character of the movie played by Fabio Testi is not all that sympathetic. Speaking of Testi his thick accent makes some of his dialogue difficult to understand. But the movie has some strengths as well as weaknesses. There's not much action but what there is is fairly exciting. There's a good musical score kind of a mix between European and American western music. And while the movie is slow it does get you interested in sticking around to see what will happen in the end. If you are into Italian westerns and want to see something a little different  and have some patience to sit through some slow andor clunky moments  this movie does have some interest.";

Excellent photography of the arid Spanish landscapes. The sound was awful though with score and background noise often drowning out dialog. Fabio Testi was the wooden antihero with a serious Italian accent. Warren Oates was the only really welldeveloped character. Jenny Agutter was oh so beautiful. But she was alternately reserved and wanton so it was hard to figure out her character. You really have to see the uncut version. It is available if you search hard enough for it. There were a few anachronisms and plot holes but not terribly so.

Clayton and Agutter think Oates is dead and they can be a couple but Oates wakes up and gathers his numerous brothers for some revenge...as does the Railroad when they find out Oates isn't dead...As this is a late era Spaghetti Western the pacing isn't exactly full throttle but I was surprised to see that the violence was very realistic  people get shot and fall over instead of clutching themselves and spinning around the place and the violence is very abrupt and sudden like the accidental shooting of a hooker through a window or two corpses being shot over and over again.Plus Testi stands out as the lightening fast Clayton made weak through his love for Agutter. Apart from her dodgy Irish accent Agutter does well too and spends a lot of time naked with Testi I actually gave birth to Testi's child just by watching this film!. Warren Oates stands out too with his mumbly tired character.This must be one of the very last Spaghetti Westerns and it's worth tracking down if you can find an uncut version of it.

	schema:headline " American Monte Hellman helms a Spaghetti Western";
	schema:reviewBody "This 1978 ItalianSpanish Western was directed by the enigmatic American Monte Hellman who has made few features during his 50year career. Its recent airing on the Western Channel confirmed its cult status as it stars Warren Oates that fine underrated actor frequently used by Hellman this being their final collaboration before Oates' untimely death at age 53 in 1982. Not having seen it since the early 1980s and perusing the other 11 reviews on IMDb I can attest that this is the full uncut 102 minute version with all the nudity and some of the most frank shocking lines you're likely to hear in a Western. The other comments gripe about the poor quality of all available prints and the accent of leading man Fabio Testi. I have two major complaints myself in that the film seems much longer due to its meandering script but what is unforgivable is that the soundtrack from the footsteps to the chickens even the music simply drowns out much of the dialogue. The photography is excellent the acting is good and Hellman works wonders with his material I just couldn't recommend it to anyone hard of hearing. The frustration is eased by Warren Oates who manages to gain sympathy as the wronged husband and the lovely Jenny Agutter who supplies the film's bold nude scenes as the supposedly shy wife who becomes a whore. As the gunman who falls in love Fabio Testi's accent makes his line readings a real chore to decipher while small cameos are provided by Sidney Lassick and Sam Peckinpah the latter playing a wealthy author manufacturing tales of the Old West. There is also an extremely brief appearance by European cult beauty Helga Line as a hotel proprietor. The 15year heyday of the Spaghetti Western 19641979 was nearing its end and this frank and occasionally bloody example continues to wallow in obscurity but isn't that a typical fate for any movie directed by Monte Hellman? My favorite Hellman feature remains his first Beast from Haunted Cave a 1959 collaboration with Gene and Roger Corman.".

I felt sorry for the Warren Oates character although he wasn't very sympathetic.I've recently seen a heavily edited for TV version of this movie and there's a lot of bad stuff in the movie very low budget sets embarrassingly underwritten scenes underdeveloped plot and sketchy acting. But there's quite a few good elements that are mentioned in some of the other reviews.Now that I know Jerry Harvey wrote this movie along with his pal Doug Venturelli and worked alongside some of his heroes like Warren Oates Monte Hellman and Sam Peckinpah not to mention some of the Italian folks who made all those great Westerns  I sure wish the uncut film that I rejected as a kid in that movie house was available on DVD.Jerry Harvey himself appears in a bordello scene as a tipsy customer.It'd be nice if this mixed yet positive achievement was around to brighten if only a little Jerry Harvey's tortured legacy.Maybe one day.".

The director of photography was Guiseppe Rotunno who worked on many of Fellini's films and in many of the exterior shots he and Hellman achieve a singular chiaroscuro effect the foreground characters are often in deep shadow while an intense golden morning or evening light illuminates a stunning backdrop of cliffs or mountains.Many of the interior shots are also carefully lit again with strong use of shadow but the main characters just aren't interesting enough to engage the attention. The sudden intensity of Sam Peckinpah's brief appearance points up the shortcomings of the rest of the film the way Jenny Agutter focuses on him makes you realise how little chemistry there is between her and Fabio Testi.Hard to recommend especially with the truly dismal quality of the available prints.".

And the weird thing is this movie is almost identical to all movies she made later being Black Emmanuelle. This is even extremely close to La Spiaggia del desiderio  the third Emmanuella negra film. The English titles confirm this  Taboo Island and A Beach Called Desire. The only differences are the higher pace of this movie the fact it looks like the budget was lower for this one and Emmanuelle is called Janine here. The title may suggest there is a lot of sex in this movie but there is surprisingly little of it and the scenes are much shorter than to be expected. This movie is quite dull by today's standards. The only reason you would have for wanting to see it is Gemser in her first movie if you are a fan of hers. Not too bad a movie but quite boring. I rate it 4 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have watched this film in 3d at a preview screening in London.First of all I do not recommend anyone watching this in 3d. It is too dark and the action is just a motion blur. It's dreadful.As for the film there is much to enjoy with excellent visual effects action set pieces though ruined for me by the 3D and a couple of stand out characters. But unfortunately there is also much to cringe at in some bouts of terrible dialogue.The characters of Reepicheep the kickass warrior mouse and Eustace the obnoxious brat cousin were the most fun with the actor playing Eustace demonstrating excellent comic timing. The relationship between them was funny and touching. And they even brought much needed zest to the action.But alarmingly Edmund and Lucy seem to have deteriorated as actors. Some of their emotions are too forced which is a pity. Not sure why as I would expect them to improve with each film as did the young cast of the Harry Potter movies.Overall the story has surprisingly been well adapted considering not a great deal actually happens in the book. But the pacing is good even though a little episodic. There are much more Christian analogies once again which would please many and irritate others. But I rather like all of the analogies.I do feel however that amongst adults mostly those who enjoyed the Narnia books will enjoy this more than non readers of the books because the story is too bizarre even for a fantasy! But I think most children will enjoy this immensely regardless if they read the books or not.With better written dialogue and better handling of the child performances namely Lucy and Edmund this could have been a much better film but as its stands its an enjoyable enough entry in this series.Oh and I will say it again do not watch this in 3d.".

It has elements for everyone to enjoy such as clean humour excitement dangers and also psychological elements. The plot is straightforward and easy to understand. It is also filled with excitement especially the battle with the dragon is quite breathtaking. The plot and the characters engage me a lot. This time the Pevensies have matured and hence are a lot less annoying. They even become interesting characters as they battle to overcome their own inadequacies. This subplot is aimed at adults but it still can be understood by children at face value.The 3D though is a lot less thrilling than the film. Most scenes do not have noticeable 3D effects. The scenes that do have 3D are quite underwhelming. There are little scenes in the film that makes use of the 3D technology. I can safely say that watching the 2D version would be just as enjoyable than the 3D version and you can save a few dollars by doing so.".

Eustace and Reepicheep were the best parts of the movie really it's only redeeming quality.

	schema:reviewBody "Chronicles of Narnia Voyage of the Dawn TreaderIt has been a few years now and a studio director and production team change since we last had a Narnia film but finally the third film in the series The Voyage of the Dawn Treader has finally come to screen and what can I say? It is well worth your money for you and your entire family to see it. The film is made by 20th Century Fox and Walden Media directed by Michael Apted still with actors Ben Barnes as Prince Caspian Liam Neesan as the voice of Aslan the Lion Skander Keynes again as Edmund Georgie Henley as Lucy with Will Poulter Son of Rambow as their cousin Eustace.The story centers around Edmund and Lucy returning to Narnia this time with their whiny cousin Eustace where they meet up with Prince Caspian now King Caspian onboard the Narnia ship the Dawn Treader. With years of peace enjoyed in Narnia they are unsure why they are there but soon find themselves on an adventure to battle a mysterious force that threatened Narnia where they face slavers dragons temptation serpents and learn to become greater than they ever thought they could be. The film follows the plot of the book very well expanding in order to make it flow as a proper story. The additions are perfectly plausible and make the story more cohesive and unlike the changes in Prince Caspian improve the story. Flowing along quickly this is by far the shortest in runtime of the series yet also the most powerful and magical it starts well and ends on a such a high emotional note there are few that will escape unaffected from any screening.Special effects stand out with the absence of WETA in the production and special effects I was anxious to see if the new team actually a fairly large group of small companies could match what WETA was able to create I am here to tell you YES and in some ways they have surprassed their creations. The dragon and a sea serpent in the film alone are well worth admission both created with much care and love and really the magic of a fantasy world involved. Other characters from Reepicheep the mouse a Minotaur and other creatures are beautiful to behold. The only one that seemed a little down was Aslan who though looking good seems a step down from what WETA created in Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe and Prince Caspian but the rest is so vivid with color and imagination there is little doubt that it will not just capture the imagination of the young but the entire family and keep them from first shot to last frame.Music is another powerful entry the strong Narnia theme running through this film giving it wonder and magic that belongs in this type of film. The strongest song though involves the arrival of a dragon a piece with great power and a pulse that gives one of the most powerful scenes in the film even greater amazement and magic. Do you want to capture the imagination of a child and your childhood an escapist film that will be great entertainment for the entire family? THIS IS THAT FILM!Acting has been hit but this one features better acting and character moments than the other films. With fewer characters than the other two films this one can focus more on the characters and each of the main characters get multiple character building moments that give us greater love and really infuses the film with such emotional power that its hard not to be moved especially by the climax. Everyone from Edmund to Lucy to Caspian to Reepicheep to Eustace get powerful scenes that culimate in the strongest ending to a Narnia films and one of the most poignant scenes I have seen in a film in a very long time.Christians out there do you fear that the Christian themes are stripped out of this movie? Do not fear this film is as powerfully religious as it is in magic. All of the religious undertones are not covered but are out in the open for all to see. There is no fear like what Disney had when it comes to hitting these themes and the director displays them in all their glory with as much power as C.S. Lewis wrote them to be.The 3D of the film was fine it does not detract now does it really add. I believe one would be fine seeing it or not seeing it in 3D whatever you prefer.Overall Voyage of the Dawn Treader is a powerful entry in the fantasy genre a great film for the entire family and the type of film that belongs in December and should be watched time and time again by young and old alike! I give this film an 8.510.".

It had a good opening scene and a smooth transition from Prince Caspian to The Dawn Treader. Three scenes later I was wondering if I had perhaps stepped into the wrong cinema and if not when the Chronicles of Narnia turned into a crossover with Deathly Hallows Find the seven horcrux  I mean swords and what the director and screenwriters were smoking when they filmed this. I spent most of the film staring in horror as the book I loved since childhood was utterly mutilated in the worst booktomovie adaption since 'Ella Enchanted'. Honestly the Lone Islands did have a problem with slavery but there were no human sacrifices and Lord Bern was a welloff man living happily if against slavetraders not some halfmad loon sitting in a dungeon. The Quest was to find the Seven Banished Lords not to hunt down seven swords and while I can understand Jadis still lurking among Edmund's fears the sea serpent was entirely unnecessary. They found Lord Rhoop on the Island of Dreams BEFORE Ramandu's Island but he was desperate to get out not waving his sword around and attacking people. And what orifice did they pull the Evil Mist TM out of anyway? I understood that while GoldDeathwater Island and Dragon Island were two different places placing them together was necessary and carried well given that both islands brought similar lessons and the encounter with the Dufflepudds and the Magicitan were pulled off nicely. I found myself praising the Emperor Over The Sea that they got Ramandu's Island and the End of The WorldAslan's Country right. By that point I was starting to wonder if Miraz was going to come back from the dead and prove to be the 'Great Evil' considering the path the movie was taking. On the positive side I enjoyed the way that Lucy's insecurity and jealousy of Susan was portrayed as well as her discovery that she needed to be herself. I also liked the bond between Caspian and the children from our world and the settings were beautiful.People who have never read the books will probably enjoy it but those who have will be either foaming at the mouth or refusing to waste good money seeing it again if they didn't walk out halfway through.".

I found myself praising the Emperor Over The Sea that they got Ramandu's Island and the End of The WorldAslan's Country right. By that point I was starting to wonder if Miraz was going to come back from the dead and prove to be the 'Great Evil' considering the path the movie was taking. On the positive side I enjoyed the way that Lucy's insecurity and jealousy of Susan was portrayed as well as her discovery that she needed to be herself. I also liked the bond between Caspian and the children from our world and the settings were beautiful.People who have never read the books will probably enjoy it but those who have will be either foaming at the mouth or refusing to waste good money seeing it again if they didn't walk out halfway through.";

	schema:headline " A Narnia Film That Expands Its Contents Beautifully From the Previous Two";
	schema:reviewBody "It's been five years from The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe debuted on theaters. The Pevensies have grown up. The first movie would see a very young Lucy still with a cute face like a firstgrader. In this movie she looks like she's in seventh grade or eight grade. Seems like time flows like Narnian time here. Voyage of the Dawn Treader marks the third film in the Narnia franchise. It follows King Caspian in a journey to find the seven lost lords of Narnia whom King Miraz banished during his reign in the previous film with his ship the Dawn Treader. On the way he met Edmund Lucy and their pathetic cousin Eustace Scrubb who turned out to have a change in the movie. However there's this horrifying green mist that can tempt you to do things that can lead up to bad things and the whereabouts of these lost lords are unknown. So these people take on a journey that passes the beyond the Silver Sea which must be really somewhere very east and to the End of the World. END of the world not those doomsday things.Voyage is actually a very enjoyable film for both kids and adults alike. The adventures were really great and breathtaking and should be a good way to take people's spare time. Its story is understandable for young kids and its characters are enjoyable and fun to befriend with especially the mouse Reepicheep. Voyage will actually give good laughs to its audience with its jokes especially with the appearance of the Pevensies' coward pathetic Eustace Scrubb who actually changed ever since he visited Narnia. His actions are the main source of laughs here. His acting also maximized the laughs in this film and I think comedy is what strengthens this movie. Voyage is also powerful in exciting action scenes. This is what seems to be lacking in the previous films even in the climax where it doesn't seem that exciting. Voyage's climax is very exciting and deserves to be called a climax. The setting of the scene was wellsuited and the scene was shot beautifully. Definitely awesome. But this movie is quite dark for very young children especially in the climax part. It has grown quite scarier than the previous ones.Voyage also has a new director allowing the series to turn into a quite different style of film. While the previous ones were really too childish this third one puts on several scenes to attract an older audience. Michael Apted replacing Andrew Adamson is definitely an advance in the Narnia film series.However Narnian fans will miss Peter and Susan Pevensie as they would not return as main characters but rather just as cameos. The reason in the story why they didn't return is that they're now too old to return to Narnia. This movie will only see two Pevensies plus their cousin Eustace Scrubb. What a pity.The 3D effects of the film were actually acceptable. They are actually quite conspicuous and are good. 3D or 2D would be OK in watching this movie.You might notice that the Pevensies have grown a lot over the five years gap between the first film and this third film. Compared to the Harry Potter series which had a 3year gap between the first and third film Narnia had a longer gap. As it is also a sevenbook series I'm quite worried how it will end up in the final filmeven though some of the installments don't include the Pevensies. Let's just hope they have no problem encountering this situation. About its loyalty to the book the movie did have some changes and some of them are quite major QUITE not REALLY be careful. The arrangement of scenes were also ordered in a new way. In the middle of the book starting to the end that's where the movie's change was big. But for me it was acceptable and let's hope that it's acceptable for other fans of the book.The Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader what a long title it is is absolutely a mustwatch film for this holiday season and is very suitable for Christmas. Rather than watching some bloody films people merry up and rather watch something appropriate for Christmas and in 3D if you prefer. It's definitely great and perfect for families to watch. Prince AJB's Score 910 90Thanks for reading my review and hope it's useful.".

	schema:headline " Narnian in essence yet shallow in fun and excitement";
	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps the most moralistic of C.S. Lewis' Narnia novels would be 'The Voyage of the Dawn Treader' which is episodic in style with the Dawn Treader's aimless journey through Narnian seas. Michael Apted takes the helm of direction and brings this adventure to us in 3D the first for Narnia.Susan and Peter King  Queen have grown up now and reside in America where Narnia has no access. The teenagers Lucy Georgie Hensley and Edmund Skander Keynes who are in Britain in the midst of WW2 along with their unnerving cousin Eustace Will Poulter catch the moving waters in a painting in their room. Soon the water flows into the room and in a spectacular fashion they are underwater only to be pulled up by Prince Caspian in front of the hull of the Dawn Treader. Welcome to Narnia! The trio are briefly introduced to the ship's crew that include the swashbuckling mouse Reepicheep and a Narnian buffalo sailor. Their initial inquiry about Narnia's state of affairs and the Dawn Treader's voyage reveal the book and film's weakness  Prince Caspian admits that there are no problems in Narnia. Peace rules the lands and barring the exploration of the farthest stretches of the waters where Aslan's country mythically exists the ship has little to do on its voyage. Thus they decide to go island hopping where just on the first one they are taken as prisoners and almost sold as slaves until a heroic rescue by the crew saves the day. It is within the walls of the prison that Prince and Edmund find out about the 7 missing lords and their magical swords. Oh and there's a LOST like smoke monster that devours boats full of slaves. The most striking aspect about 'The Chronicles of Narnia Voyage of the Dawn Treader' is that it lacks the mystery build up and joy of discovery of the first movie. At the same time it eliminates the excessive CGI and Lord of the Rings inspired battle sequences from the second installment and thus proves to be a closer to book adaptation. The focus is on retaining Narnia's adventures as an escape for children with funny bits that are memorable especially the endless picking of Eustace by the witty Reepicheep and the monopodial dwarfs on the island. Deeper into the story's entertaining layers Evil tempts the protagonists in different ways and overcoming the lure is the didactic experience of C.S. Lewis' edition that is well captured by Michael Apted. Lucy's battle against her temptation to be as beautiful as her sister Edmund's envy of Prince Caspian's position as the leader and Eustace's greed that draws him to hidden treasures are all lessons to be learnt in the battle of good vs evil. On one hand the white witch tempts Edmund to join the evil forces while Aslan in his Christ like rendition guides Lucy on the right path. The special effects involving the sea serpent in the cove are excellent and provide an ugly yet thrilling experience in 3D while the magical touches through the book of incarnations and entry to Aslan's country are simply enchanting to look at. Discovery of the 7 lords and their swords is itself a moral journey for everyone and while C.S. Lewis did brilliantly in detailing those aspects Apted is short of time and just like all Narnian films this one too falls short of the book's magical effect. But then again Michael Apted is no Peter Jackson. The climax is a sad farewell to what we were introduced to just 2 movies ago but The Silver Chair may prove to be an altogether different experience with Eustace. Will Poulter's brilliantly convincing portrayal of the annoying kid is the highlight of the film and the focus on him is a well thought out plan for the upcoming movies. Georgie Hensley IS Lucy as C.S. Lewis had once imagined and therefore her presence is always charming. The rest of the cast could've done better with more focus on their characters had it not been for the time constraint which Apted has wisely been strict about. The shortest of the 3 films yet least action packed 'Voyage of the Dawn Treader' betters its predecessor by being closer to the book with moral implications and childlike adventures. The film is beautiful to look at but it leaves you craving for more fun more adventure and sometimes more heroism. It is by no means uplifting and we do miss Aslan in action at the required times. This is Aslan's shortest time on screen and that is a tragedy for the film indeed. Nevertheless for loyal fans of Narnia this is purely Narnian in essence but not an epic by motion picture standards. 7.033 on a scale of 110.".

Edmund and Lucy long to return to Narnia Peter has been rejected by the army for his age and Lucy like many teenage girls starts to have doubts about her looks.

The adventure was lighthearted and there is a great amount of humour. Poulter was excellent as the butt of the jokes as a spoiled child who is overwhelmed by his surroundings. He had a particularly good acting relationship with Keynes and Simon Pegg the voice of Reepicheep. Pegg was able to inject some really comic energy as Eddie Izzard did with the role.The action was well handled and the special effects were decent. Because of the smaller forces involved and the seafaring adventure there are no massive battles between large armies but more smaller quicker skirmishes. The final battle was very much like the final action scene in Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest a small group of people fighting a sea creature. The costumes were very similar to the Pirates of the Caribbean films and the filmmakers seem to be influenced by the Harry Potter series and the glowing sword from Lord of the Rings.Apted paces the film quickly with no moments of boredom to settle in. The voyage to a number of strangle desertlike islands was very similar to classic adventure films like Jason and the Argonauts. The dry islands were very similar to the Greek islands. It has an oldfashioned style and feel but that is not necessarily bad  in fact it's pretty good. The cinematography and set designs are bright and colourful and this is a perfect film to take children to.Whilst Keynes and Henley are a little unsteady at first in the film they grow into their roles and becoming more assured. Barnes drops the Spanish accent from Prince Caspian and it helps him improve his performance. He was much more comfortable in the role and Caspian has grown up as character. He was more believable as a king then as a young prince.A problem with Voyage is there is a lack of a compelling antagonist. This film is more about the quest than The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe and Prince Caspian and there is a fresh amount of mystery but the mystery has a lacklustre conclusion.".

	schema:headline " Visually Outstanding. A decent movie overall";
	schema:reviewBody "It's been an overdose of fantasy for me in the last few days I guess. First in anticipation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I I watched all the previous ones at a stretch. For this I had to do a similar thing. Else how would it make any sense ??? The Narnia series it seems is shaping up to be the replacement of the Harry Potter series. We all know that Harry Potter is gonna be done with by the next year. That will leave us with the Narnia series and with four more movies to go I suppose that's gonna last a long while till another fantasy movie series pops up.The movie begins with the Pevensies being transported to Narnia least when they expected. This time they have their cousin Eustace with them who takes some time to accepting the Narnian world filled with talking creatures and other such wonders. He reacts similar to how the Pevensies did when they first saw Narnia only he's more scared than surprised. Since they've landed in Narnia unexpectedly there has to be a reason for it. And there is and a supposedly good one  one which will not only test their battling skills what with dragons serpents and storms on the way but also bring them face to face with their inner demons and fears.As far as the similarity of the movie's plot with the book goes I frankly admit to having no idea regarding that. I've viewed the movie as a movie as a sequel to the first two and as such won't be able to comment on how well the movie follows the plot of the book. On the surface of it however the plot is fairly basic but filled with too many characters to confuse someone who isn't familiar with the books. All the cast members perform well though the star of the show has to be Reepicheep the mouse  he is so endearing that you'd often find yourself rooting for him. And then again there's Aslan the Lion who in my opinion is the best CGI wonder ever created in the Narnian movie universe. His mere presence in a frame makes it stand out. He appears responsible wise calm and like a father figure to the Pevensies and others  the character is so greatly conceived that his mere sight makes you respect him. He truly has the aura of a king and rightfully deserves to be one. And Liam Neeson does a fabulous job of voicing him as do the animators on making him appear lifelike. And when the soft and soothing background score plays in the background during his presence you're bound to feel a lump in your throat. You'll definitely hear a child scream Aslan in the movie theater when he first arrives.Visually the film is simply outstanding. Such is the richness of the effects that it makes me wonder how on earth can the film be made on a budget of just 140 million. I mean the amount of visual effects present in the film and the quality of each shot is simply brilliant  from the dragon to the serpent to the wide shots of The Dawn Treader to the Islands to the waves to Reepicheep the mouse and finally the great Aslan. Lighting it seems has improved to the point that it is difficult to tell what is CGI and what is real. The main musical themes have been recycled from the past films which is a great thing since those themes were simply heart touching especially Aslan's. The set design is also good although as mentioned it is hard to distinguish between real and digital sets.Like many movies with excessive VFX the movie tends to give a slightly more focus to the effects maybe because it is a children centric film. Although made for children adults shouldn't find this a reason to stay away from the movie. The movie might tend to get a bit boring at times. And the biggest drawback of the movie is the 3D which quite simply is as good as not there. By all means you'd be better saving some bucks and watching the movie in 2D it might as well also save you a headache. As a matter of fact the commercial shown during my movie screening had better 3D that that found in this movie. Despite its drawbacks it is a good movie and can make for a good viewing with  without family. If not for anything else I recommend it For Aslan !!!Score 6.5  10".

He truly has the aura of a king and rightfully deserves to be one. And Liam Neeson does a fabulous job of voicing him as do the animators on making him appear lifelike. And when the soft and soothing background score plays in the background during his presence you're bound to feel a lump in your throat. You'll definitely hear a child scream Aslan in the movie theater when he first arrives.Visually the film is simply outstanding. Such is the richness of the effects that it makes me wonder how on earth can the film be made on a budget of just 140 million. I mean the amount of visual effects present in the film and the quality of each shot is simply brilliant  from the dragon to the serpent to the wide shots of The Dawn Treader to the Islands to the waves to Reepicheep the mouse and finally the great Aslan. Lighting it seems has improved to the point that it is difficult to tell what is CGI and what is real. The main musical themes have been recycled from the past films which is a great thing since those themes were simply heart touching especially Aslan's. The set design is also good although as mentioned it is hard to distinguish between real and digital sets.Like many movies with excessive VFX the movie tends to give a slightly more focus to the effects maybe because it is a children centric film. Although made for children adults shouldn't find this a reason to stay away from the movie. The movie might tend to get a bit boring at times. And the biggest drawback of the movie is the 3D which quite simply is as good as not there. By all means you'd be better saving some bucks and watching the movie in 2D it might as well also save you a headache. As a matter of fact the commercial shown during my movie screening had better 3D that that found in this movie. Despite its drawbacks it is a good movie and can make for a good viewing with  without family. If not for anything else I recommend it For Aslan !!!Score 6.5  10";

The first two movies were happily accurate and I've watched them over and over. But this... this is not the Dawn Treader. This is some storyline that seems as though someone came up with it after reading a vague outline of the story some 20 years ago and has now tried to recreate it from memory but failed. The mist? Really? That was a contained island with nothing in it but nightmares and one waterlogged lord not some evil darkness seeking to take over the world lurking and tempting and generally being a nuisance. And when they left it just turned around and left it it was gone. Poof over and done. And suddenly it's the most important part of the movie? The plot line as it stands leaves much to be desired utterly weaker than the previous two. And I don't blame them at all because they weren't given much to work with but the acting had definitely deteriorated. The musical score so beautiful heroic and moving in the previous two was not memorable at all. The movie in general was an insane disappointment. One would think that after the failure in the Golden Compass's plot liberties that they would know better than to take a much MORE beloved book and twiddle their fingers in it. I would hate to see this series fail before we finally get to see accurate interpretations of the later books and maybe even someday dare I say it the Magician's Nephew?! And can someone explain to me why suddenly nobody is Spanish including Caspian with his previously sexy accent? I had to go check to make sure he was even the same actor! Fail. Just... Fail. Please try again before Lucy and Edmond get too old. Please please redo sticking to the quality beauty and accuracy of the previous ones.".

Sadly with Prince Caspian it appears the film makers threw the book out the window and made up their own story where as this one sticks a lot closer to the book I am pleased to say although there are naturally a few twists and changes to the story. Seeing the film in 3D adds little as clearly it was post converted.Ben Barnes looks a lot more comfortable in the skin of Caspian this time especially having dropped the Spanish accent. Will Poulter as Eustace is a clear stand out too but being a kids film none of the cast really get a chance to show off their acting talents with any long monologues or scenes. Reepicheep's story is also well done.The film is good fun and there are some great action pieces especially with the sea serpent. The special effects are well done too. A great family flick for the holidays.I must also note a wonderful touch over the closing credits by using images from the book. A source of reference I wish had been used in the last film. Overall a good job by Fox having now taking over the series from Disney. Now if you can just go back and remake Prince Caspian for me please?".

	schema:reviewBody "This weekend it was a rare treat for me to watch and review The Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. The Chronicles of Narnia have always been a favorite of mine. It's a series comparable to all the great fantasy epics both in classic and modern times and Voyage of the Dawn Treader is my favorite chapter in the saga.A brief history for those who aren't familiar with the series. Narnia is a mystical kingdom in a magical world that can only be reached when it is of the greatest need. It is watched over by Aslan the Lion who comes and goes as he pleases but always chooses champions who can protect Narnia in the face of evil. In the first movie two brothers and two sisters from our world are brought to Narnia to overthrow a terrifying WitchQueen. In the second they help a young prince named Caspian ascend to the throne that his uncle had usurped. While only adolescents in our world in Narnia these four young men and women had become great heroes kings and queens of legend.In this movie the youngest two Edmund and Lucy travel to Narnia to find there is apparently no great need for their help. No wars are currently being fought and King Caspian is now sailing on his ship the Dawn Treader to find seven Lords of Narnia whom his uncle had banished years earlier. Accompanying Edmund and Lucy unwilling is their cousin Eustace Scrubb a thoroughly unpleasant boy who had never even read books about magical lands let alone believed in them. His only delight in life seemed to be annoying others. Naturally his attitude won him little friendship or sympathy when he found himself dragged along on a magical voyage in a land he'd teased his cousins for inventing.The ship's company sails to the east following the last known course of the seven Lords. Along their way they battle slave traders encounter an island full of invisible creatures and buildings and deal with all sorts of fantastical creatures and enchantments. They find themselves tempted by their greatest desires and threatened by their worst fears even as they strive to discover the fate of the missing Lords.The most valiant of the sailors is the brave Sir Reepicheep a Mouse granted the gift of speech and a new tail when his old was lost by Aslan himself. Never one to back away from a fight Reepicheep has a different motivation for embarking on this journey. As a young Mouse he was told that he would some day travel to Aslan's Country in person. Delighted to see King Edmund and Queen Lucy once more he finds it particularly difficult to tolerate Eustace. Reepicheep comments that if Eustace hadn't been related to them by blood he might have drawn his sword on the lad more than once and from a Mouse who has faced dragons it is no idle threat. Eventually though as Eustace is forced to face the reality of life in this strange and dangerous world the noble Mouse becomes something of a guide to him and even oddly enough a comfort from time to time.There's certainly enough adventure and danger to create an epic and the emotional and personal trials that each character faces make for interesting moral and dramatic scenes. However the main difference between the book and the movie is the nature of the voyage on which the crew of the Dawn Treader embarks. In the movie more than simply finding the lost Lords the crew is told by a magician that they must bring the swords of each Lord to Aslan's Table and lay them upon it. Doing so would mean the end to a terrible curse that plagues the isles of the east and threatens to spread to the shores of Narnia in time.Finding the seven swords grounds the movie more firmly in the epic fantasy genre but it hardly seems necessary. Adding this element to the quest actually changed the dynamic of it. Certainly it sharpened the focus of the dangers they faced making the encounters with spirits and sea serpents seem less random but it also called for changing the order of certain events such as the order in which they visited the various islands. Also it takes the focus off the characters themselves even as the movie tries to bring their personal battles to the forefront at times.These aren't major departures from the book. The same issues are addressed and the storyline is very similar. In the end not much was changed especially not the messages delivered by the Great Lion. That's the important part. The books written over half a century ago endure in large part because of the author C.S. Lewis and the lessons he hoped to teach through his characters. Like the fables of old The Chronicles of Narnia have their share of talking animals but that's just window dressing. What's important is what you can learn from the story itself.Originally appeared at httpfourthdayuniverse.comreports ".

	schema:reviewBody "I personally liked The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe but I wasn't so taken with Prince Caspian while not a bad movie it could have been much better. I love the books The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe was always my personal favourite but Voyage of the Dawn Treader I loved just as much.As for this adaptation of Voyage of the Dawn Treader while not completely perfect it was the best yet for me. It was a little too long however and there is some wooden dialogue at times with Caspian's dialogue not as well fleshed out as it could have been. That said there are some improvements over Prince Caspian. One is Ben Barnes I found him bland and a bit too eager to please in Prince Caspian but here he is much more charismatic and warmer too.The pace is another improvement I found it rather lethargic in the previous two entries particularly in Caspian making the story not as engaging as it should have been but in Voyage of the Dawn Treader the pace is brisker and the story as well as truer in spirit is easier to get into. The direction feels more confident as well.The strengths of the previous two movies are also in abundance. Once again Voyage of the Dawn Treader is visually stunning. The scenery is beautiful with a etheral and almost epic feel particularly in the sweeping action sequences the cinematography is fluid and skillful and the special effects alone are what makes this entry the best of the series so far particularly with Dawn Treader which is gorgeously realised. The score is pleasant to listen to and memorable it doesn't intrude too much and fits well with each scene.The acting is pretty much very good. Georgie Henley has improved hugely having grown in so much confidence although Skandar Keynes isn't quite as enthusiastic this time around though he was decent. Will Poulter is delightfully obnoxious and selfish as Eustace but his character transformation contrasted beautifully towards the end. Reepicheep comes close to stealing the show voiced very well by Simon Pegg Tilda Swinton is still quite chilling in her brief appearance as the White Witch and Aslan is majestically voiced by Liam Neeson. The ending is also very welldone and quite moving.All in all a surprisingly good film and the best of the series so far. 810 Bethany Cox".

The pace is very slow for a fantasyaction movie and at many points the plot seems to go nowhere there's at least half an hour when absolutely nothing happens and when it starts to get interesting guess what the movie is over. On top of that the CGI was very poor for my taste it was nothing close to spectacular.

	schema:headline " Nothing Attached";
	schema:reviewBody "Romantic comedies need a good kick in the pants and an aging Ivan Reitman ain't the guy to do it. No Strings Attached the first of at least three 2011 films about noncommittal sex with Friends with Benefits and Hall Pass in hot pursuit is only sparsely amusing and never insightful. Big surprise. Who would have guessed that a 64yearold director would be the wrong choice for a movie about hip people half his age? No Strings Attached might have been a decent film had it followed through on its premise but that it falls victim to just about every romcom trapping negates the most potentially interesting thing it has going for it.Everyone involved has proved themselves elsewhere. Reitman directed legendary '80s comedies Stripes and Ghostbusters before churning out a string of stinkers including My Super Ex Girlfriend in 2006. Stars Natalie Portman Emma and Ashton Kutcher Adam are similarly defenseless against the lousy script. For my money Portman still put on the best performance of 2010 in Black Swan and by comparison her turn here is particularly disappointing. Kutcher is the weakest link but has consistently proved he can hold his own in otherwise lame duck comedies like Valentine's Day.But between the bad direction worse script and lazy performances No Strings Attached is a triple threat. Its worst blunder is that Emma and Adam's relationship is unbelievable and their chemistry is nonexistent. Fledgling screenwriter Elizabeth Meriwether posits a female lead that flipflops her stance on monogamy every two scenes and Portman doesn't even attempt to sell it. Emma comes off pragmatic one minute and off her rocker the next. It makes less sense still given that her relationship with Adam isn't anything special to begin with. The B romance between Greta Gerwig and Jake M. Johnson friends of our principle couple is actually markedly more naturalistic and compelling. It's a shame they're on screen so infrequently.Meriwether's script is also criminally overlong. Twohour comedies need to die a slow and painful death there's just no reason No Strings Attached should exceed the 100minute mark. What's worse the audience has little expectation for when the film will end. More than once a picturesque finale will align only for Emma to inexplicably get cold feet. Or Adam's father to take ill. The bait and tease might work if the betterlatethannever conclusion defied expectation but in all likelihood you already know exactly how it will end. The biggest surprise is how much melodramatic filler we have to wade through on the way.No Strings Attached like last year's mediocre Love and Other Drugs articulates the pressing need for innovation in Hollywood's romantic comedies. Depicting a relationship built on causal sex isn't especially progressive and Ivan Reitman isn't one of the directors I'm especially interested in seeing discuss sexuality. Then again he barely clears his throat on the subject for a film about sex No Strings Attached is pretty much sterile despite its R rating. Intellectually the film is a solid PG13. Our characters generally don't behave with the nuance expected of two 30yearolds and Meriwether relies on decrepit genre archetypes rather than cause and effect to progress the plot.All told Reitman's latest is unworthy of recommendation despite falling short of being an outright waste of time. It does feature a few genuinely funny moments that help excuse its crippling formula but it never asserts itself or challenges the classic romantic comedy blueprint as much as its premise might indicate. Reitman deserves a kick in the pants every bit as much as the genre.".

Reitman directed legendary '80s comedies Stripes and Ghostbusters before churning out a string of stinkers including My Super Ex Girlfriend in 2006. Stars Natalie Portman Emma and Ashton Kutcher Adam are similarly defenseless against the lousy script. For my money Portman still put on the best performance of 2010 in Black Swan and by comparison her turn here is particularly disappointing. Kutcher is the weakest link but has consistently proved he can hold his own in otherwise lame duck comedies like Valentine's Day.But between the bad direction worse script and lazy performances No Strings Attached is a triple threat. Its worst blunder is that Emma and Adam's relationship is unbelievable and their chemistry is nonexistent. Fledgling screenwriter Elizabeth Meriwether posits a female lead that flipflops her stance on monogamy every two scenes and Portman doesn't even attempt to sell it. Emma comes off pragmatic one minute and off her rocker the next. It makes less sense still given that her relationship with Adam isn't anything special to begin with. The B romance between Greta Gerwig and Jake M. Johnson friends of our principle couple is actually markedly more naturalistic and compelling. It's a shame they're on screen so infrequently.Meriwether's script is also criminally overlong. Twohour comedies need to die a slow and painful death there's just no reason No Strings Attached should exceed the 100minute mark. What's worse the audience has little expectation for when the film will end. More than once a picturesque finale will align only for Emma to inexplicably get cold feet. Or Adam's father to take ill. The bait and tease might work if the betterlatethannever conclusion defied expectation but in all likelihood you already know exactly how it will end. The biggest surprise is how much melodramatic filler we have to wade through on the way.No Strings Attached like last year's mediocre Love and Other Drugs articulates the pressing need for innovation in Hollywood's romantic comedies. Depicting a relationship built on causal sex isn't especially progressive and Ivan Reitman isn't one of the directors I'm especially interested in seeing discuss sexuality. Then again he barely clears his throat on the subject for a film about sex No Strings Attached is pretty much sterile despite its R rating. Intellectually the film is a solid PG13. Our characters generally don't behave with the nuance expected of two 30yearolds and Meriwether relies on decrepit genre archetypes rather than cause and effect to progress the plot.All told Reitman's latest is unworthy of recommendation despite falling short of being an outright waste of time. It does feature a few genuinely funny moments that help excuse its crippling formula but it never asserts itself or challenges the classic romantic comedy blueprint as much as its premise might indicate. Reitman deserves a kick in the pants every bit as much as the genre.";

	schema:reviewBody "Natalie Portman comes out of award season on top with her numerous Best Actress Awards for her performance in Black Swan including the Critic's Choice Award the Golden Globe Award and an Oscar in the near future. Now she takes on the romantic comedy genre for the first time since her 2004 hit Garden State. Her costar Ashton Kutcher on the other hand is no stranger to the romantic comedy genre with most of his recent films falling into this genre Killers Valentine's Day and What Happens In Vegas. Together they create comedy through the awkwardly realistic chemistry between their characters Emma and Adam. Their quirky relationship begins when they are both sexually frustrated teenagers at summer camp. This leads them to becoming acquaintances throughout the early years of their relationship until they are thrown into each other's lives for the last time. Emma is a successful doctor who works eighty hours a week and is not looking for a relationship while Adam is an aspired writer looking for a break working at a gleeish television show. Their latest encounter leads the two into a sexual dilemma as they make a pact to enter into a relationship with No Strings Attaches in other words no commitment just sex. However eventually the strings have to be attached.The best part of the film is the surprisingly accurate and realistic interactions that Emma and Adam together. They are definitely not faking it as they recreate relationship situations by acting weird around each other which is exactly what you do when you are in a relationship. Their supporting cast was also very important to the entertainment of the film and the theme of differentiation between relationships. The most notable character being Kevin Klines portrayal of Adam's father Alvin as he dates his own son's exgirlfriends. The film is all about comedy aspect of all of these relationships and leaves out drama for the most part without totally forgetting about it. This does not change the fact that the film has a very touching ending no matter how clich it is.If it wasn't for the great casting of Portman and Kutcher at the center of the film creating superb chemistry all would be lost among ever other romcom. This is because the film isn't original at all. It is just a basic Hollywoodized picture perfect romantic comedy but sometimes a movie just barely lucks out when a couple stars are able to salvage the overdone clich storyline. Many may say that the film is too similar to the recent release of Love and Other Drugs just a few months ago. However no matter how similar the basic plot structure of these two films is they are very different films. While Love and Other Drugs follows the purely sexual relationship of its two main characters in the same way that No Strings Attached does it also delves into the realms of the genre of drama. On the other hand No Strings Attached avoids those depths and instead relies on the awkward comedy of romantic see it now bliss.".

It may sound like the outline of every Matthew McConaughey film and now it's also the recycled theme of No Strings Attached.Adam Ashton Kutcher is some unspecified assistant on a television show whose father Kevin Kline in what surely is one of his more forgettable roles happens to be an extremely famous actor. He's also completely irresponsible and hedonistic and somehow we're supposed to believe that he'd even bother to get a doctor's note so he could buy medical marijuana. Adam finds out that dad is now dating his bimbo exgirlfriend. Distraught over this Adam goes on a drinking binge that ends up reuniting him with Emma Natalie Portman a gifted doctor in residency in a teaching hospital. They end up in a strictly sexual relationship and you'll figure out exactly how things are going to play out before the wacky sex location montage scene has finished. Emma is fine with this arrangement as she doesn't want to get too close to anyone. Adam wants more. The falling out is inevitable as is the reunion spoiler alert everything works out just fine!.This film follows the romcom playbook to the letter. Emma of course has several roommates one of which is the required effeminate overweight gay guy. Token black guy? That role is played by Ludicrous the friend of Adam that shows up occasionally to give the standard bro you should be banging her advise. And of course the other women in Adam's life are either extremely socially awkward or lesbians. Despite taking place in Los Angeles you'd think it was more like a small town in Iowa the way everyone bumps into each other at the coffee shop or just walking down the street.The jokes tend to fall flat with the funniest scene involving Adam showing up at Emma's apartment with a menstruation mix CD i.e. Sunday Bloody Sunday other blood related songs to entertain her and her fellow suffering roommates one of who remarks that her underwear resembles a crime scene. I should point out that this film was directed by Ivan Reitman who also directed The Ghostbusters. What made him read this screenplay and decide that he must make this film? Every scene goes on just a little too long and some of them don't make any sense. Example when Adam gestures to Lucy the awkward assistant director of the show he works on to sit down she looks at the chair and says oh look a chair pauses and then sits down. What was the point of that? Ed Wood films had better editing that this. None of the characters are remotely likable and most are barely more than ugly stereotypes.Unless you really need to hear some jokes about Ashton Kutcher's penis pass on this one. This movie will be in the five dollar bin at WalMart in six months. And at that price you'd still be better off with a random McConaughey romcom instead.".

And why are we watching?However in the 2nd half Emma and Adam took a break and thus a somewhat normal movie broke out. Problem was that one of them was falling in love with the other so a stop had to be called. Two classy actors and this is all they can come up with? The title should have been Friends With Benefits for a clearer notion of what was inside. When one doesn't care about the characters what is the point?Violence No. Sex Yes. Nudity Partial Sex talk Abounds in the first half. Language Yes.";

	schema:reviewBody "No Strings Attached works precisely for one reason its script. Paramount Pictures the studio backing the film allowed the script to be R rated meaning that grown up words the ones that are four letters and need to be bleeped out from standard radio and television could be said. For a film that is about casual sexone that tries to portray its characters as realisticthese words need to be included in the characters' dialogue. So yes thank you Paramount for allowing the script to be R rated.The plot centers on two characters who have been friends for many years seeing each other only once in a while over that timeframe. We see each encounter through flashbacks right at the beginning of the film. Eventually we move to the present where Emma Natalie Portman has moved into the same city as Adam Ashton Kutcher. They meet up and decide that they should hang out some time.Adam ended a relationship with his girlfriend months ago and one day finds out that his father is now dating the same girl. After some razzing by his friends he decides to drunkenly call every girl's number that is in his cell phone in hopes that one of them will have sex with him.He eventually passes out waking up naked in the company of four people one of which happens to be Emma. They end up having sex and decide to be sex buddies. They won't be in a formal relationship but they will call one another up if they are in the mood so to speak. If either character starts to actually feel attraction for the other they would call this agreement off and move on with their lives. No feelings would be involved in their interactions with one another and therefore there would be none hurt of things went sour.Where's the conflict? is a question that you might be thinking to yourself right now. Well that comes from one of the characters no I won't tell you which developing feelings for the other. The rest of the film focuses on the characters' relationship following this revelation.If you are now thinking to yourself that you know almost exactly how the movie ends well then you aren't alone. Just by the trailer for No Strings Attached it's not difficult to figure out the film's conclusion. It won't throw many curveballs your way throughout and is overall fairly predictable with only a couple twists that are really any bit surprising. And even those are only surprising because of their timing not because of what the twist actually was.Although I'll admit that I didn't want the film to end. I liked the characters and I wanted to continue to see what would happen to them. In fact when No Strings Attached finally did wrapup I think they chose the wrong point to end it. It ends on a little bit of a cliffhanger where as if it finished earlier that wouldn't have happened.As a matter of fact the ending was actually the worst part of the film just because it didn't really give a solid conclusion to the story. And no I'm not hoping for a sequel even though one is definitely possible. Does that information make you secondguess how you think the film will end? It probably shouldn't.Anyway thanks to the Rrated script the characters actually felt believable and realistic. They still suffer from some of the flaws that come from being in a romantic comedy mainly their awkward interactions with almost everyone and their somewhat idealistic nature but that comes with the territory. They are both likable characters who are actually fair well acted for this kind of thing.Natalie Portman especially gives a very solid performance actually being the more energetic person in the duo. Ashton Kutcher is someone I've been told isn't a very good actor and while I didn't feel he was great sometimes not really seeming 100 onboard with what he was supposed to be doing he was competent as the more reserved Adam. The pair had an easygoing chemistry and because of the script felt real enough to believe in.Thanks to the characters being believable and likable when the film tries to make you emotional it succeeds. You want to see both characters happy and when they aren't you feel sad yourself. When things go right you almost want to cheer although it doesn't work quite that well. You'll feel emotion but not enough to actually bring it out of you. This isn't a tearjerker or a feelgood film despite having moments that come close to these levels.No what No Strings Attached tries to do most is to make you laugh. And it will do so as it is a very funny film. The aforementioned awkward moments and timing are quite charming the dialogue will make you laugh and even some of the situations sadly many of them ruined in the trailer will make you chuckle. It isn't really a laughoutloud film but one that will make you laugh quietly to yourself every now and then bringing out a fullblown laugh.I liked No Strings Attached probably more than I rightfully should have. Regardless I did enjoy it having a good time while watching it. The characters were likable the plot while predictable was fun to watch and the film was on the whole pretty funny. It doesn't do anything new to the romantic comedy genre but it's an entertaining film that will give you a good time at the theatre and that's really all you can ask for.".

I was correct about the overall story line but impressively the writers found a way the mix in enough comedy to keep you entertained for the full 110 minutes. On top of that there is enough cutsie romance to make for the perfect date night movie. Comedy to make you laugh and romance to cheer up any romantic girl.... sounds like a romantic comedy to me!Natalie Portman shows her range of acting abilities by having two extremely different films in theaters at the same time. I was thoroughly impressed with her ability to drop the comedic one liners and portray a unaffectionate woman who's fallen in love realistically. Comparing this to her awardwinning role in Black Swan made her abilities even more impressive. I cannot say the same for Ashton Kutcher. He has a great face and is great at comedic acting. However each serious romantic scene he was in became unrealistic and uncomfortable. Overall this is the perfect date night or girls night movie. It has some great comedic moments and brings in the romance that most ladies love to see. If you are looking for a lighthearted romantic comedy this is a great choice.See more reviews at httpburningreview.blogspot.com".

No one scene or moment merits more then a minor chuckle but the characters themselves expand and grow as the story unfolds. It's hard to care about the leads at first because there's no set up or real establishment of character. Then they kind of grow on you even though neither really rang true for me in any real world sense. Natalie Portman is great as many would expect but Ashton Kutcher did a fine job as well. I've seen others criticizing his performance but I think that's based on a predetermined hatred of him rather than on his work. The supporting characters were VERY weak and useless save for the father character played by the wonderful Kevin Kline. Overall better than I was expecting it to be.".

The funeral is at the beginning all in the same family of her father. While the title is as banal as can be it aptly describes the essence in this romcom.

In Love and other drugs however there is a good reason a disease that will mean tremendous sacrifice on the part of the loved one. Here Emma's resistance is not even explained with any particularly painful previous experience and is therefore not too convincing. But never mind. This is not a logicaldeduction whodunit mystery but rather a Valentine escapade and as such perfectly adequate.To begin with it has probably one of the most important ingredients of a romcom two leads are goodlooking and can act the part. Playing Adam Ashton Kutcher comes with impressive credentials from Valentine's day which although an ensemble type of flick clearly had him and Jennifer Garner topbilled. For Portman this is of course not Black Swan. But with full professional respect for the movie she puts in an honest and earnest effort. Chemistry? While evident throughout the movie the last scene is particularly convincing testimony.The plot line is simplicity itself two people agreed on having sex as their only relationship sex friends fxxx buddies are two terminologies employed in the movie end up along the inevitable path of falling in love. All the rest of the movie coming with a large supporting cast is just bells and whistles. While everyone did a good job I'll mention two in particular and there's a reason for it. Following the popular formula the movie brings the couple to the final stage of something going wrong. True to this formula the turnaround point is triggered by someone close. For Adam it's his father for Emma her sister.Kevin Kline looking splendid as ever at 64 plays the 58yearold father with muscles to spare. This is a pivotal character  by sleeping Adam's exgirlfriend he prompts his rueful son into seeking a sexual relationship ANY sexual relationship while propels the rest of the story. He even did a number with his own piano accompaniment immediately bringing back sounds and images from Delovely 2004.If you have seen New York I love you it's unlikely that you will forget lovely Olivia Thirlby in one of the most entertaining segments of that starstudded collection of tales from New York. Here she plays the sister whose wedding is the trigger point to Emma finally breaking free from her selfimposed inhibitions. She role is smaller than Kline's and one can't help hoping that she had more to do in this movie.My concluding remark has to be a salute to the movie's salute to Peanuts. The mere reference brings so much joy  Great Scott the Great Pumpkin and there's even a character named Lucy! Good grief!!".

That coupled with the fact that this film seemed very similar to another terrible film I saw recently 'The Ugly Truth' starring Katherine Heigl and Gerald Butler. It's like we've run out of ideas and we're just coasting on the past ideas of others hoping something hits and works for the next set of coasters to come along and rehash our own copied ideas. The scary part is that this film was a hit people so you can expect more like it coming to a theater near you sooner than you think.

	schema:reviewBody "After the announcement that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was getting an Englishlanguage film treatment I decided that the hype had built up to a point where I just had to read the source material for myself. Though it is not without flaws Dragon Tattoo is an excellent story with the important mission of raising awareness concerning violence against women. Mere days after finishing the book I watched the Swedish film. The hype train had me excited for an outstanding thriller. The hype train let me down.I was left cold and somewhat irritated by the Swedish adaptation. A ton of important plot elements were left out some were inexplicably added Blomkvist's memories of the island became far too important and contrived and Rapace felt all wrong as Lisbeth. She was brilliant and violent but lacked the quiet pensiveness of the original character. She did not come off as autistic and emotionally disturbed just bratty and rude. Worst of all I was constantly confused by the extremely rushed strange new take on the story. As a lover of foreign films I normally grind my teeth when I hear that America is developing a remake. However I found myself desperate for this one. I needed a movie that actually gave me the experience of reading the book for the first time that made me care for Lisbeth and that truly disturbed me. Thankfully the American adaptation not a remake delivered exactly what I was looking for. Those who say this version is unnecessary or a rehash must have seen a very different Swedish Girl with the Dragon Tattoo than I saw. The American take is jampacked with scenes that were either skimmed or completely left out of the Swedish version. Yet despite being more robust the English language Dragon Tattoo is incredibly paced feeling less rushed yet hitting all the important plot points. The characters have time to develop and grow on you the cluefinding makes more sense and the killer is more horrifying. Screenwriter Zaillian knows exactly what to leave out and what to change though the ending which mirrors the book's ending could have been arranged better. Craig Mara and even Plummer are spoton in their roles and feel more fleshedout as characters. Mara in particular inhabits Larsson's Lisbeth in a way Rapace did not. She captures Lisbeth's silent borderlineautistic nature perfectly. Her fragile body and alien appearance even match the book's description. She allows herself to be vulnerable but clearly regrets it over time. It's a captivating performance.If someone were to ask me personally which version to see I would have to say without hesitation that this is the rare occasion where the American adaptation is superior. I did not think it was possible to stay so true to the story under three hours.".

	schema:headline " She's Not as Interesting as Her SwedishSpeaking Counterpart";
	schema:reviewBody "Watching the original Swedish version of The Girl with the Dragon  Tattoo I was actively engaged with its dual story lines but I also  found myself pondering which of the two was the more important. Now  that David Fincher has made an Englishlanguage remake I find myself  pondering what went wrong. Here is a mystery thriller so cold so  distant and so lacking in energy that it feels neither mysterious nor  thrilling. It follows the plot of the original film fairly closely and  yet it makes a number of small changes that drastically affect its  credibility. I'm also stumped by the curious decision to retain the  Swedish setting. If you have gone to the trouble of casting  Englishspeaking actors it seems only fitting that you should change  the story's location to somewhere more appropriate say America or  Britain.  Adapted from the novel by Stieg Larsson the title is a description of  goth chick Lisbeth Salander Rooney Mara an emotionally walledoff  computer hacker who works for a security company. In the original film  we got only scraps of her back story and yet just enough was given to  pique our interest. We were challenged to read her. Who was she? What  had she gone through? What led up to a disturbing watershed moment seen  only in flashback? In this remake her back story doesn't even amount  to crumbs. That watershed moment is altogether removed as is a  significant chunk of her family history. Because of this we're no  longer compelled to probe her mind to try and understand why she is  the way she is. All we see is a girl in her early twenties in serious  need of an attitude adjustment.  She was hired to investigate a former reporter turned magazine  publisher named Mikael Blomkvist Daniel Craig who lost a libel case  against a powerful billionaire. Although he must pay a serious amount  in damages he insists that he was set up. Lisbeth is inclined to  agree her investigative work turned up nothing incriminating. Not long  after the trial Mikael is hired by a man named Dirch Frode Steven  Berkoff on behalf of his employer Henrik Vanger Christopher  Plummer the former CEO of a family industry. Now retired on a  familyowned island off the mainland he asks two things of Mikael To  write a memoir about the Vanger clan and to investigate the case of his  greatniece Harriet who disappeared in 1966 when she was only a  teenager. Henrik is convinced she was murdered and that her killer is  a member of his family with whom he does not get along.  Needing an assistant Mikael is directed towards Lisbeth who has just  worked her way of a particularly nasty situation with her new guardian  a sadistic sexual pervert Yorick van Wageningen who kept strict  control of her finances. As she and Mikael dig deeper into the mystery  they must make sense of a series of numbers Harriet wrote in a  notebook all of which are paired with initials. What do they mean? How  do they connect to a series of murders spread across time and distance  all involving young women? And in what way does Henrik's family factor  in? Watching the original film I anxiously awaited the moment the  mystery would be solved. That's because as contrived as it was there  was at least the sense that the filmmakers were interested in their own  material. The same cannot be said about this new film. There's no  urgency about it.  I think much of the blame rests on the updated screenplay by Steven  Zaillian which awkwardly intertwines dark and twisted scenarios with  an undercurrent of dry wit. When Henrik first meets Mikael for  example we find that the former is almost jovial  not at all  appropriate given his sad situation. Certain scenes from the original  film were intense and yet they always felt as if they were character  driven. That's not the case here most of the intense scenes including  when Lisbeth spontaneously decides to have sex with Mikael are  overproduced as if the intention was to be sensational. The most  glaring misfire is the inclusion of a stray cat. I don't need to spell  out what happens to it. I will say however that this plot device is  so overused that it has long since ceased to be symbolic. Now it's just  cruel and disgusting.  Little touches such as Mikael's affair with his magazine coworker  Robin Wright and his relationship with his religious teenage daughter  Josefin Asplund contribute absolutely nothing to the story apart  from a surplus of characters. And then there's the ending which is  really more of an epilogue as it involves events unrelated to the case  of Harriet Vanger. In the original film it was a brief couple of  scenes that tied up a few loose ends. Here it goes on much longer than  it should. I'm usually the first to give remakes the benefit of the  doubt. It's certainly not my style to make endless comparisons between  old and new versions of the same story. But in the case of The Girl  with the Dragon Tattoo I just can't help myself. I'll make this easy  on you See the original instead of the remake. Quite simply the  original is better.   Chris Pandolfi".

	schema:headline " The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo Another Winner From David Fincher!";
	schema:reviewBody "The lights dim the movie begins with a brief prologue and the zany and incredibly weird opening credits begin set to a creepy cover of Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song. From the beginning we are in for a wild ride as Stieg Larsson's incredibly popular novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is brought to life on screen.Scorned journalist Mikael Blomkvist is called upon by Henrik Vanger a very wealthy man while writing a book. Vanger is in search of an answer to the disappearance of his niece Harriet which occurred over 40 years ago. He assumes that Harriet is dead and that she was murdered. He looks to Mikael to investigate her disappearance and who killed her. Then Mikael gets assistance from Lisbeth Salander a dangerous but intelligent 24 yearold punk who is an accomplished computer hacker and a great contribution to the solving of other crimes. Together Mikael and Lisbeth go on a dark eerie journey into a world of crime Nazism and corruption that will lead them to Harriet's assassin.I walked into The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo with almost no knowledge of Larsson's novel or the Swedish film made a few years before David Fincher's version. The end result is ultimately an extremely satisfying brutal and complex thriller thanks to great direction by Fincher known greatly for his work on Seven The Game and The Social Network excellent writing and an impeccably chosen cast.After only a few years the character of Lisbeth Salander has become an attentiongrabbing heroine that is as iconic as Edward Cullen of the loveitorhateit Twilight series. And we can understand why. After all the truly awful and hideous things that have plagued her life Lisbeth doesn't take any crap from anybody. She may be angry violent overtly sexual demanding and perhaps a little crazy but she is a genius at what she does and has reasons for all of her actions no matter how gruesome they may be.The mystery surrounding the film is sophisticated and whiteknuckling adding to the intensity and mood of the story and its characters. We're not sure of who is Harriet's killer or if Harriet is even dead until the last half hour of the film and when we do find out the twist it leaves a stupendous impact.After cementing his reputation in brutal crime thrillers and surprising us with The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and The Social Network David Fincher was the right man for the director's chair. Every film he makes even a drama like The Social Network sets up a tone of genuine suspense tension and fear for the characters. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo isn't any different as Fincher adds his signature touch to the movie.Of all of the people they could have chosen to play these roles the casting director landed in a pot of gold. Daniel Craig does a wonderful job as Mikael showing us that he can play characters other than James Bond. With the amount of screen time she has Robin Wright is also very good as Blomkvist's business partner Erika Berger. Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsgrd also turn in great performances as Henrik Vanger and Martin Vanger.The person to really watch out for however is Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. Getting her big break in the underrated remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street and later starring in Fincher's previous film The Social Network giving a dynamite performance in the opening scene Mara has sealed her future with many more promising and exciting roles because of her portrayal of Lisbeth. This is not an easy role to play knowing that Mara is the second person to play the character. She must endure two shocking rape scenes and a torture sequence and there is a hefty amount of nudity involved. Mara embodies Lisbeth immediately bringing immense intimidation danger and fury every time she comes on to the screen. Her eyes are wide and emotionless almost as if you can see right through her. And with everything that has happened to the character we understand that Lisbeth has a right to be that way. She may be smart but she is not interested in attraction or friendships with another human being. Overall Mara gives a sensational fearless dedicated and electrifying performance that guarantees an Oscar nod.Being released during the cheery time of the holidays The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is not a feelgood film by any means. It is a harsh gritty and rough cinema trip that answers the question of leaving the kids at home with the babysitter. Also if you're squeamish you will not like it. However those who have read the book and those who have not read it should check it out. Even without having read Larsson's novel I left the theater completely satisfied. It is a movie experience that you don't commonly get. Fincher has done it again. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a must!".

Daniel Craig does a wonderful job as Mikael showing us that he can play characters other than James Bond. With the amount of screen time she has Robin Wright is also very good as Blomkvist's business partner Erika Berger. Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsgrd also turn in great performances as Henrik Vanger and Martin Vanger.The person to really watch out for however is Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. Getting her big break in the underrated remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street and later starring in Fincher's previous film The Social Network giving a dynamite performance in the opening scene Mara has sealed her future with many more promising and exciting roles because of her portrayal of Lisbeth. This is not an easy role to play knowing that Mara is the second person to play the character. She must endure two shocking rape scenes and a torture sequence and there is a hefty amount of nudity involved. Mara embodies Lisbeth immediately bringing immense intimidation danger and fury every time she comes on to the screen. Her eyes are wide and emotionless almost as if you can see right through her. And with everything that has happened to the character we understand that Lisbeth has a right to be that way. She may be smart but she is not interested in attraction or friendships with another human being. Overall Mara gives a sensational fearless dedicated and electrifying performance that guarantees an Oscar nod.Being released during the cheery time of the holidays The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is not a feelgood film by any means. It is a harsh gritty and rough cinema trip that answers the question of leaving the kids at home with the babysitter. Also if you're squeamish you will not like it. However those who have read the book and those who have not read it should check it out. Even without having read Larsson's novel I left the theater completely satisfied. It is a movie experience that you don't commonly get. Fincher has done it again. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a must!";

His flaws are laid bare and he shows himself to be much more detached than emotional.Swedish  This is the good guy side of Mikael. He is sensitive caring and smart. He shows a protective side when it comes to Lisbeth. Physically speaking the Swedish Blomkvist doesn't look as sturdy as his American counterpart. He has a gut and appears to be quite a bit older than Lisbeth which can make the relationship between them more shudder inducing and probably accounts for why there are fewer sex scenes between them in the Swedish version. LISBETH SALANDERAmerican  Perhaps because Blomkvist was made into such a strong character Lisbeth was then morphed into a more withdrawn and vulnerable girl so as to complement the new Blomkvist. She still has attitude aggression and rage but she also exhibits a quiet shy side that was not in the original as well as more of a romantic side.Swedish  In this version Lisbeth is not shy not gentle and not nice. She doesn't chase Blomkvist  he chases her. She perfectly embodies everything you think of when you think of a strong female lead and has an unpredictability and edge to her that is exciting to watch. Her dragon tattoo is much much better.OVERALL I liked the American Mikael and the Swedish Lisbeth. While I may prefer a scene or two from the Swedish version such as the ending overall I enjoyed the American version more. On the flip side I can understand why some may hate this version because Lisbeth was their favorite character and she's been changed into something they don't like. For me the modifications to Lisbeth's character weren't severe enough to put me off.The Swedish version captured a cult following for a reason and I would recommend both to anyone who has an interest in darker gritty movies that have a raw intensity to them. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo isn't for the faint of heart and that's what I love about it!".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. The character of Lisbeth Salander absolutely fascinates me. That's true whether we are discussing Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy novels the Swedish film versions or this latest film version from director David Fincher and a screenplay from Steve Zaillian. It's also true whether Lisbeth is played on screen by Noomi Rapace Swedish films or Rooney Mara. She is a brilliant character hiding in plain sight from a world that has fiercely mistreated her and now misjudges and underestimates her. She is the oddest heroine I can recall ... and I can't get enough of her.Let's start with the source material. Stieg Larsson's books are far from perfect but addictive just the same. The first book on which this film is based is at its core a simple whodunnit presented in a manner that is claustrophobic paranoid and eerie. Moving on to this particular film we find the director and screenplay holding the basic tone while making a few changes ... some minor others more substantial. These changes may irk those fans who are a bit more loyal to the books but Fincher surely wanted to offer more than a simple retelling of the story.Daniel Craig plays Mikael Blomkvist the journalist hired to solve the 40 year old mystery of the disappearancemurder of Harriet Vanger niece to Swedish millionaire Henrik Vanger Christopher Plummer. To research Blomkvist must dig into the Vanger's rotten family tree of Nazis antiSemites sexual predators antisocial fanatics and a few just plain loony birds. You can imagine how excited this rich and once powerful family is to have someone uncovering long buried secrets. Circumstances allow for Lisbeth to assist Blomkvist in researching this.Unlike many mysteries where assembling the clues is the most fun the real heart of this story is the odd somewhat uncomfortable developing relationship between Blomkvist and Lisbeth. This latest version allows this to develop relatively smoothly but it nonetheless rattles our senses. We see the subtle changes in Lisbeth as she slowly opens up to the idea of a real friendship based on trust. Fear not mystery fans the Vanger clan still provides more than enough juice to keep any film sleuth happy.It's truly impossible to avoid comparisons between the two movie versions and the respective casts. It's quite obvious Mr. Fincher was working with a substantially greater budget than Niels Arden Opler had for the first Swedish film. While they are both enthralling I actually lean a bit towards the rawer original. That takes nothing away from this latest version. Same with Noomi Rapace vs. Rooney Mara. Ms. Mara is excellent in her performance and I was fully satisfied but Ms. Rapace brought a rougher edge to the role ... one that made it even tougher to crack that shell. The biggest difference in the casts is Daniel Craig against Michael Nyqvist. Mr. Craig is just a bit too cool for the role while Nyqvist captured the insecurity and vulnerability that Larsson wrote about.All of that is nitpicking. Both film versions are sterling entertainment and hopefully the Fincher version will bring the story to a much wider audience. I would encourage those that are interested to check out the Swedish version as well as the Larsson books. Maybe that will explain my fascination with this creature known as Lisbeth Salander.".

Whether its sweeping shots of freezing snow covered Sweden or wonderfully eerie interiors Fincher creates an unsettling atmosphere that is unrelenting and technically perfect. With Fincher i've learnt to expect a beautifully shot film and this is no exception within this film are some of his greatest images. Regarding the disturbing nature of some scenes Fincher is wise enough to show them in all their horror but doesn't stop to linger or exploit.The performances are perfect all round Its clear Fincher and the casting production went to great lengths to pick not only great actors but those who embody the very essence of their characters. Of note in the supporting characters are Yorick van Wageningen who plays the sadistic Bjurman with unsettling believability and the always great Christopher plummer who is noteperfect as the desperate loney grandfather Henrik . As one part of our central duo Daniel Craig puts in his finest performance normally cast as the tough hero Craig is more subdued here he has Blomkvist easy charm down to a T but also captures the weak submissive aspect of his character.  Lisbeth Salander is a character unlike anything fiction has ever seen.brokenpierced clade in leather with short black hair and a body so slight the wind could break her she is horribly victimised but refuses to be one. To sum it up she is one of the most interesting and difficult characters an actress could ever play. I could honestly write a whole review on the brilliance of Rooney Mara's performance she is the very essence of Lisbethas if the character just walked off the page. Mara commands every scene with a mixture of silent burning rage and a deep rooted venerability. Her eyes are the heart of the film her reactions are the reason myself and the others around me laughed gasped and even cried. The character requires an actress who can internalize her emotions yet at the same time convay a wide range of feelings. Mara does this such perfect skill every glance is charged with deep feeling as if you're looking directly into her soul. A brave performance Mara bares all in the nude scenes and goes to frankly horribly dark places in the now informous scenes of sexual violence. Watching Rooney Mara is witnessing the birth of a star this is the best performance of the year and if the Oscars fail to reconzie her i will lose all hope in their judgment. The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is perfect eerie and unsettling. It is as good as their Oscar winning score last year if not better its more understated and does what every score should do....improves the scenes not overpower them.This is by and large a perfect adaptation my main issue lay with one singe sequence. There is a shot that seems to be there solely for the purpose of showing off it serves no real purpose within the story. The most touching scenes of the film come from the characters themselves this is a character driven story and none are more powerful than Lisbeth and Mikeal themselves. Fincher makes their relationship the focus and it pays off they are the heart of the books and Fincher rightfully recognises this. Proving that sometimes american adaptations can actually be for the better this is a film nobody should miss...its everything the novel is plus some. More than anything i was impressed by the humour that is added throughout this film will make you laugh it will break your heart and it will make you want to take a shower.".

	schema:reviewBody "David Fincher's remake of TGWTDT has enough to keep the film steady on its feet but lacks a horde of specific qualities from Oplev's excellent effort. Firstly in a basic mystery story there is a need to present a series of twists and discoveries that lead to solving the mystery. Fincher's film fails to present this trail of bread crumbs in the same enticing way that Oplev's did. Instead we get a fast forward hyperspace logic jump when Blomkvist's daughter out of nowhere points out the vital clue that breaks the case and then all related info is collected by Lisbeth in 5 minutes. Secondly the following characters were shadows of themselves in the Fincher version 1. Lisbeth Salander 2. Henrik Vanger 3. Martin Vanger 4. Bjurman The actors weren't horrible but they were not as good as the ones in the Swedish version. Lastly there were key omissions and changes which for me were completely inexplicable and confusing. 1. Lisbeth's past father etc. was one or two lines of dialog. 2. Harriet Vanger in London? 3. Vanger does not tell Blomkvist that he knew Harriet.It all adds up to a disappointing attempt to recreate the dark energy of Oplev's film. And the opening sequence was like a Tool video mixed with bad James Bond.".

	onyx:emotionText "David Fincher's remake of TGWTDT has enough to keep the film steady on its feet but lacks a horde of specific qualities from Oplev's excellent effort. Firstly in a basic mystery story there is a need to present a series of twists and discoveries that lead to solving the mystery. Fincher's film fails to present this trail of bread crumbs in the same enticing way that Oplev's did. Instead we get a fast forward hyperspace logic jump when Blomkvist's daughter out of nowhere points out the vital clue that breaks the case and then all related info is collected by Lisbeth in 5 minutes. Secondly the following characters were shadows of themselves in the Fincher version 1. Lisbeth Salander 2. Henrik Vanger 3. Martin Vanger 4. Bjurman The actors weren't horrible but they were not as good as the ones in the Swedish version. Lastly there were key omissions and changes which for me were completely inexplicable and confusing. 1. Lisbeth's past father etc. was one or two lines of dialog. 2. Harriet Vanger in London? 3. Vanger does not tell Blomkvist that he knew Harriet.It all adds up to a disappointing attempt to recreate the dark energy of Oplev's film. And the opening sequence was like a Tool video mixed with bad James Bond.";

	schema:reviewBody "I checked the spoiler box but I find it hard to believe that anyone interested in this movie has not read the book or seen the Swedish version. And frankly I can't understand the glowing reviews from critics and praise for Rooney Mara's performance. Did they read the book or see the Swedish version? First the good. I did like the ending better than the Swedish version. It was closer to the book and necessary to set up Lisbeth's antagonism toward Bloomkvist in the second book. But I wonder if they were even thinking about a possible second film because they dragged at least 2 key scenes from the second book into this film one being Lisbeth's confrontation of Bjurman about the possible tattoo removal.Now for the bad. As created by Larsson in the book and as portrayed by Noomi Rapace in the Swedish version Lisbeth was an angry fearless outsider determined to live life on her terms. As portrayed by Mara Lisbeth is a waif unable to cope with life making her outbursts of violence both puzzling and unexpected. In the book it is clear that Lisbeth was the stronger character but that's not the way Mara portrays her. That is the crux of the problem with this movie and probably the reason for the glowing reviews. A waiflike Lisbeth is much less threatening to the male reviewers than a strong fearless one.In the book Lisbeth took charge in tough situations she certainly didn't need to ask permission from Bloomkvist. The portrayal of Lisbeth as directed by Fincher and as portrayed by Mara is a huge disappointment and not true to the character in the book at all.There were other missteps in this version as well. Daniel Craig seemed removed and disinterested. He seemed to be walking through the performance giving little emotion. Maybe Craig just can't play a role that makes him subordinate to a woman or maybe Fincher can't conceive of a film like that. In the Swedish version Bjurman was a frightening character who exuded an aura of threat. In contrast the character of Bjurman in Fincher's movie seemed more of an overgrown adolescent who relished his position of authority.Both versions played freely with the timeline of the book and by dropping or including different subplots. But the dropping of the Kalle Bloomkvist nickname that was so prominent in the books is curious. Again Lisbeth used it as an ironic nickname to express her disdain for Bloomkvist something that the waif Lisbeth couldn't do. Granted it didn't play as big of a role in the first book but if you were thinking of a trilogy it was needed to set up the later films. I also didn't understand the inclusion of a daughter for Bloomkvist. It served no purpose and was not in the book.Overall if you are a fan of the book and liked the way Lisbeth was imagined by Larsson you will be disappointed by the movie. If you feel threatened by a strong independent woman then you will appreciate the way Fincher has castrated his version of Lisbeth. This was not as good as the Swedish version which presented a film much closer in tone to the book.".

	schema:headline " Great movie that more than well lives up to the book!";
	schema:reviewBody "I have read all three of Stieg Larsson's books and seen the Swedish movies. The Swedish version of The girl with the dragon tattooMn som hatar kvinnor was very good but I feel it is somewhat overrated. Nothing particularly weak about it but still not as good as some claim. When word came about that David Fincher would direct the new one I was just overjoyed. My maybe favourite director working right now filming one of the best books I had read in years. With thrillers like Se7en and Zodiac to his credit he was the perfect choice. And he doesn't disappoint.The big question for many have been will Rooney Mara live up to Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander? The answer is She does! Who is better is difficult to say because they actually play the character quite different. Noomi is older and seems more secure and determined character while Mara feels more fragile and emotional. I feel Mara is more like how Lisbeth is described in the book. I like this movie better but regarding Lisbeth Salander it's a draw. Daniel Craig is great as Blomkvist and it's good that even if he is a big starJames Bond he plays the role really down to earth the person the character should be. It is and should be Salander who is the main one and he lets Mara be the star. One actor who really surpasses his predecessor is Stellan Skarsgrd. Considering his character has such a big role this is a big plus for the American version. Christopher Plummer should also be mentioned. As I'm now on the actors I should also mention the relation between Salander and Blomkvist. Craig and Mara are brilliant at creating chemistry. Not only does one focus on the mystery but at the end maybe even more about them. Do they really speak with a Swedish accent? Some of them yes and I admit it felt a bit strange a first but one gets used to it like with most other things so some time later in the movie I didn't mind anymore. Steven Zaillian deserves praise for the script. The original movie even though it was not much shorter the plot at times felt rushed. Especially the ending where it went so quick and simplified. Zaillian succeeds in fitting the story without making it to fast or simple. Even if one hasn't read the book you can follow what is going on. Very impressive and perhaps what lifted this movie above the Swedish. So there are some changes but for me unlike how some feel about adaptations the book isn't something holy and changes don't have to be wrong. Stieg Larsson's novel was not without flaws and the changes they made make sense necessary and some better. Fincher is a master of suspense and shows it again here. The atmosphere and tone of the settings fit the story perfect. The movie is brutal just like the book and also that is handled great. Neither reduced or overdone. The music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is as expected amazing. Almost as great as for The Social Network. I loved the opening credits set to the tones of the Immigrant Song cover. Some may feel it's a bit out of place but personally I loved it. So are there any weak points in it? Well the last parts of the movie the story slows down somewhat but thats because Stieg Larsson's novel was like that and those parts are also needed for the continuing of the series. And even if I really like the Millennium trilogy the story is not perfect not as complicated as some might expect. Doesn't mess with your head like Se7en. If I'm to rank David Fincher's detective thrillers The girl with the dragon tattoo is below Se7en and Zodiac but it doesn't mean it is a weak movie definitely not! I don't think I can find much they could have done better. The Swedish movie was good but this is much better. It lives up to my expectations as a fan of the book. Also works great as a thriller on it's own.".

	schema:headline " A superb and chilling thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "I've never read Stieg Larsson's millennium novels so I can't say how  faithful this film is to the original material but I am a big fan of  the Swedish adaptation by Danish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev. Now I  know the fact that Hollywood is obsessed with remakes annoys the hell  out of us but I think there can always be room for different  interpretation different vision and approach and that's what David  Fincher's version excels in. It's more detailed more curious and more  unafraid. It's a superb and chilling thriller with an astounding  performance by Rooney Mara. Whether or not this version is better can  be argued but it certainly is a solid film   Rooney Mara with her skinny body and goth hairstyle and excessive  piercings and tattoos and her attitude I think Mara manages to give a  more complex Lisbeth Salander than Noomi Rapace's portrayal. But it's  mostly thanks to screenwriter Steven Zaillian who covers information  that the previous adaptation would simply skim or just talk about  instead of exposing it. Fincher and Zaillian want to seriously show how  dark troubled but motivated Lisbeth is. And some may consider this  approach to be too brutal or unnecessary but I think it's no more  brutal than Fincher's previous thrillers like Se7en. This is after all  in its essence a movie made solely for Fincher's fans or those who are  comfortable with his style. Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography work is  fantastic by the way it plays on how much you can handle. It goes  along with the script that tends to be explanatory. Whatever loopholes  or gaps that the previous adaptation had Fincher's film fills it and  explains it in its own way.  Lisbeth Salander to me is a rebel she lives by her own rules but  she's also by herself this version wants to instill in her mind the  idea that perhaps she could be sociable or she could be considered  normal if she just gets that attention that she never did and that's  what warrants a different ending. Mara is absolutely phenomenal as  Lisbeth it's a defining role for Mara she's made it her own. She's  fierce highly driven but there's a sense of innocence to her as well.  She thinks her anger and actions are justified and the film  successfully encourages us to agree.  All those tattoos and piercings are like 'keep off' or 'stay away'  sign perhaps because of years of rough background going from one  guardian to another so when somebody genuine like Mikael Blomkvist  Daniel Craig comes along he represents the safety that desperately  longs for but would never admit to. I think it's smart that Fincher and  Zailian shows the estranged family side of Blomkvist they see it as  important for Blomkvist to be able to relate to Henrik Vanger's  Christopher Plummer dilemma and I think that's a smart move. Craig is  the weakest link because his accent keeps going on and off I'm not  sure if he even tries to sound Swedish at all it's quite the  distraction. But he works with what's given to him keep in mind that  the title is not Blomkvist with the dragon tattoo.  Of course nowadays you can't talk about Fincher's movies without  talking a bit about the unconventional score by Oscar winners Atticus  Ross and Nine Inch Nail's Trent Reznor. In fact the movie pays an  amusing homage to NIN. Those of you film score aficionados would  probably find Ross and Reznor's tunes for this film rather eerie and  chilling which it then pretty much serve its purpose. Having said  that at times I find the score a bit forceful and it's like the same  soundwave echoing over and over again with the intent to hypnotize. I  don't think the opening graphic credit is all that impressive it's an  interesting take but it looks out of place it looks like it should be  a separate music video and it doesn't necessarily introduce the tone of  the film that you're about to see.  THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is definitely not a movie for the faint  of heart it's a movie that would rattle your comfort cage and I think  audiences will be divided you'll either truly love it or truly detest  it but there will hardly be a middle ground.".

	schema:headline " My Review For The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo";
	schema:reviewBody "I was really looking forward to The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo ever since I learned that David Fincher had been attached to it. Now normally I'd be angry at the fact of a foreign film being remade having seen and loved the Swedish version of the film but I made an exception with this one because of the cast and crew for this film. Fincher who directed films such as Fight Club The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button and most recently The Social Network my favorite film of 2010 and what I thought should have won over The King's Speech has a fantastic eye for filmmaking and has always impressed me with his movies save for Se7en which I wasn't as huge a fan of as everyone else was and even on that film I enjoyed a good bit. You throw in the writer of Schindler's List and Gangs Of New York add actors like Daniel Craig Rooney Mara Christopher Plummer and so many others a score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross who also scored The Social Network and base it off the best selling book by Stieg Larsson that's right this isn't a remake but rather a readaptation it all equals out to in my opinion the best film of the year by far.Now the first thing I want to say about this movie is Rooney Mara's performance. She knocks it out of the park portraying Lisbeth Salander. She captured the mystery the strangeness the darkness the outofthe norm personality that this character had. She was absolutely fantastic and I'm gonna be shocked as hell if she does not get an Oscar nomination. And she really makes you feel for her in the darker parts of this movie which we'll get to in a moment. And all the other performances are great as well. Daniel Craig is great as usual and there is great chemistry between him and Mara. Christopher Plummer as little as he's in the movie does a great job as well in fact all the actors do. This is a really well acted movie.Another thing that a lot of people have been talking about with this film as it was with the book and the Swedish film was the moments where sexual violence appears on screen. And while there are some really uncomfortable moments in the film that's the reason why these scenes succeed. They shock you and make you want to look away. And that's good especially when the themes of this movie as well as the source material were about this sort of thing and the movie conveys it perfectly. And while these scenes do linger in your mind they never distract you from the basis of this movie which leads into my next praise for the film.The story is really engaging. Even though I had seen the Swedish movie and knew how the story as a whole was going to play out I was able to be really engaged in the movie and not focus on other things. It really sucks you in and Steve Zaillian the writer of this movie structures the film in a way that is both similar and different to the Swedish version therefore doing what I hoped this film would do which was taking something that I already knew about and had watched before and made it to where it was still interesting and there were changes made to where I didn't know how it was going to turn out. And that's great.And everything technical about this movie succeeds. The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is fantastic and really sucks you into the tone of the picture. Jeff Cronenweth who worked with Fincher on both Fight Club and The Social Network delivers fantastic cinematography. The editing the direction the shots everything about this movie succeeds making it a near perfect film.Now one small complaint I have about this film stems a little bit from me viewing the Swedish version in which they reveal a little more about who Lisbeth is and one of the things she did in her past that made it so troubled. And they didn't use that here which kind of threw me off a little. However the more I think about it the less it becomes a concern because 1. You can't compare the two films and 2. there are bits and pieces shown in the films climax that shows that Lisbeth deep down does have a soul. So the movie manages to overcome that obstacle and overall I have nothing to say bad about it.Overall The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a masterful film it's one that you should definitely check out and I'll definitely be checking it out sometime soon. It's directed written and acted well and succeeds in all that it sets out to do. You feel the emotion and darkness of the film Rooney Mara blew me away with her performance and that body damn and overall it lived up to my expectations. So out of ten I got to be honest The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a 10. Go see this movie NOW.".

	onyx:emotionText "I was really looking forward to The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo ever since I learned that David Fincher had been attached to it. Now normally I'd be angry at the fact of a foreign film being remade having seen and loved the Swedish version of the film but I made an exception with this one because of the cast and crew for this film. Fincher who directed films such as Fight Club The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button and most recently The Social Network my favorite film of 2010 and what I thought should have won over The King's Speech has a fantastic eye for filmmaking and has always impressed me with his movies save for Se7en which I wasn't as huge a fan of as everyone else was and even on that film I enjoyed a good bit. You throw in the writer of Schindler's List and Gangs Of New York add actors like Daniel Craig Rooney Mara Christopher Plummer and so many others a score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross who also scored The Social Network and base it off the best selling book by Stieg Larsson that's right this isn't a remake but rather a readaptation it all equals out to in my opinion the best film of the year by far.Now the first thing I want to say about this movie is Rooney Mara's performance. She knocks it out of the park portraying Lisbeth Salander. She captured the mystery the strangeness the darkness the outofthe norm personality that this character had. She was absolutely fantastic and I'm gonna be shocked as hell if she does not get an Oscar nomination. And she really makes you feel for her in the darker parts of this movie which we'll get to in a moment. And all the other performances are great as well. Daniel Craig is great as usual and there is great chemistry between him and Mara. Christopher Plummer as little as he's in the movie does a great job as well in fact all the actors do. This is a really well acted movie.Another thing that a lot of people have been talking about with this film as it was with the book and the Swedish film was the moments where sexual violence appears on screen. And while there are some really uncomfortable moments in the film that's the reason why these scenes succeed. They shock you and make you want to look away. And that's good especially when the themes of this movie as well as the source material were about this sort of thing and the movie conveys it perfectly. And while these scenes do linger in your mind they never distract you from the basis of this movie which leads into my next praise for the film.The story is really engaging. Even though I had seen the Swedish movie and knew how the story as a whole was going to play out I was able to be really engaged in the movie and not focus on other things. It really sucks you in and Steve Zaillian the writer of this movie structures the film in a way that is both similar and different to the Swedish version therefore doing what I hoped this film would do which was taking something that I already knew about and had watched before and made it to where it was still interesting and there were changes made to where I didn't know how it was going to turn out. And that's great.And everything technical about this movie succeeds. The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is fantastic and really sucks you into the tone of the picture.

	schema:reviewBody "For starters why did they have remake this one? I would have loved to see the reactions to a remake of Casablanca in 1945 or what about Gone With The Wind with another beautiful actress who lacked the fire Leigh brought to the role. Could I even picture Titanic with another Kate? There was something iconic about the way Rapace's performance in the original Dragon. She raised the bar to the point she might never be able to match the complexity of that performance an organic complete involving role that consumed her and hypnotized the audience. The new film tries very hard to recreate the experience and it does a decent job in some aspects but the first film was more than just a performance. It emanated from troubled relationships from flawed nature from the way expectations were toppled one after another. In the recent film changing the ending doesn't quite work in fact it hurts the film quite a bit. There are some very good elements in the new film especially the score something that permeates the film with much needed energy and there is something fresh about the way some of the scenes were opened up particularly near the end. However it is what has been done to the main character that is painful to watch. In the novel and the first film our protagonist has a troubled background. It interferes with the way she develops her relationships and it makes her a survivor. She has enough scars and pain in her past to be alert and in a defensive mode. She doesn't trust others and it is not a good idea to challenge her intellectually. She could be an impressive adversary. Fincher's Lisbeth is mostly style and pouts very well. There are flashes of her strength but it is not consistent with the source material. Additionally Fincher has added some touches to the movie that emphasize the ugliness of her world sometimes it tips the feel of the movie going a little too far. It becomes too graphic too lurid and it cheapens the story.There is also an issue with the way the film is a little too long with the way some of the characters are introduced and some situations are detailed to the point that it seems to question the audience's ability to make deductions. Did we need to go into a shopping spree to set up the big scene near the end? Once again I'd love to hear an explanation for the ending? Why?".

	schema:reviewBody "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is pretty popular at our house. The trilogy has been read and all the three Scandinavian film versions have been watched. So it was with both anticipation and dread we watched the Hollywood version at the local cineplex yesterday. We walked away feeling puzzled as to why 100 million had been spent to make a movie that had already been brilliantly made only two years earlier. So tonight we watched the Swedish version again for comparison which only reenforced our opinions.The biggest problem with the new version is that it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It was filmed in Sweden. Larsson was Swedish. Etc. Yet the Swedish elements that give the story coherence have gone AWOL in the latest incarnation. I guess this is not especially surprising considering that director Fincher wondered in a Swedish interview after filming in the north how anyone could live in such a climate. If someone is actually confused about THAT not much else about Swedish society is going to make much senseespecially the complexities that allow that society to not merely survive but prosper.The biggest problem centers around the casting of Daniel Craig as journalist Mikael Blomqvist. Blomqvist is supposed to be a Swedish idealist working for a lefty Stockholm rag. In the Swedish version of the film all the nuances of such a person fill every scene so well it sometimes provokes a laughter of recognition. Craig on the other hand seems utterly clueless about how to play such a character. The man makes a great James Bonda Swedish intellectual not so much.Because Craig doesn't get his character right the whole relationship between Blomqvist and Lisbeth Salander never develops properly. This is a women who has a bunch of issues with men yet grows to trust and eventually love him. But instead of character development we are left with the unspoken assumption of what woman wouldn't have the hots for Daniel Craig? While this is what makes Bond movies work it is bizarrely out of place for this plot.And then there are the missing details that were included in the Scandinavian version. The nature of the Vanger family Fascism. The hints at why Salander is so screwed up. The role of computers in their search for the bad guy and a believable explanation for how things got done. The details of how people actually DO cope with the coldold Henrik Vanger knows how and when to wear an expensive parka in the Swedish version.Of course what is really missing from the Hollywood version is the politics of modern Sweden. Most people think of Sweden if at all as this lefty sexcrazed microsociety that was defined forever by the Social Democrats. What this picture misses is the role of the Swedish right wing. This may be the country of Gunnar Myrdal and Dag Hammarskjold but it is also a country of wealthy industrialists with global connections and ambitions. The trilogy goes into extensive detail about this reality and this whole movie is about an industrialist with a bunch of Fascist siblings. Yet except for a few lines this social tension barely makes an appearance in Fincher's telling. For example in the Swedish version we learn that one of the Vangers was killed fighting as a volunteer in Finland's Winter War with USSR. This detail explains volumes but it is missing in the Hollywood remake.Fincher makes a good movie but he cannot get over the contradictions of making a movie set in Sweden that has been stripped of all Swedishness. What remains is an adolescent action movie with a real James Bond in the lead role. So a 100 million was spent to make a new movie with roughly 15 of the intellectual content of a brilliantly made movie that is only two years old. I suppose it makes sense. If you are making a movie targeted at an audience that is too damn lazy to read subtitles I suppose it is a good move to eliminate much of the intellectual content of the books and the original movie.Who knowsmaybe this thing will make money. My guess is that in most marketsespecially those where both versions must use subtitles anywaythe Swedish version will be far more popular because there is so much more movie. It has more details and that makes it more believable. In the end that should count for something.".

	schema:reviewBody "True to the structure Irritu attacks the subject of love with a multipronged approach addressing three different stages or complications common in love.'  All three storylines represent the struggling' aspect of love.  It would be fair to say that Amores Perros roughly translated to be Love's a Bitch' makes the ultimate statement Love is a struggle.' More specifically however Octavio's narrative can be most suitably seen as the hunt for love' and acquisition or fight for it.  To be with his love Susana he must overcome both the fact that his brother is married to her and the fact that his dreams of leaving the city are hamstrung by his less than admirable socioeconomic state.  Daniel and Valeria who are about fifteen to twenty years Octavio and Susana's elders represent love's most frustrating peak  when one is already in it and wants or needs to get out for better of for worse.  Daniel is trying to get out of a marriage in which he has kids to be with the supermodel Valeria a woman whose meaning to him is ultimately superficial.  El Chivo whose story is a perfect compliment to Daniel's represents distance and alienation from love inwardly looking at it from the outside.  He has abandoned his family twenty years prior to become a guerilla terrorist and now operates as a vagabond hit man.  It would be difficult to look at these three different stages' of love in a classically structured film.  The episodic structure eases us between each stage at no point forcing us to tolerate the unrealistic concept of one couple going through all of these stages.  Breaking it up into three different narratives each revolving around different characters presents the audience with the ability to view each story as independent the others a more pervasive perspective.However this film is not a simple threepart love story.  In Amores Perros violence is akin to love.  Each character displays this brutally El Chivo leaves his love to be a terrorist Octavio engages his dog in violence and even attempts murder to provide money for his love Daniel and Valeria's relationship is verbally and nearly physically volatile to the point where they hate each other.  Each character's love for another character is manifested in their violent acts.  This is an interesting theme considering the paradoxical relationship between love and violence one of which is the induction of harm the other which is the polar opposite.  This juxtaposition of love and violence if for no other reason is meant to show the impulsive nature of love.  We take it for granted as a compassionate helping characteristic of life but Irritu reveals his characters through this juxtaposition allowing the audience to consider the consequences of love that are otherwise unforeseen.Irritu does a lot of things right in this film.  Mainly he keeps us in constant suspense through the causality of the plot forcing us to anticipate the results of the characters' actions.  This causality can be as brazen as Octavio's decision to stab Jarocho inevitably leading one into apprehension over what will happen to Octavio.  Less obviously however is the way he creates suspense around Daniel and Valeria.  Their whole relationship is characterized by conflict.  While this makes for good dialogue it insists upon a boiling point  one that is anticipated throughout the entire length of their chapter.  Likewise there is delicate suspense over what Valeria's disfigurement will mean for their relationship. Not only is Daniel forced to confront whether or not Valeria's beauty is the only thing keeping them together but Valeria must adjust to living without her beauty.  Suspense revolves around El Chivo from the moment he first comes onto screen.  We see him.  He murders someone.  We're back to the story of Octavio.  The entire first two hours of the movie beg of an answer as to who this man is and what he has to do with the subject of the film.  We later find out not only does he have everything to do with it he makes the film seeking redemption on behalf of every other lovetorn character.  The type of monologue Emilio Echevarria's character El Chivo delivers at the end of the film would have a completely different meaning in a film without an episodic structure in which case he would only be seeking redemption for himself.  However the way Irritu cross cuts between El Chivo and the other characters in all their woe  the consequences of their actions applies greater meaning to El Chivo's words and actions in the final scene.Perhaps where we get some of the most important information about the characters and Amores Perros as a whole is through what is representative. Irritu makes steady use of symbols and motifs throughout the film some of which work well lending themselves nicely to the dramatic structure of the film others failing to enhance the story.  For example the massive Enchant billboard looming above Valeria's apartment like the eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg is one of the more lackluster motifs in the film.  First we are unavoidably asking Why they would want to live under that thing in the first place?  Second the removal of the billboard coinciding with the fall of Valeria's career Daniel's selfassurance their relationship whatever you want to intuit is much to explicit for this film.  The more understated motifs such as the recurring telephone ring Bueno?.Bueno?' someone always answers come off better.  This repetition is telling of the deception and unfaithfulness rampant in this world.  It works.  Another representative device that supplements the story is how the dogs act as metaphors for their respective owners.  El Chivo's dogs are the very embodiment of him.  They are all strays much the same way he is a vagrant.  Cofi Octavio's rottweiler is equivalent to Octavio in his impulsive and aggressive behavior.  This is displayed in Cofi most notably during the fight scenes but we see it particularly in Octavio when he headbutts his brother Ramiro and when he stabs Jarocho in the stomach and thereby provoking the car chase.  Valeria's dog Richie is lost under the floorboards confined for most of this narrative.  Valeria is physically much the same way confined to her wheelchair.  More implicitly she is confined to a life that has been propped up around her by people who idolize envy or lust after her.  Valeria's death is also parallel to her dog's death in that they both die from their respective internment Valeria being trapped in a room and too immobile to save herself Richie trapped in the floor and too exhausted to fend off armies hungry rats.  The motifs and metaphors within each narrative help structure them as selfcontained bodies.The episodic structure of Amores Perros could have been damaging to the film had it not been for the inspired way the stories overlap only so much as to not exasperate the audience.  In the three stories rarely does a character from one interact with a character from another outside the unifying car crash scene.  There are truly only two occurrences when El Chivo sword in hand scares off a frustrated Jarocho who plans to sic his dog on one of El Chivo's and when Valeria appears on a Mexican morning show broadcast into Octavio's home the morning of the accident.  This interaction was all that was needed for Amores Perros to be successful as an episodic film.  Its structure lends itself well to subject matter and storyline.  Irritu tells it to us this way the literary devices at use bring it to life and its structure gives it legs to move.  Throughout it so well crafted one can mentally fuse all three stories together and see one single character going through the process of fighting for love realizing what a trivial pursuit it is abandoning it and then spending the rest of his life trying to touch it from behind the bars selfguilt.".

Not only is Daniel forced to confront whether or not Valeria's beauty is the only thing keeping them together but Valeria must adjust to living without her beauty.  Suspense revolves around El Chivo from the moment he first comes onto screen.  We see him.  He murders someone.  We're back to the story of Octavio.  The entire first two hours of the movie beg of an answer as to who this man is and what he has to do with the subject of the film.  We later find out not only does he have everything to do with it he makes the film seeking redemption on behalf of every other lovetorn character.  The type of monologue Emilio Echevarria's character El Chivo delivers at the end of the film would have a completely different meaning in a film without an episodic structure in which case he would only be seeking redemption for himself.  However the way Irritu cross cuts between El Chivo and the other characters in all their woe  the consequences of their actions applies greater meaning to El Chivo's words and actions in the final scene.Perhaps where we get some of the most important information about the characters and Amores Perros as a whole is through what is representative. Irritu makes steady use of symbols and motifs throughout the film some of which work well lending themselves nicely to the dramatic structure of the film others failing to enhance the story.  For example the massive Enchant billboard looming above Valeria's apartment like the eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg is one of the more lackluster motifs in the film.  First we are unavoidably asking Why they would want to live under that thing in the first place?  Second the removal of the billboard coinciding with the fall of Valeria's career Daniel's selfassurance their relationship whatever you want to intuit is much to explicit for this film.  The more understated motifs such as the recurring telephone ring Bueno?.Bueno?' someone always answers come off better.  This repetition is telling of the deception and unfaithfulness rampant in this world.  It works.  Another representative device that supplements the story is how the dogs act as metaphors for their respective owners.  El Chivo's dogs are the very embodiment of him.  They are all strays much the same way he is a vagrant.  Cofi Octavio's rottweiler is equivalent to Octavio in his impulsive and aggressive behavior.  This is displayed in Cofi most notably during the fight scenes but we see it particularly in Octavio when he headbutts his brother Ramiro and when he stabs Jarocho in the stomach and thereby provoking the car chase.  Valeria's dog Richie is lost under the floorboards confined for most of this narrative.  Valeria is physically much the same way confined to her wheelchair.  More implicitly she is confined to a life that has been propped up around her by people who idolize envy or lust after her.  Valeria's death is also parallel to her dog's death in that they both die from their respective internment Valeria being trapped in a room and too immobile to save herself Richie trapped in the floor and too exhausted to fend off armies hungry rats.  The motifs and metaphors within each narrative help structure them as selfcontained bodies.The episodic structure of Amores Perros could have been damaging to the film had it not been for the inspired way the stories overlap only so much as to not exasperate the audience.  In the three stories rarely does a character from one interact with a character from another outside the unifying car crash scene.  There are truly only two occurrences when El Chivo sword in hand scares off a frustrated Jarocho who plans to sic his dog on one of El Chivo's and when Valeria appears on a Mexican morning show broadcast into Octavio's home the morning of the accident.  This interaction was all that was needed for Amores Perros to be successful as an episodic film.  Its structure lends itself well to subject matter and storyline.  Irritu tells it to us this way the literary devices at use bring it to life and its structure gives it legs to move.  Throughout it so well crafted one can mentally fuse all three stories together and see one single character going through the process of fighting for love realizing what a trivial pursuit it is abandoning it and then spending the rest of his life trying to touch it from behind the bars selfguilt.";

Gonzalez Iarritu in cooperation with his almost personal screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga creates such a complex yet flawless history based on three individual ones that converge not only in the dantesque reference to Dante Alighieri's style The Divine Comedy car accident but in their perception and description of how love can be harsh as well as life itself of how love can get to be a bitch a struggle.First Story 'Octavio y Susana' is about Octavio's Garcia Bernal obsession with his sisterinlaw Susana Vanessa Bauche but it's also about the violence about an illusion about betrayal about loss. This is also reflected in the character of Octavio's dog Cofi in a parallel relationship with his owner while he seeks his own destiny having lost everything he'll have to redefine his life. This parallelism also occurs in the second story'Daniel y Valeria' an almost surreal one where Ritchie being trapped underneath the condo's floor represents how it's owner Valeria Goya Toledo is trapped in a relation with Daniel that grows sicker as her injury caused by the car accident gets worse. The removal of the gigantic advertising of 'Enchant' the scent campaign that she used to be the image for from the view of her balcony represents their decline Daniel Avaro Guerrero left behind his marriage for this superficial mirage kind of dream and she will have to make a whole redefinition of her life after losing everything. The dogcharacter parallelism with the main characters of this film can also be noticed in the third story 'El Chivo y Maru' where 'El Chivo' Emilio Echevaria a former College teacher that left it all family included to become some guerrilla terrorist is there a symbolism for Subcommander Marcos from EZLN? and now finds by losing it all all of his dogs being killed but finding a new reason new company just before a hitmantype mission where he sets a confrontation between two brothers in such a biblical style the chance that none of the characters from the rest of the stories had redemption. That's when he decides to retrieve some of the things he has lost like Maru Lourdes Echevarria Emilio's actual daughter in real life by at least apologizing to her and redeeming himself finding a new life. It's clear that he'll stop being a homeless because by the end of the movie he's got plenty of money. This story is one step ahead of the other two cause after the loss they are all victims of 'El Chivo' is the only one who gets that chance to start from scratch once again. Huge merit to Emilio Echevarria's performance for making believable the only character that was in risk of not being plausible of the film. Because of the relation within the characters their dogs and their own love personal story the title is too a big success both in Spanish and in English. Of the episodic narrative structure of the movie a few critics in the Cannes Film Festival compared it with Tarantino's Pulp Fiction it can be said that besides making it more beautiful and complex it's also necessary. One can't figure a way to resolve the situation other than this one. The thrill the shock would never be the same. For example if each one was a short film instead it wouldn't work the same way as the whole movie.In the film Gonzalez Iarritu allows himself to appear a few times in the editorial where Daniel works for example verifying a magazine cover having some of the TV spots he made in the 90's when he was a publicist shown in the movie and in the last scene 'El Chivo' names the dog he rescued formerly known as Cofi as 'El Negro' Iarritu's nickname.".

	schema:reviewBody "Thanks to contributors plot synopsis has been very well written. Amores Perros is included in the most important movies for the beginning of the 21st century. It marked a new epoch with its thoroughly lifelike vision on a twist of fate. Then in a 5 years' of time within more recognized movies we started seeing similar plot schemes telling different stories over accidents that binds each person's fate. One of them was Crash and it won the best picture Oscar in 2005.The more you see this film over and over again you'll get to a deeper point where the lives and choices of the characters won't matter any more. It's still affecting in the firsttime watch but with an examining view the next time you see it you're driven into a vision a cast of mind.There were 3 main characters and 3 main stories from each one which are nested altogether. If we look at these stories over the characters' relationships with their dogs it's intriguing. As if the dogs exemplify their owners 1' Young loafer Octavio commits crime in order to earn money to make a living. He fights his dog Cofi in dogfighting tournaments. How Cofi needs to fight for his life so does need Octavio to commit crime for his life.2' In the second story beautiful model Valeria receives a surprise gift from her fianc to choose a puppy from a pet store. By time the puppy gets used to live a superluxury pet life which is the same life style of her owner. Valeria and her fianc's apartment unit is under a hardwood flooring construction. One day while alone at home the puppy falls into a gap between the hardwood and the concrete thus stays stuck there and began to squawk since she is not used to live without comfort. At the same day her owner Valeria gets involved in a car accident while driving alone having no one to help her just as happened to her puppy. She loses her leg in this accident and her luxury life comes to an end as same as the life of her puppy. She begins complaining like her puppy squawking.3' In the last story the grim hitman El Chivo saves the life of Octavio's dog Cofi after Octavio gets killed in the traffic accident in which Valeria lost her leg. Saving him changes Cofi's life he no longer needs to fight for Octavio's bets on dogfighting. His life becomes safe and peaceful. El Chivo starts looking after Cofi beside his other dogs. Among the other dogs Cofi looks very ugly and dirty. One day when El Chivo leaves the dogs together at home Cofi kills every one of them. His reason of killing all the dogs explains why his owner is a hitman. As Cofi killed innocent dogs El Chivo kills innocent people for El Chivo seeing himself uglydirty and strange among the people like his dog feeling himself uglydirty and strange among the dogs. El Chivo feels bad about his dogs when he finds out Cofi has killed them. Yet he feels worse about himself when he actually realizes that Cofi's attitude gave him a lesson of life. Then El Chivo shaves cuts his beard and hair gets cleaned up and turns out looking like a gentleman. Cofi's attitude changes his life his life becomes safe and peaceful just as when El Chivo saved Cofi's life.The vision we're getting when we compare these 3 stories is about the public loneliness of an individual. The only person who can guide and who can help us is ourselves. This loneliness brings our freedom of choices. With making our own choices we build the essence of our character Our quintessences. Life is sum of all our choices. In order to build our quintessences we always face the risk fear and pressure of the chance of making a wrong choice. Life makes it obligatory to make choices. This obligatory builds our inner crisis and develops our personality. To find the secrets of our own personality we try to find someone or something else to lay a burden on the responsibility of selfsearch. Here in Amores Perros the 3 main characters are used by their selfsearch reflection on their dogs.Doesn't this vision form the idea of Jean Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness? Since Amores Perros hides the character views through the situations created by dogs it is a movie that has no characters but only situations. This is the systematic of Existentialism. If there was no situation or happening there wouldn't have been any characters. Existence precedes essence. A person is nothing without his actions. So a person doesn't have a soulor a character if he is not alive. Then there wasn't and won't be anything before and after our lives. If we don't believe in this vision certainly the signs of fate that we come across in our lives must be delusion.".

At the same day her owner Valeria gets involved in a car accident while driving alone having no one to help her just as happened to her puppy. She loses her leg in this accident and her luxury life comes to an end as same as the life of her puppy. She begins complaining like her puppy squawking.3' In the last story the grim hitman El Chivo saves the life of Octavio's dog Cofi after Octavio gets killed in the traffic accident in which Valeria lost her leg. Saving him changes Cofi's life he no longer needs to fight for Octavio's bets on dogfighting. His life becomes safe and peaceful. El Chivo starts looking after Cofi beside his other dogs. Among the other dogs Cofi looks very ugly and dirty. One day when El Chivo leaves the dogs together at home Cofi kills every one of them. His reason of killing all the dogs explains why his owner is a hitman. As Cofi killed innocent dogs El Chivo kills innocent people for El Chivo seeing himself uglydirty and strange among the people like his dog feeling himself uglydirty and strange among the dogs. El Chivo feels bad about his dogs when he finds out Cofi has killed them. Yet he feels worse about himself when he actually realizes that Cofi's attitude gave him a lesson of life. Then El Chivo shaves cuts his beard and hair gets cleaned up and turns out looking like a gentleman. Cofi's attitude changes his life his life becomes safe and peaceful just as when El Chivo saved Cofi's life.The vision we're getting when we compare these 3 stories is about the public loneliness of an individual. The only person who can guide and who can help us is ourselves. This loneliness brings our freedom of choices. With making our own choices we build the essence of our character Our quintessences. Life is sum of all our choices. In order to build our quintessences we always face the risk fear and pressure of the chance of making a wrong choice. Life makes it obligatory to make choices. This obligatory builds our inner crisis and develops our personality. To find the secrets of our own personality we try to find someone or something else to lay a burden on the responsibility of selfsearch. Here in Amores Perros the 3 main characters are used by their selfsearch reflection on their dogs.Doesn't this vision form the idea of Jean Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness? Since Amores Perros hides the character views through the situations created by dogs it is a movie that has no characters but only situations. This is the systematic of Existentialism. If there was no situation or happening there wouldn't have been any characters. Existence precedes essence. A person is nothing without his actions. So a person doesn't have a soulor a character if he is not alive. Then there wasn't and won't be anything before and after our lives. If we don't believe in this vision certainly the signs of fate that we come across in our lives must be delusion.";

	schema:reviewBody "A young man gets into the world of illegal dog fighting in order to get enough money together to be able to run away with his brother's wife but in the meantime he starts tension with another dog owner. A beautiful young model signs a lucrative contract with a perfume company and moves into her new flat with her lover  only for her tragedy to strike and her dog to go missing. Finally an exconvict and guerrilla mourns the wife he left decades ago and longs to meet the daughter who thinks he is dead  but is also contracted to kill a businessman. These three lives come together in a car crash that acts as a catalyst in changing their lives.After seeing 21 Grams I knew that I had to get round to seeing this film. With it's appearance on TV BBC4 showing itself to really be a 'place to think' and a wonderful channel to have I took the opportunity to watch it expecting a film that would match the good things I had heard about it. From the opening car chase that results in the crash that the film spirals outwards from like debris through for most of the first hour I was hooked  the pace was great and the story gripping. It was violent exciting and yet had a human element to it as well. However the second story knocked the wind out of it for a moment and seemed to lack the emotion of the first. It was based around an urban myth of sorts and wasn't as good  even if it did pick up towards the end.The third story saw it return to a much more involving story of pain and the grinding out of life as in 'getting by'. Maybe it was the rich lifestyles of the characters in story two that stopped me caring as much  I don't know but I know that the contrast between one  two made it more obvious how much the pace had dropped  especially when we are left wanted to know what happened to the characters we had spent an hour getting to care about. Anyway the third story is a satisfying ending to the film and drew me back in emotionally where the second story had cut me off by it's abrupt start. Story two finishes before story three begins and therefore it was easier to move on.I think the problem with this film for me was not the fact that three stories were intermingled but that I didn't think they were actually mixed well  the way the film moves away from characters before concluding their section eg Octavia the way the stories are actually quite separate from one another these things and other I felt weakened the films  although each story was strong on it's own I just felt that story 2 was such a change to the film that it hurt it.However as a film debut this is an amazing piece of work and is relentlessly impressive. From the opening car chase to the dog fights to the silent pain of the model looking out where her image once hung  in all these different moments I thought he did a great job and visually the film was never dull once no matter if it was set in a penthouse flat or a basement of an old building with the blood of dead dogs. And while we're on the subject at the time of release I heard critics say they walked out of the film refusing to watch cruelty to animals even being simulated. I can see their point but also think that they missed the fact that the animals in the film are mostly loved even if they mostly die!  however it is love and compassion for other humans that the film shows the characters having difficulty with and this is where the emotional impact of the film is  not in simulated dogfights albeit very well simulated dogfights that are hard to hear even if they are mostly unseen.The cast were all natural but I always find it hard to judge performances when they are not in English. Having said that there were no bad performances in the whole thing  even if some have better material to work with than others. Of course I still think this is a director's film and the cast often take second place to the style and the feel of the film.Overall I really enjoyed this film but don't believe it deserves to be considered one of the 'best films ever made'! The opening hour is superb and it's pace is relentless even in more sensitive moments but the sudden stop the film makes when it changes to story two is too much to stand and really caused the film to stutter for me. It gets better and is fully back on track for story three but there are problems running all through the narrative. Even though it has a lower rating on IMDb at time of writing I'd still say that 21 Grams offer this same fragmented style but with a much more satisfying narrative. Regardless of my nit picking I still think this is a powerful film that makes 150 minutes fly by with a huge amount of style from the firsttime director even if it does not live up to the endlessly gushing praise lavished upon it by many viewers.".

	schema:headline " Excellent Storytelling But Flawed";
	schema:reviewBody "I was really looking forward to this as I had heard all the hype about it off IMDb and managed to get it in a DVD sale for 8. The only thing that put me off was that there was dog fights in it and I don't take kindly to watching animal cruelty in films. I know it's not real but it reminds me that it does happen in some countries and it's just a bit upsetting but I thought to myself 'it's only a movie and I am sure it won't take anything away from it' and thankfully it didn't. I liked the way they put in the beginning of the film reminding us that no animal was hurt during the course of the movie because people don't usually watch the credits at the end unless they really want to because that quote about the animals doesn't really come up till the very last bit of the credits but without it at the beginning then I am sure there would be a lot of very upset people. But back to the film Amores Perros is all about three different stories that come together through a car accident and we see how there lives are before and after the accident. We start off with Octavio who lives at home with his abusing brother mother and his brother's girlfriend who he has taken a shine to. His brother is always on at him and smacks about his partner which doesn't like but knows he can do nothing about it unless he wants his legs broken. His story begins when his dog kills a champion fighting dog owned by a ruthless gangster of the town.When Octavio realises that he can make some money with his dog fighting so he can escape the slums of Mexico City. But it's not so easy as he wants to take his brother girlfriend and her baby with him but she takes some convincing. The other story is to do with Valeria who is happy with her new lover who has just left his wife and kids for her but the terrible accident leaves her wheelchair bound and she loses her grip on wanting to enjoy her life and things start to become hard for her and her lover. But the only thing that is keeping her occupied is the love for her dog who accidentally gets trapped underneath the floor boards. Valeria worries as there are Rats down there and doesn't seem to find a way of getting the dog out and as this happens her conditions worsens with gangrene setting in. The last story is with El Chiro A homeless man with nothing in his life apart from his love for his own pet dogs. He also has a past that is hurting him deep inside as he is not allowed to see his daughter after he walked out on the family but now is ex wife is dead he tries to make up for what he has done with the his daughter but the family do it's best to keep him away and obsolete from her life.The movie is very long and has a lot of unneeded scenes in it. I really wasn't taken in by the story of Valeria as it didn't seem very convincing and doesn't really go anywhere. You think it's just about to get interesting but at the last minute it has gone and it makes you feel whether they could have just cut out the entire screen as she doesn't make a difference. If I had it my own way then I would have kept the whole film focusing on Octavio and his dog Cofi trying their best to gather enough money to get out of there depressing lives and with El Chiro coming in in one or two scenes to make it a lot more interesting. This doesn't make Amores Perros a bad film just not a great one. You will go away thinking it could have been better or you will just plain love it but not watch it again. Its not the sort of film you go back and watch it again and again unless it intrigued you. Another good solid foreign film that didn't hit all the marks but still very good.".

	schema:headline " Brutally Powerful";
	schema:reviewBody "'Amores Perros' is a shocking experience from visionary director Alejandro Gonzalez Iarritu. It's a difficult film to watch one which continuously challenges its audience but a reward in of itself for those who can withstand its brutality. It puts a magnifying glass to the pain of love and those who are destroyed by it. It gives new meaning to the film title's literal translation 'love is a bitch'.In a single moment in time several lives in Mexico City will be changed forever by a devastating car crash. The film divides itself into three separate segments representing the past present and future. Octavio is searching for recognition and love but looks in the wrong places. It's a desire that drives him leading him to make choices in life that will soon haunt him. Valerie whose life is most impacted by the car accident finds herself living in a relationship that's crumbling and selfdestructing. El Chivo must deal with the absence of his daughter and the void it's left in his life. He finds companionship in the dogs he picks up off the street and they soon become the only living things he can connect with. Together the lives of these individuals will collide in more ways than one. They will find themselves connected by a single thread love. And the hell that can be unleashed with it.When I finished watching 'Amores Perros' one of the first things that popped into my mind was why 'Babel' couldn't have been this good. Where 'Babel' lacked in emotional depths and highs 'Amores Perros' at times finds itself drowning in it. It's a visceral and gritty film so raw and intense. You may think you've seen it all but 'Perros' will challenge even those who are rarely phased by cinema. You may find it difficult not to look away at times. Iarritu's movie has been described as being a 'dog holocaust' and at times I can't disagree. The film's sheer violence is so penetrating and disturbing it packs a mighty punch. And while this film is definitely not for the squeamish or faint of heart there's no question that 'Amores Perros' has a tender heart and message ready to be heard. Iarritu crafts a compelling story from start to finish which strips down to the bare basics. His ability to capture a piece of the human spirit is wondrous even if it doesn't always cast us in the best light. It's dark fierce and relentless but nothing short of greatness.'Amores Perros' features an array of actors and actresses all of which work wonders in their respective roles. Gael Garcia Bernal is as always brilliant. It's a more restrained and less quirky role than many are used to seeing him in but nonetheless has the rare ability to capture and audience's attention with ease. Emilio Echevarria stars as El Chivo and delivers a haunting performance as a man who finds himself alone and saddened. It's the weakest part of the film but is made up for by Emilio's wonderful presence. Goya Toledo plays Valerie a celebrity crippled by the accident the film revolves around. I found her part in the story to be most interesting if not for the fact of seeing the life of someone who goes from having it all to nothing at all. There are many numerous performances too many to cover but they all lend their talents to create something extraordinary.'Amores Perros' is an adrenaline rush for its entire running which tops twoandahalf hours. It's all a very human and primal film which can be attributed to Iarritu's impeccable style and talent. Combining a mutlifaceted story with electric performances 'Perros' works on many different layers to satisfying results. An original and bold step in filmmaking this nearly perfect picture will have you experience a collage of emotions and invest in flawed characters... all for the sake of love.".

Iarritu's movie has been described as being a 'dog holocaust' and at times I can't disagree. The film's sheer violence is so penetrating and disturbing it packs a mighty punch. And while this film is definitely not for the squeamish or faint of heart there's no question that 'Amores Perros' has a tender heart and message ready to be heard. Iarritu crafts a compelling story from start to finish which strips down to the bare basics. His ability to capture a piece of the human spirit is wondrous even if it doesn't always cast us in the best light. It's dark fierce and relentless but nothing short of greatness.'Amores Perros' features an array of actors and actresses all of which work wonders in their respective roles. Gael Garcia Bernal is as always brilliant. It's a more restrained and less quirky role than many are used to seeing him in but nonetheless has the rare ability to capture and audience's attention with ease. Emilio Echevarria stars as El Chivo and delivers a haunting performance as a man who finds himself alone and saddened. It's the weakest part of the film but is made up for by Emilio's wonderful presence. Goya Toledo plays Valerie a celebrity crippled by the accident the film revolves around. I found her part in the story to be most interesting if not for the fact of seeing the life of someone who goes from having it all to nothing at all. There are many numerous performances too many to cover but they all lend their talents to create something extraordinary.'Amores Perros' is an adrenaline rush for its entire running which tops twoandahalf hours. It's all a very human and primal film which can be attributed to Iarritu's impeccable style and talent. Combining a mutlifaceted story with electric performances 'Perros' works on many different layers to satisfying results. An original and bold step in filmmaking this nearly perfect picture will have you experience a collage of emotions and invest in flawed characters... all for the sake of love.";

It opens with a truly gruesome car crash in which blood and guts swirl around liberally. If you happen to walk in late never fear the scene will replay twice more.

Octavio's role is basically to hang around the house panting at his sisterinlaw until he decides to make money by entering Ramiro's vicious mastiff in dog fights. The car he's slammed into conveys supermodel Valeria Goya Toledo whose successful career ends on impact. She is mistress to Daniel lvaro Guerrero who's gone middleage crazy and separated from his wife to live with Valeria 247. The supermodel's true love however is her moplike Lhasa apso Richie.The triptych's third panel focuses on El Chivo Emilio Echevarra a former revolutionary. Imprisoned while his daughter was born he has never met her though he's remained obsessed with images of her for more than 20 years. He moons over her while alternately practicing his assassination skills and living with his own pack of canines.AMORES PERROS is the debut film of director Alejandro Gonzlez Inrritu a Mexican DJ who's apparently seen PULP FICTION a few times. While it doesn't slavishly imitate Tarantino it noticeably cops a few of his moves. Like a bad case of coffee nerves the film functions best at high velocity and on razor's edge. There's plenty of speededup action trick cuts and always the threat of imminent gore. With many scenes rife with tension AMORES often strays into telenovela territory though it's tough to tell if the melodrama is intentional.Yet strangely enough after all this adrenaline puts us on red alert we are thrust into an extremely tedious middle portion in which Valeria's dog gets trapped beneath floorboards and the hapless couple can't reckon how to retrieve him. Richie whines night after night Valeria whines night after night fights ensue she stages a minirevolt from her wheelchairand we're left with a yawning And your point is....Is love a bitch? Sure. Do people treat their loves like dogs?  Sometimes. Is this a rich metaphor that bears 2 12 hours of graphically violent exploration? Not really.

	schema:reviewBody "If like me you were dazzled by this year's Babel you will likely be as curious as I was to check out the first film in director Alejandro Gonzalez Irritu's trilogy about death. Similar in narrative structure to Babel this viscerally shattering 2000 movie carries three overlapping stories tied together by a defining car accident. Written with dramatic precision by Guillermo Arriaga who later wrote the other two films in the trilogy 21 Grams and Babel all three take place within the different social strata of Mexico City and as the title implies English translation Love's a Bitch dogs are intriguingly pivotal to each story. Also like Babel the various interconnections among the stories do not come across as contrived but rather as emotional resonant in a gradually revelatory manner. Even though the movie runs an epic length of 153 minutes it consistently holds your attention.The first plot line Octavio and Susana is about a love triangle that occurs between young Octavio his abusive older brother Ramiro and Ramiro's wife Susana. Dog fighting is common sport in their downscale neighborhood and the brothers own a rottweiler that's a natural aggressor in the fight pit. Octavio sees the dog as his meal ticket to steal Susana away from Ramiro and escape to Juarez. The second story Daniel and Valeria focuses on Daniel a married guiltridden TV producer who buys a fancy new condo for him to live with his tempestuous supermodel girlfriend Valeria. Their relationship unravels in light of the car accident and further complications occur when her little dog is trapped underneath the floorboards. The third story El Chivo and Maru is about former political revolutionary El Chivo who has years ago left his family and became a hit man for hire. Living in squalor with a herd of homeless dogs he is recruited by a businessman to kill his partner both of whom turns out to be brothers. The integration of these stories is handled with supple dexterity in a nonlinear fashion that allows the viewer to peel off the layers of the characters in order to understand their common dilemmas.Unbelievably this powderkeg of a film represents Irritu's feature film debut as a director and his confidence and audacity are felt throughout although the third episode seems too deliberate a pastiche of Pulp Fiction. He has assembled a superb cast with Emilio Echevarra the standout as the grizzled El Chivo a scarifying vagrant who reveals himself to be a troubled soul who is the only one who successfully escapes his trying existence. In his first major role Gael Garca Bernal portrays Octavio with escalating emotional fervor and as Susana and Ramiro Vanessa Bauche and Marco Prez provide powerful support. Together they generate a palpable sense of imminent violence throughout their episode. Goya Toledo makes a vivid impression as Valeria fully capturing her spoiled character's misplaced sense of entitlement while Alvaro Guerrero affectingly humanizes the putupon Daniel's increasing regret. Just as he would prove later with The Motorcycle Diaries Brokeback Mountain and Babel Rodrigo Prieto showcases superbly evocative cinematography that is in keeping with the emotional shadings of the story.The 2001 DVD provides a surprising number of extras beginning with an informative often meticulous commentary track by Irritu and Arriaga spoken in Spanish and subtitled in English. There are three quick featurettes. The first is a sixminute short that shows how the numerous dogs used in the film were trained and protected during the production. Considering how realistically violent the dog fighting scenes are I find this short helpfully reassuring. The second is the standard makingof featurette about fifteen minutes long. Even though Irritu seems to be promoting the film as well as explaining the genesis of it there is good behindthescenes footage including some interesting table readings from the cast. This leads to one quick short about the staging of the car accident itself. Also included are about a dozen deleted scenes totaling about fifteen minutes which actually help provide context in understanding some of the characters' motivations. There are also three music videos from the movie's soundtrack which is a dramatically effective mix of Mexican and Spanish rockrap tracks.".

	schema:reviewBody "The director Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu did an extraordinary thriller combining masterfully three different stories where fighting dogs are included and also using the camera in tricky ways several times probably to increase the excitement. In Mexico there are many ways to earn money for survival in some cases or for lucrative purposes in others. There fights among animals are arranged regularly. In Mexico the socalled Palenques are famous where the people go to see fights between cocks but also fights of dogs are organized in places less formal than Palenques. In both fights the people bet some small money but others high sums. The film goes around this issue of fights between dogs where obviously you have always a persistent dog champion highly susceptible to be killed by other means in order to take it away. But the film is in fact about the misery of the humans no matter if they are poor or rich. Amores Perros is an exceptional film and a sample of the quality of several newera films in Latin America which may compete easily in their plots and depth with other films made in Europe and USA.".

Not that they make the best films but that they have the current crop of ideas.

This is still the standard of the much celebrated Scorsese.The French were briefly interesting when to this they added the notion of reflexivity where the mechanics of filmmaking became a character. Hollywood  in their more interesting films  extended this notion of folding to an amazing collection of ironic and selfreferential devices.Meanwhile Spanish literature was long incubating a synthesis of fabulism within self reference Cervantes invented the notion combined with earthy sensuality sometimes natural energy.So in contrast to the Scorseseled character' stuff and the often mechanical Hollywood folding exercises we get Spanish films from Medem Almodovar and Garcia. Rodriguez is very much in this camp. And now this.Yes it is overly long and uneven. Yes it is artificially gritty and has some dishonest performances. But it is extremely well constructed both on a dramatic and conceptual level.Folding in this context is placed in the fantasy of rather than perspective or character. Why give several stories? Taratino does because Kar Wai Wong does and his motive is to bleach the story away and focus on the musical texture of the mood. But Garcia does it Ten Tiny Love Stories' Things You Can Tell By Just Looking at Her.' to synthesize a single entity out of many and a single larger context out of the many sketched situations. The focus is on that larger context and what magical dynamics are at work. It is pop cosmology as art drawn from drowning the soap opera content. It is new melodrama  melodrama is when the characters are puppets to external forces  with attention to interesting exposition and subterranean channels of those forces.Fate. Dogs as astrological entities.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

Had Hollywood turned out this crock I could have forgiven them but this was a German production and I expected a lot more from them.I lived in Berlin for most of the Eighties. Part of that time was spent in Kreutzberg among the Anarchists. I knew many of them and even took part in some of their demos. I could write volumes on how these people think and act and believe me it was nothing like this movie depicted.In the movie the characters were too clean and smart. Also they were all straight and the girls were pretty. And they were quite capable of launching a James Bond style breaking to a top security police fortress.In reality they were dirty burntout looking as often as not gaylesbian and didn't mind flirting it. Many were drug users came from broken homes were sexually abused as kids and had the organizing skills of Beavis and Butthead. If the girls were half way decent looking they were probably prostituting themselves or working in strip shows to make a living. Nearly all of them were on welfare. Not to mention the frequent riots and vandalism that came with the lifestyle. Certainly nothing like the happygolucky characters the movie depicts.I never ever heard of any Anarchists moving out and becoming Yuppies. Not even in the Nineties. Usually they just stayed in place until they were forced out of their squats and into concrete block neighborhoods in East Berlin.Also the police are not that stupid. Nobody ever broke into Tempelhof and stole the riot trucks or blew up the archives. Get real! This stuff never happened and should not be depicted as though it did. The worst part of it for me is that back then the media depicted the Anarchists as the lowest trash who should be locked up immediately or disposed of by any means necessary. Now they are cashing in on them by making action movies with sexy Anarchist good guys.It's as if 10 years from now Hollywood made an action movie featuring Osama Bin Laden and his Mujahadeen as the good guys and put Michelle Yeoh in as the female lead. That bad! Enjoy this movie but History it ain't!".

	schema:reviewBody "During the early 80s squatters in Berlin have been mostly students on an adventure holiday some years later they were mostly full time bums on a permanent Do you have a Mark to sparequest. They had their fair amount of street fighting activities their weapon of choice was the cobble and sometimes they threw it through the glass of a bank building. But they were no terrorists. Maybe wannabe revolutionaries in their dreams. Nobody took them really serious.Now some of them seem to have made this movie. Just let me tell you what happens during the first 15 minutes.A group of Berlin squatters decides to blow up an empty old villa. Must be a very evil villa because basically squatting was about saving empty buildings from neglect.They do an amateur movie about this heroic deed maybe they think there is a market for BuildingSnuffVideos.Their bomb doesn't explode. They don't care they just forget about the whole thing. Even though the entrance they took was very obvious and easy to detect the next 13 years nobody enters the villa.Not even the real estate agent who in 2000 wants to show it to a client. Why should she make sure that there are no unpleasant surprises waiting inside like squatters homeless garbage animals broken mains collapsing floors ... ? The main door will not open so the client uses some force to open it and the old bomb that had been waiting patiently behind it finally explodes. He and the real estate newbie get slightly hurt.The client has been a government big shot. Hell breaks loose police raids start.Of course amongst their prime suspects are two veteran squatters who still stay at a formerly occupied tenementhouse. The police confiscates .... all of their super8films. Believe me they really do I'm not making this up it's even the main part of the plot The Berlin police in the year 2000 looking for some bombbuilding terrorists confiscates the 80s super8films of some broken down bums. Please don't ask why. But imagine how the authors and producers had to get people interested in such a story. And they succeeded which is even more unlikely.The two diehard squatters will try to get the band together again and rescue what contained once proud memories of their glory days and now fatal evidence of their stupidity from the well guarded chambers of the police.By now you will know that you are not watching a movie but are instead trapped inside the dream of some pathetic drunken 80s squatters a bunch of mindless jerks who'll be the first against the wall when the revolution comes. Frightening? No just a strange and boring childish mindscape.I realize that there really IS a market for stuff like this the infamous lovers of dilettantish and inane films. Here they'll find a lot for their liking. This is a very VERY bad movie and by all means they should check it out.".

Now they must reunite and try to eliminate the proofs because now they have grown up some have children some have promising careers... and some got stunk in the past.Was tun wenn's brennt? is a very good movie by promising director Gregg Schnitzler that tells the story of this band of former radicals after 12 years of changes social and personal. The movie flows at good pace with good humor and feelgood attitude. Add to the mix an attractive young cast and you get this light comedy.Probably that is both its greatest attribute and its greatest flaw the fact that it has a lot of potential for being a deep character study filled with dark humor but instead chooses the way of being a light hearted comedy with an upbeat tone.The movie has very good camerawork although it has that Hollywoodish feeling that may turn some people away. Those Hollywood moments are what probably hurt the film the most with clichd scenes that distract us from the point for the sake of getting emotions.Besides its light tone the movie manages to deliver its message past returns to burn you. While Tim Til Schweiger and Hotte Martin Feifel are still living in the past the rest of the gang tries to forget it and ultimately it returns to burn them.The acting was actually better than expected with Matthias Matschke as Terror the former punk turned lawyer ! stealing every scene he is in. Also it is worth mentioning the appearance of Klaus Lwitsch as an old cop who still remembers those days before the fall of the wall.Overall an enjoyable movie that despite its Hollywoodish tone complete with feelgood ending it manages to be fresh and more inventive that most Hollywood light comedies. It's definitely worth a rent. 710".

But if you look deeper this is a movie about the difference of people still living in the past and on the other hand people trying to forget their past showing us that neither way will work.It is simple to sympathize with the group for their reluctance to hurt people their very normal lives and their wish to change something in a world they don't feel they can accept.".

Perhaps I'm partial for German films but this was even better because it wasn't about typical German film themes like racial tolerance finding a lost love from the EastWest separation etc. The film told the story of a five anarchists who set a bomb in a government building in Berlin. The bomb's timer stopped and when tampered with 10 or so years later begins where it left off. Suddenly it blows up the nowabandoned building and these five anarchists who are now older and more conservative must reunite and find a way to once again smash the system in order not to get caught. The film concentrated more on plot and less on cinemetography. There were a few nice cinemagraphic scenes however and at the end proved to be a heartwarming film. However the movie was completely unrealistic and didn't touch on the differences of political ideologies as much as the back cover said it would. I think it would have been better if the characters were struggling to identify with each others' new political ideologies while having to work together to realisitically save themselves from their younger anarchistic days.".

In being a slightly older than young idealistactivist myself I found this film very moving. But I think it can appeal to anyone who has had close friendships only to see them pulled apart by approaching adulthood social responsibilities or changes in values. The film actually portrays these young punks in a convincing way unlike many other movies I've seen in which underground or subversive groups are shown in the most basest of stereotypes. The characters' background story or former look is not the focus though so it does rush through that time rather quickly. The main draw in the film is the amazing job it does showing all of the reasons for the group's disbanding. You sympathize with each of the characters and can understand each of their reasons for choosing their current lifestyles. The plot is solid the characters engaging and the dialogue can be quite funny. This is the kind of film that has you laughing crying and cheering all in a span of 2 hrs. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Was tun wenn's brennt? or What to Do in Case of Fire is a German movie from 15 years ago that runs for slightly over 90 minutes without credits. The director is Gregor Schnitzler and the writer duo are Stefan Dhnert and Anne Wild. The movie scored some awards attention including a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the German Film Awards for Martin Feifel. Unfortunately I must say I never felt this was a good watch. My main problem is probably the story. All the action from start to finish never feels realistic in terms of a team of modern terrorists with noble motives though. It is clearly manipulative in trying to convince us the police are the bad guys and the character of Klaus Lwitsch rip becomes one of the good guys in the end too. His character development felt really unrealistic as well. The film certainly tries to evoke emotion in the audience on several occasions and takes itself seriously as a drama too. These two aspects are really hurt by the ridiculous storyline.The cast is pretty spectacular Schweiger Feifel Uhl Blomberg Lwitsch and Striesow are all fairly famous here in Germany. Too bad their characters were not written in a way that they could show us their potential. I also liked how we basically knew nothing about some of the group's characters such as Doris Schretzmayer's. They probably thought. Oh the actress is not that wellknown so people won't care about her anyway. Feel kinda sorry for her. She was just there. All in all I do not recommend the watch. In my opinion the filmmaker's attempt to have the audience feel for the characters did not work. I really didn't care at all what happened to them and honestly I must say I found several of them rather unlikeable. This is a mix of comedy and drama with thriller elements but it does not elaborate in a convincing manner in any of these three areas. Thumbs down.".

In my opinion the filmmaker's attempt to have the audience feel for the characters did not work. I really didn't care at all what happened to them and honestly I must say I found several of them rather unlikeable. This is a mix of comedy and drama with thriller elements but it does not elaborate in a convincing manner in any of these three areas. Thumbs down.";

The movie is about the ones who remained faithful to themselves and the other ones who have forgotten their origins.What makes this movie so special besides it very high entertainmentvalue are the performances of Martin Feifel as Hotte and of Sebstian Blomberg as Mike. Feifel reaches without doubt an Oscarworthy accomplishment. Tim Til Schweiger and Hotte are the last ones from a former small group of a radical political filmclub whose whole live was once determined by the conflicts between East and West Berlin including street battles during one which Hotte lost his legs. 11 years after the group has separated Tim and Hotte are still living in the houseruin where the Kommune used to house without any contacts to the former members. Suddenly a bomb explodes in an empty villa and the police find traces of the former film club. Unfortunately the police investigator who used to fight against the radicals in the glorious times is not yet retired and so he spends considerable time to trace the bomb back. Policedog Manowksy is the last role of the great Klaus Lwitsch which makes this movie especially precious.

The portrayal of terrorists in a kind of situation comedy light didn't strike me as strange at first.It was when they made a bomb out of a fire extinguisher that what I was watching finally struck me.  Shortly before I came to Germany just a couple of weeks before somebody blew up a bomb made out of a fire extinguisher at the American PX in Frankfurt.  It was basically an attempt to kill people at random.  I don't remember how succesful it was.The politics of the group that did it was mostly as confused and futile as that of the characters in the movie.  Ostensibly communists but far from being anything resembling real communists.Somehow after that this movie palled for me.  I just couldn't get into watching killers portrayed as lovable but basically goodhearted knuckelheads with hearts of gold.".

In fact I was living in Germany in 8788 exactly the period the flashback part is set in.I found myself enjoying this movie at first it brought back memories.  The portrayal of terrorists in a kind of situation comedy light didn't strike me as strange at first.It was when they made a bomb out of a fire extinguisher that what I was watching finally struck me.  Shortly before I came to Germany just a couple of weeks before somebody blew up a bomb made out of a fire extinguisher at the American PX in Frankfurt.  It was basically an attempt to kill people at random.  I don't remember how succesful it was.The politics of the group that did it was mostly as confused and futile as that of the characters in the movie.  Ostensibly communists but far from being anything resembling real communists.Somehow after that this movie palled for me.  I just couldn't get into watching killers portrayed as lovable but basically goodhearted knuckelheads with hearts of gold.";

But to invalidate it as art especially in the light of compelling but questionable films such as Baise Moi is wrong.This film is beautiful well made very artistic has great thematic depth and makes a statement.  What more are we looking for when we define something as art?The first clue should be in the title A Real Young Girl.'  Our culture male dominant still is fascinated with sexualizing what are in our cultural context inappropriately young females that is pubescent underaged or more gracefully put blossoming.  This is a complex issue not for discussion here but the point is artistic treatments of this subject have been predominantly male.  So a Real Young Girl may be a statement indicating that the director is going to show you early adolescent female sexuality as it truly is from someone who has experienced it first hand and not as it is eroticized by male artists.I think a big point of this film is that it is not pleasant and not easy not fun or romantic but painful confusing and filled with difficult feelings and disgust.While the film is beautiful and leaves one with a not unpleasant feeling it's a good film the ending is abrupt and funny but no more so than other great avantgarde or newwave filmmakers.The eroticism can in no way be seen as pornography though.  Despite the explicitness of its photography of the vagina especially there is no actual sex and these explicit scenes are mixed with other aspects that open them to complex interpretation.For instance the main character undresses and experiments by putting red ink on her erogenous zones but during the whole scene a fly is very persistently buzzing around the room.  I'm not going to go into detail interpreting but you get my point.Another very explicit scene the character in her fantasy bound with barbedwire spread eagled naked on the ground.  We see very explicit closeup of her vagina but this is concurrent with her fantasy lover dangling a live worm over it and eventually pulling the worm apart and dropping the still squirming bits on her pubis.Or a scene where walking on the beach to another fantasy she drops her panties on the decaying corpse of a dog.Again interpret for yourself but you'll see not only a depth of symbol but a unity of theme in the natural world and decay as related to this young girl's perception of her vagina something akin to stinky swampy pit far from the ripe juicy peach of male imagination.It gives what seems to my male mind a convincing portrayal of early adolescent female sexuality from the perspective of a woman.The director clearly loves the female form but the film is no more explicit and certainly less shocking than say Pasolini's Salo.  In fact if Pier had been attracted to women I suspect he would have given us similarly graphic views instead of tending to orient on penises of extraordinary size.  It's hard to find this film exploitative in comparison to such celebrated films as Last Tango in Paris.I could go on and on but the point is this is not a gray area somewhere near pornography but a valid necessary and probably important though only history will tell work.".

With no real men interested in her sexually aside from it is implied her father and a lecherous man his age she meets while at the fair she turns to her own body for entertainment inventing bizarre autoerotic games for herself such as walking home with her underwear around her ankles or placing it on rotting dog carcasses. It is an unflinching look at a young girl's exploration of the female body  her own  mindless of the regard of the other.That said having first stumbled upon Une vraie jeune fille on the arte channel the other night in my Paris hotel room the shock of the images took over any thought processes I was having as to why these visuals were even present and what they represented. There is a scene where the girl's mother unflinchingly saws at a live chicken's neck with a dull kitchen knife which was obviously not fake the poor chicken!.  In another Alice puts a bottle of vinegar into her own hind quarters.  In one dream scene she writhes tied up on the ground as her love interest tears up an earthworm and places it around and tries to get it in her vagina.  There are lots more where these came from but I'm describing these scenes as they are in my mind and not in the coherent order in which they appeared in the film which is unfair to Breillat's intentions.  Besides any further description of the movie might pass as obscene and be edited out of my commentary.The filmmaker herself has been quoted as saying that she wonders if the spectator can make it beyond the shocking images of her works to the emotions and meaning behind them. It is a tough task she asks of us especially here.  While I liked both Romance and 36 Fillette there is much rapport avec jeune fille  and find Breillat's feminism thoughtprovoking to say the least a film like Une vraie jeune fille is just too hard for most people to sit through I haven't brought myself to eat chicken since seeing jeune fille and can't get the rest of the images out of my head.  Yet through our participationvoyeurism and the heroines' brutal honesty they tell us a certain raw inyourface truth about female sexuality.

She also wrote the screenplay from her novel published the year before.One may be initially confused about the fact that it was made in 1976 but not released until over 20 years later. No it is not a video nasty but it was banned in France and only when films like Salo or Boise Moi got released were we able to see this film.Breillat is not for everybody. The sex in her films is inyourface. You have to look at them with an open mind. They have an artistic value and should be seen for that.The film about a 14yearold's self discovery stars voluptuous Charlotte Alexandra who would later appear in Emmanuelle 3. She explores her body with the boredom and recklessness of a teen and wonders about the studs that she comes into contact with. She fantasizes at times even about her own father. It was just too frank for the censors at the time.This is not for the trenchcoat crowd as there is no sex although her father Bruno Balp sure acts as if he would be willing. His smiles and touches are most unfatherly.The ending was both funny and sad.".

	schema:reviewBody "This the first film by notorious French director Catherine Breillat. It was frequently banned back in its day but I actually found it a lot less disturbing than some of the same director's subsequent efforts i.e. 36 Fillete To My Sister. The film focuses on an adolescent girl who comes home from boarding school to her parents' isolated country home. There she entertains herself by mercilessly teasing the local male rustics and even trying to get a rise out of her own father narcissistically examining her nude body in the mirror putting silverware down the front of her knickers and at one point even buggering herself with a spray bottle. She eventually becomes obsessed with a young married employee of her father's and after a series of increasing bizarre fantasies sets about trying to hamhandedly seduce him. But this is definitely NOT your average comingofage story.Both the French and English titles suggests that this is a story about a REAL as opposed to really young girl. And although her behavior and fantasies are pretty bizarre and often surreal the movie does capture some of perverse morbid nature of adolescence that many coming of age movies avoid. There is an obsession with odors. The girl is fascinated with the smell of her own sex and at one point takes off her panties and puts them on the face of a dead and rotting dog which she perhaps associates with the same smell of decay. There are also bizarre fantasies involving such unusual but certainly perverse and morbid sexual props as earthworms and feathers. The sound of buzzing flies is constantly heard on the soundtrack lending to an oppressive morbid atmosphere of death and decay. Obviously this movie in many ways is not particularly erotic.In her typical fashion though Breillat has cast a beautiful twentysomething softcore porn actress Charlotte Alexandra who also appeared in Immoral Tales and Goodbye Emanuelleas the teenager. This does add some eroticism but obviously takes away from the realism. It's hard to believe a girl that looks like Alexandra would have difficulty seducing ANYBODY and she would certainly be surrounded by both male admirers and female friends even in the most godforsaken part of France. Alexandra is surprisingly good in the role however and she is fairly convincing as a teenager at least with her clothes on. At any rate I'm certainly not going to complain that THIS part wasn't played by an actual fourteenyearold girl or a less physically attractive actress. It would have made it more real I guess but it also would have been pretty damn hard to watch. As it is it's a pretty interesting filma strange mixture of lyrical eroticism and morbid fascination with death and decay.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is rather difficult to review because it doesn't really have a plot to speak of and it's clear that director Catherine Breillat was more keen on focusing on the art elements and detailing the sexual developments of a young girl than telling a story. This is the first film I've seen from Catherine Breillat but given what I've read about her it would seem that she enjoys directing films that focus on sexuality and that would seem to be the case if this film is anything to go by. A Real Young Girl focuses on Alice Bonnard a 'well developed' teenager who attends a boarding school and is spending the summer at her parents' house. She enjoys experimenting and has a particular fascination with fluids as she experiments with all sorts including urine and ear wax as well as egg yolk and tanning cream. She becomes fixated on a man employed by her father as well as a couple of other local men and her father and the film basically follows her summer as things happen to her parents and she develops sexually.Unlike most exploitation films this one takes place from the woman's point of view although the idea that all men are sexobsessed perverts certainly shines through and I wouldn't be surprised to find out that Catherine Breillat is a devout feminist as there isn't one single decent male character in the whole film. The film rests a lot on its star Charlotte Alexandra and she doesn't disappoint. Her performance is thoroughly realistic and she also looks rather tasty which is sure to delight the male viewers. I have to admit that I was expecting to be shocked going into the film and while A Real Young Girl is liable to offend less well versed viewers it would seem I've seen too much of this stuff as nothing in the film seemed too over the top to me. Catherine Breillat clearly isn't afraid to shock the viewers however as the film features plenty of nudity and other perverse scenes. The film features no suspense and the plot really just plods along but it's well paced and while you know that the ending isn't going to provide much intrigue it doesn't matter as anyone looking for a sexually charged film is likely to be satisfied.".

She does not shy away from risqu material on the contrary she courts it. And she makes it terribly sexy as well. Whilst not as good as some of her later stuff this is excellent storytelling and succeeds where Bilitis fails dismally. Perhaps because Breillat was not behind the cameras in Bilitis the whole film was very unbelievable. Une vraie jeune fille on the other hand is completely believable  even her fantasy of 'Jim' ripping up an earthworm and placing the still wriggling pieces onto her vagina is entirely believable. This is partly thanks to outstanding acting by Charlotte Alexandra in the title role but also thanks to tasteful direction. Only another woman could enter Alice's psyche in such a deep and meaningful manner. Hats off to Breillat surely one of the greatest living directors of films not in the English language at this moment in time. Merci beaucoup!".

It's perhaps a movie some females can still recognize themselves in till some extend at least. For me it was just hard to identify with the characters and all of her weird sexual orientated fantasies.It's a movie about a young 14 year old girl played by an 21 year old by the way who has obviously started to hit puberty and is about to discover her sexuality. She starts experimenting a bit and we get to see all of her fantasies that are being put very straightforward to the screen. It means that the movie features plenty of full frontal female and male nudity but also some really disgusting scenes as the little girl is really having some dirty thoughts and fantasies. Pissing puking worms...should I say more? But then again it's not supposed to be a movie obviously that is supposed to turn you on. It's merely a look into the thoughts and fantasies of a girl who is about to discover her sexual identity for the first time. I really don't think this movie could had been made by a male director. It takes a woman to be able to get into a young girls mind and translate and brings to the screen all of the thoughts and feelings she might be having at that certain period in her life. I admire the movie for what it does and attempts to do but as a male it just wasn't all that appealing or throughout interesting to me.As you wouldn't had guessed it already this movie is being an arthouse type of movie. Nothing too heavy although some of the sequences might still be shocking to some people since it has some explicit nudity and some gross out moments in it. But it's at least not a movie that is full of itself and tries too desperately to be an arty and creative one by putting in lots of symbolism and sequences that run overlong.Still you feel that the movie could had done way more with its subject. It could at least had made it a bit more interesting to watch. At times now I was really thinking 'why am I even watching this'. Not that it's boring though the movie was also too short for that but it's also really a movie I could easily had done without.If you are female you might still get something out of this movie and recognize yourself in some parts of the movie or its main character though I still somewhat doubt this. Else females are way more dirty than males if this is the case.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "This may well be the definitive teen angst film of all time. I was in love with Alice Charlotte Alexandra who bears a striking resemblance to Alicia Silverstone in The Crush the moment she began her voiceover narration My name is Alice. I hate people. They oppress me. This future existentialist who in a few years will either be studying phenomonology at the Sorbonne or joining a radical Maoist splinter cell has every reason to feel oppressed. She is returning home from a truly ghastly summer vacation with her philandering dad and her nagging mom and is well on her way to becoming the next Sylvia Plath. A child trapped in a woman's body she's obsessed with her vagina and with bodily fluids but understandably shy among men and terrified of real sex. Some of her fantasies and daydreams are quite odd but hey this is France and we're talking about a fourteenyear old okay? She scandalizes the neighborhood by riding around in her bicycle without any panties and begins a torrid fling with the stud who works at her dad's sawmill Hyram Keller which ends in tragedy when he's killed by her father's wild boar trap. The final shot of Alice is chilling. This film goes on to show once again that adolescence is hell that sex is not all it's cracked out to be that the French countryside is full of mean narrowminded people and parents don't understand. Those looking for a good porno flick will be understandably disappointed but those looking for an insightful analysis of modern man or woman's existential ennui will be richly rewarded. This is the film American Beauty aspired to be.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have yet to be real impressed with any of Catherine Breillat's works that I've seen at this point. All of them tend to have interesting concepts but get lost in their own selfindulgence. Breillat is also known for tackling racy subject matter  but seems to only be able to do so in the most boring manners possible. The weird thing is  I don't really hate any of the three or four films of hers that I've seen  I just can't find much about any of them that I think is all that exceptional either  and A REAL YOUNG GIRL is no exception and honestly  this one is about the dullest of the bunch.Alice is a pre18yearold that is spending her summer at her family's home on break from the boarding school that she attends. Early on we learn that Alice is both sexually naive and adventurous  teeting in a limbo between youthful innocence and sexual maturity. She finds herself bored most of the time and uses this free time to explore her cooch in rather odd fashionswith a spoon with ink sticking a bottle in herself etc... and giving in to strange compulsions walking through fields with her underwear around her ankles riding her bike with her skirt hiked up and her ass showin' leaving her underwear on the corpse of a dead dog fantasizing of a worm being shredded and dropped on her furpie etc... and also with trying to seduce any of the men in her vacinity often to no avail. There's also an obvious but somewhat understated sexualtension between Alice and her father that is never really resolved. The film plods along from one weird scene to another with a good but of boring sh!t in between  and then finally ends abruptly with no resolution or insight provided for the viewer...Soooo...here's the good points The lead lolita is definitely hot and bears all in thefilm  I'll never complain about. There is what some would consider some aberrant sexual behavior that may be of interest to exploitstyle filmfans. The coming of age concept from a uniquely female pointofview is interesting as well. Problem is  the way the film is presented none of it seems to amount to anything  and therein lies the weaknesses. Though Breillat has always seemed to be a bit of a shock artist  she presents things in such a matteroffact and often boring manner that the only ones who will be truly shocked by the material portrayed are prudes who will never watch her films in the first place. It's also kind of a shame that none of the nude or sexuallydriven scenes are in the least bit erotic. I understand that probably isn't the director's intention in the first place but I personally prefer to have some sexuality with my sex. I can also never really find a point to any of her films. I've read other reviews of her films that go on and on about symbolism and whatnot but I don't really see it  maybe it's a French thing. To sum up  A REAL YOUNG GIRL is a semigraphic tale of a girl trying to understand and control her own sexuality  and though effective in some ways it fails on the level that I would think should be most important in this type of film to gain some sort of insight or understanding of this girl's confusion and angst. Instead the whole film feels like a bunch of random and slightly bizarre acts strung together for no real purpose. Not to mention the fact that other than the few choice scenes it's pretty much boring as hell..410 would have been a 210 and nearly unwatchable without the nudity and other juicy bits...".

Granted the girl had a great body but so do half the soft core actresses in Hollywood. If you want a good raunchy sex movie from the 70's look elsewhere bc it's not here.

I'm still not sure whether there was an actual plot or not. I realize the 'real young girl' was going through some pubescent issues or confusion but seriously... if you're going to make a bad film and call it 'psychosexual' you could at least put some good sex scenes in it. Granted the girl had a great body but so do half the soft core actresses in Hollywood. If you want a good raunchy sex movie from the 70's look elsewhere bc it's not here. I want those 93 minutes of my life back.";

I like movies that start quite slowly but that speeds up with every twist and turn. This is a plot where everything starts out nice and easy but that become increasingly more complicated for the characters with every attempt to solve everything. Soon everybody finds themselves in a mess no one can escape. And with every turn it becomes funnier. So it surely works as a fun entertainment when you're tired.And if you want there are some seeds of real importance that you can ponder upon. But really just enjoy the laughs.710".

Mistaken for a burglar in his own house he soon finds himself the hostage in a situation planned by the local chief of police.Comments A surprisingly good comedy. I like movies that start quite slowly but that speeds up with every twist and turn. This is a plot where everything starts out nice and easy but that become increasingly more complicated for the characters with every attempt to solve everything. Soon everybody finds themselves in a mess no one can escape. And with every turn it becomes funnier. So it surely works as a fun entertainment when you're tired.And if you want there are some seeds of real importance that you can ponder upon. But really just enjoy the laughs.710";

	schema:reviewBody "This is an excellent film and definitely one of Rod Taylor's best performances. Taylor is Curry a mercenary commander in the Congo during the Katanga secession. Jim Brown is his friend and number two a US educated Congolese. Taylor plays Curry as a true mercenary of the period ruthless greedy loyal to his comrades and distrustful of his rivals and employers.The film mixes two different periods of the civil wars in the Congo the Katanga secession in 1960 and the Simba revolt in 1964. The original book is set squarely during the Katanga period and involves the Baluba war not the Simba's. However both periods were exemplified by brutality on all sides. The film accurately portrays the enmity between the Katanga forces and the UN troops sent to intervene. It also accurately depicts the Belgian interests in Katanga.Much like the train the mercenaries ride the film starts out slow and builds up steam along the route. By the end it's a runaway that comes crashing to its end. This is war and humanity at its worst make no mistake. The closest I can come to finding a good guy is Jim Brown the soldier who wants his country to be free and have its place in the modern world.The Nazi character was based on an actual German mercenary in the Congo Siegfried Mueller. Mueller was noted for wearing the Iron Cross which he earned in the Second World War on his uniform. The film makers changed it to a swastika for greater effect I presume. There is a slight problem with the continuity of this character as part way through the film his voice is obviously dubbed by another actor. Presumably this was due to sound problems and the unavailability of the actor to loop his lines It sounds like Paul Frees.Allinall this is a great film vastly superior to others of the genre such as The Wild Geese and The Dogs of War. Just remember war more often brings out the worst in humanity rather than the best.".

Presumably this was due to sound problems and the unavailability of the actor to loop his lines It sounds like Paul Frees.Allinall this is a great film vastly superior to others of the genre such as The Wild Geese and The Dogs of War. Just remember war more often brings out the worst in humanity rather than the best.";

A great example of a guy's type of film where the editing direction and storyline all compliment one another in the effort towards a fastpaced action flick. It a raw gritty and satisfying action yarn. Rod Taylor is really choice in this role he was easily in his best shape ever and utterly confident as the hardboiled mercenary leader. Jim Brown is fine as well as his sidekick. The two make a good combination together.Dark of the Sun is also one of the more memorable films involving a train as a locus for the action. Train films have a charisma all their own in my opinion and this one is no exception. In this venue a band of mercenaries utilizes a steam engine to blitz across the border into rebelheld territory. The story is set in South Africa and they been enlisted to to rescue citizens cut off by the revolt and also to nab some diamonds for themselves of course.However dont think that with this storyline its at all meatless in emotion values or gratuituous in terms of its violence.With regard to emotion there are definitely some nice story elements and a chance for the actors to apply their skill. There are poignant little moments of humanness amid all the tumult. The characters suit and have been devised by the author Wilbur Smith to correctly add balance and measure to the story. Its not all gunfire and explosions. The violence is kept within acceptable oldschool bounds and the focus is on heroism and loyalty rather than sadism.There is an interesting thoughtprovoking subplot to the story that eventually factors into the conclusion of the movie. This thread comes from the fact that one of the mercenaries is an exNazi. As a mercenary he really enjoys his work. But his views raise all sorts of disturbing questions about prejudice and hate and where to draw the line  for Rod Taylor who as leader of the mercenaries has to set an example of ruthlessness. The two develop a vicious enmity and finally go at it 'mano a mano'. The end of the film is a surprise man learns better type of endingbut still quite satisfying.The film overall is a betterthanaveragequality product and definitely a mustsee guymovie its a 1960's action pic that does a better job of keeping you interested and absorbed than any twenty action pictures made more recently.Believe it!".

	schema:reviewBody "Take one part Von Ryan's Express one part Wild Geese one part The Road Warrior and one part Dogs Of War and you get a kick butt flick called Dark Of The Sun! I'm at my job and to my great fortune I tuned to TCM Europe and caught this in its entirety I was pretty blown away. I can just imagine the response the movie going public of 1968 America had with race riots and MLK Jr's assassination and all they probably really hated it. The movie depicts what I thought I was going to see in Guns at Batasi Africans revolting violently against unarmed Euro White civilians in the heart of Africa. They definitely do not to my knowledge unless possibly a South African movie make many movies that show the scenes that this movie presents. White on Black hate yes those are made but not the other way around. I was not all that interested in this at first but it definitely got a whole lot better when they get the diamonds I got off my far away seat and got real close to the TV the scenes were just totally unexpected. I thought they were going to get away ala a 1950's Clark GableJohn Wayne adventure which are great also but when I saw that caboose get separated and then it started rolling backwards I said now thats something to watch! It's totally Wild Geese doomsday mission from that point on except its a a hell of a lot bloodier. BTW those are my favorite action movies where all hell breaks loose and the good guys take a lot of casualties much more edge of your seat that way! The only thing that I guess kept this from a restricted rating was at the time they didn't have one yet this movie may have been a mover to placing ratings on movies because they came out shortly afterward I mean it's that action and graphic packed. The ending is overlong with it's morality play but it's worth watching just for the town scene when the mission starts to go horribly wrong. Here's a spoiler a white Afrikaner merc gets captured by the horde and is bent over a pool table without his pants ummm if thats not hardcore I don't know what is well the white nun being raped was right up there also and the white guy being doused with gasoline while being dragged from a motorcycle was also really brutal. I thought about The Road Warrior when I saw that part of the movie it was probably inspired by this great unknown action flick that was probably a little close to the truth on stuff that happened during the Congo's history. 9 of 10 very entertaining for action film viewers.".

I saw it as a kid but it was later when I was around 30 when I caught it on a PBS TV station that I was stunned to realize it is one of my favorite films of all time. I nearly became obsessed with it recording it for repeat viewing sometimes 2 days in a row later buying a quality VHS version and finally obtaining a widescreen version a goal of the last halfdozen years. From the first frame during the credits when you hear the perfect jazzinfluenced score by Jacques Loussier to the haunting ending this film draws you in and doesn't let go inviting you back again  again. I say 'you' but of course I'm speaking of myself I can't really explain the hold it has on me and what director Cardiff put together that connected so strongly with me. Many familiar with this film call it Rod Taylor's best work and I agree there. He epitomizes the man's man here tougher by necessity than all the other tough guys around him able to outfight anyone manoamano and at the same time able to command  demanding and keeping the loyalty of his men. Besides the obvious violence  gunplay throughout are hints and mention of the savagery the brutality of war but nothing can or should faze him  until that is he loses his best friend. This is something the one thing he was unprepared for. And he loses it he loses all his control his command of himself and others. It's a fantastic ending. And like many other scenes complemented by that fabulous score it calls me back over  over. Once again I see that train car break off again I see it slowly roll back to the waiting bloodthirsty Simbas all the passengers doomed. I know what will happen but it demands my attention again as if in a recurring nightmare. I suppose this may be a great thing about films  sure they may not ever make them like this again but you always have these past adventures to savor as many times as you wish. And the films will always give you that same or similar emotional satisfaction you crave.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to believe that a film this vivid and adventuresome is almost completely unknown except to diehard film buffs and fans of Taylor. He plays a mercenary hired to enter the wartorn Congo and retrieve a gaggle of civilians who are stranded in a remote village and who have with them 50 million in diamonds! Brown is his sidekick a native of the area but educated in America to account for his accent and demeanor. They gather up forty soldiers Taylor's former associate and enemy Carsten and boozy doctor More to assist them in their quest. After outfitting a train with sandbags for protection they trek deep into enemy territory. On the way they take on frazzled escapee Mimieux who has just barely avoided death at the hands of violent Simbanese warriors. Many hurdles stand in their way as they try to complete their mission not the least of which is the fact that the diamonds aren't readily available to them upon arrival and the deadly Simba's are hot on the warpath. Before the film is over everyone involved has been in some way affected by the raging warfare and the greed that can appear in men who value money over human life. Taylor does an excellent job in the film giving a thoughtful but rough and tumble performance. His personal appeal goes a long way in selling his sometimes questionable character. Brown always an amiable and pleasant persona on screen is an excellent counterpart to Taylor. Mimieux is more often than not decoration and her point of view seems to shift rather rapidly but she's yet another attractive endearing presence. Carsten is appropriately deplorable and succeeds in making the audience scream for blood. More does a nice job in his supporting role. As is to be expected in a film by former cinematographer Cardiff the scenery is exquisite and the film is pretty to look at even in the violent scenes of which there are more than a few. The score is exceptional and adds a great deal to the drama and suspense of the film. The early sections don't exactly zip along and it seems that maybe the movie will wind up being a tad dull. However once the mission is underway there are many many memorable and tense scenes. Even though little is shown in an exceedingly graphic way the film is quite brutal by the standards of 1968. Lynchings amputations impalings shootings rapes and not just the ladies! abound during the rousing action pieces. Aside from the infamous chainsaw fight there is a gripping scene in which Taylor and Brown infiltrate a hotel filled with rowdy warriors and a heartstopping incident involving the train. Finally there is a knockdown dragout battle in a river that's another eyeopener. The only things that let the film down slightly are an occasional reliance on rear projection and several instances of sloppy editing in which the continuity is somewhat off. There is also a strange section of film in which Carsten's voice is suddenly provided by someone else like Paul Frees! Brutality aside the film also devotes time to the philosophies of war friendship honor trust sacrifice et al. It's that rare bird...a literate action film that delivers. It's not as nailbiting as Zulu but has it's own set of tricks which it presents nicely.".

The script was based on the novel by Wilbur Smith which was called Dark of the Sun rather than The Mercenaries  by all accounts has significant differences although I have not read it. According to the IMDb diamonds aren't mined in the Congo so I guess authenticity wasn't high on the makers agenda despite being set in  around historically accurate events. The plot moves along at a decent pace there's enough action  adventure to stop most viewers becoming bored  it's also a film that tries to have many messages  themes run  develop concurrently along with the story. From the likes of trust friendship redemption the moral problems of war  Colonial rule several themes revolving around racism  the exploration of several strikingly different mens motives for being who they actually are  why they are doing what they are doing. One good aspect is that the moral issues never really bog down the main story  are fairly well judged sure by the end it might have spent a little bit too long on the drama aspects but not really at the expense of the action  I personally thought it was a well paced  well judged film never letting any one particular aspect overtake the film as a whole. Clocking in at around the 100 minute mark the film doesn't outstay it's welcome  it never becomes boring but for some reason it never really excited me it never really drew me in or engaged me the character's were broad stereotypes  I also thought it was a little predictable. The Mercenaries is good for sure but just how good will probably depend on the viewers tastes I think most people would enjoy it like me but maybe not everyone would love it like me.The Mercenaries actually looks terrific  was apparently shot on location in Jamaica the jungle scenery is very nice lush  exotic with director  cinematographer Cardiff making good use of the 2351 Panavision frame  full widescreen is really the only way you should be watching this. For a fairly obscure film such as The Mercenaries a lot of time  effort seems to have been lavished on it the sets the action the location filming  cast are very good  very polished. The action scenes are fun  suitably explosive there is a bit of blood a bit of torture at the end a cool chainsaw fight  some bad language which all seem tame by 2008 standards but for a mainstream film way in 1968 this was probably quite shocking  graphic.The production values are high  the film looks really nice with good stunt work  effects. The acting is pretty good although not outstanding Rod Taylor  Jim brown make likable heroes while the obligatory female love interest Yvette Mimieux has little to do.The Mercenaries is a good old fashioned action adventure film that I liked but didn't love despite not being able to say exactly why there was something about it that left me a bit cold  detached.

Throw in a load of cliches like a drunken doctor  a damsal in distress  a nazi war criminal  a redemption sub plot with the hero gaining his humanity  tedious moral dialogue about the future of Africa and several revealing mistakes where the victims of Simba violence are quite clearly stuffed dummies and you might think this is a really bad film . Maybe it is but its also good old fashioned entertainment . The battle scenes may have dated somewhat compared to BLACK HAWK DOWN and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN but they still pack a punch especially the editing when the action cuts from the Simba hordes attacking the train to the hero and the banker waiting patiently for the time lock to open the vault where the diamonds are stored. If you liked THE WILD GEESE youll like this film too".

	schema:reviewBody "Civil war in the Congo is the backdrop for this great adventure flick. CurryRod Taylor is a soldier for hire. Along with his sidekick RuffoJim Brown they assemble an army to bring a small group of people as well as 50 million in diamonds to safety in only three days. Along with them is HenleinPerter Carsten and 40 of his men. After an attack from a U.N. plane they pick up ClairYvette Mimieux. Her husband? was killed and she barely escapes with her life. Later adventures involve a chainsaw fight as well as a tense period while waiting for a safe to open. Simbas attack them and the diamonds as well as rescued people are lost. Curry and Ruffo devise a plan to recover the diamonds which works out. After the diamonds are recovered Curry goes on a mission to get fuel. While he is away Henlein kills Ruffo. Curry returns hunts down Henlein and kills him. After some reflection he submits to a future court martial proceeding at which time the movie ends.The plot is a straightforward one. If you liked the Dirty Dozen or Von Ryan's Express then this one is for you. What makes this film so great is the intensebrutal action and the characters involved. Rod Taylor doesn't just act his role he attacks it with flair and style. He is a very capable leading man and he shows it here. He portrays Curry as tough witty sometimes brutal but sometimes humane.Jim Brown plays Ruffo and while Brown is no great actor his presence alone fills the screen. Ruffo may be the only true good man in the movie. He doesn't do it for the money but for pride in his country.The polar opposite of Ruffo is Henlein. A former Nazi he is inhumane. He kills two childrenoff screen thankfully. He also tries to kill Curry and does kill Ruffo before Curry gives him what he deserves. Peter Carsten plays him to the hilt and the fact that you hate Henlein so much is a testament to Carsten's ability.My only real criticism of the film is Clair. Let me preface all of this by saying that I think Yvette Mimieux is a good actress and awesome to look at but Clair isn't given enough to do. She has a very good scene at a small field hospital where she stands up to Curry and a drunken doctor when a woman needs medical care but there isn't enough of that type of dialogue for her. She seems relegated to the background for most of the movie. Still she's a real beauty and I love gazing at her hotness.Lots of other actors make this movie great and I really recommend it. It's gory and brutal but not gratuitously so. The violence is what we'd expect in a civil uprising. To me it should be considered up there with the best films of the genre.".

I have the feeling the American version had an important side of the coin taken out More interesting than the routine plot of escorting diamonds in a train through areas infested with wildman rebels is the inner struggle of Rod Taylor's character with the omnipresent racism towards his black pal mainly shown by Sergeant Henlein played by very German actor Peter Carsten. In the German dubbed version this is explained well Taylor  who has got the German name Willy Krger  and Henlein were comrades in the Nazi Wehrmacht. The bad guy still acts like a nazi while TaylorKrger even tries to forget his past by being a complete almost antipatriotic mercenary. Technically the film does not fail to entertain.

	schema:reviewBody "Hi I'm glad to see that so many people share my view of this great but unsung film but shame there are so many big factual errors. Someone said it's 'set in South Africa' another that it takes place during the 'Katanga revolt'. In fact it takes place in the second part of the Congo civil war a completely separate conflict and long after the Katanga revolt had been crushed. In 1964 radical leftist followers of the assassinated President Lumumba began a revolt in NE Congo the area furthest removed from the capital Leopoldville Kinshasa and nowhere near Katanga which is south of the capital. It spread quickly until it reached Stanleyville today Kisanghani. This is the period in which the film is set. The rebels were known as 'simbas' which means 'lions' and were driven on by witch doctors so they believed they were invulnerable to bullets attacked govt units relentlessly spreading panic among the Congo army a tactic which brought the Simbas early and spectacular success. The Congo govt of Tshombe the failed rebel leader of the Katanga revolt responded by recruiting mercenaries under 'Mad' Mike Hoare who had fought for him in Katanga. The Curry character is clearly based on Hoare. They were very successful in driving back the Simbas and liberating Stanleyville and many western hostages documented in Hoare's book 'Congo Mercenary'. These true heroic events are the basis of the film not the Katanga revolt in which Hoare and his men had a much more sinister and 'mercenary' role. The mercenaries' bad reputation from this earlier is clearly referred to the scenes where Curry's clashes with the UN Officer and the journalist at the bar and this would have been well understood at the time.It was love at first sight when I saw the film the combination of fastpaced action and grisly violence and enough intelligence and fact made a compelling combination. It came as a complete surprise to me when I caught it on TCM on a sizzling hot evening in summer 2003 and by luck I recorded it. The film is years ahead of its time more like something you'd expect to see in the 70s. All the actors do a great job especially Taylor. The Jim Brown character is by contrast a politically correct fantasy. The title 'Dark of the Sun' is obviously a reference to Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' also sent in the Congo and there are some similarities the train being sucked deeper into the jungle to meet an unknown fate where even 'civilized' westerners are turned into brutal savages in order to survive. I think Cardiff works this theme very well. He actually said some of the true stories of violence during the revolt had 'turned his stomach' so he toned it down in the film but they are still fairly shocking. The scene of the train full of rescued Belgian civilians unexpectedly rolling back into the depot and into the hands of bloodthirsty Simbas is one of the creepiest moments on celluloid.In Germany the film is erroneously called 'katanga' and interestingly the part where Peter Carsten as the Nazi mercenary Henlein summarily shoots two children as spies is cut. The Carsten character is based on an authentic German mercenary called 'Congo Mller' who fought alongside Hoare. He actually had an Iron Cross not a Swastika on his breast pocket. But Cardiff cleverly incorporates many of these well known facts and reports of the Congo mercenaries that both glamorized and demonized them at the same time. The characters and events would have been easily recognizable to audiences when the film was made. I've also read that Laurence Kabila the assassinated father of Congo's president was a Simba and that as a Ugandan army officer Idi Amin was sent on a mission to train Simba rebels.".

The film is years ahead of its time more like something you'd expect to see in the 70s. All the actors do a great job especially Taylor. The Jim Brown character is by contrast a politically correct fantasy. The title 'Dark of the Sun' is obviously a reference to Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' also sent in the Congo and there are some similarities the train being sucked deeper into the jungle to meet an unknown fate where even 'civilized' westerners are turned into brutal savages in order to survive. I think Cardiff works this theme very well. He actually said some of the true stories of violence during the revolt had 'turned his stomach' so he toned it down in the film but they are still fairly shocking. The scene of the train full of rescued Belgian civilians unexpectedly rolling back into the depot and into the hands of bloodthirsty Simbas is one of the creepiest moments on celluloid.In Germany the film is erroneously called 'katanga' and interestingly the part where Peter Carsten as the Nazi mercenary Henlein summarily shoots two children as spies is cut. The Carsten character is based on an authentic German mercenary called 'Congo Mller' who fought alongside Hoare. He actually had an Iron Cross not a Swastika on his breast pocket. But Cardiff cleverly incorporates many of these well known facts and reports of the Congo mercenaries that both glamorized and demonized them at the same time. The characters and events would have been easily recognizable to audiences when the film was made. I've also read that Laurence Kabila the assassinated father of Congo's president was a Simba and that as a Ugandan army officer Idi Amin was sent on a mission to train Simba rebels.";

The whole story takes place in UN occupied wartorn Congo. The government forces are fighting against a rebel group called Simba who control a large part of the territory by force while the rest of the country is under protection by UN peacekeepers. The two men gather a group of mercenaries including a Nazi war criminal an alcoholic doctor and the leader of a squad from the Congolese army with troops. Curry is paid 50000 dollars seems like a pretty good deal for the Congolese President!! to go behind enemy lines and bring back the diamonds the superintendent responsible for overseeing the operation of the mine and his beautiful daughter.There is a lot of racial tension in this film. Especially between Curry and Ruffo as Curry at the beginning of the film at least considers Ruffo his inferior based solely on his race. There are also a lot of racially tense moments involving Nazi war criminal turned mercenary Heinlein and pretty much everyone that isn't white. Curry always attempts to demean Ruffo  but Ruffo's positive outlook on life allows him to take the blows without being terribly bothered. In the long run though Curry will realize that he is not giving Ruffo as much credit as he deserves. The two men were there for very different reasons Curry to make money and Ruffo to help the people suffering from the Simbanese oppression. Curry's ignorance wears off as the film progresses and he becomes closer to Ruffo though these tensions do lead to the film's climax.The film is setup similar to Buster Keaton's The General only more serious and less comedic in its form. But similarly they acquire a mission begin on their journey by train dealing with a few obstacles before reaching their destination meeting some tense moments before escape and the chase and conflict involved with making it back to safety. A very classically organized film but one so absorbed with action and politics that it makes for one helluva spectacular film. There are a lot of awesome action sequences.This is a great politically oriented actioner worth checking out. 7.5 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Long Ships director Jack Cardiff made one of the greatest and most rugged mercenary movies of the 20th century when he helmed the Rod Taylor  Jim Brown actioneer Dark of the Sun in 1968. Roughhewn mercenary Captain Curry Rod Taylor of The Time Machine agrees to take a specially madeup train 300 miles into the wartorn Congo to retrieve 50million in diamonds before a savage bloodthirsty Simba army can laid their hands on it. Congolese president Mwamini Ubi Calvin Lockhart of Uptown Saturday Night offers to pay Curry 25thousand dollars when he delivers the ice. Curry demands 50thousand. Ruffo Jim Brown of Rio Conchos is a Congoborn mercenary soldier who serves as Curry's sergeant. We learn that his character went to the University of Southern California and didn't have his teeth filed according to the custom of his tribal ancestors. This dangerous mission represents more than a matter of national interest for him. Anyway Ubi tells Curry that the train is designed as public relations ploy to save a number of whites trapped in enemyheld territory. However neither Ubi nor corporate interests are interested in saving anybody. The diamonds are priceless to Ubi and company because the banks in Europe are calling in his loans. Curry takes 50 elite soldiers from the nation's army. Unfortunately the commander Henlein Peter Carsten of Stalingrad Dogs Do You Want to Live Forever? decides to come along after he learns about the fortune in uncut diamonds. Carsten makes a memorable villain. Curry hates Henlein because Henlein is a former Nazi soldier who loves to parade around with his swastika displayed conspicuously on his chest. At one point in the Turner Classic Movies' version that I saw Henlein finds two small Congo children a little boy and girl in the jungle near the railway tracks. Curry and Ruffo question them and turn them back over to Henlein. Curry orders him to give them some food and turn them loose. Instead the ultraparanoid Henlein guns them down in cold blood. We don't see Henlein shoot them but we do see their blood soaked bodies. This is a rather grim scene. Meantime Curry has to enlist the aid of an alcoholic medical doctor Dr. Wreid Kenneth More of Flame Over India but Wreid refuses until he learns he will receive a case of good whiskey and a 100aday for sewing up bullet wounds. No sooner than our heroes made up their train and pulled out than they run into a United Nations fighter plane cruising the area. Although they received United Nations clearance to embark on their mission they find themselves pitted against a conscientious pilot who knows nothing about the agreement. The pilot strafes the train. Curry and company blaze away with their machine guns and eventually bring him down. By now Dr. Wreid awakens to learn that Curry has pitched the case of liquor and expects him to start doing his job. Along the way they pick up a passenger French refugee Claire Yvette Mimeux of The Time Machine and chug into the town. Meanwhile the sadistic leader of the rebel SimbasGeneral Moses Danny Daniels is closing in on Curry. The catch is that the diamonds are locked up in a bank in a time vault that will not open for three hours. Reportedly Dark of the Sun was inspired by a real event that occurred in the late 1950s in the Belgian Congo. Despite being made in 1968 Dark of the Sun pulls no punches and gets pretty grisly at times. Cardiff lensed this film on location in Jamaica. The heroes rarely catch a break in this movie in this harrowing actionpacked thriller.".

The action is good but sporadic. The conflict over the mission what each character represented and the ending are too diverse. The distractions with respect to asides within the movie were not necessary and made the film longer than necessary.

This is one of those movies that if you didn't know exactly when it was made it would be hard to guess and there are very few of those types around. The screenplay rolls right along like the runaway train depicted herein and the soundtrack is exciting and cool.One of the problems I have with the story is the background of the mercenaries themselves. For instance Rod Taylor's characterwhere is he from? Why is he a mercenary? The characters are all interesting we just want to know what makes them tick. The political and historical background well we take that for granted but it seems strange that these guys are all down in the Congo for different reasons and it's never explained.There is one gripping scene with Rod Taylor and Jim Brown on the train where Brown explains his African heritage. He might not be a great actor but he has unbeatable on screen intensity. Rod Taylor is also a fascinating screen presence usually he seemed like too much of a nice guy for tough roles but here he's pretty cool.".

Yet this is not Jesus Franco's standard garbage but rather an interesting Freudian interpretation of Jack the Ripper which deviates far enough from the actual historical facts to allow for a few surprises along the way.The cinematography is generally good. The editing and pace are decidedly unamerican and will turn off mainstream audiences. the film proceeds at a steady pace but features dialog which is more oriented toward driving the plot than elaborating the characters. The cast is pretty uneven but strong support comes from Menkopff Chaplin and Fux. Kinski's role though not much of a challenge for him is interpreted with the great actor's usual intensity. The sets though not particularly London and a tad anachronistic at times are detailed and enjoyable in their own right.What the film does successfully  and again it's not all Kinski  is to create a tense and disturbing atmosphere punctuated with occasionally graphic scenes of sexual and bloody violence. Along the way the director presents an interpretation of Jack the Ripper which is straight out of Freudian pop psychology. The effect is powerful and the film is memorable.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a Jess Franco fan but even I will admit that he is a frustratingly uneven director. Franco is a very intelligent guy a child music prodigy a student at the Sorbonne worked with Orson Welles on 'Chimes At Midnight' but he has been way too prolific for his own good. Almost always working with very small budgets his movies often appear to be rushed and in some ways unfinished. On the other hand most of us having been watching lousy prints via video often censored and generally badly dubbed so we haven't really been getting to see his work as he originally intended it. 'Jack The Ripper' is a case in point it has now been digitally restored and looks fabulous and watching it in German with subtitles instead of a silly dubbed version makes you appreciate it a great deal more. Ripper fans will no doubt be extremely puzzled by this movie as it has virtually nothing to do with the facts of the case but Franco fans are sure to be entertained. The movie was filmed in Zurich instead of London and while aesthetically it doesn't entirely convince and the whole approach is sometimes quite confusing just who exactly is the woman in the greenhouse who talks about pretty dolls and dumps the bodies?? you very quickly get used to it. Klaus Kinski in his fourth and last collaboration with Franco plays the Ripper and he is absolutely terrific. The bigger a fan of Kinski you are the more you will enjoy this movie. His character is named Orloff which is not really that much of a surprise and really this has a lot more in common with Franco's 'The Awful Dr Orloff' 1962 than any other Ripper movie I've ever seen. In Franco's world the Ripper is a well loved doctor who helps the poor of London while simultaneously leading a double life. Tormented by hallucinations of his dead mother a prostitute he viciously slaughters streetwalkers chops them up and dumps their body parts in the Thames. Andreas Mannkopf plays Inspector Selby why Selby and not Abberline? who knows... the policeman on the trail of the Ripper and his estranged girlfriend Cynthia Josephine Chaplin a dancer uses herself as Ripper bait. Franco's wife and frequent star Lina Romay has a memorable cameo as a Ripper victim and Hans Gaugler plays a blind man whose heightened senses prove to be invaluable help to Selby in discovering the Ripper. 'Jack The Ripper' is quite different from most of Franco's best known movies 'Vampyros Lesbos' 'Succubus' 'Eugenie De Sade' but the more I see of his astonishing 180 output the more I think that he's an extremely underrated film maker who has covered a lot more territory than he is given credit for. Swiss producer Erwin C. Dietrich collaborated with Franco on fifteen! movies between 1975 and 1977 and has plans to rerelease them all on DVD restored and uncut. I'm sure that if he does this then Franco's reputation will continue to grow.".

There is also some gore which  at least on some occasions  would have better been left out.What is equally untypical for a Franco movie are the production values. One can see that Franco worked on a higher budget. The film plays most of the time during the night and the night photography is carried out in an excellent way. The scene when Lina Romay is killed in a foggy park is certainly one of the best Franco has ever filmed. A funny fact here is that apart from a few exteriors like Big Ben all the movie was shot in Zuerich Switzerland. It is much fun to see how Franco has transformed this into London especially if you know the places in Zuerich Franco used. The interiors are also nice and colourful and this is complemented by the costumes. Finally the great plus of the movie is that is has Klaus Kinsky in it. Kinsky was one of the few actors who could create a certain ambiance by their mere presence. Of course Kinsky's acting is also very subtle. Especially his transformations from philanthrop into madman and back.The only thing which spoiled my viewing of Jack the Ripper a bit where some stupid beginner's mistakes by Franco. The two most obvious ones are 1 Klaus Kinsky standing at the wrong side of the car when he meets the inspector's girl friend 2 When Lina Romay is killed the puppet used for the cheap looking gore effect is lit in a completely false color maybe this is the producer's fault who might have insisted on including some gore. One less obvious mistake occurs at the beginning The first hooker which is killed walks on her way home! back half the way she came.All in all Jack the Ripper is an atmospheric unpretentious and well directed slasher movie with a formidable Klaus Kinsky as the madman.".

	schema:headline " Kinski cuts and runs...";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me begin this review with the statement that DVD packaging does make or break a film. Also DVD packaging that attempts to be creative and exciting when it is actually not will only break a film. I mention this because it is what I experienced with Jack the Ripper on DVD. When the film's menu started it seemed like there was some time and effort put into this release.As the menu opens there is Kinski's spooky eye twitching back and forth with several options for special features and extras. I was impressed I thought that this film would just start without really any detail going into the DVD. This is what I thought until I tried to work the audio options. With my German not up to par I needed some subtitles or anything to help translate this film. What I discovered were flags for different countries to have the characters speak. This was a dubbed film and the only flag that I knew since there was no American flag was Britain's flag. A made the choice and changed the outlook on this film forever. While it was grizzly to watch there was quite a bit of humor behind it as Dgrade British actors attempt to dub over German words. The character voice placement was horrendous. The main police officer sounded more effeminate than respectable and the others had this feel that they were behind the microphone speaking their lines. You never really felt like the voices matched the characters. What began as a developed horror story soon turned into a possible MST3K episode. It really detracted from the overall feel of the film.This was my first Jesus Franco film and let me say I was taken aback. I wasn't expecting to see the gore and disgusting acts that Jack the Ripper did to these unsuspecting women. Franco holds nothing back from these deeds. The blood is fake the bodies are doubles and Franco is behind the camera making this all work. Outside of Clint Howard Franco could be a master of this genre. I need to see more of his work but this initial taste left a flavor in my mouth I cannot seem to fathom. I was impressed and not impressed with this body of work. Kinski did a fantastic job of creating this hellish creature devoid of fear and compassion. The raw power in his eyes alone will send shivers up your spine as you sit in the comfort of your own couch. This was awesome to see but then on the other side of the spectrum the voice and sound that came from Kinski's mouth was embarrassing. You were scared yet laughing at the same time. This is the first time that I have ever experienced this feeling while watching a film. Kinski pulled me into this film but the sound yanked me back out.Before you expect too much from this film you need to realize that this was a Brated horror film.

	onyx:emotionText "Let me begin this review with the statement that DVD packaging does make or break a film. Also DVD packaging that attempts to be creative and exciting when it is actually not will only break a film. I mention this because it is what I experienced with Jack the Ripper on DVD. When the film's menu started it seemed like there was some time and effort put into this release.As the menu opens there is Kinski's spooky eye twitching back and forth with several options for special features and extras. I was impressed I thought that this film would just start without really any detail going into the DVD. This is what I thought until I tried to work the audio options. With my German not up to par I needed some subtitles or anything to help translate this film. What I discovered were flags for different countries to have the characters speak. This was a dubbed film and the only flag that I knew since there was no American flag was Britain's flag. A made the choice and changed the outlook on this film forever. While it was grizzly to watch there was quite a bit of humor behind it as Dgrade British actors attempt to dub over German words. The character voice placement was horrendous. The main police officer sounded more effeminate than respectable and the others had this feel that they were behind the microphone speaking their lines. You never really felt like the voices matched the characters. What began as a developed horror story soon turned into a possible MST3K episode. It really detracted from the overall feel of the film.This was my first Jesus Franco film and let me say I was taken aback. I wasn't expecting to see the gore and disgusting acts that Jack the Ripper did to these unsuspecting women. Franco holds nothing back from these deeds. The blood is fake the bodies are doubles and Franco is behind the camera making this all work. Outside of Clint Howard Franco could be a master of this genre. I need to see more of his work but this initial taste left a flavor in my mouth I cannot seem to fathom. I was impressed and not impressed with this body of work. Kinski did a fantastic job of creating this hellish creature devoid of fear and compassion. The raw power in his eyes alone will send shivers up your spine as you sit in the comfort of your own couch. This was awesome to see but then on the other side of the spectrum the voice and sound that came from Kinski's mouth was embarrassing. You were scared yet laughing at the same time. This is the first time that I have ever experienced this feeling while watching a film. Kinski pulled me into this film but the sound yanked me back out.Before you expect too much from this film you need to realize that this was a Brated horror film. The young women show their breasts they run into the woods instead of into safety there are dark alleyways and implausible characters. This is not a film to win awards but to a newbie into the world of Jesus Franco it was fascinating. This was not in anyway the caliber of From Hell because it is a slasher film to the utmost degree.

The story is funny because Franco portrays ol' Jack as a sexual maniac whose mother was a whore and who now feels the urge to kill all prostitutes to seek some kind of revenge.  He slashes their throats and then has sex with the dying ladies which leads to some very amusing scenes.  However we can feel that all the way Franco had some kind of fat producer sitting on him cuz the hardcore sex and the useless gore isn't really there.

But even for those who are not into exploitative horror flicks Kinski is always a good reason to watch a movie and playing madmen was probably the greatest talent of this brilliant actor.The movie's suspense is not built up by any mysteries since it is clear from the first minute who Jack The Ripper is. Dr. Dennis Orloff Kinskiis a charitable man as he offers medical treatment to his poor clients although they are not able to pay him well. At night however the respectable doctor prowls London's streets brutally murdering and mutilating young streetwalkers...As I mentioned above it is known from the first minute that Dr. Orloff is Jack The Ripper. Suspense is still granted by the movie's raw sleazy atmosphere and its nastiness and brutality. I don't want to give any parts of the movie away but I can assure that one can expect lots of sleaze as well as some extremely violent murders. Besides Kinski who is a great enrichment to any movie Jack The Ripper also features Josephine Chaplin Lina Romay and the Austrian actor Herbert Fux who recently passed away.There may be better film adaptations of the Jack The Ripper Case such as the Hughes Brothers' From Hell of 2001 but Jess Franco's Jack The Ripper is definitely the nastiest. The movie may be as historically inaccurate as it gets but it is certainly a treat for fans of 70s European Horror exploitation. Recommended to fans of Jess Franco andor Klaus Kinski I personally had a great time! 610".

	schema:reviewBody "This version of the oftfilmed story doesn't bother to hide who The Ripper is. By day he is the kindly and well liked doctor Dennis Orloff the oneofakind well cast Klaus Kinski. By night he gives in to his homicidal and kinky impulses and becomes The Ripper. Scotland Yard is represented by the dedicated Inspector Selby played by the stone faced Andreas Mannkopff who relies on the testimony of witnesses who happen to encounter Dennis  Jack one way or another.Jack the Ripper '76 is far and away one of director Jess Franco's best in this viewers' humble opinion. Fans of his ultra trashy output need not worry for the degree of sleaze is kept at a respectable level there's nudity aplenty but Franco does not just focus on sex and perversions here. A reasonable attempt is made at good atmosphere and good period detail this benefits from some solid production value. Franco who also wrote the screenplay creates a compelling and sober depiction of one mans' severe psychosexual hangups. Things do get quite violent  one victim is chopped up repeatedly Herschell Gordon Lewis style. And the English dialogue does include some effective and literate lines.Franco gets superb performances out of his cast. His longtime muse the sensual Lina Romay appears as one of the victims. Josephine Chaplin one of Charlie C.'s daughters has the leading lady role. Herbert Fux is great fun as Charlie the fisherman who hooks something unpleasant at one point. Hans Gaugler is excellent as Mr. Bridger the old blind man who makes up in smarts  as well as knowledge of unique smells  what he lacks in visual ability. Olga Gebhard is good as the landlady Mrs. Baxter who's touching when her efforts to reach out to her aloof tenant don't pay off. But Kinski rightfully commands most of ones' attention as he was always able to do. He sure can play crazy well but here he gets to show other facets to what might have been a onedimensional psychopath character otherwise.In terms of end results this may be one of the most accomplished things that Franco ever did with a striking surreal hallucination sequence rating as a standout.Seven out of 10.".

Scotland Yard is represented by the dedicated Inspector Selby played by the stone faced Andreas Mannkopff who relies on the testimony of witnesses who happen to encounter Dennis  Jack one way or another.Jack the Ripper '76 is far and away one of director Jess Franco's best in this viewers' humble opinion. Fans of his ultra trashy output need not worry for the degree of sleaze is kept at a respectable level there's nudity aplenty but Franco does not just focus on sex and perversions here. A reasonable attempt is made at good atmosphere and good period detail this benefits from some solid production value. Franco who also wrote the screenplay creates a compelling and sober depiction of one mans' severe psychosexual hangups. Things do get quite violent  one victim is chopped up repeatedly Herschell Gordon Lewis style. And the English dialogue does include some effective and literate lines.Franco gets superb performances out of his cast. His longtime muse the sensual Lina Romay appears as one of the victims. Josephine Chaplin one of Charlie C.'s daughters has the leading lady role. Herbert Fux is great fun as Charlie the fisherman who hooks something unpleasant at one point. Hans Gaugler is excellent as Mr. Bridger the old blind man who makes up in smarts  as well as knowledge of unique smells  what he lacks in visual ability. Olga Gebhard is good as the landlady Mrs. Baxter who's touching when her efforts to reach out to her aloof tenant don't pay off. But Kinski rightfully commands most of ones' attention as he was always able to do. He sure can play crazy well but here he gets to show other facets to what might have been a onedimensional psychopath character otherwise.In terms of end results this may be one of the most accomplished things that Franco ever did with a striking surreal hallucination sequence rating as a standout.Seven out of 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "Jess Franco is well known as one of the exploitation genre's most prolific directors so it was inevitable that he would get around to filming a version of the Jack the Ripper events before long. It was also inevitable that he would be less interested in the facts of the case than in delivering a film packed full of sleaze nudity and violence as well as his customary directorial inelegance. I know the guy has his fans but when he shoots a bunch of scenes in near total blackness and in others just veers off and zooms into a tree I can't respect him. The editing on this film is poor and only a single scene is what I would call well directed this is when victim Lina Romay is stalked through a foggy park at night. Great shots all of them up there with the most atmospheric of the Gothic horrors to come from '70s Europe but for the rest of the film the direction is a bore.The film is a coproduction between Switzerland and West Germany and other than a few framing shots of Big Ben was filmed abroad. I thought the settings looked quite nice. I also enjoyed the fact that much of the facts were changed after all there have been countless film versions of the Ripper story so the new elements  like Jack dumping body parts in the Thames  felt fresh and intriguing. In essence of course this is an excuse for lots of stalkandslash sequences of bloody Jack hunting his prostitute victims and these scenes work because of Klaus Kinski. Really I can't imagine anybody else who would have been better for the part during this period he captures the madness of the killer through his eyes alone and he really is a frightening guy. Opposite him we get Franco regular Herbert Fux as a sleazy fisherman Lina Romay as a shortlived victim and in a bit of a casting coup Josephine Chaplin as a copper's girlfriend. Chaplin was the daughter of silent movie star Charlie and I don't imagine he would have been very impressed by seeing her stripped and menaced here! The print I watched  a horrid US version  is hilariously dubbed with bad British accents to represent Victorian London although the language used  prithee kind sir would have been more at home in Elizabethan England! Still even with all the negatives this is a dark and atmospheric film that probably fits best with the German wave of krimis from the 1960s. As such it's one of Franco's most successful efforts and an intriguing little slice of '70s Eurohorror even if the ending is a bit lacklustre.".

Inspector Selby starts to feel the pressure  has next to nothing to go on feeling neglected his girlfriend Cynthia Josephine Chaplin decides to help him out. Cynthia dresses up as a whore  puts herself about hoping that she will attract the attentions of Jack the Ripper...This Swiss German coproduction was written  directed by Jesus Franco  while a lot classier than his usual output his take on Jack the Ripper isn't particularly good. The script  how Franco approaches the story is a problem for starter the identity of Jack the Ripper is revealed within the first few minutes so there is no mystery element whatsoever which then basically turns the film into a slasher like Halloween 1978 or Friday the 13th 1980. Franco never really develops any aspect of his script to any degree of satisfaction the incompetent Selby comes  goes  doesn't do much the blackmailing of the Ripper is given a few minutes  nothing more nothing about his assistant is explained like the small matter of why she helps him Cynthia for most of the film doesn't feature until the end where she offers herself up as bait which raises questions in itself. Why? What if she did meet the Ripper? No one knew what she was doing so why wouldn't he just slice her up like his other victims? No one she knew was threatened by the Ripper so why go it alone  risk her life? The only connection she has to the case is that her boyfriend was working on it not good enough motivation for me I'm afraid. There are obvious glaring inaccuracies as well this is definitely not based on any solid evidence  feels like a slasher film with Jack the Ripper as the killer nothing more. The Swiss locations double up as Victorian London surprisingly well except for the Thames for which Franco uses a stream  as someone who lives in the UK these scenes are actually quite funny to me. The film has an end which feels rushed  as a whole the film is far too slow  frankly dull while the Ripper's motivations are barely touched upon  are lazy  unoriginal to say the least. Director Franco has gained a reputation for sleaze so it may come as a surprise that Jack the Ripper is disappointingly tame there are three or four scenes with nudity  only one big gore scene when the Ripper stabs a woman starts to have sex with her  slices her breast off other than that there is a severed hand an eyeball  a couple of stabbings. On the positive side it's very well made for a Franco film  he shows that he does have at least some basic talent behind the camera if he puts the effort in. The cinematography by Peter Baumgartner  Peter Spoerri is very good for the most part with some excellent  atmospheric location shots plus a strong sense  use of colour throughout. The sets are convincing enough  pleasantly detailed while the costumes look a little suspicious like Franco stole or hired them from a local fancy dress shop but serve the film well. The dialogue  dubbing are ridiculous  totally remove any credibility the film may have had people just don't naturally talk like this  you have to listen to some of this stuff to believe it. Basically the story isn't great it just didn't grip or engage me as we all know who the Ripper is from the start. It's very slow has a low body count with just three  very little exploitation with barely any nudity or gore  just didn't do much for me overall although having said that it's fairly watchable if your desperate. Stylish  well made but nothing special probably just about worth a watch I suppose.".

	schema:headline " Jess the Ripoff artist.";
	schema:reviewBody "Like the case with many of his films it's not very clear to me what exactly Jess Franco intended to accomplish with his very personal interpretation of the notorious tale of London serial killer Jack The Ripper. This film is probably the least accurate retelling of the facts and also the narrative style is rather unusual. Foremost Franco's Jack the Ripper was entirely shot in Switzerland and even though he really tried to imitate the dark and fogenshrouded lateVictorian alleys and typically British workingclass pubs the settings simply aren't convincing. Never at one point you have the impression that the events takes place in England and so this production is already fatally implausible to begin with. The ripper's modus operandi for committing the murders and dumping the bodies is also different and completely fictionalized. Since when did Jackieboy take the dead prostitutes home with him to perform autopsies or relied on his retarded housekeeper to dump the remainders in a river? To my recollection the victims' bodies never left the scene of the crime as the Ripper wanted the authorities to find them instantly in order to raise fear and mayhem. Most of all this is probably the only version of Jack the Ripper in which his identity gets revealed immediately and the plot even makes assumptions about what started his urge to kill  mutilate luscious women. Of course if the DVDcover proudly advertises Klaus Kinski's name and scary face there isn't much mystery left regarding the culprit's identity. He's the creepy maniac responsibly period. The most logical explanation is probably the correct one Jess Franco had absolutely no intentions of making a complex and convoluted whodunitthriller but simply wanted a straightforward exploitation flick with sleaze and violence and since Jack The Ripper is a topic that is guaranteed to raise giant profits at the boxoffice he stole it. Good old Jess always in the mood to shamelessly exploit moneymaking trends! But it has to be said that Jack The Ripper easily ranks among Franco's most effective and memorable efforts! Mainly thanks to the presence of the incredibly charismatic and phenomenal Klaus Kinski even when he's clearly uninterested in a role he still delivers! but also the actual film doesn't contain as many pointless  tedious scenes as usual in Franco's productions. The extended murder sequences and particularly the aftermaths are downright sickening and misogynistic with graphic amputations and mutilations of intimate body parts.

	onyx:emotionText "Like the case with many of his films it's not very clear to me what exactly Jess Franco intended to accomplish with his very personal interpretation of the notorious tale of London serial killer Jack The Ripper. This film is probably the least accurate retelling of the facts and also the narrative style is rather unusual. Foremost Franco's Jack the Ripper was entirely shot in Switzerland and even though he really tried to imitate the dark and fogenshrouded lateVictorian alleys and typically British workingclass pubs the settings simply aren't convincing. Never at one point you have the impression that the events takes place in England and so this production is already fatally implausible to begin with. The ripper's modus operandi for committing the murders and dumping the bodies is also different and completely fictionalized. Since when did Jackieboy take the dead prostitutes home with him to perform autopsies or relied on his retarded housekeeper to dump the remainders in a river? To my recollection the victims' bodies never left the scene of the crime as the Ripper wanted the authorities to find them instantly in order to raise fear and mayhem. Most of all this is probably the only version of Jack the Ripper in which his identity gets revealed immediately and the plot even makes assumptions about what started his urge to kill  mutilate luscious women. Of course if the DVDcover proudly advertises Klaus Kinski's name and scary face there isn't much mystery left regarding the culprit's identity. He's the creepy maniac responsibly period. The most logical explanation is probably the correct one Jess Franco had absolutely no intentions of making a complex and convoluted whodunitthriller but simply wanted a straightforward exploitation flick with sleaze and violence and since Jack The Ripper is a topic that is guaranteed to raise giant profits at the boxoffice he stole it. Good old Jess always in the mood to shamelessly exploit moneymaking trends! But it has to be said that Jack The Ripper easily ranks among Franco's most effective and memorable efforts! Mainly thanks to the presence of the incredibly charismatic and phenomenal Klaus Kinski even when he's clearly uninterested in a role he still delivers! but also the actual film doesn't contain as many pointless  tedious scenes as usual in Franco's productions. The extended murder sequences and particularly the aftermaths are downright sickening and misogynistic with graphic amputations and mutilations of intimate body parts. The makeup effects are realistic enough to upset your stomach so gorehouds will definitely get a kick out of watching this film. The music by Walter Baumgartner adds some genuine suspense to the lackluster story and there occasionally even is some impressive camerawork to enjoy. Far from brilliant but nevertheless interesting viewing for admirers of Jess Franco Klaus Kinski the sexy Lina Romey in a small role as one of the victims and Ripperologists in general.";

Franco regular Lina Romay who plays a saucy music hall girl is graphically dismembered her breast sliced off and her arm removed.While I usually try my best to watch a film in its original language with subtitles I'm actually glad to have watched the dubbed U.S. version of Jack the Ripper the incredibly bad English accents making many scenes an unintentional hoot. Also adding to the fun is a hilarious scene wherein a police sketch artist draws the ripper based on descriptions given to him by several witnesses the finished doodle looks like something rendered by an untalented five year old. Oh and brandy served in London pubs looks like water.At the end of the film a blind man with a super sense of smell helps the cops to capture Jack the law descending on him as he is raping his latest victim ballet dancer Cynthia Josephine Chaplin daughter of Charlie.

It may lack the exotic juxtaposition of horrific incident occurring in beautiful sunkissed arenas but what we have here is a satisfactorily recreated Victorian London with a talented cast and a consistent story that doesn't meander.Many events take place in the spacious 'Pike's Hole' tavern a convincingly cockney meeting ground where 'Jack' finds many of his victims. The death of Marika Lina Romay is the most gratuitous of all with a protracted scene suggesting Orloff has violent sex with his victims as the life fades from them. Inspector Selby Andreas Mannkopff proves to be a very effective foil for Orloff. Hans Gaugler is also excellent as Breidger the blind man. In fact the cast as a whole is very good and a lot better than usual with Franco projects. Probably this is because he is working with a larger budget here  and it shows in other ways too. Beams of smoky light casting shadows through the branches of trees. Apart from a few panoramic shots of Big Ben and various London buildings the bulk of this is shot in Zuerich Switzerland and there is much genuine nighttime filming a very expensive procedure.The storyline is a good one. There's no point in trying to do a 'whodunit'  when you cast Klaus Kinski in a film about Jack the Ripper he could hardly be playing a peripheral character. The intrigue is why he commits his atrocities why does he appear to carve chunks off his victims while they are still barely alive? Inspector Selby's girlfriend Cynthia played by Charlie's daughter Josephine Chaplin appears to have the answer due to her resemblance to his mother. With his final victim finally degraded it is apt in a way that he be captured and taken away in a finale that is disappointingly tame compared to the effective macabre nature of the rest of the picture.".

Obviously everybody who knows a bit about JtR knows that it is not safe today even to say who he was and what he did so it is all a work of fiction. This is good for creative decisions as you impossible can make a film based on real events but it is also bad in terms of relevance for the same reason and especially bad if the creativity just results in something mediocre at best.

	schema:reviewBody "What a brilliant caper movie! Before I go on though I need to point out that this movie is a reworking of the movie Rififi 1954a French caper movie. While Rififi generally gets higher marks among critics I also liked this one.The movie is unusual in that it has such a multinational cast and quite a bit of the movie is dubbed because of this. This didn't matter to say the least. However it was interesting to see Adolfo Celi in the movie. He was the lead villain in Bond's THUNDERBALL and in this movie his voice is dubbed with a totally different voice and so he sounds a lot different.Now on to what I lovedthe complicated and exciting plot. It just keeps you guessing again and againeven up until the last scene. Also the acting was great and the characters were wellwritteneveryone seemed to be at the top of their form.So if you want a movie about a gang of thieves pulling the ultimate heist and want to see one that's among the best give this film a tryif you can find it as it's not exactly a wellknown flick. Perhaps with so many films like it Topkapi The KillingBob le Flambeur and many others it just got lost in the process.".

	onyx:emotionText "What a brilliant caper movie! Before I go on though I need to point out that this movie is a reworking of the movie Rififi 1954a French caper movie. While Rififi generally gets higher marks among critics I also liked this one.The movie is unusual in that it has such a multinational cast and quite a bit of the movie is dubbed because of this. This didn't matter to say the least. However it was interesting to see Adolfo Celi in the movie. He was the lead villain in Bond's THUNDERBALL and in this movie his voice is dubbed with a totally different voice and so he sounds a lot different.Now on to what I lovedthe complicated and exciting plot. It just keeps you guessing again and againeven up until the last scene. Also the acting was great and the characters were wellwritteneveryone seemed to be at the top of their form.So if you want a movie about a gang of thieves pulling the ultimate heist and want to see one that's among the best give this film a tryif you can find it as it's not exactly a wellknown flick. Perhaps with so many films like it Topkapi The KillingBob le Flambeur and many others it just got lost in the process.";

	schema:reviewBody "Rififi is a great movie and like most great movies it's often imitated although unlike films such as The Exorcist Jaws and Alien the Rififi imitations are usually quite good. The field is lead by JeanPierre Melville's masterpiece 'The Red Circle' but following hot on its heels is this excellent little Italian thriller. Grand Slam mixes an intricate plot interesting characters and a bucket load of style and the result is a film that constantly thrills and entertains. The plot follows the fortunes of a varied group of criminals brought together to carry out a daring robbery. Schoolteacher James Anders notices a chance in Rio de Janeiro to steal ten million dollars in diamonds and contacts his friend who gets in touch with several specialists to carry out the job. Aside from the obvious safe crackers they also recruit a tried and tested womaniser to steal a key from a secretary. Everything is put into place for the robbery to go to plan but naturally there are more twists and turns in store for thieves to deal with.Grand Slam is an Italian film but features a host of international talent including Hollywood performers Edward G. Robinson and Janet Leigh acting alongside cult stars such as Klaus Kinski Robert Hoffmann and Adolfo Celi. The cast comes together very well and it's thanks to the great performances that this film works so well. Director Giuliano Montaldo keeps things ticking over nicely and the build up to the heist is always interesting. Naturally given the film's influences the heist itself is a timed and careful also wordless of course affair that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The Rio de Janeiro setting provides some lovely locations and the film does look very nice on the whole. With the focus being on the plot you can expect some twists in the tale and Grand Slam certainly does no disappoint in that respect as the film features a great twisted ending that fits what went before it very well indeed. Overall Grand Slam is an excellent heist flick that more than does the classic French film that influenced it justice. Recommended!".

I yelled at the screen last night.Perhaps this was the first heist film that used laser beams in a vault as an obstacle to thieves but why did they do it so badly? The laser beams which crisscross the vault like a spider web are done in an ostensibly clever way translucent tubing filled with light. But when the thieves climb over the beams with a fancy telescoping ladder rig we can clearly see the laser beams sagging! Not just a little either. Worse we can see a connection point where two pieces of tubing were joined. It's a friggin' closeup! This kind of sloppy craftsmanship really takes you out of the film.It gets worse. The safe is rigged with a delicate noise detector. The sound of a cigarette lighter is enough to set it off. The solution? Lift the entire safe with pneumatic lifts stick on little wheels soundproof the wheels with shaving cream I kid you not and push the safe ten feet away from the sound detectors. Then start drilling those titanium doors. Then blow it with nitro glycerin. Then silently push the safe back up the ramp and into the vault more shaving cream disconnect the pneumatic lines cart away your seventyfive pounds of equipment and close the vault door. All without making as much sound as a Zippo.This film was coproduced by Spanish German and Italian film companies. Is it possible that in an audience of say 100 Spaniards or Germans or Italians no one made a huge PUKSSHHH! sound when those air hoses were disconnected? Maybe not. Maybe they were better at suspending disbelief than an eightyearold American.Compare this to the new gold standard for technical competence in that era of filmmaking 2001 A Space Odyssey. Although history has unspooled very differently than as predicted in 2001 no cities on the moon no manned exploration of other planets those cinematic predictions were very carefully executed. The craftsmanship was exquisite. If the Americans and British who made 2001 had been as clumsy as the hacks who made Grand Slam there never would have been any discussion about the religious or spiritual meaning of that bizarre last act. Those questions were discussed very seriously in the late 60's and still are because 2001 was a believable world where our powers of disbelief remained suspended for 2 12 hours.Now of course Grand Slam is just a heist movie. It's doesn't have any deep pretensions. Does that excuse its technical shoddiness? Of course not. Even a frothy story needs to keep us within the walls of the story so that we can be lied to convincingly. When fundamental facts are ignored the movie is over. The Confederate army can't wear blue. You can't drive to Australia. And laser beams can't sag.Maybe this is why the United States was the technological powerhouse of the world in the 1960's. We cared about getting it right. And we still do. Even bad American movies are produced with a technical brilliance that outstrips the stupidity of the abovetheline talent. And web sites like MovieMistakes.com help keep our standards from flagging.Maybe Grand Slam deserves credit for inspiring better films such as The Italian Job two years later. Perhaps you can insist that Ocean's Twelve owes its dancing laser beams to Grand Slam. But at least in The Italian Job when things blow up they go BOOM! and in Ocean's Twelve the laser beams don't sag.".

	schema:headline " Scenic Crime Thriller With Plenty of Thrills";
	schema:reviewBody "Machine Gun McCain director Giuliano Montaldo's Grand Slam qualifies as one of those traditional perfect heist capers where crime doesn't pay as in The Asphalt Jungle Topkapi Any Number Can Win The Anderson Tapes and The Italian Job. Furthermore the mastermind of this audacious thriller is an elderly gentleman who assembles a team of experts to execute his 'meticulous' plan to the letter. Edward G. Robinson adds a certain grandeur to Grand Slam as a retired school teacher who has spent 30 years teaching in Rio de Janeiro when he hasn't been filming deposits at a diamond company occupying the building across the street from the school. Formulaic from fadein to fadeout Grand Slam ranks as one of the better examples of the genre. This nimble thriller opens with our protagonist consulting the mob in New York City to recruit an international gang that have no criminal records. Robinson personally speaks to each and then the heist occurs and everything comes full circle back to the mastermind and his moll. Not only do Montaldo and his writers put plenty of obstacles in the path of the criminals but he also generates palatable suspense during the robbery. Cynicism greed treachery and surprise sets during the rollicking the second half.Retired history professor James Anders pauses on the way to boarding his jet at Rio de Janeiro airport to listen as young students from a Catholic School serenade him before he flies off to New York City. In the Big Apple Anders visits an old friend Mark Milford Adolfo Celi of Thunderball who has acquired a notorious reputation as an underworld figure though armed bodyguards surround him. Anders goes out to Milford's residence. Milford and he discuss old times and then Anders presents him with an innocuous 8mm film reel and they watch as Ander's describes his former occupation and the school where he taught history. Opposite it looms the building for a Brazilian diamond vault. Milford selects four mena safecracker Gregg Georges Rigaud a gigolo JeanPaul Audry Robert Hoffmann a strong arm man Erich Weiss Klaus Kinski of For a Few Dollars More and an electronics technician Agostino Rossi Riccardo Cucciolla to carry out his plan. He promises to pay each of them a million dollars when they split the loo. Anders buys each man a lighter that is identical and they use these lighters for their criminal cohorts to recognize them. Ander interviews each of his accomplices before he vanishes from the action and they perform the crime.Grand Slam is predictable in the sense that the writers foreshadow the flaws in the plan too well. Happily each character is etched with nuance enough to support their motivation. Kinski is believable as the neversaydie Nazi and Robinson is brilliant as the professor. Grand Slam is not without irony. Although the perpetrators don't escape with the loot they are neither arrested nor face imprisonment. This movie contains a scene that the people who made Entrapment must have known about in advance because it so closely imitates the scene. The vault scene with the infrared light beams that crisscrossed the area reminded me of Entrapment. The quirky Ennio Morricone orchestral soundtrack enhances the plot. Lenser Antonio Macasoli who photographed both Cannon for Cordoba and Guns of the Magnificent Seven makes everything look impeccably cinematic even the opening aerial shots around New York City. Sergio Leone's editor Nino Baragli cut things together. The process shots of Robinson in Rio at the airport look abysmal. Nevertheless Grand Slam is an aboveaverage perfect crime caper with more than enough suspense and surprises.".

Here he impressively fleshes out the script's thin characterization of Jimmy Stark a traveling salesman and lifelong huckster who becomes convinced his impending death was foretold by a roadside psychic. The chance encounter sets into motion events he torments himself and those around him to control thrashing from one catastrophe to another uncertain of their significance. Ultimately everything matters major and minor past and present cleverly interlocking for a final resolution. It's a solid and memorable portrayal of a man simultaneously forced to face both his past and his fate.As good as it is though it's trumped by J.K. Simmons' terrific and tooshort portrayal of Vacaro the middleaged nomad living out a solitary existence with an old pickup and camper to show for his unique 'gift'. Here the film wonderfully avoids the usual dead Hollywood clichs humourously contrasted and lampooned at one point for a resigned true psychic who wants little more than to go fishing. Without histrionics or gesture Simmons is utterly convincing and engrossing throughout.If only the same can be said of the sum. With two such strong performances focused on the universal question of fate vs. selfdetermination it's hard to put a finger on why the film never gels. The plot offers up enough clever and well thoughout twists events unfold naturally without reliance on astronomical coincidences to guide them supporting characters are serviceable and the cinematography fine yet the viewer is held at a disinterested distance. Part of the blame rests on the rushed and unsatisfying ending some of it on where the film does rely on clichs to carry subplots  the usual romantic candlelit tub scene for example to develop Jimmy's relationship with his livein girlfriend. Only when Pearce and Simmons are on screen together did I care about the characters and those scenes were short. Pearce and Simmons tack points on an otherwise promising but midpack film. 710.".

I think maybe it could have been told differently. It started off with a guy a real hustler stranded in a New Mexico service station waiting for his car to be fixed. He accidentally or was it fate stumbled upon a fortune teller who told him bad things were going to happen to him. The main character Guy Pearce laughed it off but then a few of his other predictions that seemed way out there came true.

Pearce laughs it off but after all the other predictions come true he goes back to the same guy. He says this time You will be safe until the first snowOf course the clichd plot line would be that he goes paranoid beyond belief which for part of it is like this but the film sets up multiple possibilities of his death that keep you intrigued. The film could have many alternate endings because of all the other ways he could die that are set up in the movie.But the ending is perfect. The last shot of the film is the best I've ever seen except for Glory and maybe The Shawshank Redepmtion. I also feel J.K. Simmons and William Fichtner both gave performances worthy of a Best Supporting Actor Nomination more Fichtner than Simmons but since it is April it's doubtful they'll stand a chance in Oscar season. The screenplay is top notch and OscarWorthy as well.But the movie fall short of a 1010 because it no suspense is built. For this kind of film suspense is necessary. But everything else is really good in this movie. But you should still see this movie especially if you're into fate or destiny related movies".

	schema:reviewBody "People constantly talk about how young actors like Ryan Gosling and Joseph GordonLevitt have the knack for choosing some great films to be a part of and really showing off the immense range and talent they contain. However few people talk about the stalwart adults who have been doing their job for years yet without credit. Unless you're a huge star doing some good stuff along with mindless drivel in order to keep your name in the minds of your viewers you are thrown to the side or mislabeled as a character actor. Only the young guys get hyped for the quality of work they do because they aren't quite established yet. Well let me be the one to say that the most underrated leading man working today is Guy Pearce. The man may not work as often as most but he seems to choose only the best to take the time forI can safely say this because I have not and probably will not see The Time Machine. From LA Confidential to Memento to The Count of Monte Cristo to The Proposition Pearce is a force to reckon with. With Mark Fergus' debut First Snow you couldn't wish for a better performance from him or a different actor to have played this role.Our introduction is a short monologue by Pearce from the road with blood dripping down his face. From here we go back in time to the start of everything that is to happen a fateful day where driving into a ditch lands him in the middle of nowhere with some time to kill. Our protagonist is a salesman with a gift for talking fast and planting the seed of interest in those he tries to sell. Jimmy has an idea that will get him on his own and secure his future for himself and possibly his girlfriend whom he still has yet to commit to. Pearce is pitch perfect with the cockiness needed to believe this character and even dislike him a bit knowing that there must definitely be more to him than is shown on the surface. Our catalyst to find out what has happened in his past is a fortuneteller by the roadside willing to give a reading for ten bucks. The reading goes bad though and ends abruptly with the knowledge that Jimmy doesn't have very long to live in fact he has until the first snow before his end.Sometimes fate hits you when you least expect it. Had Pearce not seen the psychic played wonderfully by JK Simmons in a role that I have not seen him tackle before he may not have been led on the path laid before him. The very knowledge of his demise is the jumpstart to why his life must end. Between the paranoia and jumping to conclusions from the fear of what he learned he sets into motion a reunion of sorts with the demons he has learned to live with throughout his life. Will he be able to reconcile his soul before the end or will he drive himself to the edge never wavering and never being able to forgive himself? First Snow is definitely a journey worthy of its time and setup.While a simple story of redemption and the fragility of life this movie hits all its marks dead on. Jimmy's evolution as a man is believable and where he ends up is because he took his life into his own hands to let it carry out on his own terms. He is told that no matter what road he chooses the end will always be the same. It is up to him to take the time to say goodbye or to keep running from the inevitable. Through all his inner turmoil we are also given a glimpse into the lives of those around him. This is a strong cast of people that help hold together the shattering performance from Pearce. Piper Perabo is fantastic as the bubbly girlfriend with the compassion and the love to stick with her man and accept that he has secrets but allow him the space to deal with them on his own. Besides Simmons we also have a couple acquaintances played by two favorites of mine William Fichtner and Rick Gonzalez. Fichtner does what he does best and shows how effective he can be in a small role redeeming himself for the paycheck he received on Blades of Glory. Although his role is small and may seem a bit of a throwaway at first by the end you learn that his was a very integral part in the decision Pearce finally makes.At the end of the day First Snow is an intelligently told taut thriller. It is wholly character based and story driven led by its emotional performances rather than confrontational action. Many of the most suspenseful moments take place just watching Pearce talk on the phone not knowing what will happen next. Even the ending is practically perfect and very un Hollywood. It is very subtle and I almost thought Fergus wouldn't do it but he does. He ends it how it needed to be ended and without the fanfare and in your face theatrics that lesser films would have used.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the look of the reviews here on IMDb this movie obviously has its fans. I really didn't care for it at all and I have been trying to think why some people find it so well done and some find it completely boring. It is definitely well filmed. It looks good and establishes a consistent tone. So fans of indie drama will recognize some of what they like about those kinds of films. The flip side is that because the movie takes the time to show the little details and develop a mood there will be those who find it too slow. I think the subject matter is also one of things that divides people about this movie. In the story the main character meets a quirky mystic who predicts he will die soon. So you get some themes of fate and destiny along with a little mysticism. Personally I didn't find any of that interesting. I also thought that there wasn't much story to it once he finds out he may die soon it becomes a character study. Except nothing really memorable or interesting happens. I like Guy Pearce a lot and I thought he did a good job with who the character was at the beginning. I would actually like to see Guy get to play another character like this because I think he could really let loose with a slimy self centered Daniel Cleaver type of role. But it just felt like it didn't go anywhere. SPOILER at the end of the movie Guy's character avoids the death that we think is coming and drives off. We are then told he died in a car accident off screen. So some viewers are sure to see that as a cheat. I liked Piper Perabo but she didn't really get more than a couple minutes screen time. I really disliked the guy who played the fortune teller. I thought he was the worst thing about this movie. For me he was just really goofy and it makes it even more annoying that so many reviewers praise his hokey act as Oscar worthy. So to sum up it was nice to look at but I only give it a four.".

Every movie in which Guy Pearce is the lead turns out to be amazing and I think he is one of the main reasons for that. Pearce is a guy who gives a soul to every character he plays and this film is no exception. It is very pleasing to see him get more and more lead roles these days.First Snow is basically intended as self realization film. But First Snow manages to stay out of the clichs of these kinds of films and brings in new themes. It is about someone who knows when he is going to die but instead of using the good old live every day like it's you're last thing First Snow shows the dark side of knowing you're fate. It sends the main character into a grim and frightening journey full of questions about the fragility of life. You'd probably think that this film would force it's thought on you but instead it gives you a chilling example and leaves you wondering and questioning themes such as fate the future and life.To generate the feel of the main thought First Snow creates a frightening and somewhat cold atmosphere using the surroundings and the music. The cinematography and editing are also amazing creating an amazing visual sense of the movie. This is easily going to be on my list of 2007's best movies.".

Jimmy played by Guy Pearce must plan a course of action to determine the veracity of the prediction and then act on his finding. FIRST SNOW creates a visual mood and takes its' own sweet time to unfold. The film is a psychological thriller with the feel of a noirish foreign film.

Starks life changes after receiving a reading which reveals that he is on borrowed time. As events spiral out of control Jimmys paranoia forces his hand into continually making incorrect assumptions and wrong decisions When he eventually comes to terms with his destiny he tries to make amends by tying up loose ends It is worth noting that much of this involves money whether it be his life insurance policy the juke box machine contract to the former colleague he sacked or the hard cash to compensate the former friend who he sent to prison.And the ending  aaaagh. His on parole former friend appeared so unobtrusively menacing on the phone but in reality.... The unbearably overlong showdown between Stark and the on parole jail bird was a bit of an anticlimax complete with hackneyed dialogue followed by a rushed conclusion with what might have been footage and a radio news broadcast denouement.

'First Snow' got a shot in the arm when producer Bob Yari came on board. But you don't know who Fergus is and you sort of want it that way with a movie like this. You wander into it recognizing only the raw bony face of Guy Pearce. Pearce as Jimmy comes on dressed in cheap suits driving a sleazy car as a salesman in New Mexico with a pretty young girlfriend Dierdre Piper Perabo and there's another salesman Ed William Fichtner who's his friend. The plot has ramifications the sketchy dialog gives hints of. Jimmy wants to sell classic Wurlitzer jukeboxes equipped with their original 45's but his card shows he still sells flooring. This movie is like a cheap salesman itself and that's its charm. It's professional but not slick raw like Pearce's skinny face. Its contents are the stuff of Bmovies  grudges doublecrosses threatening phone calls and the centerpiece a grizzled trailer park fortune teller the excellent J.K. Simmons who sees something unexpected in Jimmy's future too terrible to relate. A gritty past comes back to haunt him as he drives around on the highway fleeing winter. You're safe until the first snow the seer mumbles before he gives Jimmy his money back and clams up. But whatever road you take the same fate follows you. Ouch. There was a scam in Mexico something about money laundering and a partner named Vince Shea Wigham who did time and now is out and mad. 'First Snow' is largely made of closeups harsh bright desert light and heavy shadow. It's a nice grungy riff on noir photography with handheld camera and seedy locations instead of studio shots and fancy lighting. And instead of intrusive Angelo Badalamenti or Bernard Hermannstyle background sounds it's nicely highlighted by Cliff Martinez who did the underscored music for 'Traffic' and 'Narc'. Albuquerque NM is the setting. Fergus was living there and the snow there had dazzled him. He must have also felt the nexus of urban poor and desert as ideal for a story about a twobit shyster running from a terrible fate. Guy Pearce has long lanky hair as he did in John Hilcoat's 'The Proposition' and it makes him look sleazy even as his fine cheekbones and chiseled torso make him sexy. He grins a lot till he starts sweating and looking desperate and hiding in motel rooms from a nemesis he seems to have imagined. A coworker he fired named Andy Rick Gonzalez scares him. He's on the run after he visits Vince's grizzled dying mother Jackie Burroughs and thinks Vince is crazy and tailing him. When he's holed up in a dark motel room things get pretty tense. Then at some point Jimmy washes up and shaves and stops running some of the tension disperses and this is where writing and editing fail to come together. Jimmy goes out in the snow. It was just superstition. Wasn't it? He relaxes and smiles again and goes home. He tells Ed over their usual drink that he's in the center of the tornado where it's calm but the energy goes out of the picture for a while till Jimmy with questionable motivation after being on the run goes to meet Vince who's left him a zillion phone messages the movie is plagued by cell phones and land lines. And the tension anyway is back. First snow has a double ending whose second half almost seems a quick afterthought and the whole story falls apart like a house of cards. What was it all about anyway? Why it was about the light and the shadows and the romance and sleaze and scariness of cheap suits and cheap cars and the threadbare plots of little movies like this that can still take you off somewhere and keep you watching and hanging on every word in spite of yourself.".

There are some genuinely funny scenes that are good for a laugh and definitely some strong gore that rivals the first Nekromantik but I found myself checking my watch too often. Buttgereit and crew could have easily shaved a half hour off this film and made it a more sleek and streamlined film but being that Buttgereit seemed to have a bigger budget this time it appears he wanted to spend it on filming as much footage as possible not always to the benefit of the viewer. Still a decent experience and definitely worth checking out for the extreme horror enthusiasts and the ending is suitably matched to the first film. Give this one a look 710".

	schema:headline " An Idiosyncratic Sequel";
	schema:reviewBody "Joerg Buttgereit's films have their own unique place in horror movie history. Few directors have even come close to producing anything as beautifully depraved as Schramm Der Todeskoenig or his signature film Nekromantik. The latter film is a superbly original romantic comedy about an unusual love triangle between a woman her lover and a rotting corpse. It comes as something of a surprise that the sequel is content to rehash the original  only without the sardonic humour or the perverted sense of romance. Nekromantik 2 is a strangely dour affair the film is slow affected and a little bit too clever for its own good. Thankfully Buttgereit plucks enough grim and gross ideas from his wonderfully sick mind to make the film a worthy if somewhat disappointing sequel to a true genre classic.Nekromantik 2 picks up where the original film finished  with Robert pleasuring himself while violently committing suicide with a kitchen knife. The brutal imagery of Robert ejaculating blood while stabbing himself has lost none of its bite. After such an eye opening beginning the film quickly takes on a more solemn tone. Monika a nurse with a taste for necrophilia rescues Robert from his grave and takes him home. The painstakingly detailed depiction of erotic corpse cleaning is textbook Buttgereit. From this point on the film loses momentum  mostly due to the fact that nothing really happens apart from Monika meeting Mark at the movies and beginning a relationship with him. The courtship between Mark and Monika is painfully boring to watch and incredibly drawn out. There are tedious closeups of them on a ferris wheel an unnecessary dating montage and an uncharacteristically dull sex scene.The film only begins to show signs of life when Monika starts asking Mark to play dead during sex and shows him a family photo album full of dead relatives. It soon becomes clear that Monika is finding it difficult to choose between the decomposing object of her desire and her living boyfriend. In an excruciating scene Monika appears to choose Mark and cuts Robert into pieces with a handsaw. This sequence is wonderfully grotesque but incredibly long. Buttgereit appears intent on testing not only the viewer's ability to hold down their dinner but also their patience. Despite chopping him into small pieces Monika can't seem to part with Robert completely so she keeps his head and his penis in the fridge. Strangely Mark doesn't take finding a decomposing penis in his girlfriend's icebox as an indication that he should look for a new woman. The film falls into another slump until the gory conclusion with the exception of a particularly unsavoury and lengthy clip of a baby seal being dissected. Thankfully the conclusion is premium Buttgereit as Monika finds a way to enjoy the company of both Mark and Robert simultaneously.Buttgereit's excruciatingly long and detailed depictions of corpse cutting animal dissection and dating rituals do not make for great viewing but the parallels that these sequences draw and the clinical detachment with which Buttgereit draws them are intellectually stimulating  if clumsy and pretentious. That is not to say that the film is entirely without humour. The film within a film about ornithology is very amusing and a clear swipe at arthouse filmmakers. The irony is that Nekromantik 2 is 10 minutes of necrophiliac sex and extreme gore away from being arthouse fodder itself. Those 10 minutes make up for a lot of the film's posing. The makeup and gore effects are typically gross despite the extremely plastic looking corpses. The seal dissection looks like it has been stolen from the Greenpeace archives as it appears to be authentic.The acting and general production values are still rather amateur in nature. This is easy to disregard when you are being swept along with Buttgereit's gory magic as with the original Nekromantik. However these flaws are far more obvious at the snail's pace with which this film proceeds. Monika M puts in the best performance and makes an appealing lead with her clear blue eyes and Germanic disinterest. Buttgereit's direction and script remain as idiosyncratic as ever. I'm convinced that Buttgereit is a genius but this film only shows rare glimpses of what he is capable of. Nevertheless Nekromantik 2 does give us something to think about while we wait patiently for his next dose of cinematic perversion.".

Sadly the sequel seems merely to rehash the original's ideas and does so without the flair and inventiveness of the original. Admittedly the ending truly must be seen to be believed and easily equals if not tops the originals ending but the rest of the film a gruesome dismemberment and a pointless seal autopsy aside is extremely slow paced especially the 'art' cinema scene. With a film as original and shocking as Nekromantik a sequel was never going to pack the same punch. If you're a fan of the first film I strongly suggest you check out Schramm or the excellent Der Todes King instead.".

	onyx:emotionText "The first Nekromatik was an original concept and was executed in a darkly original way as has become Buttgereit's style. Sadly the sequel seems merely to rehash the original's ideas and does so without the flair and inventiveness of the original. Admittedly the ending truly must be seen to be believed and easily equals if not tops the originals ending but the rest of the film a gruesome dismemberment and a pointless seal autopsy aside is extremely slow paced especially the 'art' cinema scene. With a film as original and shocking as Nekromantik a sequel was never going to pack the same punch. If you're a fan of the first film I strongly suggest you check out Schramm or the excellent Der Todes King instead.";

	schema:reviewBody "It's good to live in a world where a sequel to 'Nekromantik' was made released and critically acclaimed. Only three years after the first film director Jorg Buttgereit went back behind the camera and made 'Nekromantik 2' for his loyal cult audience. Actually the German authorities seized the movie a few days after it was released but luckily for Buttgereit and us they did not confiscate the original negative of the film hence now we have an excellent Bluray from Cult Epics in glorious high definition.Some people might look at this sequel much like how they viewed the first film which is a sadistic film that depicts deplorable violence and sex acts so depraved that it would make the seasoned cinephile blush. Others like myself view the original film and 'Nekromantik 2' as a work of art that is expertly crafted to show a woman and man's search for love and sexual satisfaction. Sure they go about it in a much different way than we're used to seeing and in this case we follow a woman who engages in sex with corpses but there is so much more to the larger picture than just having sex with the dead.Buttgereit wants to show us the simplistic nature of a human trying to find love and not be lonely and how sometimes that might be more of a struggle than not. But don't worry for all you gore hounds who are just interested in seeing the gruesome slimy parts there are plenty of moments to satisfy your sick appetite. 'Nekromantik 2' gives us a recap in full of the climactic scene from the first film in black and white. Soon after a woman named Monika is seeing digging up Rob's corpse from the first film and bringing it back to her apartment. There she undresses the black and moldy corpse as she tries to have an orgasm. To my disappointment and to Monika's she is unable to achieve the ultimate feeling.Monika then decides to start looking for love in the living. Unfortunately that role goes to Mark who makes his living by dubbing voices in pornographic films. Monika and Mark seem to be the loving couple that could be in any romantic comedy as they see movies and go to the park together. However Mark is unaware of Monika's unnatural need for the dead until he sees a few images in her apartment and walks in on Monika and a few friends watching some truly disturbing shows on television.Despite all of this Mark is like Monika in a way. He's just a lonely person looking for love so he stays with her. That is until the climactic scene of the film that is guaranteed to shock you. Buttgereit definitely does not shy away from any of the blood and guts by any means but 'Nekromantik 2' is not all about the gore. There are some long extended scenes of Mark and Monica just being a couple in it's most simplistic and natural way. Though one is more distant than the other both are trying to find their better half in life and Buttgereit reveals each emotion and action with a calm and collected view as if to tell us that's it's okay to choose this lifestyle.More often than not these days horror directors tend to only rely on the gore aspect and only want an action scene that follows into another action scene. Luckily for us Buttgereit gives us a bit more tone melodrama style and grit and that's why 'Nekromantik 2' will outlive the others.".

	schema:reviewBody "I embarked to see Nekromantik 2 in optimism and happiness. since it was a cold night and I remember how the original made me feel after viewing leaving me in a strange daze. I had nothing to do especially on a week night. Watching Nekromantik was a huge thrillI heard soo much about it's ending. How Jorge Buttergereit had more moneythe movie has bigger budget.I watched as the plot unfoldedthe film went on and I kept paying good attention at the first 20 silent minutes. I leaned back and forth through my twirly chairearnestly to what went on. Reader I'm sorry I really wanted to love this film everything about had me annoyed confused overwhelmed and impatient. I admired Jorge Buttgereit for making a sequel out of his audacious first film. Here he uses the same concept with a woman who recoils having sex with a dead person. The film is shot the same way as the original it has no dark atmosphere Buttgereit uses his score again only different. He uses dreams again to see what may lead a head to his characters but doesn't to the depths to them there's hardly anything dialogue or hero to look up to. Before The SURPRISE ENDING I wanted to do cruel things to the screenplay I yelled and tried to turn it off.I hated this movieto tell you Monika our new hero goes in the cemetery in broad daylight and digs up Rob Shmadtke who had a less boring life then her. She takes him to her apartment is a little better than Rob's was. There's no bodyparts around only odd drawings .If you think Monika has sex with Rob's corpse sure. But she's too good to get sticky with him! Monika is not a necrophiliac she's just a poser. We see Betty! But sadly only for a moment how a movie with her going on with her life with Rob's corpse. Sounds good right? After she meet the bible salesman dresser Mark who works in dubbing in porn. We see Mark and Monika stroll around the park this hapless Happy Together scene goes on forever nothing eventful happens at all. This film is actually dead but doesn't know it.There was nothing new at all in Nekromantik 2there's an seal autopsy with women fixed to the screenit may have worked in the first Nekromantik but it has no reason in this. Lucker the necrophagous kissed aftermath and Nekromantik had better ways of showing us the characters lives and they had better ones.Monika doesn't really know what she wants in life or in deathwe don't really get to know much about her except she likes having sex with Mark without movingwatching animal autopsies and hanging with friends. A few things that annoyed me the swaying of the camera in a bar scene where Mark yaks with a friend Monika M's face and acting throughoutshe even cuts Rob's body apart. She keeps his head and penis in the fridge which Mark finds but ignores it. If I were to see it again and again I might be able to take something good with it but the problem is when a movie's not worth seeing twice it had better get the job done the first time through. But sureI'll try seeing Buttgereit's Schramm and the Death king.I just won't watch this againbut maybe the ending.

To say I was disappointed would be an understatement.. I will not go into part one here but part 2 was simply a really low budget it looks horrible which kind of gives the film a dirty nihilistic feel art fest with two extreme gore sequences...The first is a massively long sequence of the 'protagonist' cutting up the dead body of Rob which she has dug up the scene drags on for what seems like 25 minutes with Monika slowly sawing each limb off the corpse and pulling out its entrails. The comes the wholly unnecessary seal autopsy. I still have no idea what the point of this footage was but i ended up fast forwarding through it. The final sequence is what got this film 2 stars from me. This scene involves Monika finally deciding that she wants the best of both worlds that is her living boyfriends body with her dead boyfriends head. This scene is extreme to say the least but doesn't make up for the rest of the movie...In between the gore sequences we have incredibly long and tedious scenes of the girl and her new boyfriend random cuts to snails and black screens??? As a whole the movie is fairly unwatchable. I fast forwarded through 70 of the movie and i never do that because it was simply painful to watch.Its like Jorg Buttface was giving a slap to the face of gorehounds saying im going to give you one real cool gore sequence but before you see that you're going to have to sit through the beepest 90 minutes of celluloid you're likely to see this year! And i include the cutting up of the corpse.. Even though it has great special effects it drags on and on and on and on and on and on not only testing the viewers hardened stomach which anyone who watches this would clearly have but also the viewers patience.Don't believe the hype about this movie.

Though I'm sure it's audience is limited I can't imagine watching this except FOR the gore scenes which are pretty grueling as few and far between they are. It could've been splatter masterpiece but I feel as though there was much restraint in this. Needless to say the ending was a sweet release so to speak in that finally it was over and the money shot which still was not all that impressive. A failed effort that only gives you a taste of what could have and should have been. 3 out of 10.".

I certainly did. Necrophilia has no favorites and this time around the haunts are reserved for the ladies. And who ever said that a corpse is worse off in the tender and dismembering hands of a woman than in a mans'? This destructive little thing tells the tale of Monika a nurse whose greatest wish when coming homeafter caring for her patients is to have an absolutely still and passive face to greet her lovingly. And what better cadaverous candidate than good old Rob whose been nursing coffinboards for the last five years? A beautiful relationship soon evolves and in the loving hands of Monika Rob soon learns how to part with those tiresome appendages one calls legs arms and head. But it seems that love moves in mysterious ways and while her decaying amour is patiently waiting in a plastic bag a second relationship between Monika and pornovoiceoverdubber Mark ensues. At first Mark seems completely at ease with this new found affair but as time progresses he is faced with among others the question Is a severed rotten penis your everyday refrigerator affair? While Mark have seemed to be the most eager in the relationship Monika on the other hand is sporting a deadened sour faceSexy nevertheless! which according to the German psychiatrist Erich Fromm in his great book The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness is often a hallmark characteristic of a necrophile. And exactly what kind of necrophile is Monika? In order to interpret the bloodfeast to come in which she at the climax of sex decides to saw off Marks head while still on top of a writhing him one could see it from two angles. 1. She has mixed feelings regarding necrophilia it is hard to come to terms withIn the beginning she vomits when she fondles Rob. the loneliness of love for the dead and Mark could represent her genuine hope of connecting with Life as well as Death. She has no intent of killing Mark but in the battle between the fresh springshoot and the moldy autumn leave Death proves to be the victor and in the end she must succumb to her lust for murder. 2. She is a calculating dame and from the very beginning she is dead set on procuring for herself a fresh body. She really doesn't fancy Marks face and do not need another one since she has Robs to begin with and what better thing to do than wed Robs head with Marks body?! In my opinion both angles are just as plausible. While Nekromantik relied minimally on dialogue and was perhaps a bit more surreal and introspective Not to say that Nekromantik 2 isn't.Far from it! part 2 has got more dialogue. Except from the obviously bigger budget this time and that it has a woman leading the show that is probably the only difference between the two. While I find the end sequence in Nekromantik rewarding and special nothing had prepared me for the end sequence in Nekromantik 2!! The first time I saw it it blew me away. Even if you are a seasoned gorehound I can almost guarantee you that you have never seen an ending as bloody and bizarre as this! Fking excellent! The music comes yet again courtesy of Daktari LorenzJohn Boy Walton and Herman Kopp and this time Mark Reederplaying the part of Mark. has thrown in a few tunes as well. If you decide to buy the double disc edition of this sweet candy listen especially to Reeders Nekrowaltz and Pure Waltons Menage A Trois and Kopps Supper! Perfect.

With that thought in mind there are films I've come to in my travels that at the end i ask myself or whoever is still in the room at that time  How can you follow that one up?. In many cases you just can't however there is that time when lightning indeed does strike. Ironically i came to this when watching a sequel that I had absolutely no hope for what so ever and that film is nekromantik 2.Now before i defend my stance on this film let me catch all those uninitiated up to speed. We start out with the end of the first film where Rob is killing himself on the bed but set in an archival seepiatone lens. Cut to Monika a nurse with a real nasty fetish She finds Rob obituary and decides his work is not done. So she takes him home and has her fun but as usual something comes up. Monika meets a nice guy who dubs porn films for a living. The two hit it off and a really nice romance blossoms and of course old habits die hard. After some odd indicators that Monika isn't who she says she is and some soul searching she decides to have her cake...or corpse and eat it too resulting in a creative but disgusting solution to her love troubles.Now first off i do not in any way shape or form advocate or condone necrophilia but the film was solid. The script was coherent the casting was good the placement of characters actually made sense witch really cut on continuity errors..which we all is a hallmark in horror sequels. The film itself was in my mind very well made everything was here. It was dark disturbing more disgusting at some points than the original. I even admired the other flashback scene where Betty comes to Robs grave and gets angry that someone pilfered the plot before her. Now sitting she thinks back to the last time they spoke and how she tore him down realizing how nasty she treated him and cries at his empty plot. In closing this film is not for everyone and that is a actually a gross understatement...no pun intended . Love it or hate it this is one of the few times that one will find a film that actually lives up to the original. The fact that people still talk about Nekromantik twenty five years after its release to me says something and on top of that the fact that the sequel is still just as talked about really says something about the film in the terms that how often does that happen. Who really talks about Halloween part three or nightmare on elms street part two...not many. All in all this is worth the watch...if your strong enough that is. all the good points aside this is still a film that deals graphically with something that most will find repulsive reviewer included.".

Keeping Robert's severed head in a wooden chest and his pecker in her refrigerator Monika M will have to come to a decision regarding Mark and the result is quite a hatchet job let me tell youwink wink.Well you do see a little bit of necroloving and if you are looking for some shocking disturbing subject matter director Jrg Buttgereit doesn't fail to deliver the goods. We get to see Monika M passionately kissing the slimy rotted mouth of dead Bobby and she cries agonizingly as the saw tears away during the gruesome decapitation sequence. Oh and Jrg Buttgereit's camera quietly observes Monika M slowly disrobing the bloody rags from Bobby's decomposing corpse her hands ever so gently caressing the gaping wounds. There's a calm in how she goes about her business taking her time to go over this new man in her life. I'm sure animal lovers will be chomping at the bit to see the seal being cut open with it's skull pulled away as the ladies enjoy their little gettogether gnawing on their snacks a muted fellowship of fascination and intrigue eyes glued to the television screen. Mark's reaction to this repulsive display..after the girls bid adieuon screen is perfect as it reflects the normal gut response regarding just what kind of fiend he has been dating all this time..this revelation..in not so many words just an expression of horrorplaces a wedge between them not hard to understand considering the circumstances. Yet Mark and Monika will contemplate their relationship and what he decides will greatly affect the eyeopening outcome.Jrg Buttgereit's methodical slowmoving approach..such as this extended sequence where Mark and Monika begin courting taking in a trip to a carnival and zoomight turn viewers off as much as the bizarre content. He claims that his film is more of a romance..sure it's one hell of a warped romance that's for sure. The success of the first film..and this sequel I think derives from the matteroffact style the director shoots his subjects. What's even more interesting is the fact that Monika M is quite an attractive young woman who wouldn't need to raid a grave for sexual gratification and maybe that also adds an extra wallop to the film. Jrg Buttgereit takes plenty of time shooting the sky or a lizard  snail under Monika's surveillance as she conducts her sickening activities.The opening of the film carefully studies Monika's desecration of Robert's grave preparing us for what is to come. Watch at your own risk. Not for the easily nauseated.".

The script by Buttgereit  Franz Rodenkirchen doesn't really have a plot so to speak it's a bizarre  often grotesque character study of someone who has necrophilia  if that sounds like something you would enjoy watching then the original Nekromantic  this sequel are the films for you as I don't think there are many other films quite like them. There's hardly any dialogue there are no sub plots  it's a very basic film with a slowish pace  an extremely distasteful subject matter which to be fair to it doesn't shy away from when showing the gruesome details. There are some pretty nasty moments in this especially a gory  twisted ending that you need a strong constitution to watch. There are some strange scenes though particularly when Mark finds Robert's severed penis in Monika's fridge  doesn't seem to say anything I mean wouldn't you? Wouldn't you say something like 'darling why do you have a severed rotten penis in your fridge?' well OK maybe not.Director Buttgereit does OK on what was probably a low budget shot in German you'll have to read the subtitles so bear that in mind. The film feels like an underground experimental effort at times although as mentioned already you'll need a strong stomach  not get easily offended. There's the predictable gross scenes of sex with a corpse there's an extremely gory decapitation  a sequence where Monika saws Robert's corpse up in a bath it's lovingly shown in detail complete with severed body parts  intestines. Also bear in mind the special makeup effects are excellent  pretty realistic  it's filmed in a matteroffact sort of way so there's no exaggerated sound effects or goofy rubbery limbs.

I wouldn't say there's anything scary here it's more disturbing piece of work overall.Technically it's OK it's basic barren  doesn't have much style but it's generally well made for what it is.

I know that her character needs special skills because it's a really difficult situation the one she's been through but I think that she wasn't that passionate for the role. I expected a whole lot more from the shocking thrilling ending. The scene is raw and shocking itself but I guess that it could've been more shocking. It's disturbing and I don't mind saying provocative. The way she hurries in order to get her ex lover's head and places it on the recent dead man is as weird as you can expect. But the highlight is the way she rides the dead body with the rotten head. Nice. I haven't seen any other scene like that involving a decapitation gore and sex in such a brutal way. The scene delivers and makes the movie worth watchable just for it. I praise the director's intention to shock the audience and display the Necrophiliac disease as a deep feeling.There's plenty of violence gore sex and the occasional shocking scenes so if you are into exploitation this is a must see. Probably not as best as the original Nekromantik but still deserves a watch. The movie is visually stunning and the camera angles are really good.

Even the soundtrack is excellent combining The Clash Echo the Bunnymen along with other pulsing musical giants it provides a perfect backdrop to the gorgeous storyline. This simple however very rich tapestry of two young girls growing up together throughout the 70's 80's until today reminds me why I love movies. And the character of Nat Oliver Milburn reminds me why I want to love.  I could watch it over and again still never tiring of the struggle between the two main characters Holly and Marina to grow up into independence.  This is especially difficult for Holly as she strives to live under her bestworst friend Marina's constant control.  She manipulates every situation with no shame in order to keep Holly closely tied to her and out of her older brother's Nat arms.  It is a truly intense dynamic between these three souls one that has inspired me to recommend the movie to others both men and women as it reaches both sexes. Looks can be deceiving because it is no chick flick but a highly interesting portrayal of human behavior highlighted by flaws each one of us have and take for granted. So if you want to see a movie that will stay with you always see this one.  It's clever incredibly moving and intelligently sexy.  I highly recommend it!!!  ".

I could watch it over and again still never tiring of the struggle between the two main characters Holly and Marina to grow up into independence.  This is especially difficult for Holly as she strives to live under her bestworst friend Marina's constant control.  She manipulates every situation with no shame in order to keep Holly closely tied to her and out of her older brother's Nat arms.  It is a truly intense dynamic between these three souls one that has inspired me to recommend the movie to others both men and women as it reaches both sexes. Looks can be deceiving because it is no chick flick but a highly interesting portrayal of human behavior highlighted by flaws each one of us have and take for granted. So if you want to see a movie that will stay with you always see this one.  It's clever incredibly moving and intelligently sexy.  I highly recommend it!!!  ";

There is a moment about an hour in with Holly where it was impossible not to feel her character's desperation. While mostly drama there are many moments of subtle humour which are effective without disturbing the overall flow of the piece.The direction especially with some inspired lighting in the last half hour is more than adequate and the soundtrack perfectly evokes the spirit of the era as do the costumes which have obviously had great care taken over them.More importantly though this is a film which will really make you think make you question the nature of friendship and your friends  you'll want to recommend this film to them but you probably won't for fear of losing them afterwards!A delight and not at all what you might expect from a British film starring an ex soap actress. The two leads put in fine performances and the supporting cast more than pull their weight. It's fair to say that I felt some of the nudity and drug use were slightly gratuitous but this is a criticism that could also be levelled at American Beauty to a certain extent. This isn't quite a five star film but it's pretty close.".

	schema:reviewBody "Summary A messy busy charming little English film about girls muddling through Me Without You' is a nice little movie or should I say film? that's a lot of fun if you'll let it be. Its depiction of a dependent relationship between two young Englishwomen from the Seventies till now is messy and busy. That's fine. If life wasn't messy and busy in the Seventies and Eighties I don't know what it was. Clothes and dcor and music are thrown at us to evoke the successive periods in a way that ranges from charming to grating. The focus isn't on that it's just a way of showing the passage of time the saga of lives moving on. The early sequences jump a little too fast. When you go from the little girls to the young women you may think they're wholly different people. You may think the metamorphoses of the young women are too rapid. But quite early you start to care about both women and about Marina's sweet and good looking but tragically unavailable brother Nat. This is a women's picture in the good sense that it knows what makes men attractive to women and why that both matters very much and isn't quite enough. It seems to take Nat and Holly about twentyfive years to get together for keeps. The relationship between Marina Anna Friel and Holly Michelle Williams makes disfunctionality and exploitation between people seem okay and that's fine too. Mostly we don't question our intimate relationships. The assumption is that the relationship is symbiotic. Pretty early on it becomes clear that the insecure but fast Marina exploits and abuses Holly while the slightly mousy but smart Holly sticks around because she's too nice and too needy not to. It takes a few decades for this to end for Holly to realize that Marina needs her more than she needs Marina.I think what makes this a good film I will say film is that it's informed by the English spirit of muddling through of not expecting too much but there's an underlying moral sense. There's some of the same kind of wry honesty that comes at the end of Schlesinger's Sunday Bloody Sunday.' Me Without You' doesn't try to save the world or make Teaching Points about people. It takes them as they are. You can see this in the womanizing American prof character played excellently by Kyle McLaughlan. He's a rotter but bloody hell! He can't help it. He's sleazier than the amiable scoundrel played by Hugh Grant in About a Boy' but he has some of that appeal. Marina isn't a bitch. If a person as nice and as smart as Holly loves her how can we hate her? No one is a caricature. No one is whiney or shrill. Muddling through or making do I thought also of the mood of the onceNumber One video in England Withnail and I' it's always rainy and things are always running out.There are a lot of scenes and little reversals of fortune and through them all Friel and Williams remain excellent Friel as Marina changing costumes like some mod master of disguise while the soft slightly plain but actually quite lovely Williams as Holly carries the film. Finally it's all about Holly. It's Holly who has the endurance and who gets the man of her dreams at the end rewarded for her intelligence and moral superiority like a Jane Austen heroine. Williams does her English accent to perfection and quietly underplays her role. The highly saturated color of the film makes her skin look ravishing she becomes not just an English girl but an understated English beauty who doesn't need Marina's trendy tarted up costumes and face to be splendid looking.What makes the film worthwhile and interesting is how well the two characters are written. A long time after seeing it I was still thinking about the relationship.".

Me Without You is directed by the great Sandra Goldbacher who's a brilliant director as we see in many of her movies including this one. Michelle Williams With a British accent. and Anna Friel Ex soap star. both star here and they both good performances as does most of the rest of the cast here. Me Without You is a great movie. I'm not usually into British films but this one is good even if it is different to what I'd expected. I really liked all the Jewish scenes in the movie too especially with Holly being Jewish as I'm Jewish too. All in all there's a good movie here. See it!".

The movie sees the up and downs in there friendship love life and family life. Me Without You is directed by the great Sandra Goldbacher who's a brilliant director as we see in many of her movies including this one. Michelle Williams With a British accent. and Anna Friel Ex soap star. both star here and they both good performances as does most of the rest of the cast here. Me Without You is a great movie. I'm not usually into British films but this one is good even if it is different to what I'd expected. I really liked all the Jewish scenes in the movie too especially with Holly being Jewish as I'm Jewish too. All in all there's a good movie here. See it!";

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS   SPOILERS Sifting through the videostore is such a painful processtrying to figure out which video to pick hoping that your 3 and 2 hours will be well spentME WITHOUT YOU was a pleasant surprise.  I rented it not knowing anything about it and was pleased to find that it was one of the best comingofage movies I had seen in a long time.I am a big fan of movies that take place either in one solid work day like Clerks or movies like ME WITHOUT YOU that take place over several years  specifically those childhood to adult years.ME WITHOUT YOU focuses on the story of two white girls growing up in 1980's New WavePunkinfluenced London suburbs.  This film has plenty of subcultural and pop culture references to Punk and New Wave if that's your thing.Here's the basic synopsisWARNING I MAY GIVE AWAY MORE THAN YOU WANT TO KNOW SO DON'T READ ON IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THIS STUFF Girl 1 and Girl 2 are best friends as kids... Girl 1 is the mousey girl who in my opinion is actually cuter than the pretty girl turn intellectual and thus our film's protagonist and Girl 2 is the hip skinny wild pretty girl. Girl 1 has a crush on Girl 2's brotherwhich remains a point of jealousy between the girls.  The film moves us from childhood friendship ceremonies to high school angst to collegeaged rebellion and eventually marriages and kids. Most of the film takes place in the college years in the 1980's with a punk and new wave soundtrack and backdrop. Girl 2 continually screws over and controls Girl 1 but in the end most of the pieces fall into place. This film is great if you like coming of age films films set in the 80's films with punk  new wave references subcultural moments and soundtrack films set in England  films with cute girls...This is a good movie for people who like comingofage flicks with girls as the main characters.".

Yes it's been told over and over again. Angstridden teenagers with tons of issues. But this is one told differently. So if you want a slight emotional roller coaster ride and appreciate good acting. This is worth your while. I guess one wonders why didn't Nat and Molly just got together in the beginning but I guess that's one surprise element that keeps audience I know it kept me! in suspense. There were also very good both poignant and explosive scenes. The highlight I agree was when Molly told Marina why she had to leave. The writer and director has a bright future.

'Me Without You like most British films 'A Room for Romeo Brass' 'Bend it Like Beckham' would be more suited to TV a BBC or Channel 4 film in the mode of 'Play for Today' oneoffs that aren't soap operas. Though I do admire the scope this film aims for which should have been on a scale of TVshow 'Our Friends in the North' i.e. hours of TV.The film has a pretty great soundtrack Cabaret Voltaire The Normal Only Ones Scritti Politti and good performances from Anna Friel and Kyle Maclachlan. The best thing here is the acting of Michelle Williams as with Katie Holmes she doesn't seem to be bothered by onscreen nudity. This is a European approach typified by actresses like Monica Belluci Emanuelle Beart and Romane Bohringer it's the character who is naked. And let's face it when you're in bed with someone you usually are naked! The punk bit was OK not far from the book 'The Rachel Papers' the other side of life from suburbia the Brighton Uni bit was even better though I felt the unrequitedrequited love throughout was a bit hokey!. There is a terrible postmodern line spoken by Williams character to Maclachlan's on Tarkovsky in 1982 sher states My favourite is 'Nostalgia'  released in 1983 the postmodern loop of nostalgia...I do think this film says a lot about friendship and the passage of time for that reason alone it will find a receptive audience in the future I had some 'SpeakMemory' moments...The end of the film is quite unsatisfactory Friel's character being quite irritating and the will theywon't they? question answered in a rather boring manner. The final scene is rubbish daughters who we have never seen before are meant to reference the circular nature of 'growing up' as typified by the opening scenes of FrielWilliams as young girls playing in the garden?I think this film captures that English suburban thing well more 'Lawn Dogs' or 'Secrets  Lies' than 'American Beauty' and I don't think it is close to 'Mina Tannenbaum'. It's much better than the recent Elton John produced film with Helena Bonham Carter and Mel Smiths excerable offerring with Minnie Driver.  This film will work on video much better as it's closer to TV than the language of cinema. Still it is very touching does offer allusions to DerridaDostoyevsky  'The Sweetest Girl' and it does linger in the memory long after seeing it. Despite its flaws it's much closer to where British film should be than dross like 'Snatch' and a nice feminine companion to '24 Hour Party People'. At the end of the day though this theme has been done much better in films like 'Beautiful Girls'I Vitteloni' 'Jules et Jim' 'Summer with Monika' which if you like this I urge you to see.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was great very watchable great acting interesting twists and turns also very emotive. I identified with Holly and was drawn in.However what could have been an amazing film was stopped by three fairly substantial factors. Firstly despite astouding performances from Williams and Friel the two gorgeous actress' simply could not pull off the transcendence of time so pivitol in the script. The last two ages were simply unbelievable especially the youthful Williams who remained unchanged from 1982 to 2001 apparently. Both actresses were really fantastic and their chemistry was electrifying Williams as Holly was a well rounded performance and although Friel as Marina did not have the same scenes to work from she also shone. The slight flaw was Williams' accent which whilst often excellent waivered when she dramatically stated script. But that might just be my suburbian London upbringing which could really hear the difference between the two girls accents. Secondly whilst i believed totally in the relationship between Holly and Marina the addition of Nat brought much confusion. Why he would marry Isabella is simply uncomprehensive even taking into account his need for stability in his life the relatively small barriers between him and Holly were left there with no attempt to even really try to be with his true love. This was also unhelped by the entirely over lengthy time interludes. Lastly the ending was a complete anti climax there seemed to be no resolution to the most important relationship Holly and Marina. Whilst we could see the Ho9lly and Nat were together it wasn't the important aspect of the film as Holly letting herself be with Nat was an important element in her friendship with Marina.Sorry to write such an essay but i loved this film and was so disappointed with the ending it was a very good film and i advise anyone to see it but it also had the potential to be a fantastic film.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film was great very watchable great acting interesting twists and turns also very emotive. I identified with Holly and was drawn in.However what could have been an amazing film was stopped by three fairly substantial factors. Firstly despite astouding performances from Williams and Friel the two gorgeous actress' simply could not pull off the transcendence of time so pivitol in the script. The last two ages were simply unbelievable especially the youthful Williams who remained unchanged from 1982 to 2001 apparently. Both actresses were really fantastic and their chemistry was electrifying Williams as Holly was a well rounded performance and although Friel as Marina did not have the same scenes to work from she also shone. The slight flaw was Williams' accent which whilst often excellent waivered when she dramatically stated script. But that might just be my suburbian London upbringing which could really hear the difference between the two girls accents. Secondly whilst i believed totally in the relationship between Holly and Marina the addition of Nat brought much confusion. Why he would marry Isabella is simply uncomprehensive even taking into account his need for stability in his life the relatively small barriers between him and Holly were left there with no attempt to even really try to be with his true love. This was also unhelped by the entirely over lengthy time interludes. Lastly the ending was a complete anti climax there seemed to be no resolution to the most important relationship Holly and Marina. Whilst we could see the Ho9lly and Nat were together it wasn't the important aspect of the film as Holly letting herself be with Nat was an important element in her friendship with Marina.Sorry to write such an essay but i loved this film and was so disappointed with the ending it was a very good film and i advise anyone to see it but it also had the potential to be a fantastic film.";

The productions values are still here but Pommer had already left for the U.S.A. The sets are fabulous the dialogue is great and very funny and the cast is outstanding note e.g. Willi Fritsch showing that he can do more than just smile and Adele Sandrock. This is Schuenzel's masterpiece his direction is elegance itself. Of course Schunzel is also know for the very fine VIKTOR UND VIKTORIA source for VICTORVICTORIA by Blake Edwards. Many sources claim that contemporary German audience recognized the  concealed  Goering parody and other references to the present situation. After some hesitation the showing of the film was allowed by the ProMi Goebbels it also recognized the Goering parody. The film became a great success. This film should be an international classic and Schunzel a more known director.".

When the real Amphitryon returns triumphant from the wars the comic plot thickens. But unlike the Plautus original here the interrupted affair between Alcmene and Jupiter does NOT result in the birth of Hercules how then was the demigod born?The music is delightful the comic confusions are rendered with a light touch and the elegant sets costumes and special effects are pure eyecandy.A bonus on the German DVD is a halfhour doc giving some background to the story as well as production stills and footage. Curiously director Reinhold Schnzel shot a simultaneous version of Amphityron in French with different actors and some clips show how the two versions look and sound side by side.Amphitryon is not well known outside Germany but is nonetheless a world cinematic treasure.".

The writer and director is Reinhold Schnzel actually a successful actor too even if he does not perform in here. Writer is relative though as he merely adapted the works from Molire Titus Maccius Plautus and Heinrich von Kleist for his work here. The film is slightly shorter than 100 minutes and has Willy Fritsch play the main character mentioned in the title. I think he is the only one from the cast who is still somewhat known today even if many more cast members were prolific and successful back in the day. This film is mostly a comedy with some music influences and also a bit of romance here and there. I personally cannot say I enjoyed the watch too much. It was never as funny as I hoped it may be so I was pretty underwhelmed and the film dragged to me on several occasions. I was also not really impressed by the acting. The whole thing is a bit style over substance with all the costumes and settings and it never manages to be the relevant romance story that we see in the end that it wants to be. I five Amphitryon a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

His remark that for toothless old men!If I can remember I think that's what he said.there is some subtle propaganda in it but what can you say  this was Nazi Germany. Its when the Greek soldiers com back from battle with Willy Frtisch playingAmphityronas the leader with his alcoholic slave Sosias played by Paul Kemp.The way the Greeks soldiers march are choreographed and then you see the women Thebe's wives dancing for joy as their husbands come back. It looks like one of those Leni Riefhenstahl filmed Nazi march conferences mix with Nazis folk women dances. It's a musical but most of the actors  except for Willy Fritsch and Hilda Hildabrand can't sing so most of them just sing with pitch. Willy Fritz portrays also God Jupitor a sickly dirty old man  who so badly want to jump on one of his adult childrenAlkamene with a 1935 hair dress in ancient Greece played by Kathe Goldas she is praying to him to protect her husband Amphy. Boy he has to have her. So he and his slave Jupitor go down to earth the day before the men return from war disguising themselves as the rough Amphityron and his drunken slave Sosias.Well Alkmene is confused but surprised that he comes home a day earlier. Her slave  Andria can't believe her husband Sosia is Sober and so demanding. But Jupitor age hit him and ends up sleeping after his bath. The next day he attempts it but her friends show up for a visit one of them played by Hilda Hidabrand she cuts the party off and now her friends thinks that she has an affair. All of a sudden Jupiter gets a cold and now the doctor has made him go to bed . so that delays the seduction. Well by the time the boys from war come back Juptor has to turn himself back and Sosias comes to the house early catching Mercery kissing his wife. Hegoes berserk and thinks he's going nuts. He goes back to the ship and Amphy has him arrested thinking he has gotten drunk.He comes back and Alc is dispelled and is angry with him about going to war all those month leaving her alone.

The romance between Amphitryon then famous heartthrob Willy Fritsch and Alkmene Kthe Gold is portrayed in rather conventional ways but the real stars are the minor characters then wellknown comedians Paul Kemp playing both Mercury on roller skates and Amphityon's drunkard slave Sosia and Fita Benkhoff as Sosia's wife Andria. Their antics make this movie still worth watching. Similarly Fritsch in his other role as aged Jupiter bald and with beer belly and his tyrannical wife truly ancient Adele Sandrock then the grand old dame of German cinema are very funny. Both Sandrock and Benkhoff were nominated for the 1935 Oscars the only foreign actors thus honored that year. Maybe the best part of the movie though is the way director Reinhold Schnzl a halfJew who had to emigrate to the United States not much later slyly parodies German militarism and that under Nazicensorship and with SS men as extras playing Theban soldiers in the mass scenes. I guess Hitler and Goebbels who both visited the shooting of the movie were fooled by the National Socialist realism of parts of the set especially when the Theban army triumphally returns from war and I guess they also liked the traditional way gender roles are portrayed in the movie in the end Andria becomes an obedient wife full of newly gained respect for her husband the new Sosia a.k.a. Mercury and is rewarded with a fashionable hat.In brief this is a really funny movie and I only wish it had already been re issued with English subtitles so that Schnzl could receive the fame and admiration he deserves.".

About a third of the people walked out of the theater when I saw it and most likely the majority of them went home and rated this a One. Being a fan of the Whitest Kids U'know I was very excited to hear about this back in December. and then very annoyed when they kept pushing back the release date. But finally It arrived and it was great in my opinion. Not quite to my expectations but by no means bad. It is true that some of the jokes become incredibly repetitive and they dragged the lesbians scene out to the point that it was no longer funny. But more often than not the jokes are hits rather than misses. Many people have given the film poor reviews because of how unbelievably vulgar the jokes are. Which makes me wonder Why would you see a raunchy teen sex comedy that takes place at the playboy mansion and was written directed by and starring two of the Whitest Kids U'know if you are offended by vulgar humor? Trevor Moore was hilarious as always but I do feel that Zach Creggor's talent was in many ways wasted. He got very few of the best lines though one could expect that since he plays the clich serious buddy that is found in all teen sex comedies. Craig Robinson was great though I thought that his character got a bit annoying after a while. But despite the films dirty charm and frequent laugh out loud moments there were also a fair number of flaws. Miss MArch suffered from the same issue that the latest Harold And Kumar installment did Every once in a while they would go just a bit too far. In a film like this you have to walk the line. In many cases they would take a flying leap over it. Which is fine to a certain extent. The problem was that the just didn't seem to realize when to quit. Dirty does not always mean funny. If you are trying to decide whether or not to see it just know that it can either be a laugh out loud hilarious raunch filled comedy rollercoaster or it can be a dull lifeless trashy tasteless bomb of a movie depending on your taste or lack thereof. I personally found it to be the former rather than the latter. But it is most certainly not the type of movie that you should see with your family. 810".

Because despite the fact that the vulgar raunchy jokes are immature and gross I just can't stop laughing. It's a movie for us male audiences that still chuckle when we hear words like doodie. Besides you kinda gotta give some the two lead actors Zach Cregger and Trevor Moore for both writing both directing and producing this whole shenanigan even though it probably doesn't take a genius to come up with such a ridiculous tale.It's a teen sex comedy that centers around two best friends Eugene Cregger who is like Jimbo and Tucker Moore who is like Stiffler. Typical characters right? Really there's not much originality in this movie it even has a road trip a bunch of people that don't look like high school kids still playing high school roles and of course tons and tons of attractive dropdead gorgeous hot lookin' girls of all kinds. And just like any teen sex comedy out there that usually has one or two disgusting bomb shocker this one has those too. And of course the two leads learn something a selfrealization lesson at the end whooptidoo.Some of the humor can get repetitive and some of the characters can annoy you but for some reason every one of those aspects cracks me up and I was watching it sober. I think it caters to the childish adolescent part of me it rekindles all the sex jokes that my friends and I used to laugh about back when we were younger before we learned to grow up. So these two guys who are behind the hilarious show The Whitest Kids U Know are only doing their contribution to the society the only way they know how and what I enjoy even more is that it's one of the few immature comedy movies out there that's actually consistently funny from beginning to the very end. Craig Robinson who plays the horsedick dot mpeg rapper is on top of his game. He's not afraid to make fun of himself on screen. Hugh Heffner's cameo proves that he's quite possibly one of the coolest relics that still walks this earth. There are two unbelievable Lesbians in this movie that would go down as some of the most memorable characters in this genre. However this movie does give pressure to teens out there by putting into their minds that having countless irresponsible sex is a good thing. MISS MARCH is a comedy for the dirtyminded and those of us who can switch the on and off button from serious to filthyminded in just a blink of an eye.".

And just like any teen sex comedy out there that usually has one or two disgusting bomb shocker this one has those too. And of course the two leads learn something a selfrealization lesson at the end whooptidoo.Some of the humor can get repetitive and some of the characters can annoy you but for some reason every one of those aspects cracks me up and I was watching it sober. I think it caters to the childish adolescent part of me it rekindles all the sex jokes that my friends and I used to laugh about back when we were younger before we learned to grow up. So these two guys who are behind the hilarious show The Whitest Kids U Know are only doing their contribution to the society the only way they know how and what I enjoy even more is that it's one of the few immature comedy movies out there that's actually consistently funny from beginning to the very end. Craig Robinson who plays the horsedick dot mpeg rapper is on top of his game. He's not afraid to make fun of himself on screen. Hugh Heffner's cameo proves that he's quite possibly one of the coolest relics that still walks this earth. There are two unbelievable Lesbians in this movie that would go down as some of the most memorable characters in this genre. However this movie does give pressure to teens out there by putting into their minds that having countless irresponsible sex is a good thing. MISS MARCH is a comedy for the dirtyminded and those of us who can switch the on and off button from serious to filthyminded in just a blink of an eye.";

However on the day of their prom Cindi decides that they should have sex. After the prom they go to a party and Tucker convinces the nervous Eugene to drink a couple of drinks.

I was a little taken back with how badly this flopped. The laughs were just not that heavy or that great. The writing really could have been better as well as a lot of things. Craig Robinson of The Office and Pineapple Express didn't even make me laugh in this one as much as he did in Pineapple Express. Not a single laugh from me at all. This movie just was a complete waste to make. I know that some people may find it funny and that is fine if you think that way but in my opinion this was just a complete miss in the comedy genre.

This movie puts a new spin on the teenparty movies and I welcome it with wide open arms. It is an instant classic with parts reminiscent of Planes Trains and Automobiles and American Pie if it were funny. Sure there is some potty humor but very little. I usually hate this but it was done in a tasteful manner in this instance. The movie doesn't take itself very seriously and it's great that it doesn't. If it did critics would be slamming it for factual inconsistencies. It almost seems to make fun of itself. If you want a taste of the type of humor tune in to Whitest Kids You Know on IFC. This group of geniuses are behind this masterpiece.".

ANYTHING but sit on the couch and corrupt your humour glands with this filth.I am not a prude by any means...I love any kind of smut and filth if it's done properly i.e. American Pie There's Something About Mary etc...but how this train wreck got produced is beyond me. That anybody in Hollywood in charge of writing the cheques for something like this could read the script and think yeah this deserves a budget of XXXX!!! makes me fear for the future of moviedom.In the interest of fairness what little this piece of trash deserves I gave it a two instead of a one because I did chucklenot a genuine LOL but a guffawat least once in the movie and perhaps as many of three times. Certainly not more than that. And the saddest part is the concept had the capacity to be a decent poignant roadtrip movie with a decent script and some decent acting. But no instead we are subjected to a 9yearoldboy's masturbatory nightmare of degrading and scatological humour.Avoid at all costs! Or better yet jot down your own idea for a movie on your cocktail napkin next time you and your buddies are at the bar. No doubt somebody in Hollywood will write a big cheque for it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am fed up with this movie getting bad reviews.As far as performances go Zach Cregger was phenomenal. His acting ability exceeds that of the average big name actor in this industry. And if you can prove yourself to be a good actor in a road trip sex comedy then that's a pretty big accomplishment if you ask me. When he needs to be funny he's hilarious. When he needs to be serious he's completely nonchalant. Every detail of his tone and expressions are immediately recognized by the audience and he does a good job of not being cocky about it. Not to mention this is only his second film.Trevor Moore did a fantastic comedic job. Most critics call him a Jim Carrey wannabe which is a joke. For one thing Jim Carrey never wrote and directed anything I've ever seen. Also Carrey has the annoying tendency to over act. For some reason he has this idea that the more over the top and exaggerated you act the funnier your character will be. I disagree. That's just underestimating the intelligence of your audience. It is clear that Trevor Moore has a natural awareness of when to tone it down and when to raise things up. And of course he has this signature bugeyed expression and fluctuation of the voice that will make any line ten times funnier.When you put the two men together you get Eugene and Tucker characters with a surprisingly heartwarming chemistry. Unlike most movies you see throughout this story that these two friends really truly care about each other. Sure they have opposite points of view and it can be a real chore to have to deal with one another but they remain best friends through it all. The writers did an excellent job displaying their devotion. Which answers the question that I often ask when I watch movies like Dumb and Dumber and Wedding Crashers which is If they can't stand each other why are they even friends?The movie is oozing originality which most critics have decided to overlook when they heard the words two boys and road trip. The typical sex comedy usually makes the protagonist the straight man and his nutty friend tends to have all the bad luck. However this movie has the role of the protagonist shared between both the straight man and the nutty friend. Both characters learn a lesson both characters develop throughout the movie and both characters get the girl. They also did a good job of consistently being a comedy and not getting lost in the romance which movies mainly featuring the Frat Pack tend to do. Not to mention how many times do you see a conservative proabstinent lead in a movie like this? Isn't it usually just two horny boys trying to get laid? The character Eugene or the straight man also rebelled against the stereotypes by not being afraid to look stupid. In most movies characters like him are lovable nearly flawless and hated by almost no one. Here Eugene was scaring children pooping on floors flashing a gas station and pissing off a famous rapper. FINALLY a protagonist that knows how to get EMBARRASSED.The movie also makes the audience take another look at Playboy. Instead of viewing it as a trashy magazine that exploits women it is portrayed as a celebration of how beautiful women can be.I gave the movie an 8 simply because it wasn't their idea to make the movie about a road trip to the Playboy mansion and I know they are capable of producing something golden.I've recommended this movie to everyone I know. It has enough aww moments to take your girlfriend or boyfriend to and enough buddybuddy moments to take your best friend to as well.I hope after reading this moviegoers will give the film a chance and ignore all the thoughtless inaccurate reviews that completely bash it.".

I rented the movie a couple of days back and I only laughed at a couple of scenes at the beginning. The rest was boring and not even worth watching except the last 20 minutes where a 'playmate of the year' comes in the Playboy Mansion. This is the most dumbest and ridiculous movie of the genre I have ever seen. After watching this I wanted to start doing drugs smoke etc. Will you guys stop giving such dumb movies 5 stars please? This film makes 'Van Wilder 3 Freshman Year' look Oscar worthy. And I laughed a lot more in Van Wilder 3 which I found not to be that good than I did in this excuse for a movie.Eugene Bell Zach Cregger is a high school student who believes that one has to abstain from sex till they find their soulmate. His girlfriend Cindi Whitehall Raquel Alessi who is also a virgin doesn't believe that and makes a pact with him to have sex on prom night. His best friend Tucker Cleigh Trevor Moore doesn't have any respect for women and always trash talking them. However he has a found a girl Candace Molly Stanton who loves him despite all his flaws but he doesn't even consider her his girlfriend. On prom night to decrease his fear about sex Eugene drinks too much falls down the stairs and goes into a coma which lasts for 4 years. When he wakes up only Tucker visits him regularly and all the others have abandoned him. And to his horror Cindi is now a playboy model. They go on a roadtrip to the Playboy mansion to find out why she left Eugene.Apparently Cindi is sexy enough to be a playboy model! I don't care about that but this is a very disgusting movie. The lead characters are very very unlikeable. One girl is a psycho who has control over the firemen of all the different states under her. I dislike fart jokes I can tolerate one or two in a movie. But in this they go a step behind and do sh it jokes. They even display it graphically which is vomitinducing. One time is OK but they do it repeatedly and cruelly. I only wanted to watch it for the playboy model she was very hot and the mansion. But it turns out they only play a part in the climax. The secondary characters are downright unlikeable  the firemen the Russian lesbians the doctor and the nurse Horsedick.mpeg his climax is like yuck. Anyway don't bother with this. IMDb users are way too liberal with this one. I have given only one film a 1 rating till now on IMDb this film deserves even lower than an 1. If you will excuse me I have to go drown myself now for watching this garbage.110".

The movie has extremely gross stuff done in magnificently creative and funny ways. The setups to the gags were great and the timing was perfect. I laughed the whole way through the movie and was really glad I went. It is nice to go to a movie where you can sit back and enjoy. It didn't take a lot of thought and was the first comedy I have seen in a while where you could tell the cast was having a blast or at least it seemed that way. I wouldn't necessarily recommend dropping 10 dollars to see this on a Friday night or making this a first date movie but it is definitely well suited for a matine dollar movie or rental.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay I agree with a lot of the criticisms this movie received. The plot was underdeveloped the crazy firemen thing as well as Candace's forgiving of Tucker after a truly lame speech was a hard concept to swallow and Cyndi's role in the plot was too large for her to play such little screen time. Nevertheless I fully enjoyed this movie. Comedy is probably the one genre I can watch and can say to myself Screw the plot. Obviously every movie needs a plot but in the case of comedy as long as there's one there at all I can focus more on the interaction between humorous characters and the many jokes this movie provided. One criticism I can't wrap my mind around is the acting of Trevor Moore and Zac Cregger. They've been criticized for their performances while I thought they were hilarious. Their opposing personalities made for great conflict and they have chemistry considering the actors have known each other for years. People call this a bad movie but I feel that if a genre succeeds in its purpose in the case of comedy  laughs it is good. I feel that people over analyzed this movie and subjected it to more criticism than need be. Anyone who has watched Moore and Cregger's Whitest Kids U Know sketches know that the two end many of their skits by breaking the fourth wall saying something like we didn't know how to end this skit. Miss March is much more about the laughs and gags than the plot. Sit back and simply enjoy the movie for what it is. I promise many laughs!".

	schema:reviewBody "Miss March utilizes both lewd gags and random bursts of imbecilic humor  and this style of comedy will easily appeal to some and completely disgust others. If you've jumped aboard the recent grossout comedy bandwagon characterized by short bouts of real humor sandwiched between squalidly immoral excesses the first feature film from the creators of The Whitest Kids You Know might just be your cup of tea though the sum of its parts can't maintain the quality of the popular sketch comedy show. On Prom night minutes before he's about to lose his virginity to longtime girlfriend Cindi Raquel Alessi Eugene Cregger falls down a flight of stairs and winds up in a coma. Four years pass and the bewildered youth awakens to find that all of his friends and family have abandoned him except for his maniacal sexobsessed buddy Tucker Moore. Together the mismatched duo embarks on a desperately deranged road trip to the Playboy Mansion to reunite the traumatized youth with Cindi who is now Playmate of the Month. Vulgar comedy only surpasses its simplicities when the characters involved are actually relatable or worthy of our sympathy. The immature humor found throughout Miss March falls a little shorter than its true recycled nature due to the two main protagonists and their overly despicable presentations. Neither straight man Eugene nor funny man Tucker succeed in overcoming their annoyingly expected stereotyped traits and every attempt at redemption falls on eyes blinded by indifference. Perhaps what's most impressive about Miss March is the amount of questionable activities the creators manage to squeeze into an Rrated film. It's done in a comedic unrealistic manner but pushing the envelope isn't a phrase extreme enough to accurately describe some of the taboo endeavors. Sadly the gratuitous female nudity expected from a film shot at the Playboy Mansion and replicating a fullblown Hugh Hefner party is minimal forcing the obnoxious and insufficient buffoonery to be relied upon much too heavily.The Massie Twins".

Despite the use of English language even for the German soldiers the performances are excellent. The realistic negotiation of Joseph Krauzenberg with the Germans to save his family and the corruption of Dresler are unusual themes in this type of war movie that is unfortunately underrated in IMDb. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Contrato Arriscado Risky Contract".

So much potential is wasted by studentlevel writing and direction which is all the more incredible given that secondtime director 'John Daly qv' has produced some of the best movies of recent decades. 'Martin Landau qv' giving his usual all as JewishHungarian industrialist Joseph Krauzenberg can't make up for the patchy character development elsewhere  what there is of it. 'Judy Parfitt qv' as his wife Rachel throws out token lines of accusation and irony one would expect from an adolescent when a stony silence from such a part would send cheap gangster Heinrich Himmler 'Danny Webb qv' to the corner hanging his head in shame.And these heavyweight characters are just the background for the title characters who work as the Krauzenberg's butler and maid. After the others are all done we still have another 40 minutes of the picture to follow the title characters' fates. I won't go into further story detail here but I'll just say that 'Caroline Carver qv' shines much much brighter than her sketchy part calls for look for her in better work. 'Kenny Doughty qv' doesn't overcome his title character's limits virtually anyone else in the cast could have played the part.For that matter Daly's casting veteran British and Irish stage actors to play Nazi Germans and Jewish Holocaust victims is old hat and a classic mark of a limited budget. In this day and age budget or no they're no substitute for locals playing local parts  audiences today see through it. Movies are about the audience not seeing through it.All in all it's sadly obvious Daly's real project wasn't this story it was his curiosity at trying his hand at directing. He had the resources to make it bigproject slick but not the vision to make it memorable after I left the moviehouse.".

Written by Director John Daly based on a story by Kendrew Lascelles this film reveals a little known bit of history that shows that the Nazis allowed the wealthy Jews to 'buy their freedom and lives' at enormous losses. And the key Nazi at least in this story is none other than Himmler.Joseph Krauzenberg Martin Landau is a very wealthy German Jewish industrial tycoon whose fortune is mirrored in his palaces that are more like museums of great art. But in the year 1944 his important steel mills and other major industries are needed by the Nazis and so a plan is hatched to offer Krauzenberg his wife Rachel Judy Parfitt and his considerable family the opportunity to escape death by allowing them to leave Germany for Switzerland and ultimately for Palestine. The only servants the Krauzenbergs maintain are the Vassmans  Ingrid Caroline Carver and Hans Kenny Doughty  an Aryan couple who in reality work for the Underground and are actually Jews under strong cover.Eichmann Steven Mackintosh and Himmler Danny Webb are perpetrating the plan to gain all of the wealth and lands and homes and art of the Krauzenbergs and they attend a dinner party at the Krauzenberg palace to sign the final papers. One of the other officers Edelhein Christopher Fulford is the most repulsive of the group and despite the fact that Ingrid Vassman is pregnant Edelhein pursues her as a perfect foil for implanting his precious seed in the 'Aryan beauty' to populate the new Germany. As the night of transaction occurs Krauzenberg visits his large family being held by Eichmann in the Gestapo and reassures them that all will be safe. The Vassmans love the Krauzenbergs and ultimately confess that they are Jewish and wish to escape to Palestine with the Krauzenbergs. In a fast paced finale the trials and tribulations of the final plan are worked through in a somewhat surprising way.THE COUPLE is beautifully photographed the film was shot in Poland despite the fact that the Krauzenberg estates were in Hungary and the mood of evil is always present in the night scenes with the requisite searchlights penetrating the darkness. Laudau and Parfitt are strong as are Webb Mackintosh and Fulford. Neither Caroline Carver nor Kenny Doughty is up to the task of making the Couple credible. But the overall impact of the film is the focus of the evil that drove the Nazi machine even with this slight bit of human kindness that was bestowed on the Krauzenberg family at such an awful cost.

Additionaally such a rig would have been swiftly detected and localized by Radio Direction Finding RDF equipment. All underground radio transmitter operations had to be moved from one place to another as swiftly as possible to avoid detection by RDF.The suggestion that Heinrich Himmler had a sense of honor and therefore kept his word to Krausenberg is not only beyond ridiculous but it also attempts at a saving grace to a completely dishonorable and without scruples man. As it turned out in the end he didn't even keep his word to his divine Adolf Hitler! Ex native of the Lodz Ghetto Auschwitz and Dachau".

All underground radio transmitter operations had to be moved from one place to another as swiftly as possible to avoid detection by RDF.The suggestion that Heinrich Himmler had a sense of honor and therefore kept his word to Krausenberg is not only beyond ridiculous but it also attempts at a saving grace to a completely dishonorable and without scruples man. As it turned out in the end he didn't even keep his word to his divine Adolf Hitler! Ex native of the Lodz Ghetto Auschwitz and Dachau";

Directed by now deceased John Daly he of mostly producing credit fame the film adopts a somewhat flimsy 'point and shoot' aesthetic running on what appears to be a film stock more akin to the whatever format they used in the 1980s for shooting specifically madefor TV usually police orientated serial dramas.The film sees elderly wealthy Jewish Hungarian Joseph Krauzenberg Landau and his family of various generations come up against the Nazi war machine whom observe this successful Jewish businessman and naturally want in. Using all the powers bargaining wrangling abilities he has plus something known as the 'Europa Plan' Joseph attempts to essentially trade in what he owns for he and his families' lives. But a film revolving around this would result in whatever threat there might be born out of whether the Nazi's would stay true to their word or not. As it happens there're some incidences in which this is used to get across a scrap of dramatic weight but the real story going on here is that which relates to the title an Aryan couple whom work for the Krauzenberg family and are secretly working for the resistance so secretly in fact that their employers know nothing of it. The film begins with a somewhat illjudged sequence which sees a whole load of holocaust iconography thrust into our faces. Where maybe a series of text might have been more efficient informing us of necessary statistics and actions that were going in at the time in the area Daly throws a series of scenes at us in which dramatic shots of death camps and cattle trains accompanied by the necessary music are the order of the day on one particular occasion a tracking shot towards an oven as the looming brooding sound effects crank it up a level. From the off the film lays out its hand telling us to feel the pain and the emotion which comes with this sort of subject material rather than allowing us to naturally arrive at this point in our own time as the film tragically progresses.Following the premature bombardment of some of this content the film will cut to a train station and use a second manipulation cue in that it provides us with a Nazi guard on the platform tossing a child's toy onto the coal carriage located just behind the engine  obviously lost or dropped following the ensuing chaos of herding those 'guilty' of Judaism onto a cattle train. It's this somewhat sickly identification the film makes with the fact there are children involved which again begs us to fasttrack emotion and feel the pain and emotional anxiety which almost certainly comes when better films are executing similar subject matter in a more efficient manner. The opening is an acknowledgement to those that died whereas the film is more about those that are desperately doing everything in their power to survive. Daly's referencing to those that did perish is nothing more than exactly that a mere 'nod' of the head a removing of the hat to those that suffered  to say it doesn't quite reach the levels of achievement Polanski got to in 2002's The Piainist in terms of getting across a sense of fear loss tragedy risk and survival  all at various points and all observed brilliantly is a gross understatement. The Aryan couple of the title are Hans Vassmann Doughty and his wife Ingrid Carver two people whom it is established are 'doing their bit' in smuggling in the necessary items required to run a resistance outlet at the Krauzenberg's huge home. One of only very few tense moments comes early on involving the two when they try to get past a German checkpoint whilst carrying items they'd surely be shot for possessing. It might've been even more effective had the German guards not been played by British actors speaking in English the whole time  is it asking too much to have German actors playing these role and using the German language? It would seem the filmmakers were worrying a little too much about audience accessibility to the piece than giving a more authentic experience for the rest of us.The film maintains a pretty desperate sense that it wants to tug at those heart strings more often than not thus encompassing some pretty melodramatic acting accompanied by some daftly executed scenes best highlighted in the instance when some family heirlooms are handed over to the Aryan couple in a 'thank you' gesture. Some Nazi officers carry scars on their faces to emphasise evilness most of the lines at the more tense of times are representative of peculiar screen writing and are delivered in the worst of fashions We will never be forgotten a character states at one point around a dinner table over a rousing musical score but we're not involved enough to feel anything while a moral predicament two people question each other over seems halfbaked and lacking in any sort of real dramatic effect. The Aryan Couple is quite the little cinematic misfire a floundering mess of an adaptation of what is a supposedly true story of something which deserved better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another in the string of Holocaust movies released in recent years The Aryan Couple is a fictionalized account of a wealthy Jewish couple buying their way out of Germany in 1944 in return for handing over all of their wealth to the Nazis represented in this film by Himmler and Eichmann along with a number of subordinates  some repulsive and some more sympathetic. Martin Landau had the lead role as Jewish industrialist Joseph Krauzenberg  desperate to get his family out of Germany before they end up being sent to Auschwitz or Treblinka. Added into the mix are the Krauzenberg's Aryan servants Hans and Ingrid who are really a Jewish couple working for the resistance who also need to be spirited out of Germany before their real identities are discovered.The movie attempts to reveal part of the somewhat shadowy plan to exchange Jews for cash the socalled Europa Plan. In that it sheds a bit of light on a piece of the Holocaust that hasn't really received very much attention over the years. This isn't however one of the stronger Holocaust movies in spite of its relatively fresh subject matter. It tends to plod along for the most part until moments of extremely high tension suddenly appear such as the dinner at the Krauzenberg home attended by Eichmann and Himmler which included a wonderful performance by Judith Parfitt who played Rachel Krauzenberg as she displayed her completely undisguised contempt for her Nazi guests the revelation of Hans and Ingrid's true identities and their eventual escape into Switzerland. Sometimes though it seemed to me as if director John Daly was trying too hard to raise the tension in those dramatic scenes almost as if to compensate for the relative lack of drama in the rest of the movie.This is certainly worth watching because it does deal with a little known aspect of the Holocaust but in no other way could it really be considered a great movie. 410".

In that it sheds a bit of light on a piece of the Holocaust that hasn't really received very much attention over the years. This isn't however one of the stronger Holocaust movies in spite of its relatively fresh subject matter. It tends to plod along for the most part until moments of extremely high tension suddenly appear such as the dinner at the Krauzenberg home attended by Eichmann and Himmler which included a wonderful performance by Judith Parfitt who played Rachel Krauzenberg as she displayed her completely undisguised contempt for her Nazi guests the revelation of Hans and Ingrid's true identities and their eventual escape into Switzerland. Sometimes though it seemed to me as if director John Daly was trying too hard to raise the tension in those dramatic scenes almost as if to compensate for the relative lack of drama in the rest of the movie.This is certainly worth watching because it does deal with a little known aspect of the Holocaust but in no other way could it really be considered a great movie. 410";

Since I do not view movies from the prospect of the acting scenery etc. I found that this storyline does reflect what some experienced. It is certainly true that many objects'art were confiscated by the Nazis and it is certainly true that many lost their homes  businesses and lives. History later will reflect some of the same type of incidents from Iraqis who escaped Sadam's exploits.

Since I do not view movies from the prospect of the acting scenery etc. I found that this storyline does reflect what some experienced. It is certainly true that many objects'art were confiscated by the Nazis and it is certainly true that many lost their homes  businesses and lives. History later will reflect some of the same type of incidents from Iraqis who escaped Sadam's exploits.

Adolf Hitler does seem like a depressed businessman in stead of a psychopath ruling whole Europe and killing 6 million Jews. The Holocaust deserves proper movies like Schindlers List or The Pianist.

	schema:headline " Raquel Welch Makes this Picture Worth Watching";
	schema:reviewBody "This picture hit the movie screens on October 17th 1977 overseas in France. Starring in this film is the beautiful and gorgeous Raquel Welch who plays the role of Jane Gardner and Jean Paul Belmondo who plays the role of Mike Gaucher. The picture opens with Mike climbing the side of a burning building to rescue Jane Gardner from the fire. While talking about there up coming wedding which is the next day the producer remains Mike that the car crash scene is to start at 10am. Jane stands here ground and said no until her and Mike compromise and agrees to get married right after the scene is done. While in the car doing the crash scene for the second time the brakes in the car give out leaving the couple hanging over a bridge. The car gives and goes straight down putting both Mike and Jane in the hospital. With both of them in the same room the Justice of the Piece shows up to marry the couple. However Jane changes her mind and throws the Minister out of the room. Then she takes a pair of scissors then pulls her bed over to Mike's and tries to stab him with the scissors. After both Mike and Jane injuries heal Mike still wants to marry Jane but Jane wants nothing to do with the two time loser. After having no work Mike gets a call to go to Paris to do stunt man job for one of the local movie stars. When the stunt woman walks of the set its up to Mike to find a replacement and who's his first choose none other then Jane. So Mike follows Jane to a big party where he tries to convince Jane to work with him on this job or his finished. After running around and acting crazy Jane says yes just to get him away from her. What makes matters worst is Jane decides she going to marry one of the movie directors from Paris. Now Mike has to do anything and everything if he wants to keep Jane to himself. This wasn't a bad movie and if it wasn't for the beauty of Raquel Welch this movie wouldn't even be worth watching. The best seen is where there near the water and Raquel gets her on piece suit wet and she's shows of her beauty with style. I give this picture 10 weasel stars just for that scene alone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Forget the stories about miscasting and squabbles on the set. This production of HELLO DOLLY! is big and bright and brassy with Barbra Streisand taking center stage as Dolly Levi the matchmaker with a mind to marry a crusty halfamillionaire from Yonkers.The story line is familiar. The musical is based on Thornton Wilder's play THE MATCHMAKER and was a Broadway sensation for Carol Channing in 1964. This film version trims the story drops a couple songs and adds a new one Love Is Only Love. Directed by Gene Kelly and choreographed by Michael Kidd the film makes good use of location shooting around New York State.Streisand in only her second film is in great voice and shows a nice comic touch. Yes Dolly is supposed to be middle aged but it really doesn't matter. And with those turnofthecentury hair styles and clothes you can't tell anyway.Walter Matthau is good as crusty Horace though his accent wanders and Michael Crawford makes for a delightful Cornelius Hackl. Marianne McAndrew is Irene E.J. Peaker is Minnie and Danny Lockin is Barnaby. Others in the cast include Judy Knaiz as Gussie Tommy Tune as Ambrose Joyce Ames as Ermengarde David Hurst as Rudy and Louis Armstrong as the bandleader.The songs by Jerry Herman are wonderful and have witty lyrics. Two huge production numbers dominate the film. In the first half Before the Parade Passes By is a stunner sung by Streisand it turns into a gigantic parade beneath a summer sky and it's as big and brassy a musical number as you'll ever see. Of course the title song is a show stopper and well staged in the Harmonia Gardens on 14th Street. Streisand makes her famous entrance and return to life after a period of widowhood down a grand staircase. She wears a glittering gown of gold as she sings and dances with a battery of waiters. She also does a memorable duet with Armstrong in his final film appearance.Yes it's old fashioned. But the film is so bright and tuneful it never lags. It was the 4 boxoffice hit of 1969. Bottom line Streisand makes for a great Dolly and this is a great film musical.".

I know it almost bankrupted 20th Century Fox and that the critics were lukewarm about it on release in 1969 but they were flatout wrong. And the perspective afforded by the passage of time has seen this become one of the mostloved of the Hollywood blockbuster musicals.The principals in the cast are all wonderful. Streisand is simply gorgeous and sings beautifully as does Marianne McAndrew. Matthau is well typical Matthau all wonderful hangdog expressions of exasperation and a grouchy exterior hiding a warmhearted soul. Michael Crawford in an early role doesn't quite have the voice he developed later in life but it suits the part of the shy and nervous Hackl. The music is fabulous. It is one of Jerry Herman's very best pieces of work in my opinion. It's full of great songs and the finale setpiece when Dolly returns to the Harmonia Gardens is magnificent along with Louis Armstrong's great singing.Gene Kelly had Michael Kidd onboard as choreographer and he produced some superb setpieces. The parade scene is incredible and required hundreds of extras. The story might be a bit thin but the production values more than make up for it. The sets are remarkable as are the costumes. The fact it was shot in 65mm ToddAO means that it is a great visual experience with tremendous detail visible.This is a truly great musical movie. If you haven't seen it you really really should. You'll been for a treat.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was certainly beautiful to look at and listen to. I was lucky to see it in 70 mm during its initial roadshow release. It was one of the few movies to have the negative actually filmed in 70 mm rather than having the standard 35 mm merely blown up to 70 mm for the roadshow. The Sound of Music was another picture originally filmed in 70 mm and we all know how beautiful the cinematography was in that. Sadly the high cost of 70 mm has essentially ended the use of that type of film format.Hello Dolly! deserved the Oscars it won such as musical direction sound and art directionset design. About 15 years ago I stopped in the riverside village of Garrison New York to see where it was partially filmed. The real building that was adapted into Vandergelder's Hay  Feed was still there at the time and Vandergelder was etched on the window pane from its use in the film. The bridge over the railway tracks is still there.As much as I like the film as a whole it does have some problems that could have been easily corrected. The early scene with Walter Matthau and Tommy Tune arguing over Ermengarde is overly dramatic and simply too theatrical. It might have been fine on Broadway but the genre of cinema requires a bit of toning down. I blame this purely on Gene Kelly the director who should have known better. He is the one who is supposed to sense the pacing and delivery of lines. I get the impression he was trying to speed things up knowing that there is a lot to fit into the picture. The screenplay was naturally required to closely follow the original material but it could have been simplified a bit without sacrificing anything important. An example of this is the endless number of times that the audience is reminded that the main characters are going to New York by train. Once was enough.Still the music and choreography are superb and carry the picture. Not everyone in it can sing as beautifully as Barbra Streisand but it succeeds nonetheless. The number Put On Your Sunday Clothes is one of Hollywood's golden moments in terms of production quality. I have seen Carol Channing do the stage version and she was great but I also feel that Barbra Streisand was perfectly adequate here. She can sing better than Ms. Channing and has real star quality.If you visit the interesting Hudson River area of New York state you will be warmly reminded of the scenic beauty in Hello Dolly! Drop by the U.S. Military Academy at West Point to take the public tour and you will see the magnificent setting where the final wedding scene was done minus the church of course.".

	schema:reviewBody "This generation I'm ashamed to say MY generation just doesn't seem to appreciate a good musical much less one that came out when our parents were youngens heaven forbid! It will be a sad day when these classic films are forgotten but fortunately they are all being remastered and rereleased on DVD for this generation to enjoy if only they would give them a chance.I bought the special edition of 'Hello Dolly' because I adore musicals especially those from the 50s and 60s when Hollywood really knew how to do it right! The top 3 billings were all people I had heard off... Streisand may not be the easiest person to love but her voice is astounding... Who could forget Walter Matthau in 'Dennis the Menace' a film slightly more known to my age group... and last but certainly not least Michael Crawford a voice I had been listening to since age 3. I grew up listening to his solo albums as well as the original cast recording of 'Phantom.' I will say he was my main incentive for seeing this film.'Dolly' is musically and visually stunning. All the principle cast members sing on their own always a bonus and the songs are accompanied by some of the most entertaining and memorable dance numbers next to 'A Chorus Line.' One could expect no less since this film is directed by the infamous Gene Kelly. Need I say more? 'Hello Dolly' is by far my favorite of the classics and believe me I've seen them all. Sure you can complain that Barbra was too young to play Miss Dolly Levi but the woman has talent you can't deny it nomatter how you feel towards her as a human being. She can sing and she can act why settle for for someone who fails to meet the former and resort to dubbing? That's the one flaw in 'My Fair Lady.' Matthau is astounding as always and I have already stated how much I love Crawford. He is just so positively adorable in the role of Cornelius Hackl! Understanably his gorgeous tenor isn't nearly as developed at age 27 as it was at age 44 when 'Phantom' opened in London but it's pleasant nonetheless and his acting is superb as always flawlessly hiding his lovely accent behind the mousy but sweet demeanor of a Yonkers store clerk.I love 'Hello Dolly!' and I would recommend it to anyone who loves the classics. It's funny uplifting and heartwarming... what more could a person want in a movie? Don't miss this movie you're never too young to enjoy the classics.".

	schema:headline " I'd kinda like to see Barbra do this role now";
	schema:reviewBody "The miscasting of Barbra Streisand is an interesting topic of discussion regarding this movie.  She's way too young as everyone else has said despite slight changes to the script and giving everyone the benefit of the doubt it's silly to think that a woman in her mid twenties would have built up both the social contacts and worldly sangfroid that the character possesses.  That said however she does about as well as anyone could ask playing a role she was 3 decades too young for.  The animosity between Barbra and Walter Matthau is another problemthey have no chemistry together whatsoever.  While his annoyance with her at the beginning is believable the turnabout at the end comes across completely false. Fortunately the movie has many other charms to make up for that central problem.My favorite part of the movie and the heart of the film is the courtship of Cornelius  Irene and Barnaby  Minnie Fay.  Michael Crawford and the late Danny Lockin are absolutely adorable as Cornelius and Barnaby.  The Dancing and Elegance numbers and the dinner scene at the Harmonia Gardens are worth the price of admission alone.  Barbra plays better with the rest of the cast too she's more believable as a woman of the world when she's with the younger cast members.  The production design is wonderful as well.  While the movie was outrageously expensive for its time just about every dollar is visible on screen.  The claustrophobic musicals they've made since the Seventies really look deficient when compared to the wideopen dance scenes and crowd shots in classic musicals like this one.All in all Hello Dolly has much to offer.  It's not the best musical ever made by a long shot but it's undeniably fun to watch.  It would be fun to see Barbra play the role now that she's a more appropriate age for it. Unfortunately she doesn't do musicals anymore.  Maybe Tyne Daly would take the part.".

Lots of money was spent on making this film and every cent of it can be seen in the finished product. The film is leaps and bounds over almost everything made today.

	schema:reviewBody "The strange history of the making of Hello Dolly could make a fine motion picture itself. The feuding between Barbra Streisand and Walter Matthau during the filming is well known and documented. The incredible costs of the thing has also become an object lesson for movie producers who are not operating in the days of the studio system and actually have to pay the talent involved what they're worth. It's the biggest reason why musical films are now so few and far between.But I read a fascinating story in the Citadel Film series book on the films of Gene Kelly who directed Hello Dolly. It seems as though 20th Century Fox after scoring so big with The Sound Of Music decided on buying other big budget Broadway musicals hoping for lightning to strike twice. They bought the rights of Hello Dolly from producer David Merrick with the proviso that the film not be shown until the Broadway run concluded. So Fox made the film with huge production costs with borrowed money from bankers who wanted their loans paid back as soon as possible. What Merrick did and certainly the demand was there was to keep the show running. Hello Dolly wrapped in early 1968 and was over a year sitting on the shelf not earning a dime. In the meantime the finance boys had to be repaid and with heavy interest.Fox went to court to get out of the contract and release the film and Merrick did for some hefty financial consideration. By the time Hello Dolly sold its first ticket there was no way it could ever payback the cost. In fact it was the fifth highest grossing film of 1969 and still Fox lost big money on it. In the words of Barnaby Tucker Holy Cabooses.Well they spent big money on it and it shows. The production numbers are expensive the entire town of Garrison New York was made up to look like Yonkers at the turn of the last century. The New York scenes were lovely to look at and expensive to the bean counters. And what the biggest musical star of her time commanded in salary ate a lot of that budget as well. It's a great film that Kelly put together however and certainly Gene Kelly was a man who knew his way around the musical film. Between Streisand and Matthau feuding he must have felt like a referee. But both were professional enough to turn in good performances though the chemistry isn't quite there.Louis Armstrong's record of the title song is an American classic and it was almost mandatory that he appear in the film. His duet with Barbra Streisand is a piece of cinematic musical history. A fitting end for a man who brought the joy of living to his art and shared it with a grateful world.Besides the immortal title song Jerry Herman's score has some other gems in it as well. Streisand has one of the best numbers in her career with When The Parade Passes By and young Michael Crawford and Danny Lockin as Matthau's employees sing and dance a storm in It Only Takes A Moment.I can't finish this review without a word about Danny Lockin who left this earth way too soon the victim of a brutal murder. His performance as Barnaby Tucker is so winning that you can't help a tear coming to your eye when you read about his fate. His dancing reminded a whole lot of Donald O'Connor I'll bet Donald O'Connor thought so as well if he saw Hello Dolly. He lived a life that convention dictate as a gay man he could not be open about it. The closet eventually killed him but he left us this wonderful performance to remember him by.And to you the late Danny Lockin this review is respectfully dedicated to. Holy Cabooses Danny I'll bet you're giving Terpsichore a lesson in high stepping.".

Gene Kelly INTENTIONALLY cast Barbara Streisand as a younger more sexual Dolly rather than the older version because he thought it would make more money... obviously wrong but nonetheless an interesting strategy. I don't remember much of that time late 60's but I do remember seeing the movie with my mother at a drivein way back then and then catching a commercialridden version on a local TV station in the 80's after I had significantly fallen in love with Babs by way of Yentl. I believe if I remember correctly that Rudy's line at the Harmonia Gardens says that Dolly has not made an appearance there in over 2 years  not 20 not 40 not 50... Let's assume that Ephraim died some 2 years ago and Dolly in despair cut herself out of her old life.  Even at 27 Babs age at the time she could have been widowed at 25 which at the turn of the century would have been about 7 years of marriage for most ladies... How long did she have to have been married to qualify as experienced.  She purposefully picks on Horace because she has decided not to look for another love of her life but rather has chosen to affect someone who is bound to spend his life alone like she has been facing and make something more of his life than he alone could have done.  Remember she even says in her prayer to Ephraim Oh it won't be a marriage in the sense that we had one... Get off the She's too young kick and look at the movie for what it is... a big splashy excellent produced bit of Americana.

Louis Armstrong who originally recorded the song without ever seeing the Broadway show adds just the right touch to the showmanship of the picture.";

	schema:headline " Most high school drama departments could do better";
	schema:reviewBody "It is hard to finish watching Hello Dolly! without wanting to strangle director Gene Kelly or at least sue him for malpractice. The acting is generally atrocious. I hope this won't hurt any of the actors' feelings those still alive because glimpses of competence sneak into their performances now and then presumably when Kelly wasn't looking.The most outrageously bad performance is delivered by E.J. Peaker who seems to be delivering her lines on Laugh In or the Grand 'Ole Opry. Several actors sometimes seem to have dubbed their lines in a studio. Tommy Tune would be lucky to pass a high school drama class with his wideeyed goofy performance. Even high schoolers wouldn't ham it up so much. The only relatively natural acting comes from Marianne McAndrew and Walter Matthau. I suspect Matthau wouldn't let Kelly push him into an exaggerated performance. He probably could see what was coming that the overacting would be the film's Achille's heel. We don't see the full Matthau edgy persona he seems a bit distant. Matthew Crawford delivers the most amusing performance of the film. When this movie came out everyone was shocked and disappointed that they weren't going to get to see Carol Channing play Dolly. Everyone in America knew the music and many had the Broadway cast album so Channing WAS Dolly. And everyone in America would have gone to see the movie if Channing were in it. Barbara Streisand on the other hand was too Sixties in most people's mind to work and not Matthau's type. The Broadway production was an enormous success. I don't know why because I never saw it. There was the great music some dancing and the fantasy of traveling back 70 years to 1890s New York City. Fantasies don't need fancy sets if anything too much realism can interfere. And that's one of the mistakes this movie makes. The sumptuous sets are among the most amazing ever created for a movie but were a total waste of money. Guys and Dolls was set in NYC but many of the movie sets were painted backdrops and little of it looked realistic but that didn't stop it from being a great musical. Most musicals are that way and for a reason they are fantasies. Most of the acting was stylized Broadway performances which clashed with such realistic sets and just didn't fit a movie. Most of the performances and lines were rushed which is a problem because the plot gets a bit complex in the beginning. Also the scenes tend to shift without much connection or flow. It's as though this was a multitrack recorded movie with each person delivering their performances separately in a sound studio without any real interaction. There is ZERO chemistry between all of the performers. Early on I thought to myself they should have hired Ernest Lehman to write the script. So I checked and oops they did! Lehman did the screen adaptation of The Sound of Music and wrote North by Northwest. He puts a lot of effort into his writing so I have to believe this screenplay was as good an adaptation as you could get.So what went wrong? The directing. Some directors leave actors alone for the most part and some give them specific instructions. Kelly must have pushed them into these exaggerated performances and I suspect pushed hard. If he had allowed them to use their judgment and let them interact the movie would have been much better. I think Kelly had been a singerdancer in too many mediocre musicals that he was told were masterpieces like An American in Paris. So I think he came to believe that if you had lavish colorful dance numbers and lots of good music the movie would be a big success. But several of the dance numbers are way over the top as though he is trying to top Fred Astaire and have little to do with the story. The dancing waiters during Hello Dolly remind me of the Mel Brooks parody The Producers the original with Zero Mostel which was deliberately trying to be as tacky as possible. Kelly was a pretty good actor but not great. I guess most of his acting was just being Gene Kelly perhaps that's why he didn't really know how to direct actors. Just guessing.The bottom line is that a lot of individual elements of Hello Dolly! are excellent but the movie is less than the sum of it's part. The story of Louis Armstrong's hit recording of the title tune is interesting. As I recall he recorded it in one take never having heard the tune before in a studio as a favor. It was released after the Broadway show premiered while Armstrong was on tour and to his puzzlement suddenly everyone was requesting he perform Hello Dolly! a song he barely remember recording. No one imagined the song would be a hit including Armstrong except perhaps the composer. Armstrong rerecorded it in 1964 and believe me everyone heard that song on the radio a million times and was whistling the tune it seemed they never got tired of it. Armstrong had a long career as the premiere jazz musician in America as well as being a popular performer but this one song brought him to the attention of a new generation and gave his career a second wind. It was not a sophisticated jazz performance but I don't think Satchmo minded he always seemed to want to make music his audience would enjoy.By the time the movie was finally released in 1969 the music had gotten a bit stale. The world had changed and musical tastes had changed too. I hope people today can forgive this movie its flaws so they can enjoy the delightful music.".

It's been a long time and truthfully I had my reservations about the show even then. Watching the film again this past Saturday on Reel 13 I was reminded how lame the show really is and the film version as directed by Gene Kelly is even worse.I suspect the popularity of Jerry Herman's original production during the 60's had more to do with the Carol Channing persona than the story. If that's true then the film was handicapped before it even began by bypassing Channing in favor of a very young Barbra Streisand playing a character fifteen or twenty years older than she actually was. This is not to say that Streisand is bad in the role. Her strongest assets  her voice and her comic timing  are on prime display here and she imbues the character with an engaging energy and vitality. She puts forth extraordinary effort but one has a hard time believing that a she is a widowed matchmaker and has been out of the public scene for a decade and b she would be a good match for Walter Matthau's Horace Vandergelder character. This is the primary plot of the film and the film suffers because it never once seems plausible. Gosh  Streisand seems even younger than the ingnue Irene Malloy character Marianne McAndrew.Unfortunately the rest of the cast who were at least ageappropriate were horribly offthemark in their performances. On the whole I blame Kelly who seems to have directed all of them except maybe Streisand and Matthau to be ridiculously overthetop. This includes a babyfaced Michael Crawford as Cornelius Hackl and a Idon'tbelievehe'sstraightforasecond Tommy Tune both of which went on to have wonderful stage careers. On film they come off as silly and cartoonish. What's interesting to me is that as an actor Kelly was always so smooth sincere and understated. I'm bewildered as to why he wasn't able to bring that style to the table when he's behind the camera. It could have done wonders for the plot. It's hard enough to believe that all these people fall in love there are four couples in the film within a twentyfour hour period. The wideeyed loud and juvenile performance styles make it impossible but I wonder what it would have been like if the characters had the opportunity to establish real connections with each other  make us care and root for them to get together. It could have made for an entirely different experience.For more information on this or any other Reel 13 film check out their website at www.reel13.org".

	schema:headline " A big huge musical circus Barbra nearly succeeds in holding up this elephant.";
	schema:reviewBody "The biggest beef everyone always has about the cinematic version of Hello Dolly! is that Barbra Streisand was too young to play widow and professional meddler Dolly Levi.  Of course if we trace the history of Dolly I can't refute the fact that the role is closely identified synonymous even with two Broadway legends  Carol Channing who was 43 at the time she created the musical version and Pearl Bailey who was 49. Ruth Gordon was 58 when she played Dolly in the Broadway play The Matchmaker and Shirley Booth was 60 in the 1958 nonmusical movie version. So O.K. Dolly is usually an old broad.  I get it.The 27yearold Streisand had just come off a smashing Oscarwinning success in just her first vehicle Funny Girl and had Hollywood at her feet.  As a result she was handed the part on a silver platter   to the understandable distress of Channing.  Unfair as it may be Channing had never carried a musical film Bailey either and had the fatal reputation of coming off too weird a personality for film Bailey too.  Channing had offered flashy support in only two features up until 1969.  And despite receiving a Golden Globe award and Oscar nomination in the thoroughly mediocre Thoroughly Modern Millie just the year before it was not enough for producers to entrust Channing with the most expensive musical 24000000 ever made at the time.  With Funny Girl' and now Hello Dolly! the triumphant Barbra was singlehandedly bringing back MGMstyled blockbusters back to the movie houses.  Well the musical was not a financial success anyway.  But I insist not because of Barbra Streisand.  Yes yes yes she was far too young for the part but after the wonderful vibrant introductory number Just Leave Everything to Me she takes full command and makes the role her own never losing steam.  More importantly she makes the age of the character a nonissue.  Barbra shows a maturity beyond her years in Dolly and her comic timing is absolutely impeccable  especially the Irene Malloy shop scene and the exquisite dinner sequence with Horace Vandergelder at the Harmonia Gardens.  I suggest the dissenters and there are many rewatch this movie again throwing away all preconceived attitudes about La Streisand as a person or perfectionist and just watch real star power at work.  And as an added plus Dolly's song were finally sung by a singer!  With all due respect to Pearlie Mae and Carol it was sheer heaven to hear Barbra wrap those gorgeously golden tonsils around Before the Parade Passes By Put On Your Sunday Clothes and the added Love Is Only Love'.  Beautiful songs deserve to be sung beautifully.The problem with this grandiose production is not Barbra but what's around Barbra.  Walter Matthau practically sleepwalks through the Vandergelder role.  Granted his chemistry with Barbra was zilch due to their volatile offcamera relationship.  But still you gotta have some kind of charm even when playing a miserable grouse and he ain't got a bit of it here.  Michael Crawford is a constant irritant as Cornelius Hackl.  Some very weird annoying mannerisms and tonal qualities make him a most unwelcome guest in these proceedings.   Marianne McAndrew is lovely and quite pleasant but limited and ultimately forgettable as Irene Malloy while E.J. Peaker as Minnie Fay looks like she was coached by Crawford suffering from the same kind of giddy gulping annoying affectations that apparently afflict actors trying to play hilariously gawky.  Tommy Tune is well just so TALL!!!  I forget he's suppose to be playing a person!  The late Danny Lockin an energetic worker here comes off best among the supporting cast as Barnaby Tucker beaming with a huggable aw shucks' innocence while showing off his extensive dancing prowess.  Sadly Lockin was murdered stabbed to death a few years after the completion of Dolly.'  He was only 34.As directed by Gene Kelly Hello Dolly! deserved to be the big circuslike entertainment it was.  But not even Barbra can be expected to hold up an elephant like this alone.  It has a hollow empty feel whenever she's not on camera.  The allimportant choreography by Michael Kidd seemed tired and uninspiring as well.  But Babs gives it her all Mae West be damned and she nearly pulls it off.".

Ruth Gordon was 58 when she played Dolly in the Broadway play The Matchmaker and Shirley Booth was 60 in the 1958 nonmusical movie version. So O.K. Dolly is usually an old broad.  I get it.The 27yearold Streisand had just come off a smashing Oscarwinning success in just her first vehicle Funny Girl and had Hollywood at her feet.  As a result she was handed the part on a silver platter   to the understandable distress of Channing.  Unfair as it may be Channing had never carried a musical film Bailey either and had the fatal reputation of coming off too weird a personality for film Bailey too.  Channing had offered flashy support in only two features up until 1969.  And despite receiving a Golden Globe award and Oscar nomination in the thoroughly mediocre Thoroughly Modern Millie just the year before it was not enough for producers to entrust Channing with the most expensive musical 24000000 ever made at the time.  With Funny Girl' and now Hello Dolly! the triumphant Barbra was singlehandedly bringing back MGMstyled blockbusters back to the movie houses.  Well the musical was not a financial success anyway.  But I insist not because of Barbra Streisand.  Yes yes yes she was far too young for the part but after the wonderful vibrant introductory number Just Leave Everything to Me she takes full command and makes the role her own never losing steam.  More importantly she makes the age of the character a nonissue.  Barbra shows a maturity beyond her years in Dolly and her comic timing is absolutely impeccable  especially the Irene Malloy shop scene and the exquisite dinner sequence with Horace Vandergelder at the Harmonia Gardens.  I suggest the dissenters and there are many rewatch this movie again throwing away all preconceived attitudes about La Streisand as a person or perfectionist and just watch real star power at work.  And as an added plus Dolly's song were finally sung by a singer!  With all due respect to Pearlie Mae and Carol it was sheer heaven to hear Barbra wrap those gorgeously golden tonsils around Before the Parade Passes By Put On Your Sunday Clothes and the added Love Is Only Love'.  Beautiful songs deserve to be sung beautifully.The problem with this grandiose production is not Barbra but what's around Barbra.  Walter Matthau practically sleepwalks through the Vandergelder role.  Granted his chemistry with Barbra was zilch due to their volatile offcamera relationship.  But still you gotta have some kind of charm even when playing a miserable grouse and he ain't got a bit of it here.  Michael Crawford is a constant irritant as Cornelius Hackl.  Some very weird annoying mannerisms and tonal qualities make him a most unwelcome guest in these proceedings.   Marianne McAndrew is lovely and quite pleasant but limited and ultimately forgettable as Irene Malloy while E.J. Peaker as Minnie Fay looks like she was coached by Crawford suffering from the same kind of giddy gulping annoying affectations that apparently afflict actors trying to play hilariously gawky.  Tommy Tune is well just so TALL!!!  I forget he's suppose to be playing a person!  The late Danny Lockin an energetic worker here comes off best among the supporting cast as Barnaby Tucker beaming with a huggable aw shucks' innocence while showing off his extensive dancing prowess.  Sadly Lockin was murdered stabbed to death a few years after the completion of Dolly.'  He was only 34.As directed by Gene Kelly Hello Dolly! deserved to be the big circuslike entertainment it was.  But not even Barbra can be expected to hold up an elephant like this alone.  It has a hollow empty feel whenever she's not on camera.  The allimportant choreography by Michael Kidd seemed tired and uninspiring as well.  But Babs gives it her all Mae West be damned and she nearly pulls it off.";

Hollywood concerns kept Carol Channing out of this role  I gather the honchos were afraid she and Matthau couldn't carry the film  although for some reason she was able to costar in 1956's The First Traveling Saleslady and several other subsequent films including Thoroughly Modern Millie.I'm a huge fan of musicals and to my husband's chagrin I'll take over the remote for any costume epic.

I rated this higher than I would have normally because it had singing well duh it's a musical  and the singing was generally good. Yes I rate most musicals higher than the average movie. I'm biased.

Such was the stature of Carol Channing in the 1960's and the acclaim she brought both to the character of Dolly and to the entire Hello Dolly!

I saw her stage performance she and she alone had the ability to make the character of Dolly credible.But unfortunately for whatever reason the powers that be decided not to cast Channing in the film one of the saddest errors in movie musical history.  The film was a box office disappointment.Although Channing's absence is the film's single biggest letdown for me it is not the only letdown.  With a DVD run time of 146 minutes the film gushes with lengthy and at times totally unnecessary scenes.  The gaudy parade spectacle alone with all that pomp and mass of humanity goes on for six minutes while doing nothing to further the plot.  Similarly all those scenes in the Harmonia Gardens are over produced over directed and just plain overblown.  Further Hello Dolly! is supposed to be a comedy.  At least the stage version with Carol Channing was funny.The film does have a few good points.  Louis Armstrong makes a welcome but too brief appearance toward the end of the film.  The late Danny Lockin with tons of talent gives a wonderfully animated performance.  And Marianne McAndrew with her perfect posture and stunning overall appearance is excellent in the role of Irene.These few gold nuggets aside the film does not live up to what it could have been had there been some restraint in production some careful editing and especially the inclusion of Carol Channing in the title role.".

And no sorry I haven't seen Carol Channing but that hardly matters. In my book Streisand IS Dolly Levi. What I have seen is Thornton Wilder's The Matchmaker' both in a production in the St. Lawrence Center in Toronto and a respectable local translated version in Cantonese. The Matchmaker in among Wilder's three most popular work the other two being Our Town and Skin of Our Teeth which I saw respectively in The Avon Theatre in Ontario's Startford Festival and The Festival Theatre in the Shaw Festival in NiagaraontheLake and local translated versions too. The Matchmaker is not the best of the three Our Town has to be. Adaptation to a musical however breaths into it a new life. I can't even remember when was the last time I watched Hello Dolly probably on a TV rerun.

This marchlike number by Horace concludes in a quiet insinuating reprise by Dolly beautifully delivered by Streisand as things are quietly set in motion for a chain of events that will give the audience two absolutely delightful hours.Excitement begins to mount as various parties echo their sentiments in Put on your Sunday Clothes' reminiscent of the crescendo building up to the climax of the fateful night in West Side Story ready to embark on the train ride from Yonkers to New York for adventure. Starting the number is Cornelius Hackl played by the remarkable Michael Crawford yes alias Phantom of the Opera. A skinny chap of 27 with a lovable boyish voice at the time of making Hello Dolly Crawford has come a long way to the Phantom personified. Interesting and heartwarming to note that obviously much matured his voice still contains recognizable timbres of lovable Cornelius Hackl.In New York gentle Irene Molloy is pining away with the little tune I'll be wearing ribbon down my back this summer' wondering when the right beau will come along. Then at Dolly's introduction Cornelius and Irene meet together with their respective sidekick Barnaby Tucker and Minnie Fay. The occasion of the gentlemen learning to dance under the instruction of Dolly gives rise to an excitingly jubilant number Dancing'.Then it is all Dolly's show with Streisand at her very best. Finally resigning to the reality that losing a husband after a perfect married life should not mean being sentenced to a lifetime of solitude Dolly Levi is ready to rejoin the human race. Before the parade passes by'. What a wonderful wonderful uplifting song that nobody absolutely nobody can bring to such soaring height as Barbra Streisand did in Hello Dolly.Before another climax we have a cute little interlude with the foursome singing Elegance' on their way to the grand restaurant.Dolly going on this grand occasion of reappearing in the Harmonia Restaurant to capture the heart of Horace is in a way similar to Eliza Doolittle or Gigi before their respective trials. Almost prayerlike she sings the beautiful ballad Love is only love' to tell herself that she is ready.

Of immense help is Louis Armstrong and his band as Dolly glides by them one after one teasingly Stanley lose some weightI think I think you did Stanley. The jazzy jamming between Streisand and Armstrong has to be the climax within a climax.If I have a particularly weakness for this movie it's Michael Crawford's It only takes a moment' the love song Cornelius sings to Irene. Simply beautiful. Towards the end Cornelius has a very brief monologue if I have to be a ditchdigger for the rest of my life I'll be one who has had one wonderful day' at which point one of the gathering bystanders interjects Bag you're pardon mister I came late just at It only' singing hopelessly off key. The bystander joins in a chorus takes a moment' and carry a tune for a few bars when Irene comes in with her brief reprise He held me for an instance'. The song ends in a lovely duet by the two.I like musicals in the Gilbert and Sullivan tradition with finales in which you hear a medley of the beautiful numbers again. Hello Dolly is I'm happy to say such a one.One last word. In a family vacation to New York quite a while ago I insisted that we stay in Yonkers.".

The bystander joins in a chorus takes a moment' and carry a tune for a few bars when Irene comes in with her brief reprise He held me for an instance'. The song ends in a lovely duet by the two.I like musicals in the Gilbert and Sullivan tradition with finales in which you hear a medley of the beautiful numbers again. Hello Dolly is I'm happy to say such a one.One last word. In a family vacation to New York quite a while ago I insisted that we stay in Yonkers.";

Don't compare her to other actresses who portrayed Dolly on stage. Barbra makes the role of Dolly her own. She deftly handles the foibles of HoraceWalter Matthau. Barbra as Dolly coyly and deliberately sets Horace up to be turned down by two other women so that he can be ripe for the picking when she triumphantly gets her hooks into him. It is all a setup.

These costumes and hats are quite a large group of designs for both men and women. They are quite period specific. There is a dance scene where they are dressed like tennis players. They wear white and light blue striped outfits. They carry tennis rackets in their dancing.I love the red jacketed waiters and their intricate dancing. They are just superb the way in which they handle brooms and swirling tablecloths.Horace is a jerk saying several nasty and rude things about women. He is such a curmudgeon. Later he softens toward women. He finally realizes that a softer kind of life beats the heck out of his formerly solitary and lonely way of life.I just love the parade scene. It was very complicated to organize choreograph and execute. I enjoy seeing the different groups marching in this parade.

I loved the film the first time I saw it and my appreciation remains undimmed after several viewings. The production is gorgeous what awesome set design is displayed in the Harmonia Gardens and Central Park set pieces! and the musical arrangements and choreography are firstrate. Note when Dolly tells Cornelius Hackl in the hat shop Just give me five minutes Mr. Hackl and I'll have you dancing in the streets. She's as good as her word and the ensuing sequence  with dancers leapfrogging over one another and throwing themselves off park benches into their beaus' arms  leaves you staring at the screen with an open mouth. Few of the principal actors could dance but the hyperkinetic Danny Lockin playing Barnaby Tucker is a joy to watch. I love it when he hops repeatedly over a bicycle before catching Minnie in his arms and riding off with her! Streisand and Matthau  personal animosity aside  make a wonderful couple. Their dialogue has a quality of oneupmanship that really tickles the viewer. One drawback to the film is that it typically plays on television shorn of its widescreen format  a decision that ruins many of the compositions especially in musical numbers. When I was a boy I couldn't understand how the cinematographer got an Oscar nomination when he kept chopping actors on the end of a row out of the frame! Streisand's singing is to die for. It's amazing how she handles the first bars repeating the single word Goodbye as she bids So long dearie to Vandergelder. On the other hand it's disorienting to hear Michael Crawford now a superstar for his performance in Phantom of the Opera open his mouth and produce that grating timorous little voice. I've always wondered does he sing like that on purpose as part of the role. It's probably just how Cornelius would sound in real life.All in all the film's a true 10. One of the alltime great Hollywood musicals. Great score marvellous cast crackerjack production.".

It certainly is a once in a lifetime role and it got Gary Cooper his first nomination for Best Actor. He lost that year to Paul Muni for The Story of Louis Pasteur. But Capra won for Best Director that year.Cooper poet laureate of Mandrake Falls inherits 20 million dollars from a rich uncle. He's not terribly impressed with that as he feels he's living just fine in Mandrake Falls. But he goes down to New York City to settle the estate and gets put up in grand style at his late uncle's mansion. The executor of the estate Douglass Dumbrille is one smooth talking white shoe bottom feeder. This is probably Dumbrille's best known classic villain John Cedar. He wants Cooper's power of attorney real bad to cover up some dipping he's done. Cooper isn't giving it to him right away though.In the meantime his inheritance has become news and local editor George Bancroft has dispatched sob sister reporter Jean Arthur to invade his inner sanctum. That's a common thread in the Capra populist trilogy a woman sent to invade the inner sanctum of the hero and ends up falling for him. Jean Arthur did it again to James Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and Cooper had it done to him again by Barbara Stanwyck in Meet John Doe.After a whole lot of silly incidents which Arthur duly reports on Cooper gets a real wake up call from one of what the current president then called a forgotten man. John Wray a desperate farmer tossed off his land and there were plenty of those in the twenties and thirties tells him off good and proper in a very powerful scene. Cooper his own values questioned decides to set up a fund to save the family farm as an institution. Then he's called insane and Dumbrille takes as clients other heirs who want to contest the will. Which leads to Cooper's hearing in court to determine his sanity.The values of Mr. Deeds are certainly eternal honesty and decency don't and should never go out of style. Unfortunately the family farm is a thing of the past there are less and less of them every year. It's agribusiness now so a faithful remake could never work today.Yet the original still has a charm that cannot be denied due to Frank Capra's vision and the way he got great performances out of the whole cast. One performance that shocked me was Raymond Walburn who usually plays avuncular loquacious types. He plays the butler to Cooper's uncle and now to Cooper himself. To those who expect the usual Walburn we know and love this is one different Walburn.Even though Mr. Deeds Goes to Town is rooted firmly in the Thirties it should still be seen and studied today.".

The acting is so good so right in tone humor pace  it makes everything believable even the silly court scene at the end.  It's a feelgood movie that still has a bittersweet message.  Jean Arthur's acting is beyond anything I've recently seen  every emotion is perfectly telegraphed with just the right intonation.  Gary Cooper who was nominated for best actor sprinkles his complex role with the necessary amount of macho pixie dust.   Highly recommended.  Can't wait to see Mr. Smith goes to Washington.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think of 'Mr. Deeds Goes To Town' as the happier shinier side of a 'Gary Cooper coin' that features 'Meet John Doe' as the cynical grubby under side. Both movies feature women who use newspaper stories to distort or manipulate the two leading males both played by Cooper. In each movie the two women Barbara Stanwyck in 'Doe' and Jean Arthur in 'Deeds' end up falling in love with Cooper as the women start believing in their creation or in the case of 'Deeds' finally seeing Deeds as he really is. Furthermore both movies turn an everyday man into a hero of the people. It would seem that Cooper was the perfect fit for whatever vehicle Frank Capra had in mind so long as it was about a 'hero of the people'.But as far as 'Mr. Deeds' is concerned there's so much to like about this film that it hardly matters at all to point out any minor detraction of the film. Capra works his usual magic from a wellassembled cast that includes Jean Arthur as Louis 'Babe' Bennett and in one of his best roles to date Lionel Standard as Cornelius Cobb. Fans of Standard may see a similarity between the character of 'Cornelius Cobb' and that of the 'Bodyguard' he played in Harold Lloyd's 'The Milky Way'. Lloyd's film came out only two month's prior to the release of 'Mr. Deeds'. With Capra's magic touch we are able to see a wonderful transformation take place inside the courtroom. Stacked with the odds against him Deeds outwits his detractors by simply pointing out the idiosyncrasies of everyone in the courtroom involved in his virtual lynching. His simple homespun logic and mannerly approach to the proceedings works like Kryptonite over the jaded and corrupt super city slickers looking for the soft spot on his neck.Although it is true that Capra has a 'magic touch' for appealing to the film going masses of yesterday as well as today his deftness in the art of emotional manipulation is a chief by product of that 'magic touch'. How can you not feel good about the character Longfellow Deeds when he's leaving his hometown while the local concert band is playing the song For He's a Jolly Good Fellow? To add more emotional punch to the send off Capra has Deeds playing tuba to his own going away party. Deeds also plays Auld Lang Syne at his hometown farewell. It would appear that Capra enjoyed using this tune as he also did so in 'It's A Wonderful Life' ten years later.Watch the scene where Deeds gets the hired help to yell and whoop it up inside his mansion just so they can all hear and enjoy the sound of their own voices echoing from wall to wall. It is a fantastic scene but just one of many in this movie where you can feel layers upon layers of cynicism melting away from your soul. 1010. Clark Richards".

Never have tears and laughs been so much intermingled in the same film..I was gushing tears in the scene where Deeds hands a poem which Babe reads in the fog on her doorstep ... a few minutes later Deeds goes running off home tripping up over a dustbin in the process and I was howling with laughter ... likewise the long passage in the courtroom when Deeds finally decides to speak up has me in fits of laughter over its finesse and wit. The final scene where Deeds comes back to the almost empty courtroom to collect Babe who had been sitting by herself there once again started off my waterworks as he picks her up and tenderly embraces her all over the place. Indeed that final kiss is one of the photos featured on France's 3rd TV channel's CinmaClub on most Sunday nights.They are truly indeed a BEAUTIFUL couple in all senses of the world. I will not go through the story of the film again as this has been more than amply related by others but suffice it to say I have never seen any other film made with quite this calibre and actors' performance. Ineed this is the type of film that could only be made once ! Each character is extremely well developed and each actoractress has exactly the physique of the character they play  an absolutely perfect match one of those oneoff films where everything combines to make for the spectator's perfect pleasure.What a shame that in the twenty first century we cannot produce films of this calibre using story line actors' performance and plot alone  to obtain thrills from presentday audiences large quantities of excessive noise flashing lights and especially computergenerated imagery are necessary .... all this at the expense of plot and of the humour and witty lines.

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes we all just need to be reminded of the important things in life. Sometimes we need to be happy. Sometimes we need inspiration.As a filmmaker Frank Capra understood those elements brilliantly. His films are often dismissed as 'Capracorn' and that they are not. Yes they contain a good dose of sentimentality and what has been termed as 'corn' Capra's favorite tune 'Auld Lang Syne' gets it's first runout here along with a slice of 'For He's A Jolly Good Fellow' yet they are films with a real message and real characters. Capra celebrates the common man and the spirit of man like no other.Here we have Gary Cooper as Longfellow Deeds a smalltown hick idealist who inherits 20 million. He is brought to the the city of New York and of course the leeches start to grab on immediately. This goodnatured harmless man is then taken for a ride by the town most notably by top journalist 'Babe' Bennet the wonderful Jean Arthur who eat up his boyish innocence with mirth. Yet 'Babe' softens and realizes the good in this man and the true qualities he possesses in doing so she falls in love with him. But the vultures are already pecking on Deeds as he is absurdly committed to an insane asylum for planning to give away his fortune to the poor the essential practice of 'noblesse oblige'.My favorite Capra film behind 'It's A Wonderful Life' 'Mr Deeds' argues against bigcity cynicism and the emphasis on capital gain. It also celebrates the individual and those that possess the quality of 'goodness'. Longfellow Deeds naive as he is has this trait and he is one of cinema's most heroic and enduring characters. Cooper is excellent in the role and gives a subtle and measured performance. Deeds' courtroom speech would have been a lesser actor's excuse to put on the theatrics yet Cooper captures and maintain's his character's quiet integrity throughout.Arthur one of my favorite actresses is also excellent as the cynic reporter. Arhur's best asset her unique voice delivers many sassy lines and serves her brilliantly. She's comedic dramatic lighthearted and emotional in the role truly a multifaceted performance. And is she beautiful!...this woman was 36 when this film was made and she looks gorgeous. Timeless. The chemistry and playing between her and Cooper is wonderful watching them fall in love is one of the infinite joys of classic cinema.Capra's range of interesting supporting characters are used to the hilt here and he has the benefit of a sharp script. Never one for visual style Capra based his success on characters and storytelling. Yet his films did develop a unique structure and look exemplified in his trademark use of 'Auld Lang Syne' and newsreels that jump to the screen to convey the narrative. He also did an excellent closeup.This film is truly one of the greats. It will bring tears to your eyes make you laugh love.It will inspire you make you realize the important things in life. It will make you realize the importance of caring for others and the power a lone individual can have if heshe stands up for their beliefs. Yes Capra simplifies his message and makes it all look so easy but even if we can take one tiny piece of 'good' away from this film and place it in our everyday lives we will reach someone.Idealistic moralistic filmmaking yes. Crap? No.An absolute classic.1010.".

Yes Gary Cooper is one of the most handsome actors I've seen. He delivers his skills with effervescent and attractive face emotions that anyone could fall in love with. Now the story revolves around some pixilated guy who has so charming skills to talk with people that anyone can easily get attracted to his simplicity soberness and faithfulness. A guy who's been living in a small town with not much of important aspects ever faced has to move to the town and face modern societal structure and its aftermath. Now one important message this film tries to share isHowever smart sharp or deceit a town can be a person who has everything good in him everything elegant in him can never be affected in a bad way until he himself tries to degrade him.Frank Capra has taken so lively so real so effective issue in 1930sthat is still applicable to this 21st century. A guy who sounds simple looks simple does one pixilated thing that looks a psychologically mad thing to others. But in real that only thing helps him to be brave neat and adroit to solve one in a million case of deceit against him. That proves that however a bad state is revolving around anyone if you stay simple be free from wrongs you can easily down the impossible against you. Coming to the movie Gary Cooper is simply super. He has shown how a simple actor can manage a whole movie without any highclass techniques. Jean Arthur is cute as well as compelling. She delivers the most than she is expected of. Worth seeing an actress in a movie which requires a punchy role and also delivers the same without forcing too much. She was just natural into the frames. Director Frank Capra should be praised for bringing out most real issue on the screens to depict the reality of big cities and how easily one can live to the most. As simple as it is this movie remains one of the most charming and funny movie of 1930's. The courtroom drama is shown well enough and humor is added rightly to make the audience engaged to get the required message in an enchanting way. With few of its flaws in the first half in acting and technical aspects this remains one of a gem.".

The romance between these two characters is simple formulaic and predictable but the messages that the film has help to pull it through. It is a slight satire on the media the justice system and generally the way in which we function as individual human beings. The film also ends on a high note with many laughs towards the end of the courtroom sequences. It is a bit fanciful and arguably Stander is added in just for laughs plus there are a few other minor imperfections.

It is not as famous as other Capra films like Mr. Smith Goes to Washington or It's a Wonderful Life but it is more entertaining than either of those. Gary Cooper's best role was in High Noon but Mr. Deeds is probably his most enjoyable role. This is a movie I can watch repeatedly and not get tired of. Cooper and Jean Arthur are wonderful together in this film. It ranks with Meet John Doe  You Can't Take it With You as my favorite Capra filmns. It follows a favorite theme of Capra's a simple man is exploited by rich corrupt people. In this case they are trying to take away the inheritance Longfellow has recieved from a distant relative.There is nothing bad I can say about this movie. It's hilarious touching and very entertaining. Gary Cooper is my favorite movie actor and here he completely shines. Mr. Deeds is another gem from Frank Capra.".

	schema:reviewBody "When a famous millionaire dies the media is aflame with the identity of his missing heir. The lawyers are just as interested and track him down to none other than smalltown simpleliving Longfellow Deeds. He is more bemused than anything else about his sudden wealth and goes to New York to find out more. Once there he finds no end of people offering him services or selling him things and he tries to find some humanity within the city and the sharks around him. He believes he has found it with womenindistress Mary Dawson but little does he know that she is really Babe Bennett  the sharpest reporter on the streets.Unfair to watch this film with wholly modern eyes as some have done  berating it for its celebration of smalltown values and perhaps depicting a naivety that is beyond the pale. Likewise though I don't think that we should embrace it unquestioningly as many do. At its heart it is a Frank Capra film and it presents us with everything that we have come to expect from a film with that description. A simple man many would say a good man is confronted and to an extent crushed by examples of modern society that fly contrary to his moral and solid existence. That's it. It doesn't really matter what the specifics happen to be here as this is all you really need to know. To some extent of course this is all a bit obvious and nave and indeed to some viewer it will be hard to get past that but in its favour it does manage to presence this homely clich with an enormous wedge of charm.This charm is evident throughout the film but one of the best examples of it is in the courtroom scene that manages to just about avoid being preachy due to the sheer cheering quality it has to it. Capra's direction and Riskin's script bring this out really well although I would question the tagline rocking America with laughter  it was amusing and warming but not hilarious by any means. I'm not entirely sold on Cooper in the lead and certainly not as enamoured as some are here. For my money he plays the aw shucks ma'am stuff just a bit too heavily forgetting to give me a character to go along with it. Jean Arthur is better as she has more to play with while Bancroft is fun in a bit of a clich but a fun one. The rest of the cast do what you would expect whether they be simple men inspired crooked men confronted or serving men treated with respect  all good but nothing earth shattering.Overall then this is an obvious film that does just what you expect it to and watching it purely with modern eyes will kill it for many viewers. It is best watched with a mind to the period even if not total forgiveness  because it is not without flaws. The charm and the warming effect it has makes it though and while not the Capra I would point the newcomer to it is certainly an example of what we mean when we now say something is Capraesquire which is quite something  to have your name used as a descriptive word so many years later!.".

A nice man from a little town inherits a large fortune that he doesn't particularly want. He doesn't blink an eye when they tell him how much money he now has. He sits and plays his tuba a bit. The city people don't think he understands. But he does it just doesn't affect him. His new acquaintances take a while to get used to his personality and its hilarious seeing their reactions at his unexpected behaviour.Mr. Deeds Goes to Town is full of hilarious moments. Several adults have fun creating echoes in a mansion. Deeds looks around to make sure nobody is watching before he rides down a stair railing. He plays the tuba at his own farewell party even as he gets on a train and then later worries about where they'll find a replacement tuba player. He points out the personal ticks of multiple people who then struggle to keep still without involuntary movement arising again. A very touching moment is followed by some perfectly executed slapstick comedy that comes out of nowhere.I find the most annoying kind of people are those that overact to everything going through extreme emotions constantly. Panicking complaining gossiping getting overexcited. Mr. Deeds is the opposite  always calm and collected and very direct with what he says. But he is passionate about justice as well and throws a punch several times in the movie. He enjoys a simple life but is not stupid in the way people expect him to be. He sees through people and calls them out on their hypocrisy. He can tell when he is being manipulated.I really liked Gary Cooper in the title role. He makes the character seem innocent and charming. Jean Arthur has a funny highpitched voice but she's likable as the conflicted love interest. She is also like a child spending free time trying to shake a rope into a knot. Frank Capra's direction is effective keeping the focus on the main characters and their emotions.Mr. Deeds is a funny movie with a powerful message. It's full of nice details. There is even some darkness and tension. His purity and simple refusal to lie or do things for personal benefit shames others into becoming better versions of themselves. His life was rich before he inherited the money and he enriches the city with his outlook on life and incorruptibility.".

He is urged to move to New York into his late uncle's mansion so that he can settle the estate and tie up all the loose ends.His inheritance becomes huge news and the hot shot reporter Babe Bennett played with gusto by Jean Arthur is soon hot on the trail of her target and nicknames him Cinderella Man.Naturally they fall in love naturally he finds out how she has been deceiving him all the time by pretending she is someone else.But in the meantime he is impressed by the plight of the ordinary farmers in the massive Depression that has hit the U.S.A. and starts to set up help for them.He is soon deemed insane and a court hearing is heard where all the plot threads are then tied up and very neatly too.What delights and surprises me on the many viewings I've had of this movie over the years is that it is not the simple cornfed awshucks type of Capra movie that some make it out to be. I find there is a darker side the sudden erupting cruel rages of the hero Longfellow the stubbornness in court the quite awful poetry and the fact that he is obviously no one's fool. I am truly pixillated by him.9 out of 10. A must see.".

Cynics and moneyloving sharks may pounce on him but Deeds stands tall and strong even with friends like the law firm's gravelvoiced P.R. man Cornelius Corny Cobb Lionel Stander who later played Max the car driver of the romantic detective TV series Hart To Hart and babyfaced lead butler Walter Raymond Walburn and later Bennett herself during the film's climax. The cast is fun look out for Western character actor George Gabby Hayes as a luckless farmer the story echoes Shakespeare while being socially conscious Deeds helps out the victims of the Great Depression in a way that irks the firm and Capra and Riskin had a good time orchestrating it.Stay far away from the Adam Sandler remake.

Gary Cooper is excellent as the shy humble guy in question. While he's definitely not painted as an angel he has the tendency to hit people a lot but always with just cause  he nevertheless manages to wonderfully convey the character's innocence in terms of his exposure to true human nature. Of course while the plot might seem like it would be a downer this is still a Frank Capra film we're talking about. Capra manages to balance the comedy and drama so well I'm speechless..Really a charming movie.".

Gary Cooper does well in a somewhat atypical role for him Jean Arthur does well in the kind of role that she often played very well and Frank Capra applies his usual touch to hold it all together.The story has a light but interesting premise with Cooper as the naive Mr. Deeds who is confronted with the consequences of sudden wealth. He and Arthur work surprisingly well in their scenes together and they make both the premise and their relationship tangleups believable.It's probably not as easy as it looks to make this kind of material work as the rather illconceived 2002 remake demonstrated. The remake actually started better than expected and for quite a while Adam Sandler was surprisingly bearable in the lead role. But eventually it lost its balance inserting too much extraneous material that either did not work or that did not fit in with the tone and themes of the rest of the movie.Capra on the other hand keeps a good balance between the light gentle tone and the sometimes farfetched plot developments. He winds it up in good fashion with a funny courtroom scene that also provides a couple of good if uncomplicated observations on human nature.Capra and the stars all made other movies that worked even better than this one does but Mr. Deeds Goes to Town itself still remains one of the better movies of its kind.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK that was a minor complaint but an excellent comeon.I did not realize until after I saw this film how many movies similar to this that Frank Capra directed You Can't Take It With You Mr Deeds Goes to Town Meet John Doe Mr Smith Goes to Washington It's a Wonderful Life... pure formula. Some are better than others. It's difficult not to get sentimental over It's a Wonderful Life for me largely because of the romance between Stewart and Donna Reed. The quirkiness of the characters in You Can't Take it With You are much more endearing than the others. The common thread of the Everyman taking on the Powers That Be is a draw for just about anyone. Nevertheless I think this particular movie does not deserve it's lofty ranking compared to Capra's other works. It Happened One Night is a far superior story eschewing all the hypersentimentalization of many Depressionera films. Mr Deeds goes out of it's way to romanticize smalltown virtues and quirkiness to ridiculous extremes. This and the squeakyclean script which people forget was enforced by selfappointed moral police is why many people look to films like this as a standard of entertainment. However many parts of the film are utterly flawed. The courtroom scene is a ridiculous mess with witnesses and spectators jumping up to make frenzied speeches that would never have been permitted in a real court. The protagonist Cooper who spends most the film outwitting opponents breaks down and punches his opponent at a trial to establish his own mental competence  and gets away with it! Pure fantasy. I'm sure it played well with people who felt trodden upon by big business in the Great Depression and I would have been sympathetic but this doesn't excuse the ludicrous story. Lionel Standler has the best role as Deeds' 'handler' Cornelius Cobb displaying a nice combination of empathy and protectiveness and comes off as the only sympathetic if hardboiled character in the film. Jean Arthur does well as the reporter who traps Deeds and ultimately regrets the sleazy act but the role falls apart in hysterics during the competency hearing. Cooper somehow comes off as both a sharpie and an overtrusting naif which is quite a stretch. It's hard to tell whether his performance is authentic or wooden. Unfortunately this is one of those films that had fine sentiments but cemented the myth of what the real America was supposed to be.".

It's been said Cooper's face was the map of America so why in under God did they cast Adam Sandler in a remake of Mr Deeds Goes to Town?Mandrake Falls is a town full of oddballs and the naive but not a total dunce Longfellow Deeds comes off as a weirdo to the city dwellers who are fascinated by his behaviour and start mocking him. Mr Deeds Goes to Town certainly highlights the divide between city slickers and smalltown folk this is particularly evident in the scene in which Deeds himself a poet meets a group of distinguished poets in the restaurant and is appalled by their snobbery and elitism to the point that he beats them up. Likewise the film also features Charles Lane as a lawyer the inspiration for The Simpsons' blue haired lawyer.In an example of the darker side of Capra's films Mr Deeds Goes to Town is a cynical look at society and the media as a whole Why do people seem to get pleasure out of hurting each other why don't they try helping each other once in a while?. Multiple people are out to snag Deed's fortune while the media is out constantly pursuing him due to his odd but ultimately harmless behaviour the media manipulating how a person is seen by the public. Mr Deeds is a man who became famous for inheriting a fortune in other words he's famous for being famous and the newspapers appear to have nothing better to do than report on his escapades such as feeding donuts to a horse relevant to today's celebrity culture.With the scene in the park in which Babe plays a set of improvised drums and Deeds sings humoresque. Capra didn't want to include it as he thought it was too sappy but Jean Arthur insisted it remain. Capra of all people thought it was too sappy?! But ah Capra sentiment it never fails to move me.The sanity hearing at the end of the film is pure movie fantasy I doubt in real life someone could be classified insane on such socalled evidence. In a demonstration of Cooper's ability as one of the best actors when it comes to giving a rousing speech or monologue he talks about the silly quirks we all have. Although the likes of o filling or knuckle cracking seems rather trivial I'm always left with the impression that the movie is making a statement on society's treatment of those who don't fully fit in or adhere to conformity and asks the question who is truly normal?".

It takes place before the series and thus runs no risk of contradicting anything.  Although the translations of Japanese animation into English is usually poor I found the character of Goku to be as always the perfect combination of super hero and down to earth dad. Gohan's hidden power which even Goku is unaware of at this time is amazing and he is definitely his father's son in the way that it comes out when his friends and loved ones are suffering.  A must see for DBZ fans.".

Of course like the rest of the series Dead Zone is light on substance and heavy on fight sequences but that's what makes the show fun to watch anyway.  910".

Also being so mentally connected he would never make the mistake of thinking Piccolo was dead when by all means he wasn't.

As for original characters I didn't find anything interesting except that Nicky and Ginger pulled swords from their limbs! They were all stupid and with very annoying voices. Give the bad guys voices that suit for once! Also why would three strong warriors Sancho Nicky and Gingerfollow the leadership of Garlic Jr he wasn't smart strong or even witty! It just seemed to me that the characters in this film all characters were running around like headless chickens.

The story's simple the action's good all the Funimation voice actors I know and love are here even Troy Baker of all people. Please tell me Troy Baker is in more of these movies I love him so much. The plot isn't super complex it's short and sweet but it still has that heart and soul that makes Dragon Ball as a whole wonderful. There are also some pretty funny moments in it as well it has a little bit of everything in it. Garlic Jr.'s a cool reimagining of Emperor Pilaf only more of a threat.

It's weird how this is actually shorter than some of the specials! I still consider it a feature length movie. If so it might be the shortest one I've ever seen. It makes no sense with the show even though it should with the filler of the Garlic Jr. saga. There's no reason why Krillin would be surprised Goku has a son in the first episode or why everyone is surprised when Gohan unleashes his power on Radditz as those things happened here.With all that being said I still enjoyed it but wouldn't quite recommend it. The scenes where Gohan gets drunk is some of the funniest stuff the series has ever done! I love the idea of taking Emperor Pilaf's voice and giving it to a serious villain. I don't know if I ever realized that Ox King is Gohan's grandfather before. There's so many characters it's hard to keep up with how they're related! The animation is good too. ".

The main antagonist in this film from over 25 years ago is Garlic Jr. the son of another antagonist that got killed by Goku before this film in the series I assume. I am not familiar with the series so I cannot comment any further in detail about that reference but I can say that I was fairly underwhelmed by this movie here. Then again I may be a bit biased because anime was never a preferred choice of mine and I actually prefer very old cartoons or animation Pixar style. So yeah with that in mind Dead Zone didn't do too much for me really. It's still not an entirely bad film by any means but I felt the story was just stretched for way too long given that they already fight the antagonist halfway into the movie and it's pretty generic too. As always it looks like they have no chance and then in the end they manage to win anyway. Oh yeah the mission here is to get Goku's son back who was abducted by the vengeful other son I mentioned earlier. To make this somewhat funny they included scenes of where Goku's son is a nuisance to his kidnapper. Still it wasn't exactly comedy gold I have to say. All in all I cannot recommend this.".

The ending of this fight also doesn't fit very well with the show's timline the example I can think of off the top of my head being the fact that Gohan's burst of power that pushes Garlic Jr. into the Dead Zone is never mentioned during the Vegeta Saga of the show where none of the shows characters appear to know how strong Gohan really is.The film does have some good points though the main one being that it is entertaining enough to watch for 40 minutes or so without getting bored.".

Garlic Jr. uses the Dragon Balls to wish for immortality. Soon enough Kami God descends to Earth and reveals to Goku that Garlic Jr.'s father was a bitter rival competing for the Kami throne whom was sealed up by the preceding Kami after Garlic Sr. and his army of demons attempted to take the throne by force. Kami also reveals that Garlic Jr.'s plans are to seek revenge for his father's exile. Goku Kami and Krillin team up with Goku's old enemy Piccolo to stop Garlic Jr. from sucking the Earth into his own personallycreated black hole known as the Dead Zone. This movie mirroring the actionfighting tone of the Dragon Ball Z TV series is more serious that the trilogy of Dragon Ball movies which focused on lighthearted comedy. The high points of the movie are the animation and the movie's hilarious inserted musical sequence Tenka Ichi Gohan. The low points of the movie is that it drags a little from time to time despite the short 45 minute length of this movie.GRADE 2.5 out of 5".

So let's get deeper into the review.This is my own opinion i respect yours. First off I grew up with this crap in my childhood and yes i loved it. Going back and watching most of it now I dislike half of it. I only love this. I do not mind the Sayin and Namik sagas as they are fun to watch and they have goo plot lines. The other DBZ films are medicorish and that's where i love this one most because the story was new the characters were new and everything. When we got the AndroidCell and Buu Sagas and even DBGT it felt like a replay where everything was just been played like a broken record all over again. I also loved the Garli Jr. Saga.Now back to the film....I think the characters are very original and they are developed quickly. The story doesn't waste time into presenting into what it want to presents and show and the action mentioned above is freakin awesome. I also love Garlic Jr. Great character. The visual effects for a 1989 animation was good. If you love combat films this definitely one for the books in my collection. I own the original version in English and I got an Italian version when I was little P.As far as DBZ stuff goes episodes and films avoid most of it but this should have Ur attention straight away D.8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "To start off This is the one and only film that kept me quiet for a whole 5 mins after seeing it. I literally couldn't close my mouth and yet there wasn't any sound coming out of it. Oldboy had such an impact on me that words are too little to describe that impact. Therefore this film is definitely in my top 3 films ever made. It belongs there because it has a massive ingredient that a lot of films seem to miss out on a divine plot. Even though the acting and screenplay are world class the plot is really the cherry on the cake.When it comes to screenplay Park ChanWook is unique at least for western standards in his way of filming. The colours are so vivid and it seems like he wanted every shot to be a piece of art. One tip If you like the shooting in 'Oldboy' have a look at 'Sympathy for Lady Vengeance' the third part in Park's revengetrilogy. It's even superior to the camerawork in 'Oldboy'. Don't however expect a story like Oldboy's because you would be very disappointed.When it comes to acting and the music this film is also one of the better films ever made. The music sticks in your head and every time I put in my OldboyDVD and the themesong comes up I'm just flooded with good memories even though the plot doesn't have a single reason to be happy about. The characters are also presented very well by the outstanding cast. Especially Choi MinSik and Yu JiTae set a very convincing performance. I really appreciate this film being respected as it should be by having a place in the top 250. If however it was up to me it would be even higher in the ranking. I don't see why films like 'The Usual Suspects' or 'Memento' which are fantastic pieces of filmmaking and which without a doubt deserve a place in the top 250 are higher in the top 250 than 'Oldboy'. They serve the same cause a fantastic plot. But those plots can't stand in the shadow or even come close to the plot of 'Oldboy'. The one and only reason is that those two films are better known and from a western production company. If we were all living in Asia no doubt 'Oldboy' would be in the top 20 of all time. My advice to people who haven't watched this film yet Go see it! This is definitely a must see. If you have a weak stomach pull yourself together and still watch it. Don't be as shallow as a lot of people here tend to be. Look beyond the violence and see the things I mentioned before world class acting cinematography music and last but certainly not least the plot. Once you've opened yourself up you'll find a whole new world of cinema. Enjoy!".

They serve the same cause a fantastic plot. But those plots can't stand in the shadow or even come close to the plot of 'Oldboy'. The one and only reason is that those two films are better known and from a western production company. If we were all living in Asia no doubt 'Oldboy' would be in the top 20 of all time. My advice to people who haven't watched this film yet Go see it! This is definitely a must see. If you have a weak stomach pull yourself together and still watch it. Don't be as shallow as a lot of people here tend to be. Look beyond the violence and see the things I mentioned before world class acting cinematography music and last but certainly not least the plot. Once you've opened yourself up you'll find a whole new world of cinema. Enjoy!";

The story is gripping the characters believable and well rounded the emotion human and the feeling I was left with at the end of the film is one of awe. And that was after I had watched it twice.

I don't buy comments when people say it is so unrealistic because he should've done this ... because it is a surrealist film and meant to be unrealistic!

	schema:reviewBody "Hi! I am a South Korean national student here in London and would like to give you some clues why the main character Oh DaeSoo was kept in the private prison for exactly 15 years and why he ate the live octopus as I hope you all understand this film a little better.Firstly his wife was killed one year after his being kept in the privately run prison. Obviously Oh DaeSoo didn't kill her but was suspected of murdering her. It must be done by Lee YuJin who planned to have his sister's revenge upon Oh DaeSoo. In South Korea criminals of unsolved crimes including murder cases are forgivenoverlooked by law 15 years after the crimes were committed which means a murder suspect wouldn't be charged or get punished unless the suspect is caught within 15 years after the murder. This is why Oh DaeSoo was released 15 years after his wife was killed. Thus he wouldn't be disturbed by the police investigation and Lee YuJin could play with him at his own discretion.Secondly nobody in the country eats live octopus like the way he ate in the film. It seems to me that the scene shows his uncontrollable anger against the man who he talked with on the phone and didn't say anything about the reasons why he was kept in the prison. If there was a piece of cake or a bowl of rice in front of him I guess he would probably eat it in the same way he did with the octopus. So please don't get it wrong that eating something alive is part of Korean culture. It should be understood itself in that extreme context.I saw this film several times with my friends. I didn't quite understand it in the first view but came to like it in the second time and it's one of my favourites now. I like the complicated plot and the shocking ending. As I'm studying translation of English and Korean most of my classmates and friends are English who spent some time in South Korean and they liked this one the most among other Korean films.I hope my talk helps.".

The first time I saw it I wasn't blown away just kind of like whatever.When I watched it for the second time however I really started to notice how well it's made in addition to liking it more. Every shot is bursting with background detail a great amount of attention on the production design the theme of a certain color in a scene was restrained yet perfectly balanced. The actors really gave it all especially the 2 male leads who really blew me away. The music is a varied mix of beautiful classical music and some pretty cool techno. The screenplay is brilliant the characters are developed very well extremely complex and the plot is not only ingenious but the payoff and twists are 1000x better than any Shamaylan movie.Simply put from a technical point of view it's one of the best movies ever. From a critic's point of view it is a very welldone movie that goes a little overboard in sex and violence and is just a little strange.".

	schema:reviewBody "I looked at program for today and I saw movie Oldboy. I read plot and I liked it. What I expected is decent thriller from very good South Korean cinematographysomething like Salinui chueok . But once again I was wrong. Oldboy is masterpiece so unusual from all other movies. I've seen lots of violence on screen and to me this isn't nothing new but I think that people under 18 really shouldn't watch this one. It's because movie is brutal and I don't think that younger ones would fully understand this one.To say something about plot is quite impossible because I don't know where to begin. If I start talking about the movie I could tell few important things and I know that people often read other comments because they didn't watch that movie. SoI'm going to say only what I read before watching this movie.On his daughter's birthday Oh Daesu gets drunk and soon he's arrested by the police. His best friend No Joohwan somehow manages to get him out of jail and when No Joohwan is making a phone call Oh Daesu disappears. Someone kidnap's him and puts him into room during 15 long years.But one day he's released.That's the plot. Very interesting you should watch this movie and then judge it. By the rating on IMDb this movie is in top 250 movies. Now I can understand why. This plot that I wrote doesn't reveal the greatness of the people who wrote the script. I bow to them because this movie is so good with all those twists and it really represents a whole new wave of making a movie of writing a script and of acting in it. About direction and actors I can say only good things. Director Park Chanwook won prize Grand Jury at Cannes. That's enough about direction part. About actors. I can say that I'm impressed by one actorChoi Minsik. He's amazing in major role and he showed great potential. I hope I will see him again in some good movie.I cannot say anything more because I could reveal some secret and I don't wanna do that to all new viewers. Only a recommendation. Beautiful intelligent masterpiece of movie that I highly recommend for everyone with strong stomach and too all of you who want to see one excellent but sick story. 1010".

	schema:headline " Amazing Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Yes this is a twisted movie with plots that unravel slowly and sometimes there are scenes that are slow. But over all it's incredible. Some of the symbolism behind the scenes are stunning. You have to go deep to appreciate it. There is a lot of gore and violence that can turn you off but I was simply amazed by the depth and width of some of the scenes.Without giving anything away once the main character is released he meets a man with a dog. It's seems to be an irrelevant scene but put yourself in a cage for 15 years and think about how you would act? What happens to that man? Isn't he also in a cage? Aren't we all? What is the symbolism of that man? How about the dog? Revenge to the main character in this movie is his life. Why? And you don't question it because you know what happened to him.

Some of the symbolism behind the scenes are stunning. You have to go deep to appreciate it. There is a lot of gore and violence that can turn you off but I was simply amazed by the depth and width of some of the scenes.Without giving anything away once the main character is released he meets a man with a dog. It's seems to be an irrelevant scene but put yourself in a cage for 15 years and think about how you would act? What happens to that man? Isn't he also in a cage? Aren't we all? What is the symbolism of that man? How about the dog? Revenge to the main character in this movie is his life. Why? And you don't question it because you know what happened to him.

Especially interesting is Korea's emerging movie industry. Japan has a long tradition of quality horror and anime and China dominates the epics with statesponsored spectacles. Which place Korea will take we don't know but if Oldboy is any inclination it would be intelligent disturbing dramaaction movies.Oldboy has an extremely intelligent and edgy script which will make you think and question your morals. It would NEVER be picked up in Hollywood. Even the initial concept of being locked up for 15 years without apparent reason would be deemed to strange for the audience. Thankfully the Korean producers could see the brilliance of the script and give it a shot. It's budget is some 4 million which is amazingly well used.Oldboy is very much the child of it's director ChanWook Park who's name should warrant a lot more fame than it does. The camerawork and pacing is amazing. There are virtually no dull moments. The fighting scenes are used to compliment to movie not to give a reward after half an hour's boredom.The lead actors are no less amazing. MinSik Choi is a perfect antihero. Unlike the Western antiheroes he even has the looks of an everyman which makes his transformation so much more spectacular. The lead actress is a bit understates in my opinion but memorable never the less. The best one is by far JiTae Ju the charismatic villain. He dominates every scene he's in a sort of Korean Christian Bale American Psycho.Music and choreography is great as well. All the details and the grit makes the movie really come alive. At the end you are in awe a rare feeling for a movie. The feeling stays with you for days. Occasionally you will think of the movie and shake your head unbelieving someone could actually pull it off.So do yourself a favor watch Oldboy. You will not be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Armond White of the NY Press has called it a virtuosic stupid movie. I think that's exactly right.Certainly the movie looks fantastic. I liked the surrealistic touches. I think the director has a real imaginative way of capturing the process of memory  there's an extended flashback about 34 way through which I think is as well conceived and shot as anything I've seen. The acting is standout. Hell I even liked the score.But the movie almost aggressively makes no sense.SPOILERS Leave aside for a moment the obvious plot holes large and small  although it's worth noting that there's a whole lot of them. Leave aside the contrivances too the endless special gadgets the bad guy comes up with just when he needs them the rather magical view of hypnosis DaeSu's magical new abilities the seeming omnipotence of the badguy. Let's assume all this is beside the point and that we're supposed to take the movie more or less symbolically ala FIGHT CLUB probably the closest reference.The movie doesn't make any sense thematically either. What's it really about? The virtue of keeping your mouth shut? The movie seems to suggest that the bad guy's sexual relationship with his sister is just fine the problem seems to be DaeSu's big mouth. The movie rather laboriously teaches this the sister kills herself because of the rumors which somehow the sister believes to be true ? DaeSu becomes convinced that he was in fact at fault DaeSu cuts his own tongue out DaeSu pleads that Mido never learn the truth DaeSu even ends up brainwashing himself via hypnosis to forget the truth  or keep his mind shut in a sense. I mean huh? This is a pretty juvenile kind of ethics to be blunt about it. Although DaeSu is the protagonist the movie really doesn't seem to be on his side. It also hints at a weird kind of passivity for all of the hammer swinging and octopus eating DaeSu doesn't really do all that much things are done to him and eventually he begins to internalize the abuse given to him.Is it about the futility of revenge? One would think particularly with the references to COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO. But leaving aside the notion that DaeSu's tormentor's omnipresence seems to weigh against the notion of him and Mido doing anything really but take their lumps or try to fight back the fact that DaeSu is considered by the movie to have really done something makes any critique pretty complicated. Remember in COUNT Dantes is a true innocent. His motives are as pure as revenge ever gets  that's why Dumas's ultimate critique his ultimate notion that revenge even for the Count is wrong works so well. The force is seen in isolation. Here though it seems more a case of DaeSu learning how bad he really is. He shouldn't take revenge because he really IS at fault.I guess you could argue that the movie shows revenge is futile from the bad guy's point of view. Then why are we watching DaeSu at all? Maybe the point is that everyone feels themselves righteous until they realize the true dimensions of their sin. But I don't see a lot of people facing up to facts in the movie I see a lot of denial in fact. DaeSu admits to his relatively minor sin but can't face up to his major one.After I saw this I read some interviews with the cast and crew and apparently some of this vagueness is intentional  we're supposed to be left unsure. Well the movie is successful in that but I think it's an unworthy goal an abdication of the artist's responsibility. People have bristled at the charge that this movie is nihilistic but if that really is the point that the movie's supposed to throw up it's hands and say hey I dunno you figure it out then that truly is nihilism.Ah well I could go on but I won't bore you. A virtuosic stupid movie indeed I think often amazing to watch but underneath the surface just a whole bunch of muddleheadedness.".

It's a shame so many American film goers refuse to see foreign films because this movie is genius.

	schema:reviewBody "Old Boy is my favourite film. As far as I can see no amount of superlatives could explain quite how much I love it. After my first viewing all on my lonesome I realised I probably hadn't blinked during its entirety and I could quite possibly have been burgled during its course and been none the wiser such was the extent to which I found it totally and utterly engrossing. Obviously a review consisting of very little other than me spewing praise would be a fairly dull read which was why I never bothered to review Old Boy until after my second viewing with my Po'. My father being the eternal sceptic that he is turned out to be an extremely worthy person to watch the film with and his response to it opened my eyes a little as to why I love it that much.The plot itself is as follows. The protagonist Oh DaeSu is one day captured and finds himself locked up in a makeshift prison. After a brief spell of anger and spewing hatred for his captors he resigns himself to his fate and after 15 years of shadow boxing and suicide attempts he wakes up from a gas induced coma on top of a tower block where he was initially seized. He then proceeds to try and find out who did this and why and the film basically charts this quest.The first word that springs to mind when thinking about this film has to be graphic. There are certain scenes which will make those of nervous disposition recoil until they are firmly wedged between the back and seat of their sofa and they are likely to spend much of the film there as violence is frequent. In most of the extreme cases it is simply the implication of violence and the viewer's imagination when left to its own devices like this will cause its own disgust. This hurdle was a huge thing problem for my dad who considered some of the violence to be gratuitous which I can somewhat agree with although certain scenes are completely integral to the plot. The best way I can justify these scenes is simple. It is all about sending a message and these do just that. If you can cope with this then you will break down the initial barrier the film leaves lying in the way of your enjoyment.Another barrier will be the massive culture shock experienced when viewing the film. This is a Korean language film adapted from a Japanese anim series so there are obviously large cultural differences to the western world. Some of the images used will require quite some thought to fully understand and the script on translation does lose some of its flow as any anim or graphic novel fans will associate with. For my father this made it hard for him to settle into the flow of the film and I can identify with this slightly from my early days of watching anim.Many of the themes you will pick up on and the method of direction is very synonymous with Quentin Tarantino. There are devices used in this film which have obviously taken inspiration from Tarantino's works in particular the Pulp Fiction esquire use of camera angles and the famous dotted line sequence. However Tarantino is himself a huge fan of Old Boy being its main advocate to win the 2003 Palme d'Or where it eventually lost out to Fahrenheit 911 and has stated Park ChanWook as an influence for his directing style on the Kill Bill series as well as on his later grindhouse works Death Proof and Planet Terror. ChanWook takes on a policy of trust the director and leaves many questions throughout the film which gives it a somewhat disorientating feel at times. This method of directing can seem quite inaccessible however all loose ends are tied up very satisfactorily in the enthralling and shocking climax. This is an ending to rival the classic Kaiser Soz twist in the tail of The Usual Suspects.What really separated and elevates ChanWook's work above and beyond Tarantino's however is very simple. Much of Tarantino's work is undertaken as an exercise in direction and film making and therefore his work can therefore feel shallow. Old Boy however is a film which assesses the deepest corners of the human heart. The middle of three films which make up ChanWook's Vengeance Trilogy it is undoubtedly the masterpiece with a more powerful message than Lady Vengeance and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. This film has power because of the depths to which it explores the flaws and forces the human heart possesses stronger and more destructive than any wisdom can overcome. The performances of the main cast and most importantly the director to send this message to the viewer leave this film as about as close to perfection as I can see any film getting.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first time I saw Oldboy I watched it by myself on a rainy evening. When the credits rolled at the end I think I actually stood up and clapped. It's been a long time since I've seen something so original. The film is gripping it grabs and never lets you go.It starts out with a man who is locked inside this room and doesn't know why and blah blah blah...sounds almost clich. Read the back of the DVD case for a summary. The last fifteen minutes of Oldboy are the most intense fifteen minutes I've seen in any movie. By the end you are so eager to know what happened to this poor guy and why he has been punished. And the film takes a twist that makes every hair on your arms stand up and it remains satisfying. It's not one of those twists that leaves you scratching your head. It makes sense! A film like Oldboy is humbling in that it makes you realize that America is no longer turning out the most cuttingedge stuff. But it's also nice to know that someone out there still has the guts to do a film with no barriers that makes you stand up and flip off guys like Tarantino and go 'that's what I'm talking about.' 10 out of 10 kids.".

	onyx:emotionText "The first time I saw Oldboy I watched it by myself on a rainy evening. When the credits rolled at the end I think I actually stood up and clapped. It's been a long time since I've seen something so original. The film is gripping it grabs and never lets you go.It starts out with a man who is locked inside this room and doesn't know why and blah blah blah...sounds almost clich. Read the back of the DVD case for a summary. The last fifteen minutes of Oldboy are the most intense fifteen minutes I've seen in any movie. By the end you are so eager to know what happened to this poor guy and why he has been punished. And the film takes a twist that makes every hair on your arms stand up and it remains satisfying.

He is then abruptly released and given just five days to discover the identity and reason of the man who imprisoned him. However the great concept soon disintegrates into a pathetic joke as Oh DaeSu runs around beating people up trying to have sex with a young girl who is attempting to use the toilet and eating a live writhing squid presumably for dramatic effect as there is absolutely no other reason for it. All the while he is trying to figure out this horrible thing he did to earn himself fifteen years in jail and when he finally finds out it is both ridiculous and a major letdown. His nemesis a man who supposedly went to school with him when he was a young man looks like a Banana Republic model twenty years younger than him. Hey I know prison has been hard on Oh DaeSu but is it too much to ask to find an actor that looks a bit closer to his age? Of all the things wrong with this movie this one seems like the easiest one to fix.And the big secret  the one that kept me in my seat for 90 minutes when I could have been out doing something productive  is some joke of a plot line involving incest and a rumor started in high school. Come on! Throw us a bone here  was that really the best they could do? I sat through stupid dialogue overacting gloomy sets and gratuitous violence for this? By the way  I'm not at all against violence in a film if it seems to fit the story but in this case it seems I was forced to watch our hero knock out someone's front teeth and cut off his own tongue with a pair of scissors in order to distract me from figuring out I was wasting my afternoon watching a pretentious piece of garbage.Take my advice  do something else with your time and money.

And just to let you know where I'm coming from  'Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance' was brilliant an unforgiving and touching descent into doom. In that movie everything that happened somehow had to. One action triggered the next one and we experienced a vicious circle of violence and revenge. The characters seemed trapped in their situation.In Old Boy our protagonist is also trapped but you know the story so I won't tell you again. So he's in this room and there is great sound design and camera work. But once he frees himself the complications and problems multiply. The plot is at first close to incomprehensible as he stumbles from one situation to another. When the villain explains his schemes at the end and brings enlightenment I just couldn't care anymore. The intriguing premise is destroyed by the revelation that it's all a contrived revenge plot by the bad guy.And contrived it is. The story only works by inserting endless flashbacks full of bad pathos and explanations. To keep the audience interested we get gruesome scenes of murder selfmutilation and general mayhem. As others have remarked these scenes are well done but serve no greater purpose. It's all a sowhat comic extravaganza.Out of 'Old Boy' I got small pleasures and a lot of disappointment courtesy of one of the most interesting directors working today. I liked among other things the infamous hallway scene the actors the fight with the bodyguard the revelation of the Secret and the sequence of Oh Daesu leaving his bad self behind at the end.

You don't find out the plot line in the exact order I'm laying it out but in the end this is all that has happenedBasically Incestuos Brother is having sex with his own Sister.

MC is eventually released but he has no idea why or who captured him. He meets Young Girl they fall in love and have sex. Then you find out Young Girl is Main Character's daughter. yeah I know pretty gross Incestuous Brother is all angry about his Sister killing herself because Main Character went and told the entire school about their forbidden relationship. So he's held this 20 year long grudge in which he murders MC's wife locks the guy up for over a decade then orchestrates him having sex with his own daughter?????? Seriously how can you not be completely turned off by this movie at this point? I don't care how sad and bizarre your life is or how desperately you need to latch on to oddball art cinema and music to make yourself feel unique and different than everyone else. There's really nothing enjoyable about this movie other than the cinematography. Every plot twist it just gets more disturbing and overly complicated. A good plot twist should leave the viewer going wow why didn't I think of that? not OMG what kind of sick  would even begin to think that?The acting is sub par and the characters are lame. Main Character just runs around talking about claiming revenge the entire movie. OK I think everyone can follow this line of thinking. Someone took away your family and kidnapped you for a long time yeah I'd want to go bash some skulls in too. But then every time he should actually act on that revenge he wimps out and instead of killing some fool he lets them go in some attempt to unravel this overly complicated mystery behind WHY this was done to him. Incestous Brother is just this smug cocky stereotypical evil genius the entire film. Its a role thats been done a million times over and yet fanboys of this are raving about how DEEP the characters are. Please.And don't get me started on the action or lack there of. Every fight scene is Guy misses main character with right hook MC punches him. Another guy misses MC with right hook MC punches him. Every once in a while they stray from the dodge right hook counter punch sequence with the occasional guy swings delicate piece of wood at MC which shatters against wall MC hits him with hammer. So lame.I was seriously angry I wasted a couple hours watching this and even angrier that it had such a high rating on IMDb. This movie should be ridiculed for the crap that it is.".

	schema:reviewBody "This comment is meant mainly as a warning to the people who might be attracted to the title by its temporarilyhigh user rating which I find frankly puzzling. The reasons why I didn't like this title are following1. The directer must have had some doubts whether to make a JackieChantype of a flick or a dark Oedipian tragedy. As a result in terms of genre the film falls between two stools as the tragic and comic elements clash and cancel out each other rather than make a harmonious whole.2. The characters' motives and behaviors are incoherent and unconvincing. Psychological truth and logic are sadly missing.3. Absurd casting. I don't blame the actors for it is a hard thing to create a convincing character by acting alone if there is scarce logic in the script. However why is there an apparent age difference of about 15 years between the leading two actors whose ages in the film can't differ by more than 34?4. To me the film was poor entertainment primarily because of point 2. If you can't find a character you could sympathize with it is hard to follow the story with interest. When you finally learn the reason of what happened to the main protagonist it turns out to make no sense.5. Some films apart from being entertaining are also thoughtprovoking. Having seen this film I began to wonder whether the thought the director tried to provoke was not that incestuous relationships could be perfectly wholesome and delightful. I cannot put any other construction on the ending. 6. The film is rife with totally unnecessary violence. Violence in a film and elsewhere is a good thing if it serves an important and worthy purpose. Purposes can be different and I don't want to enter into this broad subject. Let me just say I don't object to violence in such films as Saving Private Ryan The Passion of the Christ or The Pulp Fiction. In Oldboy the scenes of torture and suffering are prolonged and graphic or aural. What for? I do not know. Personally I don't derive any satisfaction from watching teeth being extracted with a hammer or hear a man cut off his tongue with scissors and then see him choking on his own blood etc. etc. 7. The film reminds me a little of Japanese porno mangas in its fixation on incest and young Asian girls' panties urinating and the like. It appears there is a minority who actually enjoy this kind of thing. If you're one of them you might find this film enjoyable.In short I do not recommend this film either as entertainment or food for thought. Where it isn't silly it is disgusting. Don't waste your time.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am sorry to rain on everybody's parade. Just a little background about me I like and know a lot about Asian cinema especially Japanese Chinese and Indian. Admittedly I am a novice when it comes to SouthKorean cinema but if this is the best of the best sorry. I just want you to know that I am not at all narrowminded when it comes to appreciating foreign movies and I do not fit the stereotype of the dumb American . . . well not perfectly.I cannot believe the high praise this piece of nothing is bestowed upon. This is a disgusting and ludicrous movie. Hammy acting  everything is badly done and overdone like begging for the uneducated viewer's attention. Horrible camerawork with an insistence on meaningless closeups derived from the MTV aesthetics.The plot is more full of holes than a gigantic piece of Swiss cheese. Nobody expects a thriller to be 100 realistic and for the sake of entertainment I'd be happy to close my eyes to small unfitting details. But excuse me what's happening here that can stand even summary scrutiny? This story of an unbelievably intricate and contrite act of revenge is worse than the worst tabloid story one can read in a line at the supermarket.

Admittedly I am a novice when it comes to SouthKorean cinema but if this is the best of the best sorry. I just want you to know that I am not at all narrowminded when it comes to appreciating foreign movies and I do not fit the stereotype of the dumb American . . . well not perfectly.I cannot believe the high praise this piece of nothing is bestowed upon. This is a disgusting and ludicrous movie. Hammy acting  everything is badly done and overdone like begging for the uneducated viewer's attention. Horrible camerawork with an insistence on meaningless closeups derived from the MTV aesthetics.The plot is more full of holes than a gigantic piece of Swiss cheese. Nobody expects a thriller to be 100 realistic and for the sake of entertainment I'd be happy to close my eyes to small unfitting details. But excuse me what's happening here that can stand even summary scrutiny? This story of an unbelievably intricate and contrite act of revenge is worse than the worst tabloid story one can read in a line at the supermarket.

	schema:reviewBody "A remote fishing village located off the coast of Canada is the setting for this tale of a closeknit community of people who make their living from the sea while abiding the customs and superstitions that have been handed down from one generation to the next for hundreds of years.  Deeply' written and directed by Sheri Elwood is a story of love and survival and of what it sometimes takes just to get on with life but more than that it's about a dark secret that has been a part of this village since before remembrance and the effects of a collective belief in something few care to contemplate and even fewer dare to speak of openly even in a contemporary modern world in which such things no longer exist and yet still do.When her teenage daughter Claire Julia Brendler cannot escape the memories of a tragic accident Fiona McKay Alberta Watson takes her to the island and the village that was her own home as a child.  Fiona hopes the change will enable Claire to put all that has happened behind her.  Claire's depression continues however and she becomes increasingly withdrawn and uncommunicative even with her mother who is desperately trying to reach out and help her.  Things begin to change however when Claire finds a manuscript on the beach that's been rejected and returned by the publisher and she delivers it to the owner a reclusive writer named Celia Lynn Redgrave a long time resident of the island who lives alone in a small house at the edge of the sea.  Initially their relationship is tentative but gradually Claire finds herself drawn to Celia who agrees to tell Claire the story contained in the manuscript and it's a story in which Claire finds a parallel to her own life and it just may prove to be the catharsis that will enable Claire to move on with her life.Writerdirector Elwood uses the storywithinastory technique nicely to present her tale which contains elements that make it something of a cross between The Secret of Roan Inish' and The Wicker Man.'  It's beautifully filmed cinematography by Sebastian Edschmid and the transitions between the present and the depiction of Celia's story are executed quite well.  The story itself though while engaging to a point is wrapped in a fairly obvious mystery which in retrospect may have been Elwood's intent as she creates the dots but leaves it up to the viewer to connect them.  It's effective in that it invites involvement on any number of levels while leaving it up to the individual to decide upon one and to what extent they want to take it.  Celia's story which involves a young girl named Silly Kirsten Dunst is interesting but the real appeal of the film is rooted in Claire's gradual awareness of her deep connection to Silly and how the story subsequently affects her.  And it's in the telling of Claire's story that Elwood's work shines the brightest as that is where she manages somewhat to connect emotionally with her audience.One of the best young actors in the business Kirsten Dunst is to be commended for taking on a role that is quite a departure for her with the exception of her portrayal of Marion Davies in the more recent The Cat's Meow' in which she was terrific.  Dunst has a charismatic screen presence and talent to match which has served her so well in films like The Virgin Suicides' and the aforementioned The Cat's Meow' and it's obvious that she put a great deal of effort into her portrayal of Silly in this film and though it's a decent job she somehow never manages to fully realize the character and though she has her moments Silly is never entirely convincing.  Part of the blame has to fall on Elwood of course who should have taken measures to correct the most obvious flaw in Dunst's performance which is the inconsistency of the accent she affects.  Part of the time her manner of speech most resembles Lux Lisbon while at other times she sounds more like Ma Kettle's daughter.  It is perhaps a minor flaw in an otherwise solid performance but it's enough to prevent Dunst from finding' the character and it is so distracting that it diminishes the effectiveness of her portrayal and in turn the credibility of the film.  And there are a couple of scenes in which Silly smokes a pipe that simply do not work at all.  Still you have to admire Dunst for wanting to expand her repertoire and explore new territory many actors who have achieved a similar level of success lack the courage to challenge themselves artistically as Dunst has done here and it's an attribute that will continue to set her apart from the dimeadozen actors who flow through the business without making so much as a dent.As Claire Julia Brendler gives a performance that is honest and affecting and as much as the story itself it's what establishes her as the focus of the film.  She conveys emotions that transcend the typical teen angst and it makes her situation real and believable.  Her portrayal of Claire is sensitive and with Elwood's help of course is developed with great care which is what makes it so effective.  The film in fact would have benefited had Claire's part been expanded perhaps with more interaction between her and Celia.  As presented however it is definitely the strength of the film.Lynn Redgrave does a good job as Celia though she isn't afforded enough screen time to fully develop her character with any nuance but it is a convincing performance.  Interestingly enough this was filmed the same year her sister Vanessa played a similar role that of a reclusive old woman living by the sea in A Rumor of Angels.'  A good film but nothing special Deeply' is worth a look just don't expect to be too emotionally engaged by it.  610.".

	schema:headline " Good tearjerker but predictable.";
	schema:reviewBody "Like all good faerietales Deeply's story is naturally predictable to avoid disappointment focus on the quality of the telling not the originality of the tale. The plot and literary devices are carbon copies of James Cameron's Titanic while the cinematography is a slightly less artistic version of The Shipping News. Other commenters provide a more detailed synopsis so I will cut straight to my somewhat unique perspective.I come from an island called the rock off the coast of Nova Scotia that once boasted the world's best fishing until the fishery dried up a few decades ago. So this tale hit home from the outset. As it so happens my Newfoundland is the same island that inspired The Shipping News the same island that received the real Titanic's distress calls and the same island that inspired another recent shipwreck movie The Perfect Storm. It is also the only island in North America proven to have been visited by Vikings. Although Deeply's island is not specifically named it is large enough to host several outports and to entice a military base or two and was once visited by Vikings who cast a myserious curse on the island. The island's leader is strikingly reminiscent of Joey Smallwood but I digress.Anyone who has lost someone close to them at a young age will love this movie no matter what as will many who fear losing someone they love. Although manly men like me don't admit to crying I will confirm that my room became extremely humid and caused steady streams of condensation to roll down me cheeks . The storytelling was so compelling that I am willing to forgive the movie's technical gaffs but as one close to the culture I would be wrong not to point out the obvious problems.Before mentioning the negatives I must say Lynn Redgrave gives a stellar performance every bit as good as Dame Judy Dench in The Shipping News. While the other main actors emote well they don't believably deliver the accents or mannerisms of their characters. The minor cast does excellent in contrast leading me to wonder if Kirsten Dunst would have fared better using her normal voice instead of butchering the marittime lilt into a goofy patchwork of Ozarkian hickese and fake Texan drawl. Her character's mother was supposedly a mainlander so another director might have considered reducing the distraction of a bad accent by allowing Dunst to speak naturally while directing Redgrave to mimic Dunst's accent blaming the difference on the mother's influence. Of course that is merely a lesson for future directors as the damage is already done.Yet in spite of Dunst's difficulty melding with the culture she gives a wonderful overall performance because the culture was not by any means the most important aspect of her character. Dunst's character Silly is a strongspirited girl turned troubled teen a lifelong outsider resulting not only from the paranoia of adolescence but also from a smalltown superstition concerning the island's Viking curse. The older Cecilia is one so haunted by her forbidden lover's tragic death that she withdraws and cannot bring herself to love again. As Redgrave's Cecilia she writes her own story in an apparent effort to help other young girls achieve catharsis but when her manuscript is rejected fate brings her the perfect audience through whom she finally elicits the solace that eluded her long years of solitude.Deeply's celtic music is modern marittime fare not specific to any culture but highly influenced by the scores of the aforementioned Titanic and The Shipping News. The scenes with folk music resort to some of my favorite old Irish standbies rather than exploring the more colorful folk music specific to Nova Scotia or Newfoundland however I naturally view this as a missed opportunity to showcase the more distinctive elements of Canadian culture there were many historical scenes that would have been vastly enriched by a few verses of I'se the B'y Feller from Fortune Revised As I Roved Out or at least a few jigs and reels instead of the more modernized Enyaesque instrumentals that although beautiful would have been more effective if used to distinguish the modern elements of the film from the historical.In sum a few technical gaffes and cultural flaws sadly distract from an otherwise beautiful retelling of a classic tragic love story foreshadowed in the ambiguously ironic name of the film's illfated sailboat Fate's Fortune. I personally prefer Deeply's plot and storyline to the movies it copies Titanic and The Shipping News because it is refreshingly innocent without losing the weight of its dark edge. I find most of the characters in Deeply more compelling than their counterparts in Titanic and The Shipping News but I wish some of the acting and technical delivery had a depth more worthy of the movie's title. Perhaps my negativity is no more than hypersensitivity I felt so in tune with the movie that I wanted it to be perfect obviously an unreasonable expectation.If you hate chick flicks and demand comedic actionadventures don't torture yourself with this one. However if you've ever loved and lost especially at a young age you will fall Deeply in love with this movie. Even without a predisposition to catharsis you will probably find it Deeply compelling in spite of its minor flaws. If this movie inspires you CFAs to visit to Nova Scotia a tip come in the summer get your ferry tickets well in advance and also plan to spend several days exploring Newfoundland. If you're an Anne of Green Gables fan you'll want to see Prince Edward Island too.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS this is a great movie i just wish there were more of it. it tells the story of two girls one from the 1940's one from 50 years later each of whom has their lover die in an accident. claire the modern one comes to the island with her mother after her boy friend died in a motorcycle accident claire was driving. she meets a cranky and bitter older woman celia who tells her the tale of silly a girl who loved the sea and fishing. silly was born the first baby of fishing season and was the baby chosen by the curse that rests on the island. every fifty years all the fish leave the island bc of a curse that two viking lovers who drowned put on it for revenge for their deaths. every one on the island starves until one of two young lovers dies leaving the one left to mourn eternal sorrow as tribute to the curse this has happened for over 500 years. silly's mother made her promise never to go near the water and the fish do leave. an admiral and his family come to the island with the idea of putting a naval base there. silly and the only son james fall in love and of course every one else wants to pull them apart. in the end they escape by boat to elope. but silly's mothers pearls get lost over the side of the boat. as soon as james jumps in the water to get them a storm blows up and he is drowned. back in the present claire reads the story and by grieving for silly and james she is able at last to grieve for herself and her own loss. i rate this film 7 of 10 starsif you want a happy ending don't watch if you want to cry this is a good movie ditto if you want lovely nova scotia scenery or like kirsten dunstfinal words each of the story lines would have supported their own seperate movie and its a desperate shame that they were not seperate movies.as is though it is mostly good and made me cry which i hardly ever do. it left me wanting more of the story which i don't think will be likely to happen so i say go watch Michael Collins after this movie. there's one that will satisfy.".

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS this is a great movie i just wish there were more of it. it tells the story of two girls one from the 1940's one from 50 years later each of whom has their lover die in an accident. claire the modern one comes to the island with her mother after her boy friend died in a motorcycle accident claire was driving. she meets a cranky and bitter older woman celia who tells her the tale of silly a girl who loved the sea and fishing. silly was born the first baby of fishing season and was the baby chosen by the curse that rests on the island. every fifty years all the fish leave the island bc of a curse that two viking lovers who drowned put on it for revenge for their deaths. every one on the island starves until one of two young lovers dies leaving the one left to mourn eternal sorrow as tribute to the curse this has happened for over 500 years. silly's mother made her promise never to go near the water and the fish do leave. an admiral and his family come to the island with the idea of putting a naval base there. silly and the only son james fall in love and of course every one else wants to pull them apart. in the end they escape by boat to elope. but silly's mothers pearls get lost over the side of the boat. as soon as james jumps in the water to get them a storm blows up and he is drowned. back in the present claire reads the story and by grieving for silly and james she is able at last to grieve for herself and her own loss. i rate this film 7 of 10 starsif you want a happy ending don't watch if you want to cry this is a good movie ditto if you want lovely nova scotia scenery or like kirsten dunstfinal words each of the story lines would have supported their own seperate movie and its a desperate shame that they were not seperate movies.as is though it is mostly good and made me cry which i hardly ever do. it left me wanting more of the story which i don't think will be likely to happen so i say go watch Michael Collins after this movie. there's one that will satisfy.";

I think Kirsetn Dunst does a pretty awesome job in this film. The only thing that really bothered me was her accent. Trent Ford is adorable and is spectacular. I really would recommend this movie to anyone. I don't think it is just a chick flick.

The kind of film that relies on story and character instead of bang and zoom demands a level of depth and insight that was not fully realized here.

The script is so predictable that my friend and I were literally able to guess the next lines in some scenes and sometimes the dialogue is very movieoftheweek. However there are some standout performances among the cast.Lynn Redgrave plays Celia an eccentric old writer hashing out a manuscript on a manual typewriter in her home on a barren island.  Think Old Rose in Titanic  She meets Clare Julia Brendler a teenage girl who has recently lost her boyfriend in an accident and has been brought to the island by her mother Fiona Alberta Watson who just inherited a house there.  Clare is very angry at life and her mother is at her wit's end about how to help her. She meets Celia and out of boredom and a desire to stay far away from her mother's attempts to get her to talk starts going to her house to listen to her tell the story she is writing up  a tale of a young girl who also lost her love in an accident many years earlier.  As she narrates we have flashback sequences of Celia's story with Kirsten Dunst and Trent Ford playing the lovers in that tale.  The end result is that Clare is able to put aside her anger and deal with her grief.Brendler an unknown in North America gives a solid performance as the furiousatfate daughter and she works well with alwaysstellar actresses Redgrave and Watson. Dunst is cute but her character isn't believable making too many abrupt transitions from tomboyish prankster to fishing industry advocate to romantic heroine without any real explanation of just what motivates her for instance why does she care if it's fishing that supports the islanders or some other business?  Because she was born on a fish gutting table? This is never explained well. Trent Ford is nice eye candy but needed more experience to pull off his role.Our biggest gripe was the editing.  This movie flashes back and forth from past to present more times than you can count often so quickly it's like a bad MTV music video.  Please stop this person before they edit again.Overall a decent movie but nothing you haven't seen before. Worth watching for the performances of Brendler Redgrave and Watson.  We both think Brendler is going places and are interested to see what she chooses next.".

Her mother Fiona has split up with Claire's father Max who is not seen though there is a phone conversation when the phone actually works. They are staying with Uncle Pete and Claire hates being cut off from the world. In flashbacks she is shown playing the violin with an orchestra of some sort and she seems to like one of the boys in the orchestra. She brings the violin with her and does play once. A reference is made to the family living in Berlin and the closing credits do refer to Berlin Germany but no one in this movie has an accent that would suggest they are German. I thought maybe these people were Scottish or Irish.One day while swimming in the ocean Claire sees a package. It turns out to be a manuscript of a story by Celia a cranky old woman. At first Celia seems to want nothing to do with anyone else but when Claire expresses an interest in the story and this makes Celia happy. As Celia tells the story we see it happen. Claire seems to cheer up whenever she visits Celia but otherwise she remains quite bitter.A baby is born to Rose the first baby of the fishing season in a village that is one of the best places anywhere for fishermen. The people wonder if this baby will be the one as if she is something evil. The baby is baptized and yet still people behave as if she is evil.Silly the little girl helps the fishermen out. She appears to be a hard worker. And shortly before she turns 16 she is pretty but quite a tomboy and certainly roughnatured. This must have been a family movie because surely such a girl in real life would have used language nice girls shouldn't hear but Silly is almost Grated. Almost.And then it happens. Every 50 years since the Vikings arrived nearly a thousand years earlier probably not counting the years after the Vikings gave up on this place there has been some sort of tragic death and the fish have disappeared. It is called the curse. The people are ready to give up but Silly believes the fish will come back.After she steals the doctor's boat and wrecks it Silly must go to work for the doctor who also rents out rooms to pay him back. He is a stern and demanding taskmaster yet Silly continues with her attitude. Then comes the day a large ship docks in the community. Admiral Griggs wants to build a military base which would require changes that would put an end to fishing even if the fish would have come back. Based on the date on a tombstone all of this is taking place shortly after World War II. The admiral his spoiled wife and their handsome son James stay with the doctor and Silly must tend to their every need. Actually James stays in a tent on the beach but Silly doesn't mind taking care of him if you know what I mean.There are parallels to the present day. On the radio it is announced that once again fishing has ended in this town and developers want to take over and make the community prosperous again.And Claire and Silly are both teens who are rebellious and misunderstood who have had difficulties in their love life.Kirsten Dunst is the real reason to watch this movie. She does such a wonderful job and of course her looks add something even if her appearance isn't consistent with her character's background. I wouldn't have even known Lynn Regrave but I guess she is getting up in years. She too gives a very good performance. And Brent Carver is quite good as Silly's frustrated father. I will say everyone with a leading role does a good job.I liked the traditional music at a dance.Overall I found this movie depressing. I was glad there were some pleasant scenes and even some humor but this movie is probably intended for women or girls who enjoy a good cry. That isn't me. I was particularly distressed with the progress of Claire's character. But if you are someone who keeps a supply of Kleenex for your favorite movies and you enjoy stories about life on the coast where civilization hasn't quite caught up this is a good choice.".

Of course it is predictable but what movie nowadays isn't? And even though we call it clich the clichs work because they're good clichs. Lovers running off together...dying as an ultimate sacrifice...an island curse... It's been done before yada yada...so? It's still fun.The music haunting and very effective. I personally loved the actress who portrayed Claire and I get rather annoyed when I see people harping on her German accent...especially when it states clearly IN the movie that Claire is FROM Berlin. Berlin is in Germany. Airgo She is supposed to have a German accent. I was also impressed by the actress who played Celia. Very very nice and she gave a few laughs. I was not impressed with Kirsten Dunst. I don't believe that she gave enough in this role and her accent was appalling and horrid to say the least. I can say nothing but Bad Acting. They could have gotten a different actress not based on name and fame and I'm sure the movie would have been better. Kirsten Dunst is a decent actress but she disappointed me in this movie.I'm surprised that I haven't seen the boy who plays James around. He looks like a young Josh Hartnett and was very believable in his role as the carefree James. He really stole my heart. I want one. All in all I would say that this movie is good depending on tastes. I am a romantic at heart and a fan of tragic romances...so I do like this movie. I don't watch it on a normal basis and some parts of the movie I would change...but it is not half bad. The music and the lovely climax scene are the highlights of the movie...as well as what carries it entirely.Can I not stress enough how the CHARACTER was from Berlin and so her German accent FIT her ROLE?

	schema:headline " For David Hamilton fans only";
	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes my quest to see every notorious European sex film from the 70's leads me very far afieldand sometimes it just leads to a lot of boredom. I saw this film backtoback with Catherine Breillat's directorial debut Un Vrai Jeune Fille Breillat was cowriter of this film as well. Both are very pretentious but while Jeune Fille is genuinely disturbing yet also realistic in a strange way this film is simply dull and rarely rises above the most generic level of male fantasy. The director David Hamilton depending on who you ask is either a brilliant photographer or an incorrigible pervert. His main subject of interest was capturing adolescent and postadolescent females at their most nubile. He's definitely in hog heaven at the beginning of this film which is set at a French girls' school the protagonist is attending. This apparently is a VERY liberal school where the students freely skinnydip openly engage in lesbian frolics and even put on Greek plays for their families wearing nearly diaphanous togas that barely cover their lissome bodies. Naturally ALL these girls are model beautiful. It's probably best not to wonder how old some of them were at the time but the lead American actress Patty D'Arbanville was actually in her mid20's although she looks younger.As questionable as the first half hour may be though it certainly achieves it effect it's surpassed only by the Barthory section of Walerian Borowzyx's Immoral Tales in its sheer gratuitous display of nubile skin. It's really the second hour that's the problem. D'Arbanville's character Bilitis goes to stay with her ridiculously young female guardian Mona Christensen and the latter's unfaithful brutish husband. Bilitis falls in love with the slightlyolder woman and they have a long lesbian sex scene. The guardian spurns her afterwards but Bilitis taking it like a trooper decides to try to personally find a man for her after her husband walks out.

No heterosexual male can honestly say he is turned off by bountiful breasts OR nubile 18yearold bodies but if you don't happen to share either of these director's obsessive personal fetishes their work gets kind of tedious after awhile. This movie would have been vastly improved  for instance if the guardian had been played by a voluptuous older woman instead of another young nymph like Christensen. It's not that I really advocate intergenerational lesbian sex but if you're gonna do it do it right. I'd definitely recommend this for David Hamilton fans but otherwise ehhhhh.".

	onyx:emotionText "Sometimes my quest to see every notorious European sex film from the 70's leads me very far afieldand sometimes it just leads to a lot of boredom. I saw this film backtoback with Catherine Breillat's directorial debut Un Vrai Jeune Fille Breillat was cowriter of this film as well. Both are very pretentious but while Jeune Fille is genuinely disturbing yet also realistic in a strange way this film is simply dull and rarely rises above the most generic level of male fantasy. The director David Hamilton depending on who you ask is either a brilliant photographer or an incorrigible pervert. His main subject of interest was capturing adolescent and postadolescent females at their most nubile. He's definitely in hog heaven at the beginning of this film which is set at a French girls' school the protagonist is attending. This apparently is a VERY liberal school where the students freely skinnydip openly engage in lesbian frolics and even put on Greek plays for their families wearing nearly diaphanous togas that barely cover their lissome bodies. Naturally ALL these girls are model beautiful. It's probably best not to wonder how old some of them were at the time but the lead American actress Patty D'Arbanville was actually in her mid20's although she looks younger.As questionable as the first half hour may be though it certainly achieves it effect it's surpassed only by the Barthory section of Walerian Borowzyx's Immoral Tales in its sheer gratuitous display of nubile skin. It's really the second hour that's the problem. D'Arbanville's character Bilitis goes to stay with her ridiculously young female guardian Mona Christensen and the latter's unfaithful brutish husband. Bilitis falls in love with the slightlyolder woman and they have a long lesbian sex scene. The guardian spurns her afterwards but Bilitis taking it like a trooper decides to try to personally find a man for her after her husband walks out. Bilitis also has a wouldbe beau herself a young photographer just like the director hmmm. Respected actor Mathieu Carriere also shows up as one wouldbe suitor for the older woman but I THINK he's supposed to be gay.

I guess we just weren't ready for a deep and meaningful movie that required an element of sophistication that we just didn't possess at the time. I'm not so sure I possess it now and I have long since parted company with that particular girlfriend pity really... my first love. We left the cinema half way through the film my friend who should have known better stayed for the whole thing. I still got the required result with my girlfriend the film just didn't help much.

But basically it's about seeing Katja Bienert nude and it works when it comes down to that. Just realize she was about 15 or 16 when this film was made and she was really not very shy. Anyway go get this one if you're able to find it but be prepared to feel the urge to throw it in the garbage can once you've seen it. P.S. This film has been reissued in 1999 by the german label XRATED CULT MOVIES but with a different title MONDO CANNIBALE 4. Obviously for marketingreasons. Cause you'd better not expect to watch one of the infamous EuroCannibalflics when you put this in. Franco has done better than this. Katja Bienert has too. But the jungle has never looked more corny. So ... you get the idea. I like it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jesus Franco made many bad films and some of the worst were the ones he did with the ultracheapskate French outfit Eurocine. This is probably the best of the a bad lot but it IS a chance to see Franco regular Katja Beinert in a role that might actually be legal by US standards some of his earlier films with her probably pushed even the much more liberal Continental European ageofconsent laws to the limit. I doubt this movie will appeal too much to the barely legal crowd though as Bienert seems to have sprung from the womb with a body that would put any 25yearold woman to shame and all she really does is wander around in nothing but a ridiculously lowriding loincloth for most of the film.Biernert plays a female version of Tarzan who is adopted by a tribe of Africans along with her godfather after their plane crashes in the deep jungle. This tribe is so pathetic that they not only worship a teenage white girl as a goddess but also make her drunken Scottish stereotype of a godfather their Big White Chief. The one rebellious tribesmember meanwhile is about the same age as Beinert and looks like Lisa Bonet circa 1987. The plot begins when some mercenaries looking for the titular diamonds stumble across the barelylegal white jungle girl. They return with some of her relatives who are planning to kill her to get their hands on the inheritance of her sickly dying mother Lina Romay in a highly unusual role given that it was the height of her hardcore porn career. It would have made a lot more sense to pay the mercenaries to just keep quiet rather than to follow them into the jungle to kill the girl but oh well.There is much less violence than the earlier FrancoEurocine cannibal films. The only real sex scenes come courtesy of the luscious mistress Maria Nieto of one of Bienert's greedy relatives who gets so turned on after being nearly eaten by stock footage of a crocodile while skinnydipping that she drags one of the mercenaries Anthony Mayans into the weeds for some afternoon delight while Biernert's character curiously watches them. Mayans playing the most outofshape mercenary in cinema history later also takes a roll in the hay with the jungle girl but offscreen probably a good thing as there are already WAY too many shots of his flabby ass in this movie.This is not good by any stretch of the imagination but it is a pretty harmless movie aside from a couple sex scenes and National Geographicstyle nudity it could have gotten a PG rating in America. It has serviceable plot occasional drama and a setting that you can sometimes believe is NOT just a European zoo. And it's Citizen Kane compared to the other Franco film Golden Temple Amazonsit's paired up with in Shriek Show's new Jungle Girls box set.".

Add fortune hunters and precious stones and you have your basic rescue the girl for greedy intentions plot line. The characters are stock not adding an ounce of believability to the proceedings.Gore? None or at least very little. This film is often mentioned in the same vein as the classic Italian cannibal movies. Those seeking that type of gore need to run the other way. Save for one cheap beheading this movie features surprisingly little blood and guts.As best I can tell the only reason this movie exists is so Katja Bienert Aliene Mess and Mari Carmen Neieto could run around naked. Actually Lita Mari Carmen Neieto does the full frontal heavy lifting while the two jungle ladies are bare chested throughout. Yes there are love scenes....probably the most sterile Franco has ever supervised. The women are beautiful but nothing here to really make this movie an erotic classic either.This movie just reeks of low budget buffoonery. The sets are laughable. The acting is horrid and the editing is confusing. There is no real story to hold this together and not enough of a budget or effort to shock or titillate.

Theres some animal documentary footage brought on but the style doesnt fit to the rest of the film what causes some real laughable impressions! And former German sex starlet Katja Bienert is only ridiculous in the role of Tarzanlike girl Liana her scream sounds like a drunk gorilla! Dont be fooled folks! Even Franco can do it better!

	schema:reviewBody "Champion exploitation director Jess Franco provides another installment of his brief yet prolific jungle trash series with Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro AKA The Treasure of the White Goddess AKA a bunch of other titles. The movie shares a lot with the more notable Devil Hunter another Franco flick from around the same era some of the native music is the same the cannibalinchief is the same actress in both movies and the overall confused hodgepodge of halfbaked themes is similar. Of course there's also Franco's mandatory homevideo style panning and zooming into random things usually leaves the totally inappropriate groovy jazz music and that distinctive trash element that marks all of Franco's oeuvre.Diamonds of Kilimanjaro has a deceptively complex plot a story so confusing that a reasonable synopsis is impossible. A tribe of Englishspeaking island aborigines ruled by a drunken Scotsman kill all trespassers who attempt to steal their diamonds except when convinced otherwise by their Goddess Diana a topless teenage white girl. Things get interesting when Diana's mother sends an assortment of bickering bounty hunters to return her daughter to civilization. When not arguing eternally over where they should cross the river the rescuers develop alternate clandestine plans including bringing back Diana but stealing the diamonds not bringing back Diana and stealing the diamonds murdering Diana and stealing diamonds marrying Diana and bringing her back with the diamonds marrying Diana but not bringing her back forgetting the diamonds and a few others. Just about everyone dies in the process of figuring this out sometimes in the nude. At one point Jess Franco answers again the rarely asked question of whether it's possible to have a plot twist without having a plot to begin with.Those who expected a Eurocannibal fest here should have known better. In fact anyone who knows Franco and expected something other than what he saw needs to have himself examined. Those seeking the everelusive Franco gem might be disappointed as usual but might find enough cheap thrills and mindbending confusion to make Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro worthwhile.".

	schema:reviewBody "Good old Jess Franco! The alwaysreliable choice of director in case you're looking for undemanding sleaze shameless exploitation and 200 gratuitousness. Jess once again really surpassed himself with this utterly trashy piece of jungle adventure. Let's face it this film is basically just an excuse to have the ravishingly hot and underage actress Katja Bienert parade around topless. It's actually a rather disturbing thought that an innocent 16yearold girl had to walk around a film set naked in front of a whole crew and particularly before the gazing eyes of pervert Franco! And it wasn't even the first time since the duo previously already made Linda together. Anyways just in case you wondered YES Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro does have a plot albeit a very imbecilic one. During the opening sequences a plane carrying aboard a wealthy Scottish guy and a girl child crash amidst an African tribe of vegetarian cannibals. I say vegetarian because they never at one point in the film so much even attempt to consume human flesh. The obnoxious Scot declares himself the Great White Leader and the girl grows up to become the beautiful and scarcely dressed White Goddess. Several years later an expedition reaches the middle of the jungle to get the girl back to civilization and  even more importantly  to steal some of the tribe's legendary diamonds. This could have been a compelling and actionpacked adventure movie but Jess Franco obviously couldn't be bothered. Why shoot jungle chase sequences or bloody cannibalistic rites when you can just as easily aim your camera at a hot young chick sitting naked in a tree? Most of the jungle settings simply appear to be filmed in someone's garden and there's a massive amount of clumsily edited National Geographic wildlife footage in order to fill up the gaps in continuity. The back of the DVD describes Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro as an ingenious feminist and adult orientated version of Tarzan. Yeah right they just put that sentence there because Katja Bienert's character swings from one tree to another using a a couple of times.".

I can't profess to have seen all of Franco's 1983 films in fact I only saw this one and the truly awful Grave of the Living Dead but on the basis of the two films I would say that less than a month for writing filming and producing is about right. The film largely takes place in the jungle and is effectively a remake of the classic Tarzan story although in this case Tarzan is a woman called Diana. Well...more of a girl actually as actress Katja Bienert was just sixteen at the time of filming! The lead actress' age doesn't seem to have put Franco off either as she spends most of the film topless. To the film's credit the jungle setting is rather well used and despite being rather dull the film at least doesn't descent into absolute boredom in the same way that a lot of films like this one have done. The ending is rather amusing  it's like Franco got so far and realised he'd ran out of film stock so just called for a wrap...though the film does run for over ninety minutes so perhaps it was intended to end abruptly. Anyway this film isn't really worth seeing unless you're a diehard Franco fan.".

Really? Then the dude somehow is able to keep his dignity and his clothes while the girl fully adjusts to this tribal lifestyle stripping down and baring her breasts showing no shame in front of the tribesmen or her godfather.Then she learns what sex is by watching white people in the act? How can a girl who has been so generous as to show her ample breasts not know about sex? Do these tribesmen not reproduce? So later white people find her. What is curious is that neither she nor the group of civilized white people including her very own uncle are not at all disturbed at seeing a naked white girl. In fact her indecency isn't even mentioned.So at the end of the movie a native naked witch woman admits that she only treated the godfather and goddaughter as gods so she could destroy them? What?? All in all this movie sucked. The 20 of the movie I'm referencing in the title are the parts the naked girl is in I think she's underage actually. This review should have really gotten 2 stars but I added a few just because of her body.Believe it or not though this actress actually did many nude scenes before and after this movie.

When evidence is collected it is known as an encounter of the second kind. When contact is made with extraterrestrials it is the third kind. The next level abduction is the fourth kind. Modernday Alaska wheremysteriously since the 1960sa disproportionate number of the population has been reported missing every year. Despite multiple FBI investigations of the region the truth has never been discovered. Here in this remote region psychologist Dr. Abigail Tyler began videotaping sessions with traumatized patients and unwittingly discovered some of the most disturbing evidence of alien abduction ever documented. The Fourth Kind exposes the terrified revelations of multiple witnesses. Their accounts of being visited by alien figures all share disturbingly identical details the validity of which is investigated throughout the film.";

So I'm from Nome.I and most people I know from here have avoided this movie like the plague just because of how inherently retarded this piece of BS was going to be.So to clear things up since I've seen lots of discussion about how the movie even if a hoax leaves things unexplained concerning disappearances here you go..Nome has a high rate of alcohol and substance abuse less than .75 square miles with 7 bars and 5 liquor stores. During the winter when most of these disappearances occur snowmobiling is a main form of transportation for many in town. Nome is also a village hub for many surrounding communities which have a population of 100 or less generally.What happens often is people like to go out get drunk hop on their snowmachine snowmobile to those in the lower 48 and will wreck or break down somewhere out on the tundra miles from town in dangerous weather. Naturally these people perish and it may take days before someone sends out SR Search and Rescue unless they've filed something with the State Troopers giving them their travel plans and when they plan to return in which case SR is sent out when they haven't arrived.They also go disappearing when they travel across Norton Sound part of the Bering Sea pack ice to fast travel to the other side of the peninsula. In break up conditions when the ice is moving out and there is rotten ice they sometimes break through the ice into the Bering Sea and again.. they are gone.Nome not just Nome but the Bering Sea coast in general has a high rate of suicide which also explains some disappearances. Nome used to have a jetti for boats to pass through and distraught people would jump into it. Its almost impossible to get out of even if you're a strong swimmer. That is the reason it was graveled inover between 20042006.There is no amount of UFO BS anywhere in Nome among any citizens you may find quite a few Big Brother government conspiracy theorists though.Trivial topics of note  Nome does not have trees except for 60 miles inland along Council Road there is no owl population to speak of except again many miles outside of town along Council Road or Teller Road we have a police department and State Troopers Post not sheriffs or deputies probably 1 in 30 houses in Nome would be as nice as those portrayed in the movie.Etc.This is a major irritation. And the movie was not even good as has been said poor dialogueacting misinformation distracting cameraspecial effects work.Want an idea of what Nome is actually like?

That film is the monster hit Paranormal Activity. Now we have yet another unique viewing experience this one is The Fourth Kind.I have never been a huge believer about visitors from other worlds UFOs and conspiracy theories but I must say that if there was ever a film that made me question if only for a second that their might be life out there somewhere it would be this movie. It starts off with actress Mila Jovovich introducing herself and giving a preface to the film. She says that the film is based entirely on first person encounters and is backed up with evidence both in audio visual and in testimonial form.We are then introduced to Dr. Tyler the woman who Jovovich is portraying. She is being interviewed by the director Olatunde Osunsanmi. This interview is broken up and played at different points of the film. The look on Dr. Tyler's face alone gives you the impression that the story we are going to be told has obviously wreaked havoc on her life.We begin after the death of her husband whose mysterious death has yet to be fully resolved. She is working on a sleep study in the town of Nome Alaska where some of the residents have been telling her about a certain disturbances in the night. One in particular involving an owl outside their windows.Without ruining too much of the plot and some of the good parts I was pretty impressed with this film. I liked how much emphasis they put on the evidence. Osunsanmi obviously wants there to be no doubt that this movie is perceived not just as a movie but as a document. It's hard to believe that this is based on actual events seeing that some of the archival evidence is so startling and shocking. We have all seen videos and pictures of UFOs but these videos and audio clips are by far the most unsettling.How could this story with all of it's evidence go unnoticed? Wouldn't it have helped Dr. Tyler's case? This so called evidence is so powerful and so unsettling were it real I would be led to believe a lot of people around the world would reconsider that existence of intelligent life on other worlds.I've read plenty of reviews calling this film a fraud a let down and a disappointment. I on the other hand thought that this was unique compelling and disturbing. It's not the scariest movie ever made but there are certain images that will stay with you for a while. I have given up caring about whether or not this is a real case or if it is partially or entirely fabricated. It's fun scary and different. In the end it's a movie a movie is supposed to entertain and make you think.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alright. First of all there is no point debating whether the film is a hoax or not. Firstly the people in the supposedly real footage are actors... who have been in films. You can find it out on IMDb. The real Charlotte Milchard is an actress from the UKPlus the people in Nome Alaska were angry that the film attributed the missing persons who probably died from the rugged harsh cold terrain if anything to UFOs and aliens. And the Alaska Press club successfully hired an attorney to make Universal pay a settlement of 20000 for the fake news stories. Simply go to Google to confirm this.If this story were real it wouldn't have been released in a film it would have been all over the news and possibly be a bigger story than Roswell... or even 911. It would be all over the place. But I hadn't heard a thing about it other than an interview on Coast to Coast AM where a UFO investigator was shooting down the film for claiming it was real and making the actual people in UFOlogy look bad and giving lesser credibility to real actual stories. Shame on the producers of this movie.As for the footage you think you saw you probably mistook it for something else. Go get the DVD and watch the original scenes. Apparently you can hear someone yell action in the supposedly real footage just before the man shoots his entire family.Personally I think the movie was a bit of a failure unless the person viewing it actually believe it to be real. It felt a little bit like they had no budget so they only had enough money to hire a couple of good actors throw them into a poorly scripted movie with an unconvincing actor as the police detective... Some overhead shots of a city in Alaska and wham you have a film...The only positive thing I can say about this film is one major highlight indie filmmaking getting big... the filmmakers got away with making some good cash with little budget interesting but poorly executed marketing plan they could afford decent actors like Milla Jovovich and the guy who played the male psychiatrist... I did like how you never get to see the aliens. But what's up with the scene aboard the alien spacecraft with the drills about to drill into Milla if they're not gonna show anything? Scriptwise storywise it was unoriginal and uninteresting. The main problem was the slow pace of the film lack of anything interesting that I haven't seen before in an Xfiles episode... And why do the aliens use Sumerian? Can't they take English lessons if they're smart enough to fly across the universe? And the biggest flaw of all? The poorly executed realism of the film which I could instantly tell was not real... all the scenes purportedly shot in 2000 had fake digital interference which can easily be done in computer videoediting programs like Vegas.Overall not impressed. 310".

So despite of your approach whether aliens and alien abductions are real or not sit down and watch this movie. It is good.";

It's a shame that the lazy hacks that put this one together couldn't be bothered to fix this huge and easily remedied plot hole by using Egyptian which would have worked just as well. It didn't spoil the movie for me but it did serve as a good example of how badly conceived the whole thing was.

When i say reality based i mean based on actual events even events that could be construed as debatable. This is simply not the case here. This is an entirely fictional film for which Universal pictures has paid a settlement for having placed fake news stories in order to sell this film. This is a new low in film marketing. I know the excuse will be that films are in and of themselves a suspension of belief but do we need to be lied to now in order to achieve this? I submit NO! If i were to simply review this film knowing in advance that it was pure fiction i would have watched an entirely different film. A film that was slow to develop and only contained a few moments of actual horror. There were a few fearful moments a feat easily achieved but largely this was due to the illusion of reality perpetrated by the introduction of the film by Mila Lead Female role as being based on actual events. Sadly this seems to be a trend in the horror genre that i fear may continue simply because of the gap between when the general public can unearth the truth about such films and the money generated in the meantime. Suffice to say anyone reading this review before having seen this film will undoubtedly have a quite different reaction to those yet unaware of the films true fictional nature. I might also add that i am a fan of this genre. I enjoyed the movie Communion with Chris Walken purely for the subject matter despite its flaws as a film. Perhaps those who see this film knowing in advance that it is a marketing ploy will find greater enjoyment. I myself was not amused with the deception. Don't take me for a fool i don't take at face value and abduction story as pure truth but some basis in reality might have been more acceptable to pure lies. There are of course countless encounters of the fourth kind retold by real people to be debated and discussed. The only thing i feel like discussing about this film is how many people will see it before they know the ridiculous deception perpetrated by Universal pictures.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Fourth Kind goes to great lengths to convince you that everything in the film has actually happened. The commercials for the film claim it to be a true story and the movie opens with Milla Jovovich vouching for the truth of the story. No based on a true story. Milla Jovovich suddenly appears at the beginning of the story amid a spinning camera to inform you in an all too familiar PSA style that Hi I'm Milla Jovovich I'm an actor portraying a psychologist. Long story short her and the director inform you that what you are about to watch is real and serious.Then the movie plays and you get shots of the Milla playing her character sharing split screen with the real archive footage. The archive footage works for a while until the story decides to kick in and the footage gets more bizarre. In a method used more conservatively by shows like The XFiles and films like paranormal activity the camera cuts out during any action and you get VHS blur that obscures the entire screen. The entire screen is obscured for upwards of 30 seconds at a time and it becomes obvious that they are abusing this effect to avoid using actual special effects.Actual onscreen special effects are poorly done. They are obviously computer edited and what's worse is that they consist of effects easily available in consumer level products like Adobe Aftereffects and Sony Vegas.The sheriff who works against Milla throughout the film is a terrible actor. Enough said. Milla herself looks more like an owl than the owl aliens her clients report seeing. The film also adds lots of nonsensical morals and metaphors that are completely pointless. I won't spoil anything but the aliens at one point say I am... I am  blank being the most obvious thing they could say. Of course this metaphorical plot line is dropped instantly just to make sure this film has no depth.And then after several scenes of what is supposed to be Milla Jovovich's character in real life who looks more like a crack addict than an abductee the film abruptly ends. We get another PSA scene where Milla Jovovich gives you facts about FBI visits to the town from the film completely taken out of context She implies the visits related to abduction when in fact they related to drinking and exposure to elements related incidents and then proceeds to inform you that madeup missing little girl was never found.What would truly be an emotional ending is however in no way emotional the second you learn that the film and all the characters were completely fabricated. There is no evidence that any of the characters exist. No one in Nome remembers any of these events. Nome's sheriff which the film informs you couldn't be reached for comment was in fact reached for comment in which he reinforced that the movie was nonsense and truly a stain on the town that would hurt tourism.In the end it's a truly week film that's only shining grace is that it is a true story.The only problem being that it isn't.The worst part of the entire film however is when the credits roll and the film offers no disclaimer to inform you that it was fictional. The film effectively lies to you. The end.".

We all know what that means in the movie world. Based on true events horror films usually end up being less scary than completely made up because you sit there and you're like...that's dumb. They so obviously made 90 of that up. I mean they have potential but most of them fail. Epically.But...this movie was different. The opening was fabulous having Milla Jovovich walk on screen and say I'm actress Milla Jovovich and I will be portraying Dr. Abigail Tyler...background info...What you are about to see is extremely disturbing. This is by the way the understatement of the year. It set up the premise of the film brilliantly. I think that if the film had been purely recreated footage it would have fallen down the same slippery slope to failure that so many before it has. But by mixing in interviews by the director with the real Abigail Tyler and actual or fake actual...really it doesn't matter. The impact is the same video and audio recordings the film makers scored big time. The recreations were creepy. The actual videos the placed next to and over top of the recreation? Those were deeply disturbing and downright terrifying. Someone earlier complained about the split screen and 'merry go round' shots but I thought they were fabulous. I don't know something about seeing several angles of things and seeing the real footage next to the recreated footage just made what was happening hit so much harder. And the sound!! The sound made this film. Using the real audio recordings even when the only thing on the screen was reenactment was just...inspired. Those sounds! I can't get them out of my head. There are just...no words.I also just have to say that I loved the fact that they did not show the aliens. It made it infinitely more effective. In fact I think seeing aliens would have ruined the film. But not showing the aliens went back to the days of Hitchcock who showed us that the man with the ax is infinitely less terrifying than the idea of the man with the ax. This movie was very refreshing in a world where ridiculous amounts of gore and so one rule the horror scene. Gore and cheep scares can entertain us for a while but eventually just end up insulting our intelligence. But The Fourth Kind hits hard and is extremely disturbing right to the core. Thank you film makers for acknowledging our intelligence as viewers.Honestly I'd recommend this film to anyone who's looking for a truly terrifying horror film. But be warned. It's not for the faint of heart. But in all seriousness the film was remarkably well done. Everyone in the theater sat for a good 5 minutes during the credits before we could speak or move. I adored this film even if it looks like it is going to be leaving me without sleep for a while. Go. See it. Now.".

The use of cheap theatrical scare tactics including sudden movements and loud noises diminished rather than enhanced what little tension the film managed to achieve. But the worse transgression was the use of an actress I know I've seen her before but I can't recall her name to portray the real Abbey Tyler in what were supposed to be actual video recordings. So what you end up with is an actress Milla Jojovic acting as the real Abbey Tyler who is then played by another actress. Sorry but it just doesn't work. Sadly there are wasted in this production some excellent acting performances by the aforementioned Miss Jojovic Will Patton always excellentand Elias Koteas Law  Order. I am a sucker for this type of film but in this case I feel more like I was duped.".

	schema:headline " a disappointing movie  wasted potential and shoddy filmmaking";
	schema:reviewBody "I didn't believe for a moment that the actual footage in The Fourth Kind was actually actual footage. Surely one would have heard of stories of a relatively unknown filmmaker Olatunde Osunsanmi crafting a docudrama out of footage from actual alien abductee interviews from some years ago. It should be no surprise that it is just a gimmick to make the story of UFO abduction more credible which is all well and good. Indeed this wasn't even really the problem in and of itself I had with the movie. It was just that well it wasn't a good movie. This may sound like one of the weakest ways to complain about something like a film that took a lot of preparation and acting heft or not or too much as case turns out but it is the case here. It's a premise and technique that starts promising and then without knowing exactly when it just crumbles in selfimportance.It's from the start given the weight of THIS IS FACT! sort of as Milla Jovovich comes to tell the audience that she will be playing the part of Dr. Abigail Tyler and that footage will be shown in the film that is from reallife footage of the real Dr. Tyler from videotaped interviews she had with abducted under hypnosis and herself interviewed by the director of the film. This is an awful lot of information to give at the front and it's a sign of things to come a film that decides it take its subject matter SERIOUSLY as factual albeit with dramatization so much so that we see this 'real' actress telling us this. It's about Tyler who one night found her husband murdered in her bedroom with a knife through his chest. How did this happen? Did she see or 'feel' someone else in the room? Hypnosis shows this as a vague terrifying possibility and she follows up on cases in the small Alaskan town of Nome to interview others who have had nearly identical experiences. Every night a snow owl is outside the window and somehow 'comes in' to the bedroom and then... well no one can seem to remember or really that there is nothing to remember due to their intended to be forgetful from the fourth kind experience. Dr. Tyler can't come to any other conclusion than it despite protest from her fellow psychologist Koetas and soon digs up some research on Sumerian language and that the horrific dialog heard on an audio tape recording shows dialog from Sumeria. Freaky.The approach at first seems that it is original and with some daring. The idea is to combine scenes ala Woodstock splitscreens as a scene is happening simultaneously and create a perspective of reality filtering into the fictional representation. It's interesting for the first twenty minutes. But unfortunately this method doesn't hold up. The director means for the audience to take alien abduction seriously and it's not something he really needs to go to too far lengths to do though he clutters his serious approach with selfseriousness and a hyperstyle that calls attention to itself in some practically laughable ways at least that was the reaction of the audience I was with I was more dumbfounded and shellshocked after a while.There are examples littered throughout the film. One is the approach to the owls. Why do owls appear? What's the connection? This ambiguity isn't so bad but the way Osunsanmi approaches it with his camera is precious with lighting that is of that bluecrap tint and with some splicedin footage of owls every so often just to give an unnecessary jolt. One other is a small scene where we're shown some artifacts from Sumerian culture. At first this just looks like one of those scenes from a hacky sciencefiction TV show on alien abduction or something and then Osunsanmi just goes all nutty with how he shoots it with strobe lights going all over the place and creating a whiplash feel that is just wrong for this portion of the film.And lastly it's the whole approach to Dr. Tyler as a character that bothers one. Jovovich does what she can as an actress and to her credit she has some affecting scenes here as a mother of two who is trying to hold on to her principles as a doctor hard evidence but lacking in just the kind of case that needs it to dissuade a dissatisfied sheriff Will Patton and ultimately her character becomes one note INTENSE FEAR! She fares better than the 'other' woman who if you believe the story and the footage aka hoax is really Dr. Tyler interviewed by the director on her experience who is slabbed with bad makeup and mugs her way through an atbest hysterical turn. Towards the end just as it's supposed to be most stirring it gets cringeworthy especially as the filmmakerJovovich tells us not asks us outright decide for yourself based on this. Yeah it's just a movie thanks no matter what we really think of aliens. This split in the twoone characters of a dramatic and harrowing dramatization of a story and of interviews with this woman and her ashappened clips with distorted video and audio punctuating the abduction bits don't mesh together well enough to justify the movie on the whole. It might have made a fascinating short film but even at 93 minutes it overstays its welcome and doesn't blow one away with surprises indeed a scene late in the film showing a 'recreation' of a drillprobe had me and a friend chuckling at exactly the wrong moment. The director could have decided either to make a solid drama that might appear to be based on a real case i.e. Fargo but isn't or make a documentary ala the recent Paranormal Activity or to an extent District 9. As it stands if you saw the somewhat misleading trailer you saw it all.".

Towards the end just as it's supposed to be most stirring it gets cringeworthy especially as the filmmakerJovovich tells us not asks us outright decide for yourself based on this. Yeah it's just a movie thanks no matter what we really think of aliens. This split in the twoone characters of a dramatic and harrowing dramatization of a story and of interviews with this woman and her ashappened clips with distorted video and audio punctuating the abduction bits don't mesh together well enough to justify the movie on the whole. It might have made a fascinating short film but even at 93 minutes it overstays its welcome and doesn't blow one away with surprises indeed a scene late in the film showing a 'recreation' of a drillprobe had me and a friend chuckling at exactly the wrong moment. The director could have decided either to make a solid drama that might appear to be based on a real case i.e. Fargo but isn't or make a documentary ala the recent Paranormal Activity or to an extent District 9. As it stands if you saw the somewhat misleading trailer you saw it all.";

It does however manage to insult the intelligence of the viewer with terrible acting a weak plot and a ridiculous premise. The ridiculous premise is made more ridiculous by the film's disingenuous suggestion that it is based on true events which it is not.It contains footage of a pseudodocumentary which insults the intelligence of the viewer by simply having different actors play the same characters during the fake documentary. The premise that there were an unusually high number of disappearances in Nome Alaska is simply not true. The fact that there has been an unusual amount of FBI visits to Nome overlooks the fact that 1 criminals often flea to remote areas of Alaska to escape the authorities and 2 there is a lot of pot being grown up there in the summer time due to the seclusion and cover the forests provide from the government. Its also a great place to hide meth labs. So yes the Feds visit Nome quite a bit and its not because of aliens! The film tries to use subtle imagery and a slow build up of tension to create an atmosphere or intrigue and fear but it is so poorly conceived and directed that it just comes off forced and ridiculous.".

	schema:reviewBody "After being blown away by the film version of Requiem for a Dream I recently began reading some of Selby's books. I started with The Room and moved on to Last Exit to Brooklyn. Tonight I watched the film.I think it's very unfortunate that people have criticized it here for exactly the qualities that make it unique compared to most American films. Yes it's dark and yes there are not always clear resolutions to every character's part of the story. Those are qualities present in Selby's book and it would have been a shame for the filmmakers to abandon them just as it would have been a shame for Aronofsky to cave to the pressures to find a happier ending for his film of Requiem...As a reader of the book I think those negative comments are even more misguided because the screenwriter did quite a bit to try to make the material more accessible for the viewing audience. He intertwined what are essentially separate stories the book is more like a collection of short stories around related themes than a traditional novel and found what was probably the happiest ending possible given the material. The book doesn't end on the relief of the end of the strike but finishes with an amazing coda that contains characters like Abraham a man who spends money on clothes and his car but won't cough up to buy vitamins for his malnourished children.My one big complaint about the screenplay was the treatment of Harry Black's character. In the book he is a largely ineffectual blowhard who is laughed at by almost everyone around him but in the film he is almost heroic at times leaping into the middle of the confrontation at the picket line. I think his descent is more credible in the book but Selby was also able to get inside Harry's head on paper in a way that's difficult to translate into film.Overall I think this film is a very excellent adaptation of extremely difficult material and I recommend it to anyone who is willing to watch a story about the pain and suffering that happens in everyday life without the Hollywood gloss.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember my intense eagerness to see this film. I wasn't entirely sure why at the time but when I finally saw it in 1990 I was devastated and soon addicted to this sad tale of city life spiralling out of control.  Its a film with an epic quality and a grand sweeping style that turns the city scape into a character in itself. This was Uli Edel's as he was then known classic and it remains  a remarkably strong film.  Its not pretty and doesn't hold back in revealing the light and dark of its characters.  Brutal it may be but there is something vital and alive seething in this movie with anger and pain. Its source is Hubert Selby Jr's  novel. I believe its a superior adaptation.The film is based around a union strike which threatens to cripple the city of Brooklyn in the 1950s. The film focuses several characters Harry the troubled union leader struggling to come to terms with his desires for other men and his  genderbending lover against the anger aggression and hypocrisy of  the era a woman TraLaLa who sells her body for money but finds herself committing the ultimate crime of her profession by falling for a client  an army man destined to hurt her a family with a daughter pregnant out of wedlock a gang of aimless young men hungry  for trouble and a young teen looking for love in TraLaLa.Its a film full of fascinating performances which reinforce the greatness of this film. Jennifer Jason Leigh burst into the spotlight with her startling performance as TraLaLa. She embodies the role with unceasing honesty and vigour. It is her  late scenes in the film which rip at the heart especially when she finds compassion in an unlikely source at the worst of moments.  Her portrayal doesn't seek sympathy  on the contrary Jennifer Jason Leigh gets deep inside the cruel and manipulative character to reveal the hope beneath without a false note. Peter Dobson Stephen Baldwin are a brilliant combination as the thugs and Alexis Arquette is remarkable as their taunted worshipper Georgette.  Ricki Lake Sam Rockwell and Stephen lang also excel in a great ensemble film.I can still picture vividly the majesty and intensity of the strike  riot and the water spraying at the wire fence as strikers confront the police.There are many great scenes such as this which combined with striking performances and an unflinching script and score make Last Exit to Brooklyn a modern masterpiece. This is a highly underrated film mainly because of the view that the subject matter is too seamy grotesque and extreme. And there is no doubt this is a confronting violent and provocative film experience. Unfortunately because of this widely heralded view many people are missing out on an unacknowledged classic. Don't miss out.".

This is one of those films. Very postwar early 50's but a 1950's Donna Reed would have been lost in. It truly is the opposite of Pleasantville.Hubert Selby's dark vision of the common man is woven around several characters in a Brooklyn neighborhood. A factory worker called Big Joe is played by Burt Young. Instinctively brutal yet pathetically naive he wanders through his Brooklyn neighborhood functioning at the most elemental level reinforced only by an inherited value system to which he is singlemindedly loyal. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a whore whose timeline for thoughts of her future stretches out only several hours. She gets by in life rolling drunks whose tolerance for liquor is less than hers or giving sex to those who outlast her. A soldier soon to be shipped out takes her to Manhattan for his last few stateside days and falls in love with her. Tralala Leigh's character recognizes the attendant lust but has no clue about the implications of his love. As she sees him off the Lieutenant hands her an envelope. Tra's face lights up as her vision of the order in life she gives him sex he has a good time he gives her money seems to have been reaffirmed. When the envelope turns out to contain a lengthy love letter she doesn't become angry or disappointed just confused.In addition to Leigh and Young powerful performances are turned in by Jerry Orbach the corrupt union boss Stephen Lang the closet homosexual strikeline foreman Stephen Baldwin a street punk Ricki Lake Big Joe's very pregnant daughter and Alexis Arquette the teenage transvestite.The soundtrack is excellent and unobtrusive and Uli Edel's direction insightful.

People who put down this film don't know what they're talking about.  The author of the book this movie was based on said himself he thought this was one great adaptation of his novel.  And he was sure right.  Folks who can handle the dark brutal films of David Lynch the Coen Brothers and Tarantino Scorsese Kubrick Hartley and Fosse will dig this movie.  But if You've Got Mail is your idea fo a great rental you won't like it a bit.  It's just as well a lot of great cool films aren't for everyone.".

	schema:headline " Powerful drama";
	schema:reviewBody "Last Exit to Brooklyn 1989 is based on the book by Hubert Selby Jr. about a group of working class during a labour strike in early 1950's in the gritty streets of Brooklyn. German Uli Edel directed this and Desmond Nakano wrote the screenplay. Stephen Lang plays Harry Black the leader of the strike unit and Jennifer Jason Leigh is Tralala a lost soul who works as a hooker for the various soldiers and other drunken males that use the services of the hookers drinking beer and acting dirty. The film explores the forms of love and how desperate we are for it because living without it is not too easy or even possible as it belongs to being a human being.The film opens with a line from the Bible which thickens the theme of the film and the above thing I wrote. Soon we get introduced to the main characters who don't seem to be too happy. Harry doesn't care about his wife and child but seems to be very attracted by a sensual and very attractive transvestite who lives with other transvestites in their own apartment while the straight prostitutes are mainly in the streets. This relationship between Harry and the transvestites is very great and emotional and depicts the nature of love and caring as it doesn't always involve just different sexes together. Just watching Harry's eyes when he first sees his new interest in the street shows how powerful cinema can be without one single word.Another important character is of course Tralala and she is also involved in the film's harrowing and almost unbearably sadistic and ugly end scene that finally or what happens after that makes the film a very strong experience. She is completely lost even though she meets a nice sailor who truly falls in love with her even though Tralala doesn't understand it at once. She understands it during the end scene as well as the meaning of the crying boy she first gets to meet during the act. Last Exit to Brooklyn explores love and caring between human beings and how strong it can be. Tralala wouldn't survive without the motorcycle boy or she would live the rest of her life in pure emptiness and void. The film handles also violence and weak human nature desperate for sex and other of his instincts. The violence is very harsh and off putting and the film's view of life is dark to say the least. Violence is here as unjustified and brutal as in real life too and maybe that's why so many seem to dislike the film and its honesty saying it is unpleasant and repellent. The sets are very impressive and the atmosphere in this film is all the time like the actors could any minute start singing and dancing their lines! This creates also a very strong feel of danger and clock ticking as the workers and strikers wait for the decision by the authorities and it is like it is night all the time. The film feels like a depiction of the world's last day that still may not be the last but no one knows it yet for sure.Equally great with the photography and sets is the music by Mark Knopfler. The beautiful theme is played during the film restrainedly and it makes the strong events and situations even stronger as always a great soundtrack does. The very conclusion is pretty optimistic and again the music makes it look even brighter and hopeful. Some characters didn't manage to learn before it was too late but at least those who did have a chance for a better tomorrow.The major negative sides in the film are in the occasional restlessness as the writer tried to give us more information than it was necessary. I mean mostly the scenes involving Burt Young character's family tragedy with all its screaming and shouting and crying. These scenes are not too powerful but more irritating as they could have been different. The characters' motivations are not always clear and sometimes they seem to develop too fast. What they tried to express through screaming and horrible noise should have been done more aesthetically and with the tools of the art and much more effectively.Last Exit to Brooklyn is a powerful challenging and at the end beautiful film about the most important and universal things in life and about humanity and it is also a great film visually. This is very powerful drama and only few steps from being a nearly perfect masterpiece. 810".

Which leads to the boys friends brutally beating Harry to the point where he was within an inch of his life from being dead and ending up being literally crucified in an empty backlot This is the level of brutality in this movie. A violent brutal and at the same time shockingly honest movie about life in Brooklyn New York circa 1952. During a long and savage dock strike on Brooklyn's heavily industrialized Bush Terminal waterfront. The film is truly disturbing with a shocking and vicious gang rape intercut with a baby shower for one of the unions members Big Joe Burt Young daughters child at the local union hall. These are just two of many such jolting scenes in the movie. An excellent cast with Stephen Lang as the union shop steward who's problems are more then just the job that he has on the docks. With Jennifer Jason Leigh as the bar girl who likes to date and then roll servicemen with the help of her friends to get their money and ends up paying for what she did in more ways then one. With Jerry Orbach as the feisty and two fisted union president who sticks to his guns and in the end gets what he wants for himself and his union members and many many more good actors and the parts that they play in the movie.Last Exit to Brooklyn is a very hard movie to watch but if you want a film with brutal realism and fine acting and photography as well as a story that will grip you right from the start and hold on to you long after the movie is over this is it.".

None of us lived in the streets like the characters in the film but the violence from there was definitely reflected in our day to day life. Heartwrenchingly faithful to the mood and sentiment of Hubert Selby's important novel I am continuously surprised at how films like this are overlooked in a larger classic sense. This is not a pleasant film. The German direction and influence put me in mind of Fassbiner's Berlin Alexanderplatz. There was a similar grotesque as well as aesthetic beauty that I found to be very compelling. Most of all however I was remarkably impressed by Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance. She gave us the flip side of Marylin Monroe the antithesis if you will. I'm pretty sure that she has not as yet received Oscar recognition and am puzzled how her performance in Last Exit did not get her a nod. This film come highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " As HardHitting as a Baseball Bat...";
	schema:reviewBody "Mark Knopfler's beautiful and melancholy score paints a haunting and pained picture over this an extremely hardhitting drama superbly directed by Uli Edel.For 1989 its release date and set around Brooklyn in the 1952 this is as strong as films got. The C word rape scenes florid homosexuality and sexual violence  from a novel by Hubert Selby jnr that was initially banned under the Obscene Publications Act.So why watch it? There's a sense of brooding beauty about it in the same way that West Side Story had flawed characters in so many conflicts within their own community and incomers such as military servicemen at night looking for a great time. Enter busty platinum blonde and cocky Jennifer Jason Leigh who gets men in bars buying her drinks leads them out for some 'fun' and then her mates bash him round the head with a bottle. Grabbing the money they're just those hoodlums from west Side...just older doing worse things.Stephen Lang meanwhile is the shop steward for a union that's called its dockside workers out. He's raking in on expenses for things he doesn't even need. He's got a wife and baby but leaves them at night to go out with Regina actually Reginald a camp gay and his bitching transvestite buddies.As you can see this is strictly for adults and no I haven't read the book. A friend I lent the DVD to who's read all manner of literature from the classics to strong stuff like this just said Wow.It's a memorable and distinctive film. Not one that's known either commercially or infamously. It doesn't seem to get bundled up with the likes of Natural Born Killers or A Clockwork Orange. Maybe cos it has a heart a survivoral instinct that's most apparent in the Italian families in the film headed by Burt Young who of course played Paulie Rocky Balboa's wheezing training aide in the Rocky movies.My Universal release has a fine transfer and is quite cheap especially secondhand. So if you want something pretty edgy but with a heart and a pulse this could end up in your player.".

	onyx:emotionText "Mark Knopfler's beautiful and melancholy score paints a haunting and pained picture over this an extremely hardhitting drama superbly directed by Uli Edel.For 1989 its release date and set around Brooklyn in the 1952 this is as strong as films got. The C word rape scenes florid homosexuality and sexual violence  from a novel by Hubert Selby jnr that was initially banned under the Obscene Publications Act.So why watch it? There's a sense of brooding beauty about it in the same way that West Side Story had flawed characters in so many conflicts within their own community and incomers such as military servicemen at night looking for a great time. Enter busty platinum blonde and cocky Jennifer Jason Leigh who gets men in bars buying her drinks leads them out for some 'fun' and then her mates bash him round the head with a bottle. Grabbing the money they're just those hoodlums from west Side...just older doing worse things.Stephen Lang meanwhile is the shop steward for a union that's called its dockside workers out. He's raking in on expenses for things he doesn't even need. He's got a wife and baby but leaves them at night to go out with Regina actually Reginald a camp gay and his bitching transvestite buddies.As you can see this is strictly for adults and no I haven't read the book. A friend I lent the DVD to who's read all manner of literature from the classics to strong stuff like this just said Wow.It's a memorable and distinctive film. Not one that's known either commercially or infamously. It doesn't seem to get bundled up with the likes of Natural Born Killers or A Clockwork Orange. Maybe cos it has a heart a survivoral instinct that's most apparent in the Italian families in the film headed by Burt Young who of course played Paulie Rocky Balboa's wheezing training aide in the Rocky movies.My Universal release has a fine transfer and is quite cheap especially secondhand. So if you want something pretty edgy but with a heart and a pulse this could end up in your player.";

That is the best complement that I can give to this movie. I wonder why the director has not done more feature film work cause this film is on the level of the greats.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was drawn to this movie curious to see how they have adapted Hubert Shelby's brutal novel. I thought that a literary piece of such depth with a rich tapestry of characters horrid situations and social critique could not translate into a bad movie. I was wrong.This flick is a terrible movie experience not for its content but for its form. Director Ulrich Edel executes in my sincere opinion a terrible directorial job that does no justice to the original book. No wonder Edel is a TV director this movie looks and feels like a bad made for TV flick. Some of my views on this bomb spoilers aheadLack of directorial creativity. The scenes are slow feel slow look poorly shot and barely ever move from an anchored position. The only liberty they take is in the cinematography area with a nice dark tone. Other than that the movie has the same technical creativity as a TV soapopera.All the actors do a terrific job at portraying these miserable characters. The problem is that the adaptation does not tackle a basic element in the development of the plot MOTIVATION. All these characters move around like robots without a clear motivation for their action. They seem to do things out of the blue like robots for no reason at all. Edel misses every opportunity to enrich character development by not exploring the character's motivations and by avoiding developing each character's personality to its full extent.This lack of character development is blatant on Tralala. Jennifer Jason Leight does a great job playing this trashy prostitute but her alcoholinduced decision to let the sailors violate her is not explained. It looks extremely stupid as we see this character doing this out of the blue. This is a clear example of poor character development.The movie also has many secondary token characters that do nothing feel nothing and add nothing to the plot. I would have liked to learn more about Harry's wife for instance and the interaction between the two. That's another missed opportunity.Edel only approaches character development with Harry and his fixation with his gay lover only to screw it up at the end not clearly explaining again his motivations. The thugs are also a joke in their lack of development.The soundtrack is one of the worst I've ever experienced. Terrible job by Mark Knopfler. I seriously expected more from the former leader of Dire Straits but his job in this movie is seriously lacking. At times like in the battle between the union workers and the police the music seems totally disconnected from the movie. It also feels completely poor and anachronic I could swear the whole soundtrack was made with a Casio toy keyboard. It distracts from the actual action.The book adaptation by Desmond Nakano is so literal that eliminates the point of the story. It feels as if they tried so hard to keep the actionbyaction storyline in the book that they forgot to actually develop the characters and once again explain their actions and motivations.I seriously can not recommend this movie not even to a Shelby fan because it can ruin the original book. It's a very uninspired effort in adapting the novel and shows very little creative input.".

However thanks to Martin Scorcese and a few other filmmakers like him there have been mainline films worse languagewise than this....but this is a pretty brutal assault on one's ears. Hey I can take a lot of it but this got ridiculous. In the first six minutes alone I heard a halfdozen usage's of the Lord's name in vain plus an untold number of fwords. I wonder how many people walked out of the theater watching this in 1990? I couldn't have been the only one.Not surprisingly some of the feature actors included Jennifer JasonLeigh Burt Young Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake. Since this film Stephen Lang seems to have improved his image at least playing the Godly Stonewall Jackson in Gods and Generals. Lang's role here is just the opposite perhaps the worst trashy person in the film and a character who falls in love with a transvestite by the end of the film.Depressing gloomy semipornographic repulsive these are just a few of the adjectives people used  even some Liberal critics  in describing this story which is painted even worse in the novel. Of course some of the betterknown critics all extreme Libs praised the movie. However they were the only ones. Most critics were disgusted as well almost all of the paying public. It's unbelievable that anyone could praise filth and garbage like this.Trust me on this there are no good likable characters in this entire movie. This is a mean sick film one of the worst of the modern era. That is unless you enjoy seeing child abuse drug abuse teen prostitutes on and on  two straight hours of nothing but atrocities and just plain evil people. No thanks.".

What interests me more is it's director when you consider what he made before and after this film the unfair latter of these titles named as one of 93's worst. Set in Brooklyn 1952 we flip through the lives of many characters in their bored going nowhere town. And what characters we meet in still what appears a film that has it's sleazy and shock for the thrill of shocking moments and be warned some scenes are confronting. The movie could be seen like that but doesn't mean it's not true. Jennifer Jason Leigh is fantastic here top notch as the towns popular hooker who works a deal with the town's bad boys to snag horny but oblivious men at the moment sailors soldiers to lure them sexually then knock 'em over dividing the moolah between them. These punks some of them real pigs with no respect for women especially Stephen Baldwin's character who personally I found quite repulsive work at the bottle plant whatever where a a strike begins. One of them is forced to marry a fat women he knocked up. We have the local real 'out there' homosexual who dresses up in woman's clothing a character again I found repulsive as in his manner. There's the head manager of the plant Stephen Lang great a married man who can't come out of the closet his last tragic scene one of the most memorable in the film. We have a young I guess geek type guy drooling over and obsessing with Leigh while trying to get his bloody motorcycle up and running. The gang bang scene with Leigh was shocking but this guy coming to her rescue alleviated the shock and truly made this scene a moving and poignant one where just viewing this part again after about twenty years almost had my eyes tearing up. It's one of the most touching scenes I've ever experienced. LETB is about struggling and pitiable characters it's title ringing true. Despite their ugly and repulsive traits we do feel for them where the reality here the uglyness for them is that this is as probably as good as it's ever gonna get for them. That's what's tragic. This enthusiastic effort does seem one held by some juicy shock moments and themes but you can't deny the powerful impact this movie serves bringing with it stand up performances especially from Leigh and Terranova's Lang. The music by Knophler is great but the other music isn't bad either one tune familiarly sounding in it's start to that one in Rumble Fish if you can remember.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's such a shame that Wertmuller no longer commands the interest of producers. She gave us such powerful films and at her peak she and Giannini could do no wrong. European directors have given us films that excoriate Fascists. There is Bertoluci's 1900 and The Conformist Costa Gravas's Missing there is Schindler's ListThe Pianist Two Women are just a few of a long list. What does Wertmuller show us? Simple people get caught up in every single war WW 2 was no exception. There were probably all kinds of attempts to kill Mussolini before he was finally caught and hung up like a piece of meat. This movie takes place early in the rise of El Duce. To openly show displeasure with his black shirted thugs would guarantee a short and brutal outcome. The same held true for those brave and furious souls in Spain and Germany who tried in vain to stand up against Fascism. The main story in this drama is the almost mad plans of a simple country bumpkin who seeks to avenge the murder of an anarchist who planned to kill Mussolini but got carried away and told everyone in the town of his plans. Next thing we see is him murdered. Giannini's character shows up in Rome and seeks refuge in a brothel all prearranged after having gone to France for training in shooting a gun. Much has been made of the mayhem inside the brothel but to me this is color adding to the texture it is subtext. The main body of this drama evolves with Tunin and his trembling approach to the plot. That he becomes embroiled in an unexpected love for a prostitute is but one twist in the plot. There are several wonderful scenes where he has ample opportunity to kill a vile fascist thug who is a regular at the brothel but he refuses to get sidetracked. Even after having fallen in love he still refuses to divert from his presumed destiny. He fully expects to either fail or even if successful to get caught and killed for his efforts. Tunin tries to make sense of his confused feelings and at the end has to abandon clarity for duty. He is confused frightened and compelled to honor his fallen comrade. The surprise twist I won't spoil it at the end of the film pushes him over the edge into an irrational spontaneous and self destructive spree. His fate once met is anticlimactic he having already intuited the end. The film is funny tense and upsetting. I simply cannot believe how fast Mariangela Melato speaks she sounds like the fast rattle of a machine gun. The cast is totally wonderful the direction tight with evocative single frame shots of Tunin in a pose creating a snapshot feel supporting his introspection as he plans. An aside what is up with Giannini's face? He looks like his face was covered in splotches ...like freckles he looked sickly and scary and did not look like this in Swept Away Anyway a really powerful drama the likes of which we just don't see today.".

The plan gets offtrack when Turin falls in love with Tripolina a prostitute in the bordello where he lives in the days leading up to the assassination attempt. We soon learn that Tripolina returns his love and the tragic stage is set. Knowing full well that the assassination attempt successful or not will surely mean his death Turin is suddenly gripped by fear. When all he had at stake was a quiet life on the farm he was glad to give it up for a chance at changing the quality of life for his peasant countrymen. But now having tasted the happiness love can afford can Turin really carry through with this suicidal act? Can he truly give up his life for a belief he once thought was worth dying?Love  Anarchy is a brilliant study of turmoil and human testing in the face of insurmountable odds. It begs the questionis it better to bow and live or stand up and die? How much can a people be crushed before someone makes a sacrifice for the betterment of society? Whose responsibility is it? And on a grander scale is it better to live happily contented by love or family and leave the world untouched or to attempt real change by sacrificing everything in exchange for it? Love  Anarchy poses all these questions but it offers no easy answers.Wertmller's favorite actor Giancarlo Giannini plays the peasant boy Turin with beautiful humility. He wordlessly portrays infinite subtleties of emotion with body language and facial expression alone. Giannini has the face of a silent movie actor and in fact was touted as a new Chaplin in the 1970s. Playing opposite him as the prostitute Salome is Mariangela Melato who viewers may recognize from Wertmller's Swept Away. She too delivers a wonderful performance. The style and pacing of the film are excellent. Cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno captures Rome in a gorgeous yet unobtrusive manner.In Love  Anarchy Wertmller doesn't pull any punches. As par usual she lets the politics of her movie decide the fate of its characters and tragedy ensues. One must admire her for making an extraordinarily brave and beautiful film. She exhibits how powerful and effective a tragic story can truly be in exploring the more complex questions of life.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rather than contend for film with the longest title Film of Love and Anarchy or At Ten o'clock This Morning in Via dei Fiori in the Infamous House of Prostitution is better known by the more manageable Love and Anarchy. This 1973 Lina Wertmller thriller is a hard first watch because there is no suspense to grab the viewer and hook them into the story. I was only able to handle about 30 minutes at a time not because it was unpleasant but because I was too uninvolved in the story to ignore distractions and interruptions. But while it withholds most of its appeal from the initial viewing it yields something new each time it is viewed.Love and Anarchy is more an expressionistic opera than a realistic thriller. Imagine Cabaret starring Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp and you will have a good idea of its style. It's main theme sneaks up and surprises you. U.S. viewers dimly aware of the great depression and World War Two suffer a complete cultural disconnect regarding the continuing legacy of fascism in Italy and Germany. Meaning that antifascist political messages are embedded in almost all postwar Italian cinema. But Wertmller's Love and Anarchy has the broader theme of antiextremism taking shots at those who make major sacrifices out of perverted idealism and a lack historical perspective. The film begins with its main character Tonino Giancarlo Giannini at a turning point in his life the execution of an older relative for political subversion. After viewing the body on display in what would otherwise by an idyllic rural setting Torino is inspired to take over what he perceives as his relative's mission the assassination of Benito Mussolini. Tonino goes to Rome and links up with his anarchist contact a highly sought after call girl named Salom another Wertmuller regular Mariangela Melato her brothel is popular with the Fascists and Mussolini's head of security an arrogant blowhard named Spatoletti Eros Pagni is especially fond of Salom. Tonino and young call girl Tripolina Lina Polito soon fall in love which serves to greatly complicate his mission.I watched the widescreen version of the film on the Fox Lorber DVD and contrary to several other comments I found no problems with the film transfer. My guess is that these refer to the variation in color tone as the film cuts between characters but this is a deliberate effect by Wertmller's. She lights each face differently to convey the character's motivation. The uncomplicated Torino is given natural lighting the political Salom is tinted red and the disillusioned Tripolina is in shadow. These combine with bold colors a surreal score and acute camera angles that exaggerate elements and play with scale in many of the frames. The everyday scenes in the brothel are especially good combining the audacious with the darkly comic. The best is a carnivallike montage to music showcasing the start of a busy day of business for the prostitutes and their eager customers. In almost any other film Pagni would steal the whole thing with his overplayed performance but Melato matches him line for line. This contrasts nicely with the more subtle and nuanced performances of Giannini and Polito. Polito is very effective when Wertmller makes use of her eyes in several closeups.There is much overwrought melodrama as Wertmller uses a farcical tone to illustrate that the Fascists and their opposition are linked by a common hypocrisy and a shared perversion of idealism. Ironically the film is at its best during its quiet scenes such as Tornio and Tripolina's stroll through the plazas of the city. This is an important film with an original message fine performances from the entire ensemble and really slick filmmaking techniques.Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

Polito is very effective when Wertmller makes use of her eyes in several closeups.There is much overwrought melodrama as Wertmller uses a farcical tone to illustrate that the Fascists and their opposition are linked by a common hypocrisy and a shared perversion of idealism. Ironically the film is at its best during its quiet scenes such as Tornio and Tripolina's stroll through the plazas of the city. This is an important film with an original message fine performances from the entire ensemble and really slick filmmaking techniques.Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.";

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film two times in 1973 and a few years later again in art cinemas in the United States. I vividly remember the opening line I'm off to kill Mussolini. Screw the rest. While Fox Lorber put this film on DVD in 1997 it is now unavailable and sells for 37 used. I bought a madeinChina copy for 5 on Ebay. I was a bit upset when the first title read only I'm off to kill Mussolini. I wondered why the change? Anyways the rest of the DVD seemed fine.This is an amazing film. The acting by everyone is superb with Giancarlo Gianini giving a performance that won him a best acting award at the Cannes film festival and should have won him an Oscar. He is Chaplinesque but not imitative of Chaplin or anybody else. It is one of the most sympathetic performances ever given. In many scenes he doesn't talk but you sense his feelings of anger or sadness. His mass of freckles on his face make him look more like a 14 year old than a man planning a major political assassination. Mariangela Melato is sexy foulmouthed and hilarious. She also manages to make you believe that she is both a cynical prostitute and a politically and culturally aware anarchist. Lina Polito is the young prostitute with hope. She gives a performance similar to and as wonderful as Liza Minnelli in Cabaret. The musical score by Federico Fellini's main composer Nino Rota is energetic and terrific. It often counterpoints the action on the screen bringing us away from it and making some harsh scenes seem comical but it also heightens the playfulness or menace in other crucial scenes. He won an Oscar for the Godfather Part II a few years later but he deserved one here too. This is a tribute to the European nihilist and anarchist movements of the 1800 and 1900's. It is also powerfully antifascist.This is great and enthralling filmmaking. It is Lina Wertmuller's best film and still stands out today nearly 40 years later as a great historical and humanist work of art. It is sad that more people do not know about it and have not had the opportunity to experience it.Having seen about 6000 films 150 films X 40 years I would put this one in the top twenty.".

He also meets another prostitute with whom he falls in love.  Wertmuller does a very good job with the romantic storyline as well.Although Tunin's first reason for assassinating Mussolini was that he hates tyrants he also was doing it to get revenge for his friend but also he hoped that in this act he would beome someone. This story had a more universal theme of how people try to become someone when they feel like a no one and it also makes you wonder how many people there are that were like Tunin trying to change things and failing to the point that no one even knew they had tried in the first place.Sadly in the end Tunin remains an unknown and it is so sad yet the ending is so well done and I really think the original title is much more powerful than just Love and Anarchy because of the ending.  At 10 o'clock in the morning in via dei Fiori in a wellknown brothel... he is no one.

It is very operatic which is how she chose to attack it. The direction I can say is flawless but the movie feels incomplete. First I am more the director who uses visual images rather than hammy stagey dialogue to tell their stories. Carnini is the only actor who does not use a pantomime overexagerrated style in the movie until the very end while everybody else does. It softens the impact of the movie as it is the quieter moments that carry real weight. The style of direction is very narchiac with wonderful wide shots and good editing creating an effigy of exuberance over the picture. Most of the picture set in an italian bordello where the fascists of italy stay is a place for both love between carnini and pesilamo. Images are beautiful and certain individual scenes work while others don't. We are left with a great understanding of what love must feel like but the brutality of man is never explained. It esssentially sets up the theory that all fascists are naturally evil. The ending tells us it is the stoty of one man while the movie sets it up as the story of every man. This the best explanation I can give without speaking too much about its plot. Wertmuller was much better in Swept away and seven beauties. But for an introduction to Wertmuller and arty Italian cinema of the sixties and seventies which dealt very operaticly with evils of fascism.".

The main one is that this is I believe the first German movie it's actually a GermanSpanish coproduction from the 1950s that I think I've seen. It's directed by Alfred Weidenmann a director with whom I am unfamiliar. He seems to have become a director in the early 1940s in charge of a series of shorts about the Hitler Youth. By 1942 he was directing features ... invariably described as propaganda. After the war he did not direct another film until 1953 denazification seems to have taken some time for him. He directed his last of 28 films in 1978 then directed television until 1999. He died the following year in Zurich.My other issue with discussing this war film is that I have seen many of them well over a thousand. If the saying that if you've seen one you've seen them all has any truth in it then if you've seen them all then you've seen one. It certainly falls into the standard mold of the rebellious young man who does brilliantly and then dies pointlessly. In many ways it's THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON in the air. A voiceover artist near the beginning and at the end makes rote observations of the pointlessness of the war. In the movie itself there's none of that. There's the best friend of leading man Joachim Hansen from childhood the good man who does the right thing at all times. There's Marianne Koch as the love interest who tries to talk him into deserting so they can have a life  he doesn't know what she is talking about. There's even the commanding officer who talks about their unit comparing himself to a father with many children he strikes me as a Trevor Howard type for some reason.It's the easy comparison with other war movies that troubles me. At one point hauled back to Berlin to have medals pinned on him he gives a speech at his old school. I thought about ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT and how Lew Ayres in a similar situation breaks down calls the teacher who inspired him to join the army a fraud and says that nothing makes sense and he longs to go back to the Front where he understands things. Hansen does no such thing. He gives a speech grinning like a schoolboy saying nothing about himself. He comes into this film loving to fly and shoot targets. He spends the majority of the film flying and shooting down targets. He dies and there's no sense of character no sense of growth and no regrets although others around him have them.Perhaps that's the point of this film but I find it like listening to a songwriter who introduces each song with And then I wrote.... If this was intended as an antiwar film it's about as effective as a Dime Novel. Considering the great antiwar films of the era.... well if you've seen one you've seen them all and this isn't one.".

I must say I have not been familiar with the name at all but after seeing this film he must have been the World War II equivalent to Manfred von Richthofen. It is about a new generation of men blinded by wrong ideas and by their enthusiasm and nationalistic spirit that they imbibed from their infancy. So despite the film being pretty wild and enthusiastic it is actually a fairly sad story really how this generation was somewhat lost especially the title character too. He is played by Joachim Hansen and I cannot say I have heard the name before I think. But Felmy and Koch are still somewhat known today to German film fans maybe Hansen too and it's just my failure. Overall the story of this 100minute film was not too interesting to me maybe because militarythemed movies have never been my preferred choice really. If you think differently about the subject then you may actually enjoy the watch a lot more than I did. I personally would have preferred watching a documentary on the subject.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well I actually really liked it. Next to the tension this movie builds on it has a very warm very dutch comforting seventiesbased and natural feel to it. Despite of the actual storyline and the grim ideas behind it I could understand where Theo was coming from when he wanted this to be made. Having lived the day when Pim Fortuyn got killed and knowing the many unexplained details surrounding it I think parts of the movie are terrifying in that they might very well be more true than most of us would like to believe. Just waving away the entire story as fiction somehow doesn't cut it for me. Knowing Theo Van Gogh quite well from local TV etcetera I expected some hidden messages telling us things beneath the surface of it all They're not getting through to every viewer but they're all over the place.Theo shot this movie using the very fast 3camera technique giving it a documentarylike speed which fits the writing. Some of the action scenes could have been done better with a bigger budget perhaps but aside from a few lesser moments which didn't really bother me the movie had me hooked and the only thing I didn't like was that it ended. You know good guys can't always win but you really want them to this time around. Even today you'd like Pim and Theo to just reappear onscreen like nothing had happened in our 'innocent' little country. It's hard to view the film not knowing the sickening story behind his killing and it's even harder to notice how wrongfully he and Pim have been accused of being racist and rightwing extremists or similar accusations. If anything this movie is telling it like it is and shows us how the exact opposite was true for both Pim and Theo.The movie would have looked quite promising for Van Gogh and still does for most of the actors in it. Theo was clearly getting better by the year so it truly saddens me to see what could have been if he would still be alive. It's all been so silly so stupid so useless and when you see this movie you want to snap out of reality but you know you can't because it is all so real...".

	onyx:emotionText "Well I actually really liked it. Next to the tension this movie builds on it has a very warm very dutch comforting seventiesbased and natural feel to it. Despite of the actual storyline and the grim ideas behind it I could understand where Theo was coming from when he wanted this to be made. Having lived the day when Pim Fortuyn got killed and knowing the many unexplained details surrounding it I think parts of the movie are terrifying in that they might very well be more true than most of us would like to believe. Just waving away the entire story as fiction somehow doesn't cut it for me. Knowing Theo Van Gogh quite well from local TV etcetera I expected some hidden messages telling us things beneath the surface of it all They're not getting through to every viewer but they're all over the place.Theo shot this movie using the very fast 3camera technique giving it a documentarylike speed which fits the writing. Some of the action scenes could have been done better with a bigger budget perhaps but aside from a few lesser moments which didn't really bother me the movie had me hooked and the only thing I didn't like was that it ended. You know good guys can't always win but you really want them to this time around. Even today you'd like Pim and Theo to just reappear onscreen like nothing had happened in our 'innocent' little country. It's hard to view the film not knowing the sickening story behind his killing and it's even harder to notice how wrongfully he and Pim have been accused of being racist and rightwing extremists or similar accusations.

The plot is pretty good as we could expect from Ross but the acting is a little rough sometimes. Every time I see someone handling a gun in a dutch movie it seems strange to me. Only LEK succeeded in making that work for me. It's definitely a movie a for many people in The Netherlands to see especially because it's the last movie Theo van Gogh made before he was killed by a crazy SOAB. It's funny to see the voting on this movie. 38 When i'm writing this and about half votes it a 10 and the other half votes for a 1. That's an example of how this is still a subject in the dutch society and this might be compared to a dutch JFK. It's a pity van Gogh couldn't get actors that are the same quality as JFK or even find one that speaks proper English!".

Secondly two of the main characters are westernized Muslims and in the film they drink alcohol have a sexual affair and wear regular clothes  no hijab for the female character . What all of that means exactly is something of a mystery to me.Third the storytelling in this film is far better than some of the other comments might indicate. Given that the fine DVD presentation requires the viewer to read subtitles for the parts given in other languages which is about 98 per cent of the film it all works real well. In my lessthanhumble opinion of course.Apparently the Dutch secret service or spy agency does not believe in or perhaps does not need warrants to break into the homes of private citizens and is not averse to random acts of vandalism as well.So yes the story is convoluted and to see this film without some basic backgrounding on the politics involved makes it a daunting task. On the other side the principal actors mostly do a very fine job in their characterizations of real persons. The fact that the film ends without giving the viewer any kind of in the face explanation of who really killed the Dutch politician Pym does not make the story in any way irrelevant. Nor can any sensible person find anything racist in this intriguing drama. On the contrary the Netherlands is presented as being a most tolerant place where natives and secondgeneration immigrants live next to each other and work together quite well.It's a spy story and a murder story after all and it does provoke the viewer to ask ... who really wanted that fellow Pym to be killed ? The colorful controversial life of Theo van Gogh who was in life so very central to the creation of this film is NOT the subject here.The pacing and the direction were really rather good and it is not a slowpaced film but it is telling a rather convoluted story. Leading lady Tara Elders does a remarkable turn in a tough role too as the Muslim immigrant with a checkered past.For my dollar two ninetyfive it was worth renting and worth viewing twice. The second time around the intrigue was much easier to grasp.It is necessary to know something about the recent history of the Netherlands to get the full value of this production.".

This is exactly the Sovietlike unmeasured demagoguery that had Fortuyn killed. Would I be allowed to make a generalization of my own? Would it be offlimits to present some statistically significant data about crime committed by immigrants which makes the Dutch a bit wary and suspicious? Now that would be racism wouldn't it? Or the fact that a significant minority is involved in gang and violent criminal activity and that large portion of these people feel alienated from the dominant culture and have made it explicitly clear that they will do as they please regardless of what the laws say. Another fact is that we are one the most racially diverse of the leading industrialized nations with the biggest percentage of nonWestern immigrants. That we have done many things for the eternally disaffected Muslims We have build them mosques with imposing minarets all over Rotterdam Amsterdam and the rest of the country we have authorized state grants to Islamic schools etc. etc. Many Muslims however relate to their host countries in ways that are diametrically opposed to the multicultural indulgence that they have received. Did I mention that Van Gogh is dead like Fortuyn? And that two prominent politicians are into hiding for the rest of their lives? That sort of proves their point doesn't it? I also can't say that I'm much impressed by the idiot schoolmarmish cant about racism and xenophobia from SnoopDogDog from Albania. To call opinions you don't like racist is such a debasement the question is are they true?. A phobia is an irrational fear of something or someone. It is not irrational to fear those who follow issued fatwa's. Fortuyn was a publicspirited person doing his citizenly best to promote his idea that freedom of speech is more important than the supposed feelings of Muslims. Fortuyn's opinions were politically incorrect the opinions of the left were simply incorrect comparing him to Hitler in a very volatile period of World War II commemorations which was an offence to objective truth and reason. However Fortuyn never thought that any speech should be legally banned. By the way we take the pss out of everyone we're Dutch!

Theo van Gogh has made a clever attempt in pointing out facts that almost everyone who had something to lose in the elections of 2002 or something to gain wanted Fortuyn out of the way. The resemblance with the death of JFK is apparent.It is a fact that heavy police activity was noticed in the area of the assassination prior to the shooting. It is a fact that Mat Herben was a little known politician who rose to power after the election. In true conspiracy style Van Gogh links the election with king makers very much like the king makers in Being There. Reference is made to the Bilderberg Group. Apparently Mat Herben was spotted at one of those secret meetings. Mat Herben is known to be a Freemason. It is interesting to note that then Prime Minister Win Kok was quoted as saying that he thought that political assassinations were a thing of the past. No journalist ever followed up on that rather odd remark.The movie is entertaining the acting is much better than expected and the plot does contain holes as Van Gogh took too little time to further develop the story. The Dutch have a lot to learn about conspiracies in general. They make the fundamental mistake of filling in gaps left in the official story without asking the right questions first. In JFK the movie there is a famous quote by Jim Garrison Ask the question!. Maybe just maybe the official story intentionally leaves holes for conspiracy theorists to make the number one mistake..".

Especially in the scenes with the father sometimes HE looked younger despite his beardI found it totally unbelievable that she was 15! She's pretty she's a good actress but looked too old. Most ridiculous the scene in the poolwaterparadise. Embarrassing.";

It also claims that various politicians and media personalities by saying very harsh things about Fortuyn created an atmosphere that facilitated or even directly led to the murder.For a movie that makes such bold statements everything hinges on how convincing it can carry those statements across.

It does make it clear that various people went way too far in the things they said to and about Fortuyn but it fails to explain why this would automatically lead to murder. There's a difference between words and deeds you know and holding an entire group responsible for the actions of one madman is cheap to say the least. It also glosses over the fact that Fortuyn consciously chose the role of the victim and cleverly provoked a lot of the reactions and insulted lots of people himself.The actual conspiracy theory presented here is very straightforward and rather predictable but not all that convincing . It's good enough to serve as a movie plot but it's not nearly good enough to make you believe that something like it actually happened since it's very clearly mostly just fiction.So as a political statement 0605 mostly fails but is it still good entertainment? IMHO not really. Theo van Gogh's directing style might work for documentaries but it's too straightforward and rushed to create any form of tension or to make you care about any of the characters. Fairly uninspired acting and dialog don't really help either. The leads are OK but some of the supporting roles are horribly miscast Jack Wouterse as head of intelligence...yeah right and the Dutch actors that speak English are embarrassing.

But if it were an American film it wouldn't have been made at all. we in the US are pretty protected from news about what our weapons manufacturers are really doing.

Pim Fortuyn would have won the next elections in the Netherlands and would probably have been the next Dutch Prime Minister in 2005. With his more or less liberal promarket agenda Pim Fortuyn was acceptable for the rightist political and economic powers and their media until  it appeared that he would not respect the Dutch NATO obligations e.g. the purchase of brand new fighter planes and would instead spend the huge sums available on more social programs. From that moment on he became an outcast an outlaw free to be killed by any person who could be manipulated by the forces Pim Fortuyn had unleashed against him. He was shot dead under the eyes of the secret services. One of his main media opponents was the socialist ? TV commentator MVD. This man is the perfect example of the adage 'do as I say not as I do'. He defended passionately with his mouth the underdogs and the poor immigrants while building a mansion of more than 2 million euro in his backyard. If anyone in the Netherlands had done the same only one tenth of the actual Dutch population would have found a place to live there.This movie is a must see for all those who want to understand the world we live in.".

Nowadays it's very popular to take the pss on foreigners in the Netherlands. Not just the man in the street does it politicians do it even more so.

Being homosexual is a capital offense in Iran.I have to agree with others that technically and plotwise the film is below par. The acting is not that bad but the significance of this work lies in the political message. It's often said that Fortuyn despite all his shortcomings woke up the silent minority and that he lead the masses to the ballot box. If all he did was wake up the racists the xenophobes the antiimmigration crowd please let these people go back to sleep again. Another flaw of this movie is the part about the Demonizing the movie suggests that Fortuyn was Demonized and thus leftwing politicians are morally responsible for his murder. This is also known as the 'He Started The Fight When He Hit Me Back'defense or put more succinctly Hypocrisy. The movie supports Fortuyns double standard it's okay to say the most heinous and harsh things about Moslems but when Fortuyn is criticized for that by leftwing politicians and even those from the center all of a sudden they're accused of Demonizing??!".

The only interesting things in the movie were the music in the beginning and the few pieces of news broadcasts and the 'famous' Marcel van Dam piece from 'Het Lagerhuis'.

But I think I should give his movies a second chance since I actually really ended up liking this movie! Think that one of the problems at the time was that this movie felt far too modern at the time for normal Dutch cinema standards. This movie is more slick and stylish looking like am expensive Hollywood production. It also was a movie that came too soon and used a questionable premise. It got made and released just 2 years after the murder of Pim Fortuyn and at the time the movie always got advertised and presented as the story behind the murder while in fact this movie is truly a work of fiction. People were perhaps a bit offended by all of the conspiracy theories presented in this movie as if it was being the Dutch JFK.And it was no big secret that director Theo van Gogh truly admired Pim Fortuyn and some of his ideologies. I think that therefore also some people had a problem with the movie its objectivity but in all truth this all hardly seems an issue nowadays. I had absolutely no problem with this movie and simple watched it as a fictional thriller based on some true events.It's still a bit ridicules to see how everybody seemed to be against Pim Fortuyn in this movie. The police politicians and plenty of other groups and ethnicities all wanted to get rid of Fortuyn and were more than happy to conspire in his murder and cooperate with each other. I was however able to step over this fairly easily simple because the story itself was some good thriller material. Again as a work of fiction this movie is truly great and even somewhat tense so please also just simply look at it that way and as nothing more and nothing less as simply just that.It's a fast paced movie with some great direction and style to it that takes the story too many different places. There are plenty of great thriller developments and characters in this movie that help to keep the movie and its story interesting no matter how far fetched the movie gets at times.The professional approach and style to its story are the foremost reason why this movie works out so well. It doesn't even feel like Dutch movie at all and is more like a well written and well put together American production in which everything feels right and comes together. Story cinematography acting directing all of it combined makes 0605 a more than just good or average thriller.

However and pardon the sarcasm this movie does have a plus side it involves some typical Dutch nonessential nudity. Breasts. Because we can.";

	schema:reviewBody "On mai 6 2002 the nationalist Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn was liquidated by the proenvironment and animal rights activist Volkert van der Graaf.  Some political background information for foreigners Fortuyns'politics was basically a national one. Among the Dutch people it found a wide recognition. But at the time 2002 the elite still associated his nationalism with the German fascism so that Fortuyns' rhetoric restriction of immigration of Muslims etc. caused shock waves within the cosmopolitical elite. . It was a crime that defies any notion of common sense. Later the writer Tomas Ross transformed the event into a fictional story that tried to search for some logic and construct a possible explanation. In his representation van der Graaf is a dangerous psychopath. This helps us to understand. Of course such a person has to be closely observed by the Dutch Intelligence Agency let us say DIA. Is it not amazing that the DIA did not act somehow I love the word amazing. It reminds me of Amazon? According to Ross the DIA was informed about the forthcoming attempt on Fortuyns life but decided not to intervene. For the militaryindustrial complex wanted to further the purchase of the Joint Strike Fighter and the political position of Fortuyn on this subject was unpredictable. By the way Ross tells his story through the eyes of a press photographer. Subsequently Theo van Gogh transformed the book of Ross into a film. As a person van Gogh always tried to be original albeit often in a coarse and sometimes abusive way. However with Fortuyn he failed in his attempt. For the film 0605 is rather ordinary common?. Its characters are credible but not impressive. The shots are pleasant to watch but not exceptional. And I must add that the text is plain and superficial or do I miss something?. Not at all amazing! Do not expect an unforgettable experience. On the other hand he deserves his place on IMDb. For essentially the thing is an agreeable way to kill time. Just make your choice ... and if you feel cheated afterwards don't say that I did not warn you! Get what I mean? Just look at the screen and read my lips! Its main charm is perhaps the inclusion of real news shots about Fortuyn and his political adversaries. Here are some amazing examples of news shots. Referring to Fortuyn the democrat Thom de Graaf compared with German fascism Nearby at a walking distance we have the back premises where Anne Frank ... etc. The leftwing liberal Paul Rosenmller said I think that Fortuyn has cut in his fingers. I hope that the wound will be so deep that the bleeding will last until the election day. The socialdemocrat Ad Melkert said Here he crosses a line that one must not pass. Netherlands wake up! And the socialist Marcel van Dam said You are a liar an instigator. ... You are an extremely inferior person. It is indeed unbelievable. So why did van Gogh decide to produce a mediocre detective film? Certainly his fascination with the person Fortuyn was a motivation. He was himself a controversial Bohemian and most likely saw an equal in Fortuyn. Someone to whom he should respond. Immediately he recognized a shared destiny. Van Gogh was not only a producer but also hosted several talk shows. More than once he invited Fortuyn in his heavenly shows and interviewed him in a relatively friendly manner. He liked his company. However if a producer is so much emotionally involved in his story you would expect a more exciting result. The film is too much downtoearth. It seems like a missed opportunity. So yes I am somewhat disappointed.".

Pim Fortuyn had struck a political goldmine with his antimigrant the Netherlands is full rhetoric and was a riding a wave of popularity which would probably soon give his LPF party a significant representation in legislation if not in execution. The burning question was could the Dutch who love seeing themselves as the beacon of tolerance accept the same dishonorable EU treatment Austria suffered for Jrg Haider's rise to power in 2000? Fortuyn's death eliminated that possibility conveniently. With the benefit of hind side in 2002 Fortuyn was a moderate compared to Geert Wilders of 2010s who has made dexterous use of the Pandora's box already wide open for him. Wilders is less of an outcast in today's European political landscape.Given the backdrop of many suspicious elements surrounding the incident Theo van Gogh's imagination had preferred to point the finger at the international military industrial complex. Well Dutch people are still tolerant and generous but a bit too naive. Lockheed scandal battered Prince Bernard and his Bilderberg buddies are running the show.Technically 0605 is an average film. Acting and casting are problematic. Not betraying Theo van Gogh's stance and reflecting popular mood the film involves plenty of ethnic stereotyping such as the scene with Moroccan youths next to a stack of stolen car radios and the Dutch neighbor woman telling her husband a Turk is voluntarily returning to Turkey call the press!.".

Every scene involving the elves conveys a harmony of which this beauty is a principal feature. They wish to live their lives without having to battle for their freedom to do so. In the context of a fairytale this seems to me to be perfectly legitimate. Olli Saarela the director displays a feeling for the beauty of natural colours almost as good as Franco Zefferelli in the countryside scenes of La Traviata and contrasts them well with the darkness of evil.The film is splendidly supported by the leading actor Allu Tuppurainen and actress Maria Jrvenhelmi who nicely capture the nuances of emotion as both the thematic struggle and their personal relationship follow their twisting course.There are a few musical interludes well woven into the storyline but these do not reach the heights of the visual and narrative aspects of the film.The whole film exudes a fairytale atmosphere and evokes an urge to learn how the story unfolds right up to the very end.

	schema:reviewBody "Of the many films by Peter Handke either alone or with his partner Wim Wenders this may be the most appealing. It is also not recommended for modern viewers accustomed to Hollywood's rhythm it is long slow paced and even difficult to follow sometimes. I strongly recommend viewers to read the book too although they may not find too many additional clues there for Handke's style is to reflect the character's actions rather than their thoughts which by the way should be the perfect cinematic approach. Some people have wasted their time especulating about the woman's reasons to divorce her husband the french essayist Gilles Lipovetsky even said that her lack of good reasons is a sign of modern life's emptiness. In fact we can not say she does not have reasons only we are not allowed to see them on the screen. One might even think that Handke himself did not care to build the woman's inner thoughts and if he did he sure did not share them with us. The movie and the book are about communication between us or at least this is one of its possible readings. Do we really know what is on other people's mind even people real close to us? The answer is no we can only talk of what they tell us or what we might hint but how many times had we been completely wrong about somebody? The movie defies the usual assumption of an omniscient camera the woman would not share her thoughts with the viewers and this leaves us with a sense of discomfort. We feel compelled to find motivations that are just not there. Just the fact that the movie makes us think about it would be enough to qualify it as a masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die linkshndige Frau or The LeftHanded Woman is a West German Germanlanguage film from 1978 so this one will soon have its 40th anniversary. The writer here is Peter Handke who did not only come up with the novel that this is based on but also adapted his work for the screen. Plus this is one of the rare occasions where the prolific writer also acts as director. His most known work as the man in charge. The film received a good deal of awards recognition and you could call it one of the careerdefining films for lead actress Edith Clever who plays the title character. She is supported by more known names like Bruno Ganz Angela Winkler Bernhard Wicki and Rdiger Vogler and even Grard Depardieu appears briefly. This is the story of a man who returns home from abroad but when he does his wife informs him that she intends to leave him together with their son. This is fairly fine and interesting but really not even the core plot for the first half of the film. The rest is basically about how Clever's character deals with the new complicated situation for example how her son annoys her during her work as a single mother. I must say this film has some solid moments but I still found it fairly dragging and way too long for its own good. It is extremely bleak and had many lengths in my opinion which is why I am not convinced by Handke's work as a director. Just as a writer if at all. Maybe Wenders Handke's longtime collaborator could have made something better out of this one. I also am not really impressed by Clever's performance and I would not call it awards or even nominationworthy. I guess she received lots of recognition because she is basically in every scene of the film except the very beginning and has lots of screentime in a movie that comes close to the 2hour mark. I would have preferred more elaboration on Ganz' and Vogler's characters for example. The way it turned out I can not recommend the watch. I have seen many better German films from the 1970s. Thumbs down.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had never heard of Memory till I purchased it on a 4movie Horror Collector's Set DVD from the bargain bin. In addition to Memory the other three movies on the DVD were Tobe Hooper's Mortuary Wages of Sin and Bloody Mary. Mortuary wasn't too bad but the other two films were flatout awful so by the time I sat down to watch Memory I really wasn't expecting much. Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be the best movie on the DVD even though it certainly isn't what I would consider a Horror movie. Memory is a fine mysterysuspense thriller along the lines of a James Patterson story think Kiss the Girls or Along Came A Spider with some occasional horrific overtones.Billy Zane of Titanic stars as Taylor a researcher for a pharmaceutical company who is accidentally exposed to an unknown drug compound while in Brazil for a convention. When he returns home to Boston he begins having disturbing flashbacks of a masked person in a black cloak dark forests and little girls. Disturbed by these visions he begins to do some research on the powder he touched and it turns out that Indian tribes in the Amazon have been using it for thousands of years to see other people's memories through their own eyes. Unfortunately for Taylor the person whose memories he's now sharing happens to be a psycho who's been kidnapping and killing little girls for the past 30 years without being caught. With the help of his artist girlfriend Tricia Helfer of Battlestar Galactica and two family friends the late great Dennis Hopper and AnnMargret he takes it upon himself to unravel the mystery and stop the masked kidnapper before he can claim yet another new victim. As his investigation moves along it seems that the killer also has a connection to Taylor's past that he has never suspected.Though this was obviously a low budget film from a first time writerdirector Memory is a nice looking film and a tight fast moving effort. The veteran cast turns in fine performances all around and the twists and turns of the plot will keep the viewer guessing till its creepy finale in the kidnapper's lair. This is also the coolest set piece in the movie a cavernous building loaded with scary looking mannequins and bizarre scrawlings on the walls. I thought I had the ending figured out early on but as it turns out the filmmakers threw me a curve ball that I wasn't expecting. Horror fans will probably be disappointed by this flick as I said it really doesn't belong on a Horror DVD but fans of psychological thrillers should be pleased with this little known gem.Memory can apparently be found cheaply wherever bargain DVDs are sold so I would recommend checking it out. Just a tip if you happen to buy it on the same Horror Collector's Set that I did skip the other three movies on it and go right to this one.".

	onyx:emotionText "I had never heard of Memory till I purchased it on a 4movie Horror Collector's Set DVD from the bargain bin. In addition to Memory the other three movies on the DVD were Tobe Hooper's Mortuary Wages of Sin and Bloody Mary. Mortuary wasn't too bad but the other two films were flatout awful so by the time I sat down to watch Memory I really wasn't expecting much. Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be the best movie on the DVD even though it certainly isn't what I would consider a Horror movie. Memory is a fine mysterysuspense thriller along the lines of a James Patterson story think Kiss the Girls or Along Came A Spider with some occasional horrific overtones.Billy Zane of Titanic stars as Taylor a researcher for a pharmaceutical company who is accidentally exposed to an unknown drug compound while in Brazil for a convention. When he returns home to Boston he begins having disturbing flashbacks of a masked person in a black cloak dark forests and little girls.

	schema:reviewBody "After accidentally touching an unknown drug Taylor Briggs Billy Zane begins having flashbacks to the life of someone else  a child abductor who has never been caught. Can he put the pieces together and solve the crime before the kidnapper abducts again? I have said in other reviews that Billy Zane really makes a movie. My trust in that statement was fractured after seeing The Mad though I don't blame Zane but once more restored after this picture. He appears in practically every scene. While not the greatest film you'll see it has a very madeforTV or straighttovideo feel about it the plot is interesting and the characters likable. Billy Zane of course helps tremendously by being the evil twin of Ben Affleck.It also helps to have Dennis Hopper play Taylor's foster father Max Lichtenstein although his only purpose in this film is to show up at random times with a few beers and cigars. Oh well he's still better here than he was in Land of the Dead. Max says Hopper is a guy whose wife has died and he's sort of coasting through life a bit like a ghost. But it's a really warm relationship that he has with Taylor  something genuine and real. That's a good quote. And Hopper knows Max if the rumors are true because he spent weeks studying his lines despite being a relatively small character  residents around town would catch him in restaurants reading. Tricia Helfer was also pretty decent though not particularly noteworthy.This was a plotdriven film to be sure. Rated R for language and frightening images there's no nudity or gore here. The frightening images as far as I can tell are just a person in a mask. Nothing really disturbing. There's a photo album that may be thought as disturbing by some. I thought it was deviously brilliant. The plot was excellent because it's not only a thriller but also a mystery a race against time to solve a child abduction case while the lead also must find how he's connected to the kidnapper. There's even submysteries such as how the lead's girlfriend knows about the kidnappings that might leave you guessing. And random shoutout nice use of a cell phone as a flashlight. We've all been there.I give this film credit because I thought I had it figured out before it was half over. My two guesses about certain plots were close but ultimately both wrong. There's a few twists you won't see coming. The big reveal is disappointing only if you're being overly critical as they sort of dump it all on you at once for no reason. But I thought it was okay.I wouldn't have rented this film on my own but having been asked to review it I'm glad I did. If you're scanning the new releases and find this you could do much worse. I saw it with two friends and we all seemed to enjoy it so it caters to a wider range than just myself. And Billy Zane and Dennis Hopper are in it. Worth checking out if you want a story different from your usual serial killers and splatter films.".

With good atmospheric buildup and thankfully minimal gore so that you could at least think about watching it with family. Don't know about you but I'm kinda getting sick and tired of all the SAW and HOSTEL ripoffs.Don't expect much from the actors. For those who've tracked their careers Billy Zane and D Hopper have been collecting paychecks for a while now and they sleepwalk thru their roles here as well. Oldtimer Ann Margret puts in a decent performance tho the role hardly requires acting ability.5 out of 10".

I wish more had been added into this subject regarding the powder and the Indians which would have given this movie more of a smart flash.Regardless I did enjoy the performances of Zane Margaret and Hopper. I was pleasantly surprised to see Zane with more meat on his bones and is becoming a more seasoned actor. Of course from a female perspective I certainly didn't turn away when he took his shirt off! He's still hot. I think that this threesome made a very good complimentary combination together and would like to see other movies similarly cast.The movie didn't really drag too much in my opinion as other comments made here. There are more visuals than explaining dialognarrative which were all very well done. If more dollars could have gone into this movie it would have been a bigger box office seller. The talent was definitely there in the casting directing audio and visuals but stops a wee short in lacking the extra substance such as what I've mentioned ... something more about the genetic memory angle.All in all I liked this movie and recommend the rental fee and enjoy some popcorn.".

The writer director story boarded the whole thing. The production values are very high for their budget.

Once those concepts fall into place the ending becomes clear. This movie needs to be seen a couple of times to catch the subtle clues.This is not guerrilla film making  with a single set and some of the filming done on the cuff. A good example semiguerrilla film making is the film by Darren Aronofsky in 2000 Requium for a Dream that cost 4.5 million 5 years ago. Aronofskys' first nonstudent movie was Pi in 1998.

For a first effort it is not too bad Its not too good either.note a 7 rating in my book is in the fair to good rangeTo its credit there are 3 semimajor stars heading this cast.Billy Zane He still has a good looking body He is a capable actor. AnnMargaret she has been a star for over 45 years  still is pleasing to the eye. also on hand is Dennis Hopper He has been around the sound stages since before GIANT that was 53 yrs ago.He is still a fine actor. I always liked these 3 players This is perhaps the reason I rented this film.It is a 2005 movie  only released on DVD this past March 2 months ago. I do not think it had a theatre release.. This is really a B film worthy of a cofeature on a double bill.The story is somewhat confusing but still interesting It is also a mystery  a mild horror film To its credit IT IS NOT A GOREFEST.Interesting camerawork with a good score It runs a fast 98 minutes however it still could have been a bit shorter.I must mention 2 of the other players.Tracy Helfer from TV Battlestar Gallatica. She is pretty to look at  may be a good actress in time.All films of this type have a comic relief character who is the stars sidekick. His name is Terry Chen. A ChineseAmerican actor with a great smile  good comic timing thankfully he is not a stereotype like they used to be He plays a Doctor friend of our hero who happens to have a great comic wit. I want to see more films he is in.Note this is not a really good movie BUT its is not a bad one I was not too surprised who the villain was.note I will say this it is not the first person you may think it is.Ratinss 12 out of 4 78 points OUT of 100 IMDb 7  out of 100".

I watched this for the first time on DVD and also enjoyed the Making of segment of the special features. Davlin and Badalucco are fantastic storytellers and movie makers.

I think this is a movie worth seeing if you like movies that have various twist and huge mysteries.

	schema:reviewBody "Got to see the movie bc the director use to date my cousin. Even though that relationship didn't turn out well the movie was still pretty damn good! I'm a big fan of Battlestar Galatica and Trish Helfer is smoking hot! I'd been a big fan of her's since her Maxim spread and YOU KNOW I bought last month's playboy too. Only knock is that for some stupid reason she dies her hair jet black for this movie but she's still smoking hot! And there's a strip poker scene too! So the movie starts out kind of crazy like a TV medical drama or csi or something. Some kid gets coked up on mysterious amazonian powder turns him all red and crap then ends up half dead in a hospital in Brazil. Then freaking Cal from Titanic shows up Billy Zane although his character's name is Taylor. So CalTaylorBilly is a medical research dude trying to cure Parkinson's or whatever the name of that disease that kills little old ladies and presidents. He just happens to be in town for a swinging convention of Medical researchers and is an expert on amazonian powders or something. And Taylor's sidekick is the rolling stone publisher guy from Almost Famous which is a bad ass movie. Terry Chen.So Taylor and his partner take some powder home for testing but Taylor is a dumb mofo and accidentally gets some on his hands then back at the hotel he has some weird drug trip on the stuff and has a flashback of a serial killer. There's a really cool scene where Taylors' hotel bathroom explodes with water.OK flashforward to Six the sex robot Trish Helfer's character meets Taylor when he goes back to Boston and attends an art show evidently that's where the hot maxim chicks hang out. Eventually she becomes Taylor's hot sex robot too.Taylor keeps having these drug trips sees serial killer and then realizes it could be one of his parents one of his parents memories but his mom is in a coma or something and his dad is dead so he doesn't know which one is a serial killer.Taylor investigates Trish Six Helfer helps actually is kind part of the serial killer's life and in the end it all turns out to be some screwed up twisted discovery about Taylor's true identity. I mean that in a good way a cool way! So if this flick ever sees a movie screen I'd definitely recommend it. In fact my cousin was probably pretty stupid from dumping the director guy bc he'll probably be pretty rich. I'm also betting she wrote the bad!bad!bad! review too.peace... mumblogger111.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Shoot the Pianist' opens with the insides of a playing piano the inner machinations of a musical instrument.  This image points to the film's ambiguity.  it says that this film will similarly uncover the insides heart soul of a man who gives nothing away on the surface.  it will suggest that his insides are like the piano's insides the the only way he can express what's buried inside of him is through pianoplaying  this is what gives the film its emotional pull.  but it also suggests that Charlie Koller's fatal emotional timidity has warped or deadened that soul made it a mere mechanism alive only in a technical sense.  More objectively it amounts to a manifesto for Truffaut's intentions with the film the way he will turn the gangster genre inside out a genre he confessed to not really liking.Although Truffaut would go on to make selfconscious and superficial tributes to his hero e.g. 'La Peau Douce' 'The Bride Wore Black' 'Shoot the Pianist' is his most Hitchcockian film.  Most obviously it is a reworking of 'Vertigo' the story of a homme fatal Koller  black widower? who kills two women because he couldn't say the right thing because he behaved like a man should rather than the way he really feels.  Lena is in effect a reincarnation of his dead wife a woman who wants to reinstate his 'original' identity.  Like Scottie Ferguson Charlie is a man paralysed by memory shellshocked by his experiences with an elusive love that could so easily have been his.  But again like 'Vertigo' 'Pianist' is the study of masculine identity and its dissolution.  When we first see Charlie he is literally in a scrapheap getting dressed in front of a mirror.  This mirror motif recurs throughout and with it the question who is Charlie Koller?  The farmboy sibling of gangsters the renowned pianist the backroom tinkler the father to his young brother the man who desires but cannot ask who keeps destructively pulling back?  Throughout the real 'man' is deluged by different names images posters paintings stories etc. about himself his own personality is divided by the talks he conducts with himself.  Even the heartbreaking flashback sequence about his past is related to him by someone else.  In the fear of losing his identity of giving himself in union Charlie loses everything.But 'Pianist' is also reminiscent of early British Hitchcock films like 'The 39 Steps' and 'Young and Innocent' in its playful irreverence with genre.  David Thomson has said it was a film Laurence Sterne might have made and like 'Tristam Shandy' like those Hitchcock movies the main genre narrative is frequently broken off by digressions and bits of business.  The film plunges us in media res in the gangster genre a man being chased in the obscurity.  He bangs into a lamppost and is helped by a passerby.  They start talking about marriage.  This is emblematic of the film as a whole  a gangster film that keeps stopping to talk about love women family music the past etc.  When the genre kicks in again  Chico gangster name yes but Marx Brother too rushes into his brother's bar the tension is somewhat undermined by the comedy barroom singer bouncing to the cymbals.  When Charlie and Lena are kidnapped by the two hoods a fraught situation turns into an hilarious banter about women and dirty old men.  the most frightening sequence  the abduction of young Fido  provokes the funniest scene where captor and captive debate the authenticity of the former's Japanese metal scarf.But the film works the other way too when the comic unexpectedly flashes into the tragic.  In an early scene Charlie agonises to himself about the proper etiquette to be used in handling Lena  this is a touching sad scene but full of the comedy of embarrassment.  Suddenly having dithered so long Charlie realises she's gone.  The scrunched pain on his face is devastating.'Pianist' is my favourite film.  For Charles Aznavour's performance the embodiment of shy timidity leading to emotional paralysis and my altar ego. For the Godardian style mixing abrupt immediate handheld location shooting and natural sound excitement with a grasp of miseenscene worthy of the great 1950s melodramatists the framing cutting characters off from one another trapping them in their decor or the elaborate Ophulsian camerawork such as the 'Le Plaisir' gliding outside the bar the circular narrative that sees continuity tragically affirmed in the shape of the new waitress.  'Pianist' couldn't have been made without Melville's 'Bob le Flambeur' and its flippancy and humanising of genre but the influence of this on Cassavetes Penn Scorcese etc. was immense for its generosity to all its characters showing despite Eustache that a good woman can be a maman and putain.  For the comic chutzpah the dazzling abduction scene the triptych revealing the boss's betrayal the clumsy murder the wonderfully bumbling hoods Fido's Hawksian little dance.  For Truffaut's concern with time and decay and art.  For the haunting scene with the cello girl.  For the music fulfilling Noel Coward's dictum about the potency of cheap music giving this short strange movie its generous soul a film that so humanely departs from genre it makes the generic climax grotesque a DW Griffith nightmare in blinding white.".

	schema:headline " French gangster thriller that hits all the right notes";
	schema:reviewBody "Shoot the Pianist is Francois Truffaut's attempt at mirroring the greatness of the classic gangster films. And suffice to say it is a very nice attempt indeed. The film follows Charlie Kohler a simple barside piano player. Charlie's life takes a turn for the more exciting one day when his brother turns up at the bar telling his brother that a couple of gangsters that he and his other brother cheated out of their side of the loot from a job that the four did together are after him. Charlie also has a secret admirer Lena a barmaid at the bar he works in. Now this once simple piano player has gone from a quiet life at a piano to having to deal with gangsters his brothers and a new love interest. But wait...there's more is Charlie all that he seems? Is he merely a simple piano player? That's what makes this film great it's never black and white if you'll excuse the pun and it is always ready to throw in another plot turn to keep you guessing.After the universally acclaimed The 400 Blows Francois Truffaut had his work cut out for his next movie. Many will disagree but I actually think he surpassed it. The 400 Blows is undoubtedly a more important work but this film hits more of the right notes and is very much more enjoyable. The cast is absolutely flawless throughout Charles Aznavour stars in the lead role. He gets his characterization spot on his melancholy comes naturally and is believable throughout. Marie Debois and Nicole Berger star alongside Aznavour and although they are more in the background they still manage to impress. There is also a role here for Michle Mercier whom you may remember from the Mario Bava masterpiece Black Sabbath. Truffaut's cinematography is clean and crisp and the film is an aesthetic treat throughout. Despite being nearly 45 years old the film also manages to retain a feeling of freshness and that's something that not all crime thrillers of today can do after 4 years let alone 45. Truffaut has also very obviously got an astute sense of humour  there's one part of the film involving one of the gangster's mother's dropping dead that made me laugh out loud. Let it never be said that the French can't be funnyThe film features many anecdotes that ring true. My personal favourite is when Lena says that what you do today becomes a part of you tomorrow. It's simple but very astute. Another good one is when one of the gangsters talks about all the lovely gadgets he has and after listing them all he finishes with I'm bored. Truffaut obviously knows that material goods aren't what make people happy and this film presents a rather amusing way of showing that. However despite these and several other anecdotes the film doesn't appear to have a defining point which lessens its impact somewhat. Overall however Shoot the Pianist is a lovely little film that shouldn't be missed by anyone that professes to like gangster movies. It's amusing has some points to make and its flawlessly acted and directed. Highest recommendations for this one.".

	schema:headline " One of Truffaut's best";
	schema:reviewBody "Franois Truffaut's second feature Tirez sur le pianiste is a deliberately wild and chaotic satire of the American gangster pictures of the 1930s '40s and '50s. Truffaut tried to make Tirez sur le pianiste or Shoot the Pianist the complete opposite of his first picture The 400 Blows doing away with the sentimentality of the predecessor and making his second feature far more vicious nonlinear and occasionally quite funny.Based off of a pulp novel by David Goodis the movie is about a oncefamous piano player Charles Aznavour who gives up looking for the reason his wife left him and now plays piano in a rundown Paris bar where he falls for a waitress and must overcome his natural shyness in order to express his love for her. Unfortunately his brother gets him involved in a gangland feud which gives the story an unnecessary but welcomed edge to the romance.There are some highly amusing scenes such as when Charles and his soontobegirlfriend walk down a Paris sidewalk and he contemplates what to say do and how to act without offending her or making a fool out of himself. We hear Charles' neurotic thoughts in voiceover  an effect now overused in cinema but back in 1960 very new. It wasn't until the intrusion of Woody Allen comedies such as Annie Hall that sporadic firstperson narratives became popular  in the noir movies of the earlier decades voiceovers were sometimes used by narrators such as in the cult classic Detour but never in such a way as Shoot the Pianist's. It's one of the best scenes in the movie and a great way of expressing the innerworkings of Charles the character.Shoot the Pianist's chaotic structure confused and overwhelmed many audiences when the film was released in 1960. Its content violence nudity etc. was not as welcomed by audiences as it is now and as a result the film was a financial and critical failure. The humor was not appreciated the insightful look at a French Everyman was not even noticed  it was ruled out as a dud and that's all that mattered to anyone.Over the years it has picked up a rather small cult following and fans of Truffaut's films have declared it to be one of his best pictures. Looking back now in light of such recent gangster genre hybrids such as Reservoir Dogs and Lock Stock  Two Smoking Barrels Truffaut's movie not only seems more understandable but far ahead of its time. In relation to Reservoir Dogs it contains the same sort of standard everyday nonchalance in accordance with gangsters  while it contains the narrative flow of Guy Ritchie's British gangster cult hit.Regardless of how brilliant Shoot the Pianist seems forty years later Truffaut was scarred by the negative press surrounding his second feature and never made another movie as daring so to speak or more likely downright fun as Tirez sur le pianiste. It's a very amusing movie and it is one of the few 1960s films that doesn't seem dated compared to the filmmaking standards of modernday Hollywood. The performances are flawless the characters likable and realistic the movie overall highly enjoyable and worth seeing more than just once. It is sadly one of Truffaut's most underrated movies although hopefully in another forty years it will only be all the more appreciated for its qualities.55".

	schema:reviewBody "Francois Truffaut was a film critic for the magazine Cahiers du cinma. He was disenchanted with what he saw as a lack of originality and honesty in contemporary cinema. He developed the theory of the auteur in cinema  an idiosyncratic force such as his hero Hitchcock rather than a 'civil servant of the cinema'.His motivation for entering the cinema was to make films which he and others like him wanted to see and which then didn't exist. Cinema with breadth and imagination which took risks and broke rules. The zest and vitality of his vision is still evident so many years on.After his impeccable full length debut Les Quatre Cents Coups aka The 400 Blows which was a slice of life  coming of age tale Truffaut took a completely different subject matter for this second feature. The source novel is 'Down There' typical US pulp fiction by the little known David Goodis. Its a tale of crime set in seedy locations with a graceless linear plot. Obviously its the way the filmmakers use this source that makes Tirez Sur Le Pianiste the film it is.Charles Aznavour a mainstream celebrity in France is the bizarre but perfect choice for the lead role of Charlie Kohler. His passive indifferent demeanour makes him an antihero of a different kind to Cagney or Brando  one who is ineffective in either solving or preventing crime. This minor cinematic tradition I see as continuing with John Klute in Klute 1971 Marlowe in The Long Goodbye 1973 reaching its comical apex with The Dude in The Big Lebowski 1998.Not in fact that Charlie has to solve any crimes. He is simply out to save his skin  and those of his brothers. His life is in danger throughout the film yet he is more preoccupied with whether or not he should take the arm of the attractive waitress Lena Marie Dubois from the dive where he plays the piano as he walks her home in a scene that is a perfect marriage of its imagery and internal monologue. It is this kind of juxtaposition of themes threat to life and romantic shyness which makes this film such compelling and unpredictable viewing.The film opens with a charming conversation about the secrets of a happy marriage spoken by a character we never see again who simply runs into Charlie's brother Chico Albert Rmy  who is the catalyst for the 'plot'. The throwaway conversations are really more important to the creative spirit of the film than any of the plot's major concerns. This trend continues with the characters of Ernest and Momo the pursuing heavies. Though evidently dangerous men they speak tangentially on a range of subjects mostly women though which cannot help but remind a modern audience of Tarantino's hit men in Pulp Fiction. Indeed much of what I said about Truffaut  how he was compelled to make rulechanging cinema that he and others wanted to see  could of course equally be applied to Tarantino.The centrepiece of the film goes back to Charlie' past where he was a classical concert pianist. This beautiful vignette explains to us why Charlie is in the pits now. Nicole Berger as Thrse Saroyan Charlie's wife absolutely owns this part of the film. This section also features the celebrated and beautiful sequence where the camera chooses to follow a female violinist from the door of an apartment and out into the courtyard. Why? Just for the sake of artistic freedom it seems.As well as Aznavour and Berger the casting is uniformly perfect. Claude Mansard and Daniel Boulanger as the waffling heavies Marie Dubois as the sweet maternal young waitress Lna Michle Mercier as a tart with a heart with a body to die for bringing the total of female 'leads' to three! Serge Davri and Catherine Lutz as Charlie's antagonistic and ultimately tragic employers. The obscure threesome the latter two brothers have their only major film roles here of Albert Rmy JeanJacques Aslanian and the young Richard Kanayan are brilliantly effective as Charlie's brothers all of whom display varying degrees of the criminal element  the 'curse' of Charlie and his family. Early on in the film there is also a terrifically amusing song complete with karaokestyle lyrics performed by Boby Lapointe a reallife Parisian entertainer.For all its wealth of ideas though this is generally not a pacey movie. Its pace is as laidback as Charlie himself at times. But with patience this will reward the audience with all kinds of unexpected delights.".

There are loads of little comic moments that reminded me of the modern British comedies  stuff like Snatch and Shaun of the Dead  that I love.

It's not the relatively lighthearted depression of Godard's films it's fullfledged tragedy. However the combination of drama and comedy doesn't always mesh well as it rarely does for me and the characters seem too shortchanged to justify such an ending.

	schema:reviewBody "The opening scene is of a man running in dark streets. We only hear his steps and the menacing mechanical sound of traffic which we assume to be made by the pursuer. He collides with a post and is stunned. A man carrying a bouquet of flowers helps him to his feet. As they walk the man is expansive and briefly describes the course of his relationship with his wife from simple selfish lust leading to marriage and only later leading to true love. The man excuses himself turning towards his home and in an instant the original victim returns to his role as prey to some allpervasive inhuman pursuer.For me this is Truffaut the viewer identifying with the victim for a few moments being safe in the domestic harmony of the man only to be launched anew into the role of the hopeless quarry. The talkative man's recognition of his dependence on his wife contrasts with a later scene in a car where the two gangsters reveal highly cynical attitudes towards women. The irony is that their cynicism is capped by Charlie Edward who quotes his father as saying when you've seen one woman you've seen them all. It is significant how timid and respectful he is when daring to interrupt the macho diatribe of the two hoods. With this one statement we have the background to the whole story. Big brother Chico the prey needs help from Eddy who is very reluctant to be drawn in but family ties prove too strong. We see Chico as being a demandingselfish brute and can guess he takes after his father. We also guess where Eddy's timidity originates. In the dialogue between Eddy and the brutish barowner who is jealous of Eddy's attractiveness to the waitress Lena Eddy even offers to leave. When the barowner tells Eddy he is scared Eddy repeats the phrase playing with it as if it were a new flavour. This seems to be the ultimate in humility or humiliation yet Eddy respectfully almost accepts it as advice. This short conversation suggests a life of victimisation from father and big brother. Yet most touching of all is that his submission does not mask underlying contempt Eddy still cares for the barowner as he does for his brother. Later when the two are collapsed in the alley after a struggle Eddy tosses aside his advantage of the knife and is then tricked by the barowner who appears to be offering to make peace with a manly hug but then attempts to strangle Eddy.In his relations with Lena Therese and Clarisse we witness tenderness spontaneity playfulness and trust. I don't know if it's my imagination but these scenes seem to have brighter lighting. With each woman there is a different mood. For instance those involving Therese are all flashbacks and seem to involve more classical static camerawork lending an appropriate quality of distance. With Clarisse the prostitute there is bawdy but innocent humour and no physical embarrassment while with Lena there is adolescent awkwardness reminiscent of Woody Allen followed by such delicate romantic scenes of physical discovery.There are unexpected cameos such as Boby Lapointe in the bar singing Framboises and Fido Eddy's kid brother being fascinated by the two gangsters who have kidnapped him. The final moment of the film ignores the outcome of the feud between gangsters and brothers. We are only concerned with Lena.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shoot The Piano Player is an enormously entertaining movie that utilises a variety of different styles moods and sudden changes of pace to tell the story of a piano player whose attempts to achieve contentment in obscurity are thwarted by the actions of his criminal brother. This was Francois Truffaut's second movie and at the time of its making he was clearly on a creative high as what's seen on screen looks like the delirious outpourings of a mind that was totally passionate about filmmaking and also brimming over with ideas.Truffaut's love of movies started at an early age and provided him with some respite from his very troubled childhood. As a young man he like most of the well known New Wave directors became a contributor to the film journal Cahiers du Cinema and together they advocated a more informal approach to filmmaking with greater use being made of footage that was shot outside of the studios. The type of films that had captivated the young Truffaut were predominantly American Bmovies and it was because of his great respect and affection for them that he made Shoot The Piano Player.Charlie Kohler Charles Aznavour is a pianist in a small but lively Parisian bar who finds that his regular routine is thrown into chaos when his older brother Chico Albert Remy seeks his help because he's being pursued by a couple of gangsters. It transpires that Chico and another brother Richard JeanJacques Aslanian had worked together with Momo Claude Mansard and Ernest Daniel Boulanger on a heist but had double crossed them when they took off with most of the loot.Charlie leads a quiet life looking after his youngest brother Fido Richard Kanayan and is helped in this by his good natured neighbour Clarisse Michelle Mercier who's a prostitute and also occasionally his mistress. Helping Chico leads to trouble for Charlie when he and his girlfriend Lena Marie Dubois get kidnapped at gunpoint by Momo and Ernest but fortunately they manage to escape when Ernest's bad driving leads to him being stopped by the police.Lena is a waitress at the bar where Charlie works and tells him that she knows about his past. Charlie had been a very successful concert pianist known by his real name Edouard Saroyan but had given up his career after his wife Therese Nicole Berger had committed suicide. Tragically she had taken her own life because she'd confessed to Charlie that the first big break in his career had come as a result of her agreeing to sleep with his impresario. Charlie's inability to come to terms with what she'd done had been more than she could bear.After Charlie kills his boss in selfdefence trouble continues to follow him until events ultimately reach a climax during a shootout in a countryside location.Charlie is a tragic and sensitive character who's a victim of fate. Not only had his career which had elevated him to a new level of success ended suddenly with the result that he'd ended up back in the type of environment that he'd originally emerged from but also his love affairs with Therese and Lena both ended in tragedy and heartbreak.There's a great deal that's melancholic and poignant about Charlie's story but the way in which it's told is often comical irreverent and disconcerting because of the use of unorthodox styles of editing and pacing. This juxtaposition of humour and pathos could be regarded as a reflection of the normal balance of life which often leads to humorous things happening at times of great sadness or it could simply be what happens when someone who's so intoxicated by the possibilities of his art form gives his creativity free rein.The quality of the acting in this movie is consistently good but Charles Aznavour's performance is positively exceptional. His facial expressions and body language are perfect and convey Charlie's vulnerability and innate sadness so well that it would be hard to imagine anyone else being able to improve on what he achieved in this role.".

All of this serves to further undermine the traditional domination of stagebound realist films that had dominated French cinema throughout the 1950s.Charles Aznavour performs well in the lead role of the pianist with the broken spirit. As another reviewer points out the film begins with a closeup of the inner workings of his piano reflecting the fact that the film will attempt to show the innerworkings of his heart. Indeed it is this that is the preoccupation of all the long dialogues throughout the film as his psyche is explored even by the gangsters who abduct him and in the early voiceovers.He is a character too timid to have a voice of his own it is the piano that provides him with his boldness to entertain. Indeed Aznavour's timid and wonderfully human antihero is an extremely welcome antidote to the macho posturing still found in Hollywood films to this very day. He is real and audiences can readily relate to him. Indeed the centrepiece of the film the flashback sequence is moving as it details his fall from grace after his struggle to break away from his family and overcome the bad reputation of his surname.The bumbling but ultimately murderous gangsters also subvert notions that people with guns are in some way heroic  they are shown to be stupid fools inept but brutally dangerous.As in Godard's Breathless there are small attacks on American consumerism throughout yet at the same time this film embraces aspects of the noir style. Indeed it was originally based on a pulp novel though it far transcends these genre writing origins to become a unique high culture work of film art.Ultimately this film along with Breathless Band a Part and Jules et Jim firm established the nouvelle vague movement as a uniquely French phenomenon that defined the 1960s. Subversive innovative and a thorough rejection of the nowstagnant older style of studio filmmaking it remains a unique fresh vision to this day. Highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " Meh...";
	schema:reviewBody "Franois Truffaut the father of the auteur theory expressed revolutionary ideas about cinema and his theories about growth of cinema and his ideas that stretched cinema to a true art form played a major role in cinemas development today. Unfortunately I just can't seem to find the translation of his ideas into his own films. Shoot the Piano Player is about a man named Charlie Kohler who plays piano in a small bar. He used to be a huge piano virtuoso until he became too involved with his brothers who are part of the gangster world. And now he can't escape their world as much as he wants to. After one of his brothers comes to his bar looking for refuge Charlie whose real name is actually Edouard a name he gave up after leaving his professional piano playing days is reluctantly drawn back into his family's business.Overall Shoot the Piano Player was a pretty dull experience. There are certain things you can give it credit on. It tells an original story with characters that don't fall into particular stereotypes. The dialouge is witty and fluid although I do have some issues with it. But I'll get to that in a second. I want to keep from sounding like I hated this film or that it is a bad film because both of those are false. I didn't hate this film because it isn't a bad film and it's not a bad film because Truffaut really does strive for something original here. I suppose that for the time it probably was pretty original but today I'm not very impressed by any of it and I hate to admit it but it sort of bored me. Maybe it is all just personal issues of mine but for whatever reason I was never enthralled by the story here. I followed it just fine but I was never moved by it and I never felt the motivation or obligation to invest much interest in the story as much as I felt I should have been able to. Perhaps I just look for too much in a film and want to be emotionally gripped in every film I watch. But I don't want this review to devolve into a reflection of my own movie watching habits so I'll move on.Truffaut boasts a keen understanding of the human psyche and human condition in all of his films. He strives to include an abundance of comments on sociology in his dialouge and that brings me back to the issue I mentioned earlier. There are odd moments when I start to feel like Truffaut is just throwing a line into the story to make some point about the human psyche. It seems like many of his scenarios are too well set up and only serve as a means to reflect on humanity. I give him kudos for addressing the thing which mystifies us all and is the subject of so many movies but I just feel like the execution of some of his ideas fall flat. A lot of other films do this and probably more blatantly than Truffaut yet I guess I don't notice the blatancy as much as in a Truffaut film because when I think of Truffaut I think of psychology and his theories relating back to auteurs. It's a weird idea that probably makes zero sense but that's the best I can explain it.So I'm not sure how much of this review has actually been about Shoot the Piano Player so I apologize. But I suppose it goes to show how I was only able to become mildly interested in this film. There isn't a whole lot that grabbed my attention here thus I just don't have a ton to say about this movie. It isn't a bad film but to me it wasn't memorable and I don't plan on seeing it again.".

	onyx:emotionText "Franois Truffaut the father of the auteur theory expressed revolutionary ideas about cinema and his theories about growth of cinema and his ideas that stretched cinema to a true art form played a major role in cinemas development today. Unfortunately I just can't seem to find the translation of his ideas into his own films. Shoot the Piano Player is about a man named Charlie Kohler who plays piano in a small bar. He used to be a huge piano virtuoso until he became too involved with his brothers who are part of the gangster world. And now he can't escape their world as much as he wants to. After one of his brothers comes to his bar looking for refuge Charlie whose real name is actually Edouard a name he gave up after leaving his professional piano playing days is reluctantly drawn back into his family's business.Overall Shoot the Piano Player was a pretty dull experience. There are certain things you can give it credit on. It tells an original story with characters that don't fall into particular stereotypes. The dialouge is witty and fluid although I do have some issues with it. But I'll get to that in a second. I want to keep from sounding like I hated this film or that it is a bad film because both of those are false. I didn't hate this film because it isn't a bad film and it's not a bad film because Truffaut really does strive for something original here.

	schema:reviewBody "Truffaut introduced himself with 'The 400 Blows' a film of very good taste. His 2nd effort 'Tirez sur le pianiste' isn't a let down quite the contrary it's a generally quite enjoyable film that tells the story of a piano player in trouble.This interesting french film is a clever combination of comedy drama crime thriller and suspense. It approaches the policial genre as well as the atmosphere sometimes approaches darkness even the noir genre. Nevertheless the levels of action are very modest. But I'm not the hungry for action type so that fact doesn't bother me. Another thing is that there isn't one truly tense scene even in the scenes which are supposed to be tense. Even the bad guys are not intrinsically evil enough to be much of a problem and therefore they're not really scary or intimidating.It wouldn't be far from the truth claiming that another achievement is how this displays humor in less than good circumstances. For example there is a scene when Charlie and Lna are being kidnapped by the bad guys and Charlie says a funny line about women If you've seen one you've seen them all  and they all erupt into laughter. Even I laugh out loud with that line even more so considering it is so true. The piano music by the talented musician Georges Delerue is relaxing to hear it's like poetry for the soul. Cinematography is great and obeys to the principles of liberty so characteristic of Monsieur Truffaut.Frankly speaking I think all of the actors are great in this. And I mean all. Charles Aznavour a talented singer is just as interesting as an actor as his performance proves. Albert Rmy is again great. Richard Kanayan has a bigger role here as Fido Saroyan but still far from being a big role. Nevertheless he is hilarious. That kid had charisma and talent. His big floppy hair his weird raspy voice his dancewalk style his lips's movement the fact that the actor was quirky and hyperactive... all of that made him unique and hilarious.The bad guys are funny and pretty cool for bad guys and they're well played by the actors Claude Mansard as Momo and Daniel Boulanger as Ernest. As for the beautiful women Marie Dubois as Lna and Michle Mercier as Clarisse I also like the way they play their roles.All in all great movie. Only its ending is somewhat rushed and ambiguous although satisfying aside the fact that the girl gets shot.Title in Portugal 'Disparem sobre o pianista'.".

Shoot the Piano Player is worth smiles too. It's a clever film playful at times even funny. More than anything however it defies categorization.

It's the story of Charlie Koller Charles Aznavour a piano player in a Paris dive who used to be Eduoard Saroyan a famous pianist whose wife committed suicide. Truffaut says the movie is a film about a shy man. Charlie is the kind of shy man who cannot bring himself to touch the hand of a woman he wants.

Charlie thanks to his brothers finds himself in a gangland underworld where doublecrossing is going to lead to a shootout in the snow. Some say Shoot the Piano Player is an homage to American gangster films. Perhaps it is but I challenge anyone to spend much time considering this possibility while watching the movie.

We leave him where we met him playing piano in a Paris dive. Charles Aznavour a diminutive man with a hangdog look plays Charlie perfectly. Aznavour is probably better known in the U.

Aznavour lets us see into Charlie's soul with few words. It's a marvelous performance that left me saddened by Charlie but liking him.".

And Charlie is rescued from there by Thrse Saroyan. Thrse takes him on adventures where he can't play the piano when ecstasy approaches. It's no coincidence that in Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets the main character Charlie is caught up in alcohol and the characters around him that he is supposed to be like and then is saved by a girl named Thrse. Although it was a very famous story even before the film was released.So I'm not going to go into detail with the story except say most of the film is an homage to American cinema and is very French new wave. I will say this the closing shot is again a closeup shot of a piano but it fades out to another closeup of Charlies face this shows him breaking away from the piano. Thrse has saved him. The soundtrack is probably one of my favorites it is lowkey a piano but very angelic much like Charlie much like Truffaut.".

	schema:headline " Hilarious and tragic realistic and cinematic  an outstanding film thriving on contradictions";
	schema:reviewBody "The term 'ahead of its time' remains in constant danger of becoming redundant through overuse until examples such as maverick director Franois Truffaut's Shoot the Piano Player come to mind. Initially dismissed as a selfindulgent bewildering artistic failure come 30 years later techniques pioneered by Truffaut's film have become staples of modern independent cinema particularly in the works of directors Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie. Yet Truffaut's film regarded on retrospect remains an entirely different animal and by no means suffers by comparison to films following its example. From the opening shot of a piano being played from the inside Shoot the Piano Player never loses its riveting fascinating and crucially different footing generating a piece of cinema just as adept at paying homage to the Marx Brothers as the mob films and romantic melodramas it overtly satirises. Despite being greeted with scorn and derision due to being allegedly inaccessible nonlinear and incomprehensible Truffaut's film is in the end a deceptively straightforward piece of work. With only a single clearly articulated flashback disrupting the flow of the narrative it remains in the midst of its protective parodic shell an achingly heartfelt story about a man both consumed and haunted by his sense of self artistic potential and family and their potential to destroy everything meaningful in his life. Yet the fact that such a seemingly dour emotional centerpiece is housed in what is ultimately an incredibly funny lighthearted and charming film is testament to the chaotic imbalances in tone which should have torn the film apart but instead make it a remarkable cocktail of cinematic experimentation. Truffaut's film thrives on contrasts between the very real and the very cinematic between delightful lighthearted hilarity and satire one of the most hilarious nude scenes in film history gleefully pokes at the fourth wall and devastating resonant emotional pain. It is a film which delights in the nature of its own construction rather than attempting to mask it. Infamously shot guerrilla style on a shoestring budget while writing the script and determining the course of the narrative on the go rather than struggling to craft a tonally cohesive work Truffaut allows his film to take on the abrupt aboutfaces its production faced. This open approach makes the violent contrasts in tone and emotion far more genuine than a more contrived and uniform work could ever deliver  the tragedy is made all the more poignant when contrasted with nonsensical cheerfulness and wry satire and vice versa. But Truffaut's visionary technical work can similarly not be ignored. Making sumptuous use of looming long shots uncomfortable closeups and rapid zooms coupled with its crisp black and white photography the film creates a unique visual aesthetic often copied but never bettered. Similarly as the title would suggest the film's music plays an essential role present to the point of almost becoming a character itself within the film. In many ways the film's music is a direct representation of the film's deliberate dismantling of the pretensions and clichs of the American films it both mocks and pays tribute to  a tense chase sequence is interrupted by a nonsensical song number comparing women's body parts to various fruits. Comical banter is accompanied by sombre moody musical strains better fitted to melodramatic exchanges. The music appears emblematic of Truffaut's winking influence throughout constantly encouraging the viewer to engage with the film artistically yet never at the expense of entertainment. The film is made all the more timeless through its sublime performances creating real honest and effortlessly lovable characters which instead of caving to Hollywood sap and clich gleefully subvert it. Charles Aznavour proves a delightful mirror image of the archetypal hardboiled film noir protagonist his sad haunted eyes and quick witted voiceover announcing the quiet humanity he attempts to keep hidden underneath a more grim facade of how he believes a man should act. Marie Dubois is equally superb a female lead bubbling with genuine warmth and shining charisma. Albert Rmy makes the titular pianist's washed up failure of a brother impossible to dislike through a charming grounded performance and Nicole Berger simmers with magnetic pathos and muted warmth as the pianist's mysterious first wife. Finally as the most incongruous figures in the film Daniel Boulanger and Claude Mansard are bizarrely hilarious as bumbling heavies Ernest and Momo keeping their menace carefully concealed behind a veneer of sidesplitting oneliners physical comedy and inane dialogue which clearly proved inspirational for Tarantino's ruminating thugs in Pulp Fiction. However more than anything else the film pulses with an unquenchable glow of fun and invention which proves consistently infectious a noteworthy debunking of the clich than all artistically viable films need be sombre slow and deliberate. As experimental as it is Truffaut's film breaks all of its grounds for the sake of fun making it one of the most resonant and accessible films of the French New Wave period as well as nearly impossible not to fall for.

Initially dismissed as a selfindulgent bewildering artistic failure come 30 years later techniques pioneered by Truffaut's film have become staples of modern independent cinema particularly in the works of directors Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie. Yet Truffaut's film regarded on retrospect remains an entirely different animal and by no means suffers by comparison to films following its example. From the opening shot of a piano being played from the inside Shoot the Piano Player never loses its riveting fascinating and crucially different footing generating a piece of cinema just as adept at paying homage to the Marx Brothers as the mob films and romantic melodramas it overtly satirises. Despite being greeted with scorn and derision due to being allegedly inaccessible nonlinear and incomprehensible Truffaut's film is in the end a deceptively straightforward piece of work. With only a single clearly articulated flashback disrupting the flow of the narrative it remains in the midst of its protective parodic shell an achingly heartfelt story about a man both consumed and haunted by his sense of self artistic potential and family and their potential to destroy everything meaningful in his life. Yet the fact that such a seemingly dour emotional centerpiece is housed in what is ultimately an incredibly funny lighthearted and charming film is testament to the chaotic imbalances in tone which should have torn the film apart but instead make it a remarkable cocktail of cinematic experimentation. Truffaut's film thrives on contrasts between the very real and the very cinematic between delightful lighthearted hilarity and satire one of the most hilarious nude scenes in film history gleefully pokes at the fourth wall and devastating resonant emotional pain. It is a film which delights in the nature of its own construction rather than attempting to mask it. Infamously shot guerrilla style on a shoestring budget while writing the script and determining the course of the narrative on the go rather than struggling to craft a tonally cohesive work Truffaut allows his film to take on the abrupt aboutfaces its production faced. This open approach makes the violent contrasts in tone and emotion far more genuine than a more contrived and uniform work could ever deliver  the tragedy is made all the more poignant when contrasted with nonsensical cheerfulness and wry satire and vice versa. But Truffaut's visionary technical work can similarly not be ignored. Making sumptuous use of looming long shots uncomfortable closeups and rapid zooms coupled with its crisp black and white photography the film creates a unique visual aesthetic often copied but never bettered. Similarly as the title would suggest the film's music plays an essential role present to the point of almost becoming a character itself within the film. In many ways the film's music is a direct representation of the film's deliberate dismantling of the pretensions and clichs of the American films it both mocks and pays tribute to  a tense chase sequence is interrupted by a nonsensical song number comparing women's body parts to various fruits. Comical banter is accompanied by sombre moody musical strains better fitted to melodramatic exchanges. The music appears emblematic of Truffaut's winking influence throughout constantly encouraging the viewer to engage with the film artistically yet never at the expense of entertainment. The film is made all the more timeless through its sublime performances creating real honest and effortlessly lovable characters which instead of caving to Hollywood sap and clich gleefully subvert it. Charles Aznavour proves a delightful mirror image of the archetypal hardboiled film noir protagonist his sad haunted eyes and quick witted voiceover announcing the quiet humanity he attempts to keep hidden underneath a more grim facade of how he believes a man should act. Marie Dubois is equally superb a female lead bubbling with genuine warmth and shining charisma. Albert Rmy makes the titular pianist's washed up failure of a brother impossible to dislike through a charming grounded performance and Nicole Berger simmers with magnetic pathos and muted warmth as the pianist's mysterious first wife. Finally as the most incongruous figures in the film Daniel Boulanger and Claude Mansard are bizarrely hilarious as bumbling heavies Ernest and Momo keeping their menace carefully concealed behind a veneer of sidesplitting oneliners physical comedy and inane dialogue which clearly proved inspirational for Tarantino's ruminating thugs in Pulp Fiction.

This was a great find for the intermediate French New Wave cinephile. A few minutes into the film I'd realized that I had seen this well a different version a milder version without subtitled cuss words and without the Boob scene. From an American perspective most French foreign films are too deliberate and very slow this isn't the case in this film. Intelligent dialogue mixed speed wit sharp crime gritty film work and the seldom used internal dialogue was a nice surprise. Additionally the choreography was excellent almost in line with a musical.".
