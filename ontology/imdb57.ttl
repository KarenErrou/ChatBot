	schema:headline " A true classic horror vampire flick better than remake!";
	schema:reviewBody "Fright Night 1985 is an awesome true classic vampire horror film that is written and directed by Tom Holland him self. I love the remake but I just love the original much better. In here you have monsters a real vampires and werewolves in it. Chris Sarandon did a wonderful job as Jerry Dandridge a vampire by night. I love the make up and I love how they were portraying a vampire in this movie. Evil Ed Stephen Geoffreys is a turned werewolves at the end of the film and he is staked by Peter Vincent Roddy McDowall. Fright Night 1985 is one of my favorite vampire horror flicks I love vampire movies and this film is for me. The remake is a good film but they aren't portraying real monsters and werewolves like they do in this movie. I am pretty sure if the new movie would portrayed such a monsters werewolves like in here I am pretty sure the movie would be better! The end was perfect and awesome how Charley and Peter are fighting Jerry I love how Vincent and Charley are smashing in all the basement windows allowing the sunlight to hit Dandridge. Using a mirror they reflect the sunlight and finally manage to kill Dandridge by blasting him with the rays and he bursts into flames and within seconds his body is reduced to dust and bones. That scene was awesome!I love Roddy McDowall as Peter Vincent the great Vampire Killer! Seriously this movie kick ass! Roddy McDowall kicks ass in this slasher vampire film! I love everything about this film that it is in it! My all time favorite vampire movie ever a classic the remake doesn't even come close to matching it. Chris Sarandon was perfect as Jerry Dandridge the next door neighbor vampire nothing will ever change my mind about this one no vampire movie since this one has ever matched it movie or series!! Fright Night is a ultimate classic a classic film that I will always cherish it to death! The special effects are great in this one. This film not only has vampires werewolves and monsters in it it also has a virgins it has Roddy Mcdowell in one of his best performances. It has Prince HumperdinkJack Skelenton as the baddie. It is quotable selfaware way before Joss WhedonKevin Williamson and funny as hell. The weakest link although she still gives a very good performance is Amanda Bearse AKA Marcy Darcy from Married with Children as the sexpot could be bonus if you are so inclined object of desire. It's hard not to look nor listen to her without waiting for an Al Bundy insult but there is some consolation when she turns. Watch it and love it this is what comedyhorror is all about. This is a great movie. I wouldn't say it scared me to death but it's good and creepy it's one of those movies you can watch over and over again. GREAT FILM! Our heroes are a motley group of characters the straightlaced boy next door who no one believes the bookish girl crush who is coveted by all the monsterfan geek and a most wonderful touch with Roddy McDowall playing a washedup horror actor similar to character actors such as Peter CushingChristopher LeeVincent Price. Bottom of line I love this film it is one of my favorite Vampire horror slasher films I also love the remake tough it even can't hold a candle to this film. Meet Jerry Dandridge. He's sweet sexy and he likes to sleep in late. You might think he's the perfect neighbor. But before inviting Jerry in for a nightcap there's just one thing you should know. Jerry prefers his drinks warm red and straight from the jugular! It's Fright Night a horrific howl starring Chris Sarandon as the seductive vampire and William Ragsdale as the frantic teenager struggling to keep Jerry's deadly fangs out of his neck. Only 17yearold Charley Brewster Ragsdale knows Jerry's bloodcurdling secret. When Charley can't get anybody to believe him he turns to TV horror host Peter Vincent Roddy McDowall who used to be the Great Vampire Killer of the movies. Can these mortals save Charley and his sweetheart Amy Amanda Bearse from the wrathful bloodsucker's toothy embrace? If you love being scared Fright Night...will give you the nightmare of your life. That is the main plot in the remake they don't even mentioned Jerry's last Surname. Fright Night is a 1985 American horror film written and directed by Tom Holland and produced by Herb Jaffe. It stars William Ragsdale Chris Sarandon Roddy McDowall and Amanda Bearse. I love this film to death! It is my favorite best horror slasher film the rating I am giving tot his film is 1010. This film deserves it! Tom Holland thank you for so beautiful wonderful horror vampire film big cheers and thank you!".

	schema:reviewBody "Fright Night Lost Boys and Near Dark are the holy trinity of 80s vampire flicks. And arguably three of the best vampires movies of alltime. Just recently I returned to this piece of 80's horror gold and I have to say I enjoyed it just as much as the first time I saw it.Fright Night is about a kid named Charlie Brewster who accidentally discovers that his new neighbor Jerry Dandrige is a vampire. The movie is about Charlie and friends setting out to destroy the vampire. But Mr. Dandridge is no slouch and is more of a threat to them then they are to him.Besides being one of the best 80's horror films I think it's also one of the best movies of the entire 1980s. The movie is full of great performances especially Chris Sarandon as Jerry Dandrige and Roddy McDowall as TV Vampire Slayer Peter Vincent. It has fantastic makeup effects that are sorely sorely missing from today's horror flicks. And it also combines a great feel of horror with a realistic touch of comedy and drama. The best and funniest aspect to the movie for myself is how they portray the vampire character. I won't spoil it for you but the guy enjoys wearing very tata clothes eats fruit all the time and has a livein roommate. This movie is classic! Fright Night has a sequel that some say is equally as good but I wouldn't be one to say that. But I do enjoy the sequel and definitely think it's worth a view. If you're a fan of horror and vampires this is a must see flick. Welcome to Fright Night baby!".

	schema:reviewBody "Is it the 80's cheesiness fashion clichs music? It's impressive FX? The story? Who knows. Time made justice to Fright Night one of the best vampire movies ever and probably the best of the 80's. When it came out in 1985 the Slasher genre was on it's highest peak and as Peter Vincent said to Charlie his generation prefers movies where a masked looney kills virgin innocents or something like that. When nobody cared about Vampires Fright Night came out with a tremendous potential on it's story actors and make up the basic elements that a Slasher movie needs. The result is an entertaining chilling and very well done horror movie better than expected.SPOILERS Charlie Brewster an average boy finds out that his neighbor is a vampire. He has doubts until Jerry Dandridge his vampire neighbor appears on his bedroom and threatens him to death. Nobody believes Charlie and after a series of events not only his life is in danger but also his girlfriend's. Charlie finds in Peter Vincent t.v.'s popular Vampire Killer character his only hope to save his girlfriend. In order to accomplish what he wants Charlie and Peter Vincent will face the deadly Jerry Dandridge his guardian Billy Cole and their attacks.ACTING. You can't go wrong when a great actor like Mr. Chris Sarandon carries the entire movie on his back with his performance. His character Jerry Dandridge completely steals the show. Sarandon made the character. Roddy McDowall as Peter Vincent is a pleasure to watch. His character has an admirable quick evolution in the movie. First he's the vampire killer t.v. character that after meeting a REAL vampire knows what fear is like. Then after dealing with fear he recovers faith and that makes him stronger in every aspect. William Ragsdale is good as Charlie Brewster the teen main character in the movie. The boy that discovers that his neighbor is a real vampire but nobody believes him. Good character. Special mention to Stephen Geoffreys as Evil Ed for being one of the weirdest but likable characters ever to appear in a horror movie. His performance is truly evil and humorist. A nice touch. Amanda Bearse from Married with Children fame is also a good addition to the cast she delivers an o.k. performance. Jonathan Stark as Billie Cole Jerry's guardian delivers a solid performance. This is one of the best casts that you can get from an 80's horror movie.DIRECTION. The 80's craziness was never this creepy. Tom Holland makes a terrific job this time. This man is behind key horror movies from the 80's like Child's Play and the surprisingly good Psycho II among others. His camera work in Fright Night is great. He knew how to combine perfectly the 80's feeling something that nobody has ever described for it's madness with the Vampire movies basic rules.The idea of watching a Vampire movie from the 80's could make you think the worst but luckily it's a great idea. Excellent job Mr. Holland.FXSCORECINEMATOGRAPHY. The fx and makeup are very ahead of it's time. You can't get better gore effects! The scene of Evil Ed's death when he's a werewolf is amazing. On it's time I'm sure that it shocked more than once. Also Billy Cole's death and the ending are great scenes that will please the horror audience's eyes. Great use of gore and fx. Enough said. The score is great. The 80's pop metal and club music fits perfect with the feeling of the movie. The club scene is something you haven't seen. In the tense and thrilling scenes the music works perfect. The cinematography is pretty good. The use of lightning on dark settings is very good. Watch the DVD version for a different experience. I love the lines from the movie. I can assure that Fright Night is something you haven't seen. Don't get fooled by the 80's big hair laughable fashion and clichs. The movie stands alone. Be prepared for a real FRIGHT NIGHT!".

	schema:reviewBody "'Fright Night' is a movie that has stuck with me for years. Recently I was able to get it on DVD and have been watching it and trying to convince my friends to watch it ever since. It has it's flaws but time has been kinder I think to 'Fright Night' than it has been to either 'Near Dark' or 'The Lost Boys.'Chris Sarandon is great and charismatic in his role as the new nextdoor neighbor. He gives a deep performance and it seems like he's having a lot of fun in every scene. William Ragsdale isn't bad either as he tries with greater desperation and anxiety to convince people that the vampire exists and win allies to help him destroy it. My favourite performance comes from Roddy McDowall. Like Donald Pleasance later in his career Roddy McDowell could reasonably be accused of acting in anything if there was a paycheck involved this has damaged his reputation somewhat. I think 'Fright Night' and his performance as Peter Vincent definitely falls in the plus category rather than negative. He is great at hiding behind masks and is constantly performing for the other characters. As an actor the part required versatility compassion and depth. Had they been able Peter Cushing or Vincent Price would have also played the part splendidly  McDowell's character is of course a tribute to both these actors and I think that he was simply fantastic.So many of the moments in 'Fright Night' compete to be my favourite but I think it comes in the final third of the film. Peter Vincent has run out of masks to hide behind and becomes a very tired very frightened and very old man. Redemption isn't out of reach  but he's going to have to work for it.I mentioned earlier that 'Fright Night' has aged fairly well. There is decent gore and makeup so anyone looking for that will likely be satisfied. Music can kill films and age them more quickly than anything else. It works here where it might fail in other films.The strength of 'Fright Night' though are it's performances and the sense of fun that it has. Definitive vampire film? No but a lot better than many many many of the pretenders to that title. Rewarding fun and worth a look.".

	onyx:emotionText "'Fright Night' is a movie that has stuck with me for years. Recently I was able to get it on DVD and have been watching it and trying to convince my friends to watch it ever since. It has it's flaws but time has been kinder I think to 'Fright Night' than it has been to either 'Near Dark' or 'The Lost Boys.'Chris Sarandon is great and charismatic in his role as the new nextdoor neighbor. He gives a deep performance and it seems like he's having a lot of fun in every scene. William Ragsdale isn't bad either as he tries with greater desperation and anxiety to convince people that the vampire exists and win allies to help him destroy it. My favourite performance comes from Roddy McDowall. Like Donald Pleasance later in his career Roddy McDowell could reasonably be accused of acting in anything if there was a paycheck involved this has damaged his reputation somewhat. I think 'Fright Night' and his performance as Peter Vincent definitely falls in the plus category rather than negative. He is great at hiding behind masks and is constantly performing for the other characters. As an actor the part required versatility compassion and depth. Had they been able Peter Cushing or Vincent Price would have also played the part splendidly  McDowell's character is of course a tribute to both these actors and I think that he was simply fantastic.So many of the moments in 'Fright Night' compete to be my favourite but I think it comes in the final third of the film.

	schema:reviewBody "Title Fright Night Director Tom Holland Stars Roddy McDowell Chris Sarandon William Ragsdale Amanda Bearse and Stephen Geoffreys Released 1985 Review very few minor spoilers I'm sure many of you here know this movie by heart and have seen it countless hundreds of times but this here review is for those newer schmoes who still haven't had the pleasure of seeing this masterpiece. So here it goes.This movie has a special place in my horror loving heart for many reasons. Among them the fact that its just so fun to watch. Over and over again I find myself revisiting this flick simply because I love the characters so much and because all those horror clichs I love are all over the place.The story revolves around a teenager named Charlie Brewster William Ragsdale who loves to watch his favorite horror show called Fright Night. This show which is hosted by Peter Vincent played by Roddy Mc Dowell plays old horror movies every night and Charlie watches them all the time.One problem though. Charlie suspects his new neighbor Jerry Dandridge Chris Sarandon is a vampire and therefore decides he has to destroy him. No one believes him not his girlfriend Amy or his buddy Evil. So he decides to take matters into his own hands. Once Dandridge realizes what a threat Charlie could be to him well lets just say things get complicated. And for us horror fans in a good way.This film pays homage to many horror films of old. If your a horror fan you'll get all the cool inside jokes...like Peter Vincent who is obviously named after Peter Cushing and Vincent Price. If you watch closely you'll catch a Hammer film playing on Charlies TV. Hell at one moment Charlie is even watching Children Shouldn't Play with dead things! This films taken inspiration from many other vampire films before it like for example hammer films Horror of Dracula. Check out Evil Ed getting that cross burned onto his forehead to see what I mean! It also has some hints of 1979s Dracula adaptation by Jhon Badham. But thats not to say that Fright Night is not at all original its taken inspiration by these films and is paying homage to them but it has its own thing going on.All the characters in this film are memorable if not arch typical. Yeah you get your teenage nerdgoody little two shoes with Charlie Brewster Amanda Bearse as the virgin girl who's to scared to do it with her boyfriend and your get your clown act with Evil but they are so endearing and innocent that you cant help but feel sorry for what they are about to hurl themselves into.Then there's Roddy McDowells great Peter Vincent who plays a father figure to Charlie. The situations and scenes with them together are great. Specially that scene where Charlies begging Peter to help him.Then there's the main baddie Jerry Dandridge a vampire who's lived for many thousands of years and now just wants to settle down in this quiet little town and suck it dry! Many female horror fans refer to Dandridge as the sexiest male vampire ever so there you go. He delivers many memorable lines and is a formidable character for Peter and Charlie to go up against.Cool make up fx even by todays standards the make up fx seen on Fright Night stand on their own as being very well achieved vampire transformations werewolf's giant vampire bats you name it its in there and done well. One particularly good moments is Evils transformation...enough said.One minor set back is that maybe some younger viewers might not like the 80s soundtrack which the movie has. All the songs on it are as 80s as you can get. This is very evident in a scene that takes place inside of a disco called Club Radio. To me and many others that might come of as nostalgic and a trip down memory lane but to others specially the younger viewers it might prove to be distracting. But thats about the only set back I can see in watching this film.Fright Nights success at the box office was followed by an also entertaining sequel aptly titled Fright Night II. Not as good as the first but still highly enjoyable.Check this flick out...its a horror film done right. And one of the best vampire flicks ever if you ask me! Rating 5 out of 5".

Well a couple years later hitting sixth grade I found the video at a video store and fell in love with it all over again.

I have more of a appreciation for the movie. For all the actors and actresses.I have the movie memorized word for ward even if I go like a year without watching it again. But recently I began to realize that the 20th anniversary for this great horror classic is coming around the bend. I had started a script myself which I know will fail to be noticed for such a special occasion. Bringing back all the characters from part one and two except Peter Vicent since no one but Roddy MacDowall could do the part.I just want everyone to know that Fright Night is the definition of the perfect eighties Horror film. It is original with it's characters setting and the all around story itself. But it also shows the hard work that had gone into it to create those undoubtedly scarier then crap Dandridge Evil Amy and Billy Coal transformations. Chris Sarandon himself stated it was hell to do the make up for the movie but his character was worth it. I would rather see a film with special make up effects then with the modern computer animation special effects. More work and artistic hands on talent went into movies like Fright Night. That's why Fright Night stands out as a eighties classic vampire flick. I personally would like to thank all the actors for the gift of entertainment when making the film. Also the brilliant minds and talented men and women who worked on the film. Fright Night is a movie that has fond memories for me in my child hood. Chris Sarandon will always be my first movie star crush. Dang he is still hot today! I can't help but still imagine Jerry Dandridge as my perfect eye candy neighbor. I would recommend anyone to view this movie. Appreciate it as a art form of entertainment with the taste of horror mixed in there. Enjoy it and love it!One final statement.....LONG LIVE FRIGHT NIGHT!!!!!!!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Before I first watched Fright Night I admit I was unsure about what to think about it. All I knew about it was from what I had been told from my Dad though his likesdislikes are generally on par with mine they sometimes border on plain stupid. But when I saw it to the end I was almost totally converted.Although the beginning is a bit cheesy and reminiscent of stereotypical horror Bmovies it soon becomes clear that this is part of what makes Fright Night so original. All the typical horror film genres are there horror romance comedy well maybe comedy isn't a typical horror element but what makes this horror flick stand out a mileandahalf from the rest is that it's a very offbeat tale. It's creepily cheesy but gets away with it because it's atmosphere is so good.All this and I haven't mentioned the acting or special effects yet. Sarandon seems to give such an effortless performance as the vampire and as a result is almost perfect. I had thought of what a modern day vampire would be like before I saw Fright Night but Jerry Dandridge just blew all these ideas away and has to be the coolest and I don't often use that word and sexiest vampire ever and is one of my favourite movie villains. Roddy McDowall can't hold a candle to Sarandon but is still very good and Stephen Geoffreys is one of the funniest and memorable movie characters ever to grace a film screen too.The special effects are good for 1985 and unlike where in modern films the SFX are the main point in the movie here they add to the already present chilling atmosphere. And although on the one hand Fright Night is quite dated it also captures the atmosphere and the essence of the 80s. The soundtrack is excellent for the film but paradoxically not very memorable apart from one or two good songs.I wish I'd been born before 1981 maybe 1961 so that I could have lived in the late70s and 80s and would have memories of the best music from that time and not the boybandsBeatles clonesdance ditties not decent tunes mind we have now.All in all an almost perfect film watch it and you'll most likely enjoy it and watch it again and again.".

	schema:reviewBody "I would consider myself a film fan with somewhat intellectual preferences and I have a passion for European art house pretentious stuff so when Fright Night was recommended to me I dismissed it in a snobby 80s special effects vampire horror movie? A title that rhymes? No thank you! kind of way.HOWEVER I have a feeling it may be the single best film I have ever seen of any genre or time period. It has a witty script fabulous special effects and some of the best acting I have seen particularly Evil Ed later on in the film. There are moments of suspense hilarity tenderness for example with Peter Vincent and the dying wolf and believable every day life. This film didn't actually scare me but it did make me laugh very very hard.A special mention must be made of Chris Sarandon as I think his performance really stood out. Evil is not as easy to portray in stories as people think but Sarandon does the most believable evilness I think I have ever seen coupled irresistibly with the sexiest seduction scene ever is it wrong that I wanted him to win in the end because he was so gorgeous?. If vampires really did exist I think they would be exactly like Jerry Dandridge except maybe without the same scary 80s vampire mask and claws.My advice is SEE THIS FILM and don't have any preconceptions about it.".

	onyx:emotionText "I would consider myself a film fan with somewhat intellectual preferences and I have a passion for European art house pretentious stuff so when Fright Night was recommended to me I dismissed it in a snobby 80s special effects vampire horror movie? A title that rhymes? No thank you! kind of way.HOWEVER I have a feeling it may be the single best film I have ever seen of any genre or time period. It has a witty script fabulous special effects and some of the best acting I have seen particularly Evil Ed later on in the film. There are moments of suspense hilarity tenderness for example with Peter Vincent and the dying wolf and believable every day life. This film didn't actually scare me but it did make me laugh very very hard.A special mention must be made of Chris Sarandon as I think his performance really stood out.

	schema:reviewBody "While with his girlfriend Amy Peterson Amanda Bearse in his bedroom the teenager Charley Brewster William Ragsdale sees a coffin being transported to the house on the next door. A couple of days later he concludes that his neighbor Jerry Dandrige Chris Sarandon is a vampire who is committing some recent unsolved murders. Charley decides to look for help first his friend Evil Ed Thompson Stephen Geoffreys since the policemen do not believe on his accusation. Jerry is upset and promises to kill Charley. Later he meets Peter Vincent Roddy McDowall a middle aged man who is a vampire killer in a television show but does not believe on vampires in the real life. Amy and Ed seek out Peter Vincent and the group tries to prove to Charley that Jerry is not a vampire. 'Fright Night' is one of my favorite vampire movies indeed a cultmovie in Brazil. I do not know how many times I have seen this film in my life but yesterday I saw it on DVD for the first time and I was not disappointed since the Brazilian DVD offers two choices widescreen and fullscreen. There is just a trailer in the extras but it suffices. Chris Sarandon is incredibly funny and sexy in this role the movie has a perfect combination and timing of the genres of horror and comedy the 'Van Helsing' of the story Peter Vincent is a fantastic joke with the names of the great Peter Cushing and Vincent Price the special effects were state of art in 1985. My vote is nine.Title 'Brazil' ' A Hora do Espanto' 'The Fright Hour'Note on 14 January 2012 I saw this wonderful film again.".

	schema:headline " Why Fright Night is worth many words";
	schema:reviewBody "Why is Fright Night my all time favorite horror movie within the vampire content? Well simply because of the films actors and the story line itself. In the past month or so I have had the chance to reminisce on the fact that I had always adored this movie. Sitting down and taking the time to watch it through again as I had once done years ago when Fright Night was my inspiration to dive into the horror writing area with great vampire characters with memorable appearance and expression. From the villainous immortal to the pathetic immortal. Remembering my youth not that long about about close to twenty years ago I was introduced to Fright Night on a cable movie channel. The part I remembered the most was Evil Ed's transformation from wolf to man. Why that stuck out probably played on my fear of werewolves funny I know. As I got older I found that I was madly in love with the character Jerry Dandridge just by the fact of Chris Sarandon's wonderful portrayal of the creature of the night. Just is seduction and sexiness. But also the fact that he was pure evil with all the vampire cunningness. Having the movie given as a birthday present at the age of twelve made my life peachy. Watching as much as I can. Now as a adult I understand more about the movie. It's contents the story line and the effort that was put into making it a graphic film with horror and terror. Fright Night is a perfect example of the greatest of special effects for the 80's. It was battling against movies like Nightmare On Elm Street and others that played on fears. This is a classical story because it creates a modernized vampire and also shows what happens when a young teen gets nosey. With that you think of what you might do when if a vampire lived nextdoor to you! But with all the actors and actresses only one stood out from the rest. Chris Sarandon is a talented actor who deserves praise for his performance which many seem to appreciate. I think any person with a horror taste should take the time to watch this classic movie and see what is definitely the most original and breath taking movie of its time. I can go on and on about this movie but I am limited. But the time is ended. Please take the time and watch the movie if you haven't seen it or haven't seen it in a along time. Thanks".

It was simply a very entertaining horror flick with a good mixture of suspense comedy and good special effects. The kids  William Ragsdale Amanda Bearse and Stephen Geoffreys  are all excellent but the two adults  Chris Sarandon and Roddy McDowell  steal the show.Sarandon is very cool as the vampire cocky arrogant and smooth. He is easily the best character in the movie. McDowell does a nice job as the reluctant vampire slayer.The specialeffects are good and the film is played strictly for fun even with the suspenseful scenes. In fact it reminds me of the word camp because it's so hokey in spots. Yet the film definitely has its scary moments. Note I watched this 34 times on the tape so I am familiar with most of the film and after seeing the DVD I swear several short scenes are missing such as Bearse's quick shower scene. I've never come across something like this before.".

	schema:reviewBody "After watching this film just Friday I have already found this film to be a very memorable piece of work by Tom Holland who did Psycho II and of coarse Child's Play.The story is about a kid who believes that there's a Vampire living next to him. He tries to notify that people are being murdered by the blood thirsty Jerry but nobody will believe him. He then looks up to the famous horror vampire killer on TV Peter Vincent who he believes will help him stop Jerry and his buddy.First watching Child's Play and now Fright Night Another horror film I should have watched ages ago.. Tom Holland does a top notch job on creating the right amount of humour scares and disturbance for us to feast on. I believe like Wes Craven Tobe Hooper or even John Carpentar Tom Holland is a legend in the horror business as in this film he can create the right mood like he created the right scares for Child's Play.Chris Sarandon does an excellent job as the charming but sinister Jerry Dandrige who takes people in and posses them with his evil love. I just could not get over how great Chris Sarandon was in this vampire role. I usually hate vampires and vampire films but with Tom Holland's great direction and once again memorable scenes and Chris Sarandon's perfecto acting I believe that now I like vampires well only Sarandon's for now.The other actors where casted perfectly for their roles and the special vampire and wolf effects and even the concept are all done well.They say they are going to release a remake of Fright Night this year. All I can say is that I've looked at the trailer and it looks fail. The new actor playing Jerry Dandrige doesn't look like he'll be able to pull it off he just can't do it and the whole remaking of the story looks like a complete mess. I have no hopes for the remake.The original from me gets 9 bloody vampires out of 10.".

More than anything else it's all about the fun and I just find it as great and entertaining a watch as it's always been. That's the true test of a classic horror flick if you can see it over so many times and still it seems fresh still it offers new insights still it lends itself to bold and exciting new interpretations! And you can still go to the bathroom in the middle of it without missing a thing! It's very straightforward and dead easy to get into. I mean what an angle A teenage boy who's a big horror fan he's seen all the movies read all the stories and he suddenly finds himself faced with a real monster who's moved in right next door and who soon knows that the boy knows about his true nature  what does he do? It's such a novel concept and one that plays out in such a satisfying way. The atmosphere is amazing it doesn't ever drag and it doesn't take itself too seriously not to say there are no scary moments or anything. It's helped a lot by a good cast. William Ragsdale as Charlie was fine but he was kind of neurotic and boring for me I thought he was overshadowed even by most of the smaller characters. He played the lead well I just thought that the role could've been done a lot better and memorable by someone like Zach Galligan say.. I loved his ditzy mother she was a hoot! She kept coming out with such funny lines. I absolutely bloody adore Roddy McDowall in this what a class act. He's simply priceless in his role as Peter Vincent a meek and unlikely cowardly aged actor who becomes the hero he has played in a string of classic Bmovie vampire pictures in his glory days after a graceful character arc in which he gains the courage and faith! to face his fear. And Chris Sarandon he just played his vampiric character to perfection. I love the way he's got the whole charm and seduction thing down but at the same time he has a certain little odd quirkiness to some of his lines and actions. And he was also perfectly intimidating and wrathful when he had to be. And although you understand how he's gotta go you never really hate the guy he's a very likable villain that I could 'dig' and that's half the battle right there at winning the audience of a horror movie over if the bad guy's interesting and charismatic. I love all of the nifty and gruesome special effects like the awesomely foreboding mist that swirls around Dandridge's humble abode and sets such a fabulous tone. There's the prosthetics and models of the prolonged sequence where poor strange Evil Ed slowly transforms back into a regular human following an impaling while in wolf form and dies.Or does he? I also love the brief but superb animation of the bat and the little but effective gag of when Amy's dancing and sees a reflection that shows her dancing with thin air. I love that sequence it's so vibrant and so of its time it's like someone felt like indulging themselves by incorporating a glitzy music video into their movie and it's really 80s really corny and really epic!!! There is also the impressively gooey disintegration of the sexy and mysteriousDemon? Zombie? Billy Cole and the spectacular demise of Jerry Dandridge in which he kind of explodes to death. Some of the effects hold up a little better than others but so what? There's such a charm there sometimes when you know that they had to put it all together themselves and they clearly had a lot of love for the old vampire movies and the horror genre here and you just very rarely get that anymore. Still brilliant fun couldn't have asked for anything better! I wonder if any real vampires ever come to see these films....".

	schema:reviewBody "Fright Night is simply 80's vampire movies at their greatest. It goes along with The Lost Boys in terms of horror gore and fun. No depressing sparkly romantic crap here. Here we see Ragsdale discover his neighbor is a vampire. Of course nobody believes him and he's soon driven mad. Luckily he forms an alliance with a reluctant TV vampire hunter. As I said Fright Night is a fun movie which always raises a chuckle but it also has some disgusting effects. I'm talking real practical stuff with some of the most painful deaths and transformations you can imagine. This stuff is so much more creative with prosthetics and the like. Computers can easily make a body melt or turn a wolf into a man here some truly creative visuals make these things a reality. Sarandon is excellent as the charming vampire and it's nice to see him go along with trying to prove he isn't a vampire. It shows him as a man that would rather keep his secret than enter a battle to the death. Ragsdale does the usual notbelievedkid routine but he makes it work. McDowall stole the movie for me. He plays an out of date TV star given a chance to live out his pretend life. The threats are real and the climax steadily grows. You do have to suspend some belief in terms of how the characters respond but if you love the 80's vampires and movies that knew how to be fun no matter what their subject you need to see Fright Night.".

	schema:headline " Drawing parallels...";
	schema:reviewBody "In an age of Twilight it's very interesting to see a film with vampires where they're portrayed as scary rather than your average soap opera character. In the Bela Lugosi Dracula Dracula was portrayed with an almost Bond like stature. However whether it was Lugosi or just the film making of the times Dracula lacked just the the charisma to sell it. Now that's just my opinion but in stating that it makes my point clearer when I say the Sarandon's performance of the vampire Jerry Dandrige has that charisma so that you buy it when he seduces someone.I compare Dandrige and Dracula because that's what Fright Night is. It's a contemporary well in the eighties it was take on the classic vampire. It doesn't try to create new rules or reboot classic Universal vampire lore. It simply elaborates on it. We never saw what would have happened in Dracula when Dr. Van Helsing holds up the cross. We just saw Lugosi's over the top reaction to its presence. In Fright Night it's the equivalent of jabbing someone with a red hot brand.Speaking of Van Helsing Roddy McDowall turns in a very fun turn as Fright Night's interpretation of the character Peter Vincent. He's a washed up film star who's been reduced to hosting a horror movie show that shows. He has the know how and yet is crippled by his cowardice and greed. In the role of the brave boy willing to risk life and limb to protect his neighborhood and girlfriend is young Charley Brewster played by William Ragsdale. He's the main character after all and plays the role with naivety and yet an undying persistence to stop this creature that threatens him and his community. In an all to common parallel is Charley's girlfriend Amy Amanda Bearse and his best friend Evil Ed Stephen Geoffreys. They don't believe Charley but are concerned for him and enlist Vincent's help with Amy's college fund. The design of the vampire is the least faithful thing to the classic idea of the vampire. Well the Universal vampire anyways. When the vampires become hungry they turn into more ravenous takes on Nosferatu which is technically Dracula the film studio just couldn't afford the rights to the name. Anyway the vampires also can transform as did Dracula. These effects are pretty good. One of the best involves just a quick effect with a wolves' eyes. The way the scenery blends with the film is also very well done if not slightly exaggerated.As much as I've been praising this film however it's definitely not perfect. A lot of the acting is exaggerated. This problem is easily forgivable although because the overacting actually leads to some of the more memorable characters and moments in the film. Second the screenplay is pretty weak at points and under mines itself when it's trying to be serious and scary and that's leading to my last complaint which is coincidentally my complaint with Dracula and that is that to me this film just isn't scary. I mean sure it's creepy but if you're like me a 14 year old boy there's a strong possibility that this film won't scare you. However I don't really count this as a strike against it as it's not as much a flaw with the movie as it is with modern movie goers such as myself.The more I think about this movie the more I realize how much this film is a contemporary retelling of Dracula and it's a well made one too. It's a refreshing break to see a vampire movie that doesn't try to be particularly special with it's portrayal of vampires and in not being special it BECOMES special. And that's the beauty of Fright Night. And yet it makes me sad as it shows just how pathetic vampires have gotten that watching a movie where vampires do what they're supposed to do is such a rare and glorious occurrence. Oh well. In the end Fright Night is a fun campy and creepy vampire flick that would be ideal to watch on Halloween.".

	schema:headline " Far superior to it's remake!";
	schema:reviewBody "After I finished reading the truly horrible script for the 2011 remake of Fright Night I found myself with a new appreciation of the original movie.Peter Vincent is probably the most enjoyable character in this film. Roddy McDowall stole the show as the slightly cowardly TV horror host who grows a spine and rises to be the heroic vampire killer he had always pretended to be. The soundtrack is incredible. The acting is brilliant. I have always loved Gothic Horror particularly the old Hammer horror films such as what Peter Vincent shows on his TV show. Not only do I not see a purpose in the Fright Night remake but I feel it fails on my many levels where the original excels. The vampires of the original Fright night had the powers of Dracula himself. They could turn into horrible little bats or wolves or mist. They could enthrall human wills and could show up on film as a human might. In the remake they have no such abilities and this is not sowell compensated by an excess of explosions. The writer of the remake claims that horror movie hosts don't exist anymore. Not only is this not true but there are more horror movie hosts on TV AND Internet today than there ever were on TV in 1985. Elvira's Movie Macabre Mystery science theater 3000 Nostalgia Critic just to name a few... I think they made a huge mistake in changing Peter Vincent to a nearly unrecognizable stage magician in the remake. If anything the movie host is more relatable now than ever before. Skip the remake stick with the original. It makes more sense. It has more accessible characters. Peter Vincent actually has depth rather than the show pretense of depth with the added backstory given in the remake. Charlie is a lot nicer and a lot more sympathetic in the original. And this one had memorable and catchy songs on the soundtrack. The vampires are more frightening while at the same time more charming and strangely sympathetic while also terrifying and deadly. The humor isn't forced and there's no obnoxious product placement. The remake... has none of these qualities. This is by far the superior film. Skip the remake kids. Stick with the original!".

	onyx:emotionText "After I finished reading the truly horrible script for the 2011 remake of Fright Night I found myself with a new appreciation of the original movie.Peter Vincent is probably the most enjoyable character in this film. Roddy McDowall stole the show as the slightly cowardly TV horror host who grows a spine and rises to be the heroic vampire killer he had always pretended to be. The soundtrack is incredible. The acting is brilliant. I have always loved Gothic Horror particularly the old Hammer horror films such as what Peter Vincent shows on his TV show. Not only do I not see a purpose in the Fright Night remake but I feel it fails on my many levels where the original excels.

	schema:reviewBody "Bankhead made a handful of silent films before she became the rage of the London stage in the late 20s. Back in Hollywood she made 7 films in 1931 and 1932. The Devil and the Deep was the penultimate one. She was not a success. It would be more than a decade before she would face the cameras again in 1944's brilliant Lifeboat for Alfred HItchcock.The few of these early talkies I've seen have been fascinating because Bankhead was a STAR and no one was quite like her. She had the allure of Garbo or Dietrich but she was closer to Davis or Crawford or Constance Bennett in her temperament. In Faithless Tarnished Lady The Cheat and Devil and the Deep she plays basically the same character the woman who goes wrong but is saved in the end. Bankhead suffered in her 30s films from lousy directors. In Devil and the Deep Marion Gering misdirects by letting Charles Laughton ham it up as the husband while Gary Cooper as the lover is boring. Bankhead holds center stage and is really very good in this VERY strange film.It's a submarine movie set apparently in Algiers or some such place. She is the commander's bored wife. He's nuts. After her fling with Cary Grant yes it's quite the cast Laughton has him transferred. Cooper's fate is worse since they're all aboard the sub when all hell breaks loose.Bankhead looks great in stylish clothing and slinks about the house and the club  the streets amid whirling dervishes and on the sub. Laughton is menacing and his final scene is memorable. But they're not a very believable couple. Cooper is oddly boring and is given awful lines to say. Grant in a small part is well Cary Grant. Paul Porcasi is the shop keeper Henry Kolker and Juliette Compton are the catty club denizens. One problem is that the film is underlit so it's hard to see a lot of detail. Amusing scenes with Cooper and Bankhead staring up at the stars buying cheap perfume and buying a pool cue.With a better director and better writers this could have been a blockbuster. But it's neat to see Bankhead in her prime before she became a campy professional star.".

Bankhead like other female stars of that historical moment is made up and coiffed to look like a Garbo clone. The style suits her without overwhelming her innate distinctive qualities of voice and manner. Laughton's performance prefigures his later Captain Bligh in Mutiny on the Bounty and Quasimodo in The Hunchback of Notre Dame. I prefer his work here to his Bligh which was sometimes too messily overwrought. This is also the second 1932 film the other being Payment Deferred in which he plays dementia with mad laughter. Cooper is wooden and awkward and handsome as usual and Grant does well in a smallish supporting role.".

Laughten is exceptionally paranoid and delights in playing like the slighted husband by starting these rumors himself!

He falls for her but she rebuffs his advances because she's a decent woman. However she does kiss him and soon makes her escape back home. Soon afterward Cooper reports to her homeit seems he's the officer who's replacing Grant. However seeing that his nice commanding officer is married to a woman that let him kiss her he assumed incorrectly that Talullah is a cheatnot understanding that Laughton is certifiably insane.Talullah comes on board the submarine that will be sailing later that night in order to try to explain herself to Cooper. However when Laughton sees she's on board he orders the boat to sail immediately as he sees an insane chance to punish the two loversleading to a very exciting final portion of the film. In fact from then on the film is at its best. The final moments aboard the ship were exceptionally well done and Laughton's final scene quite memorable. Since this film was made PreProduction Code the scene is particularly graphic and exciting.Overall although the film starts a bit slowly it's a dandy film that combines a naval film with a psychological drama. I must admit that the final five minutes or so of the film seemed a tad awkward but what proceeded was exciting and it's a heck of a good film.".

Honored with the title of the esteemed British stage actor Laughton is not only the commander of his submarine but this film as well. He can go from being a gracious host and strong but caring commander to rantingly mad with little provocation and when he does you know that in 1932 they realized what a great actor had just been introduced to Hollywood and American audiences. Tallulah is great as well and the thought of her being stuck on a submarine with dozens of lonely men aboard brings on all sorts of images. It is unfortunate that Cooper and Grant never share as much as a brief exchange considering their legendary status as leading men. The issue is the script which tries to make us believe that Tallulah's character knows the names of some of the obscure equipment on the submarine and can identify what happened when the ship is stranded at the bottom of the ocean with little chance for everyone to escape. Laughton's final scene is haunting and the outcome of what happens with Cooper in his court martial trial quite believable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Devil and the Deep 1932  out of 4 Diana Sturm Tallulah Bankhead is married to submarine Cmdr. Charles Sturm Charles Laughton and everyone sees her as a bad person. The truth of the matter is that Charles is extremely abusive to her and will stop at nothing to destroy any man's life he feels she is attracted to. One night while running away from the abuse Diana meets Lt. Sempter Gary Cooper and the two have a relationship which soon leads to disaster.DEVIL AND THE DEEP isn't a very wellknown movie and I must admit that I'm quite shocked about that. I had never really heard of the film until recently and it's rather amazing because you've got not only Bankhead Laughton and Cooper but you've also got a young Cary Grant in a nice early role. Four legendary stars from Hollywood's Golden Age and you mention the title to most film buffs and they won't be familiar with it.Whatever the reason people don't know the film it's really too bad because it's actually pretty good. The greatest thing about the film is the ending which I won't spoil but it takes place on the submarine and there's no question that it's quite tense and rather claustrophobic. Director Marion Gering really does a nice job with this entire sequence and while some of the special effects shots aren't the greatest the overall impact of the scene is very good. The film does get off to a rather slow start but it quickly picks up.The performances are certainly the main reason to watch the picture with Bankhead delivering a fine one. She's very good in the role of the abusive wife and I really enjoyed her performance when she had to show the fear she feels for her husband. I thought the actress was very believable as an abused woman. Cooper was also very stoic in his hero type of role. I thought the two of them shared some very good chemistry and that helped their relationship. Grant appears early on in the picture and he's very good as well. As for Laughton he gets a very special screen credit and he certainly deserves it as he is great as the crazed man who will stop at nothing to hurt his wife and any man who likes her. By watching this film it's easy to see why he would eventually be cast in MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY.At just seventyfive minutes the film has a very good pace and there's no question that it's one worth watching.".

Tallulah is married to Commander Charles Laughton and while he's jovial and entertaining to others at home he's a different animal entirely. He's jealous to the point of paranoia and at the start of the movie he fires Cary Grant because he believes he's slept with his wife. Tallulah is very upset because she's shared nothing but friendship with Cary. After a fight with Charles she flees from the house. Now if you had an extremely jealous husband and you'd just seen him ruin a man's career over a nonexistent affair wouldn't you immediately run to town and sleep with the first man you ran into? Obviously that's the smart thing to do!The other major problem with the movie is Gary Cooper. He's supposed to be irresistiblehe's notand he's supposed to be able to act his way through the moviehe can't. His monotone delivery would have been laughable if it wasn't painful. Charles Laughton is very good and he receives an introducing credit for this his first American film. But since he is very clearly written to be the bad guy and I was very clearly on his side rather than his wife's I didn't end up liking this movie.I feel so sorry for Charles Laughton. In almost every single movie he made it was written into the script that he was overweight and unattractive. I've seen male characters call him tubby female costars call him ugly and he's on countless occasions had to call himself both. In Devil and the Deep he laments to Gary Cooper It must be a happy thing to look like you do. I suppose women love you. I've never had that it must be a happy thing. During this very sad speech in which he confesses he's sick and tired of living he completely won me over. How are the adulterers the couple you're supposed to root for? It's Charles the sad tortured loving pitiful husband who steals my heart.".

A craftsman and a humanist at that his career is not as dismal as the N.V. clique claims.The sixties were his most mediocre periodhe was wise enough to call it a day in 1966 he died in 1985.Monsieur has some good moments particularly in Gabrielle Dorziat's scene asking Jean Lefevre for a dead body to make sure her soninlaw is dead and to latch onto his doughMireille Darc has spontaneity and charm going for her in her maid turned hooker turned maid again role which eventually ends up in a Cinderellaesque way .Gabin is Gabin but his part is weak just compare to what Sacha Guitry did with Michel Simon in a similar subject in La Vie D'Un Honnte Homme 1952.Philippe Noiret is wasted and Liselotte Pulver gives a rather poor performance to think that she was the heroine of Douglas Sirk's masterpiece  a time to love and a time to die 1958!It was to be Gaby Morlay's last part she died the same year and she does seem the ghost of herselfOne wishes she had left the screen on a high noteon the endearing Fortunat 1960for instance.";

	schema:reviewBody "Jean Gabin had been one of France's biggest stars during the 1930s with several films for great directors such as Marcel Carne' Julien Duvivier and Jean Renoir his later output wasn't anywhere near this level and apart from the odd title  Max Ophuls' LE PLAISIR 1952 Jacques Becker's TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI 1954 or Renoir's own FRENCH CANCAN 1954 to mention the ones I've watched myself  the majority of these could be deemed fillers.Still a good many of them have turned up from time to time on TV I've missed a few and watched others  but then I'm most interested in the ones which fall into the thriller genre. This promised to be one such title and sure enough the first half is interesting as it deals with banker Gabin about to commit suicide after the death of his faithless wife but being dissuaded by a chance meeting with former maid Mireille Darc who has herself fallen on hard times and become a hooker! As he had left a suicide note his relatives eye his wealth greedily and even insinuate themselves in his vacant household since Gabin finds it convenient to appear dead to the world! however he hitches up with Darc's criminal associates and decides to break into his own house unbeknownst to the rest of the gang  in fact he's only referred to as Monsieur hence the film's title and rob the safe!! The second half however in which Gabin and Darc ostensibly present themselves to a rich household in the countryside as servants in preparation for another heist turns the film into a pleasant  and typically French  comedy of sexual manners with Gabin covering up the female owner's escapades from husband Philippe Noiret one of my favorite bits during this section is when Gabin is asked to pick her up from one such tryst after her car has broken down and an old vicar turns up and helpfully  but cluelessly  suggests to them what might be wrong with the vehicle while their son falls for Darc whom Gabin is passing off as his own daughter!. While all this is undeniably entertaining it jars with the earlier section as Gabin's accomplices are unaccountably removed from the picture  so that his decision to remain in Noiret's employ other than the fact that he is being paid for his services and being thought dead by his relatives and colleagues won't be missed is never explained! Even if older and plumper Gabin's quietly authoritative screen presence is unmistakable  and the film also benefits from having the gorgeous Darc best known for playing the female lead in JeanLuc Godard's masterpiece WEEKEND 1967 on board as well as a cheerful score by Georges Van Parys.".

Her criminal rat of a boyfriend Steve DeCunzo Loren Dean wants nothing to do with her or the baby. But fate has a better future in store for Connie and the heavily pregnant girl finds herself almost miraculously on a train bound for Boston from New York. There she shares a compartment with a young married couple Hugh and Patricia Winterbourne Susan Haskell and Brendan Fraser who are also expecting a little bundle of joy. But one little innocent action followed by one horrifying accident lands Connie in the hospital mistaken for Patricia Winterbourne. She and her baby who survived are both whisked off to the massive Winterbourne estate in Boston. Connie decides to carry on the charade it's almost ironic that her her name is Connie since she's conning everyone even after coming face to face with her coddling motherinlaw Shirley MacLaine and Hugh's twin brother the cold and unfriendly Bill Winterbourne also Brendan Fraser.For a fluff film like this the cast is surprisingly good. Loren Dean is convincing enough and makes you want to jump into your TV and strangle the jerk. The Winterbourne butler Paco Miguel Sandoval is a delight to watch especially when he's drunk. But Fraser and MacLaine really make the film worthwhile to see. Why either talented actor would want to participate in a film like this is a mystery to me but maybe it's for the best. Fraser especially plays twins very well and his transition from part antagonist to full protagonist is believable. But I have a difficult time understanding why Ricki Lake was cast as Connie. She has a tendency to overact in many scenes she doesn't make a convincing 18 yearold at all she was 28 when cast and her transition from sharptongued teenager to polite young socialite bridetobe is too fast and unbelievable.Overall 'Mrs. Winterbourne' is a good film for a boring Friday night. This is definitely a chick flick. It's heartwarming and the cast is a joy to watch. Just don't expect anymore than that.".

It almost commands that you not think about the plot too much because if you do the entire movie falls apart.The plot is simple. Connie Doyle is thrown out by her boyfriend when she becomes pregnant and she ends up on a train with the Winterbournes a wealthy young couple on their way to Boston. The train derails and both Winterbournes are killed. However as Connie was trying on Mrs. Winterbourne's ring at the time of the accident she is mistaken for her and her baby for the Winterbourne grandchild. What follows is what always happens in romantic comedies Connie is taken in by the Winterbourne family and falls in love with the dead Winterbourne's twin brother who is initially suspicious of her but then grows to love her. Complications arise but everything works out in the end.Shirley MacLaine is quite winning at Grace Winterbourne and Miguel Sandoval steals most of his scenes. The problem is that neither Ricki Lake or Brendan Fraser have much chemistry with each other and Ricki Lake seems miscast in general. Of course there are also massive plot holes here and even in the end no one really seems to care that the real Mrs. Winterbourne and the real Winterbourne grandchild are off buried somewhere under someone else's name. This is not a bad movie it's perfectly pleasant but you really are required to not think about the plot at all to really enjoy it.".

Yeah I know that fluffy romantic comedies aren't supposed to be realistic but this one just stretches credulity too much. The worst deficiency is Brendan Frasier's chilly WASP suddenly and inexplicably melting into a nice guy. He not only changes his opinion about Ricki Lake but seems to completely change personality as well. One moment he's rudely questioning her every move and investigating her and virtually the next he's romancing her tangoing her around the room and kissing her and then proposing marriage! He goes from aloof to gooey in 6 seconds flat. It's just too much to swallow. What was it exactly that caused him to fall in love  her charming use of the words tits and ass at the dinner table? The haircut? Actually I liked her hair better long and curly. Don't get me wrong I love Ricki Lake and I don't think she was bad here she just wasn't given anything to do and we were never given any reason why Frasier should experience such a dramatic seachange. If perhaps they'd shown that a few months had passed or something to explain the abrupt turnaround. Frankly everyone in this movie goes around like their brains are made of mush. I suppose Maclaine's alcoholic character has an excuse but really the extremely simplistic and downright stereotypical characterizations of everyone involved rich people poor people gay latino butlers were insulting. Maclaine Frasier and Sandoval are excellent comedic actors and do the best with what they can here but the characters are not even close to real people. The only real thing I got out of it was drooling over Brendan Frasier and frankly there are many other superior movies that can be used for that purpose.".

	schema:reviewBody "Connie Ricki Lake lost her mother at twelve in Hoboken New Jersey. Because she did not get along with her father Connie left NJ at 18 and went to NYC. Unfortunately she immediately hooked up with a lowlife named Steve and became pregnant. Steve was less than thrilled with the news and threw Connie out of the house. Although she works as a waitress for awhile when her delivery date draws near she finds herself broke and homeless. The next day  Connie boards a train she thinks is the subway but which turns out to be a railway to Boston. There she is befriended by handsome rich Hugh and his new and very pregnant wife Patricia. The train derails. Hugh and Patricia are killed. But by a twist of fate Connie is mistaken for Patricia and finds herself and her new baby in a private hospital as befitting the wife of a member of the rich Winterbourne family. She meets her new motherinlaw Shirley MacLaine and her husband's twin brother Bill Brendan Fraser and goes home to a posh Boston mansion complete with servants. Just how long will she be able to fool everyone into thinking she really is a part of the family? This is a nice little film for the proverbial romcom fan. MacLaine is wonderful as the matriarch of the wealthy family and Fraser is his usual handsome quirky affable self. Lake seems a bit miscast as the girl with a big secret but fulfills her role adequately. The sets costumes and production values are very high. Do you love improbable plots and unexpected humorous romance? Make a date to see Mrs. W. and you will be in your element absolutely.".

I feel they could have cast not necessarily a better actress but just one who fit into this role more properly. I just can't seem to take Lake as a serious actress. Plus I'm used to her John Waters' film roles. She portrays wacky weirdo characters alot better than a single pregnant pennyless outsider. This in my opinion is a great feel good flick perfect for those who crave silly romance comedies. I know my mother couldn't stop talking about it and loves the movie as do I. All in all... the storyline was cliche  but I tend to like simple movies. Lake's acting could have been better  she did alright considering the films she's appeared in in the past.

Mrs. W is so glad to have a grandbaby she'll believe anything. The rest of the movie is rather predictable with the usual boy falls for girlgirl tries to do noble thing and leave with babygirl comes backboy asks girl to marry himperil ensueseveryone confessescouple marries.However there are plenty of entertaining moments to enjoy. The aforementioned tango scene is worth renting it alone. Brendan Fraser personifies a REAL MAN! I wish there were more actors like him who can portray masculinity with a sense of humor and without a submachine gun. I'll take Mr. F over Brad Pitt any day. The scene where Connie's trying to leave and he makes the list is indeed charming. Well written and well acted. Ms. Lake tends to stick within a small range of emotions shock confusion joy fear but seems to hold her own.

	schema:reviewBody "First off if you want to enjoy this one be prepared to suspend disbelief. The plot hinges on a number of incredibly unlikely coincidences in the manner of '30's screwball comedies. It doesn't always work but parts of it are so hysterically funny I'd definitely recommend seeing it. The script is uneven with the first 20 minutes slow and somewhat depressing. But with the introduction of Fraser and MacLaine it perks up a whole lot. The central problem of this movie is that Ricki Lake simply isn't a strong enough actress to carry a lead role. Her Connie comes across as merely dumb rather than vulnerable and she's just not all that funny. To see how Connie should have been played watch Sandra Bullock in While You Were Sleeping playing a very similar role infinitely better. MacLaine is terrific as the ironwilled acidtongued Winterbourne matriarch but Fraser steals the show! He has  a deadpan delivery that enhances the good lines he's given but even when he's silent he's funny. He has terrifically versatile facial expressions that can push a scene from amusing to hilarious. Also Miguel Sandoval is great as the bossy flamboyant butler. There is some great sidebusiness between MacLaine Fraser and Sandoval as the two men conspire to try and keep her healthy and she sneaks around smoking and drinking. It's fluffy stuff but these 3 experienced comic performers milk it for everything it's worth. That could pretty much sum up the whole movie light on plot light on plausibility but very very funny. With a different actress exploiting Connie's comic potential this one could have been a gem. As it is it's flawed but definitely worth seeing. The tango scene alone is worth the price of the video.".

But with the introduction of Fraser and MacLaine it perks up a whole lot. The central problem of this movie is that Ricki Lake simply isn't a strong enough actress to carry a lead role. Her Connie comes across as merely dumb rather than vulnerable and she's just not all that funny. To see how Connie should have been played watch Sandra Bullock in While You Were Sleeping playing a very similar role infinitely better. MacLaine is terrific as the ironwilled acidtongued Winterbourne matriarch but Fraser steals the show! He has  a deadpan delivery that enhances the good lines he's given but even when he's silent he's funny. He has terrifically versatile facial expressions that can push a scene from amusing to hilarious. Also Miguel Sandoval is great as the bossy flamboyant butler. There is some great sidebusiness between MacLaine Fraser and Sandoval as the two men conspire to try and keep her healthy and she sneaks around smoking and drinking. It's fluffy stuff but these 3 experienced comic performers milk it for everything it's worth. That could pretty much sum up the whole movie light on plot light on plausibility but very very funny. With a different actress exploiting Connie's comic potential this one could have been a gem. As it is it's flawed but definitely worth seeing. The tango scene alone is worth the price of the video.";

Shirley McClaine shines in all of her scenes as she always does in literally every movie she is involved in. The only real problem with this movie is that sometimes the writing can become dull and as a result the scene and the comedic value in it suffers from it. Yes you have Shirley McClaine's wonderful witty humor and great acting abilities but sometimes the writing can be underwhelming and then that just brings the whole scene down. Ricki Lake was pretty good in the lead role as Connie Doyle I don't think that she's a bad actress and I don't think at all that she gave a poor performance here. Like I said I think one of the movies main problems is the underwhelming writing that can come up sometimes but I think another problem with Mrs. Winterbourne is Brendan Fraser. Now I don't mean to hate on Brendan Fraser and I think he has given some good acting performances in other films but to be honest I just didn't think he was a good fit in this movie. I didn't like the way he came across in most scenes and I just didn't like him as a character until the very end and even then he seemed to me like he was stuck in some cheesy runofthemill Hallmark movie I just thought he gave a poor performance here. 610 overall for Mrs. Winterbourne seems fair.".

The focus is on the reasons why it doesn't succeed rather than on characters and plot. In fact to use words like character and plot in connection to the Red Psalm would be misguiding.This is an example of a film where message dictates the cinematic language of the film. It is not meant to be a realistic depiction of the living conditions of the peasants in the late 19th century. Instead it tries to depict realistically the reasons and causes of such tragedies in general. The film is full of what some people would call gaffes but they are there just because it does not matter if the actor has his wristwatch on or whether the guitar has nylon strings. That kind of authenticity is only superficial.All in all The Red Psalm is an ultimately challenging viewing recommended for everyone who is looking for alternatives to Hollywood pap. It demands the attention of the viewer throughout because it is not generic in any way. Yet it is not without its flaws. It is extremely slow paced full of folk dancing and saturated with socialist propaganda. Yet features like Jancso's free flowing camera should interest at least wannabe filmmakers to this challenging and complex film.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die eminent film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote about RED PSALM being dazzlingawesomeravishingstrikingit may well be the greatest Hungarian film of its time conversely Miklos Jancso's acknowledged masterpiece THE ROUNDUP 1965  which I adore  is conspicuous by its absence in that singular pantheon. Besides the late great film critic Raymond Durgnat wrote extensively about this film in his very last article published in 2002. Furthermore Jancso' won the best direction prize at the Cannes Film Festival when Joseph Losey whom I admire a great deal was the President of the Jury and where RED PSALM was competing against such remarkable contenders as Robert Altmans IMAGES Harry Kumels MALPERTUIS Peter Medaks THE RULING CLASS and Andrei Tarkovskys SOLARIS! Why is it then that my star rating is such a lowly one? There is no doubt in my mind that this is a key work in the directors canon which makes my underwhelmed reaction all the more painful to me but frankly this is truly a case where form completely overpowers content or to put it in the apposite laymans terms a film which can only be admired but not enjoyed. The main reason for this is that the entire running time a relatively modest 81 minutes in PAL mode is taken up by Jancso's obsession with politics and folklore with no space left for any real characters to emerge much less a discernible plot line. This would hardly be a problem in itself where it not for the fact that when somebody takes a break from the constant  and by now familiar  communal dancing marathons which thankfully does mean that some of the typically stunning girls get to shed their clothing they do so only to spout a litany of Communist diatribes which completely wear the viewer and the film itself down before long. Although Jancso's exuberant visual style always had a certain aloofness to it I really didnt connect at all with any of the characters or events depicted here. In fact Id go so far as to say that this is one time where the English subtitles which in themselves are grammatically awkward and replete with spelling mistakes distinctly felt like an intrusion and their verbosity detracted from the power of the meticulously composed images. Consequently ones enjoyment of the film as a whole suffers for it and given the generic prosaic nature of the dialogue I might well consider watching the film unsubtitled in the future! Amusingly enough however the Catholic prayer of Our Father is even blasphemously transformed into a Communist credo at one point.Still this is not to say that the film is completely worthless the rebelling peasant farmers sing various songs a couple of which are in English that while lyrically are merely propagandistic are also melodically haunting. Given Jancso's penchant for lengthy traveling sequenceshots the film is said to contain a mere 26 in all! which are essentially its true raison detre some striking images cant help but stand out in particular the burning of a church by the peasants and their eventual massacre by the landowners army of defenders. Even more remarkable is Jancso' fusing his historical recreation with unexpected but decidedly welcome fantasy elements which sees dead people coming back to life with a kiss and in an unheralded uproar to which nobody retaliates an incensed peasant woman shoots several soldiers in quick succession singlehandedly etc.As a result of my disappointing viewing of RED PSALM I have decided to to take a sabbatical from Jancso' for now and postpone the three other films of his that I have in my possession to a later date by which time nevertheless hopefully I would have acquired two more".

A war musical with dancing naked women armed men choreographed walking communist folk songs and poetic settings.The film is based on peasant uprisings in Hungary that occurred between 1980 and 1910. The style is like something from a poetic theater. People hardly talk and everything is very staged. You might even say fake. Well I suspect the message of the film is in the style. It is fake because communism and its origin was fake. It was an Utopia based on a lie. Mikls Jancs was a socialist but not a communist most people confuse the two and he was critical of the direction his country was taking as can be seen in other films by him. Here he gets the communist government to finance a film that looks like a glorious praise of the origin of the party while the style is telling us that this is all a staged lie. Don't believe it any more than you believe that all these scenes are a realistic account of what happened.The music is brilliant. Folk songs many probably used in the peasant uprisings. I also liked the staging and the poetic imagery like how a stigmata wound in the hand turned into a red flower which looks like a French Revolution rosette cockade pin. And how many will die only because of one shot fired. And the use of doves as symbols of peace and harmony was beautiful. And the naked women? I guess they represent the innocence and the beauty of the peasant who in their ignorance believed in the promised land.You might not enjoy this film if you watch it as a straight communist propaganda. Watch it as a clever Trojan horse pretending to be one thing while smuggling critical social commentary and you might get much more out of it. I for one liked this film for its bravery its message poetic beauty and for being like no other musical out there.".

Whether or not this is a cinematic triumph against plot and character though as championed by many will invariably depend on your definition of cinematic. It does not meet mine at least my definition of richly cinematic worth leaving the mind behind.Here's the setup it is apparently the 1890's the place is a stretch of Hungarian plains rolling in the distance. A village of farmers has gone into a strike with a battle being fought over their soul and minds. Now and then newcomers emerge from nowhere young intellectuals who give spirited lectures on Engels and socialist theory priests with their sermons and rites soldiers of some distant  oppressive authority.The people are by turns confused and spirited bold and despairing. They lash out against each other burn a church. They pray and hold court. Now and then they sing and dance about their woes stabbing who they see as more privileged. Soldiers swell their revolutionary ranks then break out and shoot them. It all happens in circles in that same featureless plain.The allegory is stark what the Czech had been for years leveling against Nazis covert attack on the hypocrisy and tyranny of a distant state by celebrating betrayed hopes and idealism.That's all fine but for one factor. We see a lot of upheaval a lot of pain turned into song. But we are not tethered into human soul for any of it. We never know any of these people except schematically as actors on a stage. A disembodied camera liturgically roams and roams around these faces but we have no entry into the soft underbelly of actual lives.It is a matter of presentation. In The Red and the White Jancso solved this by first ushering us into a world at war with stakes and limits with blood coursing through people. So when he abstracted we were moved the right distance away from the aimless bloodspill to view a more cosmic grind.Here the abstraction is all done before we get there. The abstract world is already in place and does not transform again the sparse setting the visitations recitations and ceremonies. You don't make the jump to an ecstatic view and it has to be you.So the effect is like being taken to a room where people are calmly sitting with eyes closed and told this solemn air that you see is meditation. How do you know they're not sleeping?".

Soldiers swell their revolutionary ranks then break out and shoot them. It all happens in circles in that same featureless plain.The allegory is stark what the Czech had been for years leveling against Nazis covert attack on the hypocrisy and tyranny of a distant state by celebrating betrayed hopes and idealism.That's all fine but for one factor. We see a lot of upheaval a lot of pain turned into song. But we are not tethered into human soul for any of it. We never know any of these people except schematically as actors on a stage. A disembodied camera liturgically roams and roams around these faces but we have no entry into the soft underbelly of actual lives.It is a matter of presentation. In The Red and the White Jancso solved this by first ushering us into a world at war with stakes and limits with blood coursing through people. So when he abstracted we were moved the right distance away from the aimless bloodspill to view a more cosmic grind.Here the abstraction is all done before we get there. The abstract world is already in place and does not transform again the sparse setting the visitations recitations and ceremonies. You don't make the jump to an ecstatic view and it has to be you.So the effect is like being taken to a room where people are calmly sitting with eyes closed and told this solemn air that you see is meditation. How do you know they're not sleeping?";

Hundreds of extras dance and perform rituals on the vast Hungarian plain surrounded by galloping horses a traditional Hungarian animal as the Hungarians are heirs of the nomadic Huns. Very often the viewer is confronted by naked women walking around I am still confused as to what they symbolize...that socialism needs no violence to overtake the old regime? Another typical feature is the solemnity with which the actors converse and act no real dialog is to be found but a series of monologues. These monologues reveal what Jancso is most interested in  socialism and the equality of people. It is difficult for the viewer to keep up with them as they follow one after the other to bombard him with socialist ideology on the rights of the workers the rising of the masses the resistance etc. Jancso tries to show that socialism can peacefully convert even the officials of the old order as seen by the officer refusing to suppress the mutineers and the soldiers dancing with the crowd towards the end of the movie. Regarding the lengthy monologues on socialism a resemblance to Godard and his La Chinoise...? This movie is difficult to watch due to its complex imagery intertwined with the socialist ideology that Jancso's characters devour us with. There may appear the question whether this movie can be seen out of the context of a life in a regime glorifying socialism Hungary between 1945 and 1989. For anyone interested in moviemaking by Hungarian directors I recommend first starting with Szabo's films such as Mephisto Oberst Redl and Sunshine then going through Bela Tarr's movies and finally trying Jancso.".

Basically the story is set in the 1890s on the Hungarian plains a group of farm workers go on strike and will face harsh retaliation and experience the realities of the revolt oppression morality and violence. The iconic images I recall are many women being stripped completely naked and walking across the plains but the most significant is the image of a woman getting a gunshot in the hand her wounded hand being held in the air he hand red and the blood draining down her arm. This is later used as a statement for peace or something as many other people wear red velvet on their hands holding them in the air to represent the bloody hand as they march on the plains against whatever enemy they fight. The cast are all unknowns but they all do their parts fine the film mainly consists of 28 shots and the poignant symbolic imagery using the colour red to great effect the title relates obviously to the colour and that religious songs are sung a few times the title is also a literal translation from a poem And the People Still Ask this film may not be high profile or rated by many critics yet but it is one that should be recognised as a good interesting drama. Worth watching!".

Definitely not for the mainstream cinema goer but is it also for the art house lover? Only a hardcore alternative cinema can love this movie. But can you appreciate it? sure. Roving cameras. Complex rhythms and sudden breakouts into song and dance yet there is nothing musical about it. It is first and foremost a mood piece. To understand it you really need to know the background of the opus. This might be considered a spoiler.According to film critic Raymond Durgnat the movie is based on a series of psalms thus the title and prayers written circa 1890. They are of a socialist nature echoing such biblical models as the Lord's Prayer.END OF SPOILERKnowing the background the movie makes sense as a series of short stories each ending with the same thematic resolution. A socialist parable for chaotic times. It was the seventies after all. Using a kind of folk narrative medium kind of like performing in the village square for the elders it possesses an African or European medieval story telling technique. Hard to follow except as a tale of the lower classes versus the aristocracy and tyranny it is something short of a dictum for revolution. Refusing to explain itself it comes across as live theater packed with heavy symbolism. There is blood and lots of it. Gun shots and death. Camaderie community resistance nakedness of the soul and death. Rambling in circles at times it is laughable sprinkled with unusual sound edits curious performances and image synching. But it is all controlled by the invincible hand of Jancso who orchestrates the miseenscene like a virtuoso marionettist. Tricky intricate camera movements supposedly done in 28 shots make up the movie. It is a ballet of zoom lenses curious camera setups and resistance to the basic nature of its medium. Neither here or there on the engrossing meter scale it does present experimental cinema and a different film vocabulary. Championed by some wayward critics over the years it did win the best director at the Cannes film festival. So that is what you get. Limited story confusing actions and narrative arc in a stop and go fashion but camera tricks comparable to the best of Fellini. PS. I saw the movie on the big screen but the projectionist framed it to look like a big TV screen. It looked odd. I have no idea if this was the original framing.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film Red Psalm is more a fantastic ballet or opera than a realistic story. It portrays the revolutionary spirit in the Hungarian countryside. The events play in a feudal society where the village is constantly plundered by passing soldiers. Actually the cavalrymen are always and persistently present in the background of the sets. Whilst the soldiers make away with the lute the peasants dance make music sing and deliberate. Now and then they kill an officer a civil servant or a priest nothing to make a song and dance about. Or they are massacred themselves by the military. In short the film rejects feudalism and praises freedom. It is a glorification of peasants' uprisings not of a socialist industrial revolution. I enjoy revolutionary hymns and recognized the usual song the Marseillaise the Internationale and the Varshavyanka. Red Psalm is clearly rooted in the Leninist tradition and it shows the typical Leninist contradiction. For on the one hand the regime of the state was red tape conservative bureaucratic and official. And on the other hand the state culture glorified revolutions of all kinds. This includes the sexual revolution for again and again three naked women pop up on the scene. It also includes the invention of the wheel joke. The Leninist state itself provided a living to the people and even allowed the production of films like this one. But it ruled by command and was devoid of freedom. In summary I would not call Red Psalm a masterpiece but is is agreeable to watch. If you enjoy Leninist films consider seeing my other reviews.".

	schema:reviewBody "Up In Central Park marked a successful return to Broadway for Sigmund Romberg as this musical about the Tammany Hall era of Boss William Marcy Tweed ran for 504 performances during the 194546 season on Broadway. Instead of the elegant Vincent Price as the powerful Boss of Tammany Hall Civil War and post Civil War the part was played by Noah Beery Sr. Now that certainly would have called for a different kind of Boss Tweed.Musically what Universal Studios gave us is a half baked version of the Broadway Show. Dick Haymes and Deanna Durbin are in good voice for th Sigmund RombergDorothy Fields numbers still left but because the music is cut the emphasis of the film turns to Price.Young Deanna Durbin and her father Albert Sharpe are freshly arrived from Ireland and immediately as was the tradition back in the day welcomed to the shores by the Tammany political machine. Sharpe takes to the repeat voting the way that Brian Donlevy did in The Great McGinty but his rise only consists of becoming the superintendent of Central Park which the Tweed Ring plans to 'improve' with many kickbacks for themselves.In the meantime Durbin comes to the attention of Price but she also comes to the attention of crusading reporter Dick Haymes. They make beautiful music together and apart in what little is left of the RombergFields score.If Up In Central Park had been done at MGM it surely would have gotten the production needed for this musical. Unforgivably the big hit song of the film Close As Pages In A Book was not performed and it's a duet which I'm sure Haymes and Durbin would have been great at. I'm betting it ended on the cutting room floor. Close As Pages In A Book is heard on the soundtrack as background music There's another nice song called It Doesn't Cost You Anything To Dream that was also cut. But what I was most disappointed in was a number called The Fireman's Bride that was not included. It's a rollicking number that I have a recording of Jeanette MacDonald and Robert Merrill doing and I'm sure it must have been great on stage. When it wasn't in the film I was truly disappointed.Casting Vincent Price as Tweed was a stroke of genius. I truly think that a young woman's virtue would have been far more in danger from him than from Noah Beery. Remembering the villains Beery played on screen he would have to get really overbearing and physical which he must have on stage.As a musical Up In Central Park is disappointing but fans of Vincent Price will appreciate this actor displaying the fact he could do far more than horror films.".

The actor playing Durbin's Irish father is strictly from the Barry Fitzgerald school of ersatz Blarney.Contrary to what another reviewer said this 100 soundstange shot film shows all to clearly that Universal didn't spend much money on it. Sets are unusually limited in scope for a musical. One example In one number immigrant Durbin on the deck of a boat coming to America sings about the new countries glories. Not only is the boat deck tiny with the only backdrop a painted sky but there is not one shot showing what she is singing about what is supposedly inspiriting her song.The plot and characters are hardly realistic but work just fine for a musical. The dialog is well written better than in the majority of musicals of this era.The music what there is of it has big well written orchestrations and the fidelity is excellent on the VHS tape. Johnny Green is credited as composer music director and I believe he was head of MGM's music department at the time so I suspect Universal farmed out musical duties to MGM L.B. Mayor was father in law to Universal's chief. If so it was a good decision.As was standard practice in this era only a few of the songs written for the stage show on which the film was based made it to the film. The glaring omission is We'll Be Close As Pages In A Book which I believe is the only song from the theater production to become popular and have a life outside of the show. It's not in the film but is very prominently featured in the instrumental title music and is the music which closes the film. Makes me suspect they filmed the song but cut it before the film was released.".

It has a magnificent script about a magnate in actual fact a kind of dictator of New York City who whitewashes his money through Central Park has the puppet mayor elected by bribing immigrants just off Ellis Island to vote in the names of dead constituents and is just overall a very bad guy. He is played by Vincent Price of course softvoiced seductive and insinuating. An utter gentleman even at the end. I wish more patriots like you would come to this country he says debonairly and hilariously. Deanna Durbin is the young Irish girl with dreams of becoming an opera star. She has just arrived in New York with her illiterate father who is given the position of superintendent of Central Park because Vincent Price thinks his daughter overheard his evil plans for the city. Then enters young ambitious reporter Dick Haynes with his lovely tenor voice and he wants to bring the mighty down.So we have young budding love we have the older lecher we have filial duty and we have scathing political satire believe me. If you're strong enough to take something it belongs to you Vincent Price says and the film takes him seriously as it well might and the jokes aside Price's character is not too far off the mark.The music is pleasant the acting a sheer joy and the pacing admirable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sigmund Romberg and Dorothy Field's midtier score Decca recorded eight numbers but only used two of the four leads on their cast album but first tier wartime Broadway hit 504 performances at the New Century and Broadway Theatres from 27 January 1945 to 13 April 1946 which the movie trailer inflated to a thousand made an unusual but surprisingly pleasing transfer from stage to screen under the banner of Universal International.Because the stage show blended a tale of Irish immigration and crusading reporting with the graft and corruption of New York political boss William Marcy Tweed made infamous by editorial caricaturist Thomas Nast who more or less invented the Republican elephant and Democratic donkey and improvements to New York's big back yard Central Park Universal promoted one side of the central love triangle between the reporter Dick Haymes the female lead an Irish colleen Rosie played by Durbin and one of Tweed's nefarious henchmen who on stage MARRIED Rosie only to desert her when the inevitable scandals came but died in a street brawl to free Rosie to marry her true investigative reporter love to an affair between Rosie and the already married TWEED played with suave assurance by Vincent Price at his best  but looking nothing like the famous Nast caricatures.While the trailer proclaims the movie boasts ALL THE SPECTACLE AND SONG OF BROADWAY'S HAPPIEST MUSICAL the claim is typical Hollywood hyperbole. Much of the best known music from the show has been omitted. Although the biggest hit from the show Close As the Pages In A Book is prominently played through out the Overture under the opening credits it was cut from the film itself  apparently the robust seduction song for the rich baritone of Wilbur Evans on stage was felt wrong for the lighter instrument of big band singer Dick Haymes who was wrapping up a midlevel 40's film career. Because of video releases he may be best remembered for the films of STATE FAIR and ONE TOUCH OF VENUS but he does a nice enough job with Evans' other hits Carousel In The Park and When You Walk In The Room here.The casting of the still satisfying Durbin in her last filmed role  if nexttolast released in the lead was another minor problem. Romberg was a fine composer for her and added an excellent opening number for her character the protopatriotic I Like What I See as her ship enters New York Harbour but the film ALSO adds an aria for the colleen with operatic singing ambitions Tweed will open the door for her in addition to getting her father  Albert Sharpe star of the Broadway stage hit FINIAN'S RAINBOW a decade later Sharpe was Darby O'Gill for Disney  a job as his henchman had on stage. The number is there to show off Durbin's excellent voice and it does but since Rosie is dramatically supposed to be unready for a big opera break Durbin's obviously BEING ready undercuts Haymes' plot important contention that we need to earn what we receive.On another level however UP IN CENTRAL PARK preserves a significant part of the hit stage production it rarely gets credit for Universal International hired famed Broadway choreographer Helen Tamaris to recreate some of her Broadway staging and to judge from the production photographs of the original production she did that admirably. Tamiris is only credited on two Hollywood films this and 1952's JUST FOR YOU a Bing Crosby piece based on a Stephen Vincent Benet story. Veteran of 16 Broadway shows UP IN CENTRAL PARK was her fourth this film probably represents her best preserved work. While the delightful stage song Currier  Ives as Tweed puts the moves on Rosie is reduced to a mere song cue in the film it still introduces Tamiris' excellent Skaters' Ballet one of the highlights of the show and her energetic occasionally to the point of silliness  as at Boss Tweeds' party near the end stage based dances are well woven all through the film.At barely 88 minutes Universal International and screenwriter Karl Turnberg found it surprisingly easy to trim down a two plus hour stage story for the screen merely by cutting the main comedy subplot Rosie's social climbing friend who sang about The Fireman's Bride is nowhere to be seen and the time needed to dispose of the husband Rosie doesn't acquire in this version  the ever suave PriceTweed frees her with gracious honor when the scandals come. What remains is a surprisingly pleasant even satisfying postcard to a past not as much more innocent than today as we might like to think.One last interesting note in the film's trailer included in the VHS release there is a brief clip of an audience supposedly applauding the stage show just before the original Broadway Playbill cover is shown and most audiences will assume it is merely a stock film clip of a generic audience and theatre but if you look closely at the clip and surviving photos of the New Century Theatre the undoubtedly staged clip appears to be of that long vanished Broadway house where UP IN CENTRAL PARK played the first six months of its New York run! It's a nice touch.For a film of a significant Broadway hit UP IN CENTRAL PARK doubtless should have been in color and more respect should have been given to the real hits in the score little though they may be remembered by many today but the film remains an enjoyable curio and well worth a look  especially for fans of any of the four leads.".

She has gained a few extra pounds but her voice has also gained weight the one short operatic excerpt proves that she was becoming a proper soprano with rich full operatic voice. It's a pity she doesn't sing more in this film and also a great pity she didn't pursue career in opera as she quit movies.Why Universal didn't shoot this in full color and why they cast Dick Haynes are beyond me. This shouldn't have been a project to save money with but to spend spend spend! It's very well written and just plain interesting. The story runs smoothly and is quite multidimensional  you can understand most of the characters and their motives and even the smooth villain becomes rather sympathetic once he explains his views on life to Deanna whom he really seems to cherish. But then again Vincent Price is at his very best here sexy and handsome as the Devil and their scenes with Durbin are really sizzling so one might turn a blind eye to his evil nature and be lulled into sleep by his silky voice and seductive manners. With Dick Haynes the things get to a halt  he's obviously miscast and seems rather uncomfortable. There's no electricity between him and Deanna.This film would work well even as a straight picture. The musical numbers are only a few and even though not very memorable they blend in well with the action. Not at all a bad pastime for Durbin  Price fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Question Who is the most famousinfamous political boss in U.S. History?  I suspect that out of ten informed people the name pops up is William M. Tweed Tammany Hall Sachem from 1863 to 1874 when circumstances forced him to resign.  Tweed held many important posts in his years of ... public service.  He was a city Commissioner an alderman a New York State Senator. He was even for only one term in the middle 1850s a Congressman in Washington.  He was also a bank director and a corporation director.  He is of course best remembered for supposedly looting the city of New York out of between forty and two hundred million dollars in fraudulent contracts and kickback schemes.  Tweed was sent to prison in 1874 escaped in 1875 was recaptured in Spain in 1876 and returned to the U.S. and died in prison in 1878.There have been dozens of political bosses in our nation's history.  Senator Marcus Hanna who helped make his friend William McKinley President can be an example of a successful boss although a relatively honest and honorable one.  Matt Quay of Pennsylvania was another.  But only historians remember Hanna or Quay or Frank Hague of New Jersey or Nelson Aldrich of Rhode Island.  Tweed stands out  because of one man the cartoonist Thomas Nast. Nast was a genius in political cartooning even now his best work is still effective 102 years after his death and 133 years after his Tweed cartoons got really underway.  He took the fat somewhat vulgar looking Tweed and made him look like the human image of greed it helped that the name and the word rhymed.  It immortalized cartoonist and subject no matter what.  Tweed had three or four successors as head of Tammany Hall.  At least two of them Richard Croker and Charles Murphy were more important and powerful than Tweed ever was.  Nobody thinks of them when the term TAMMANY HALL comes up  they think of Tweed.Is this image fair?  Most historians follow Gustavus Myers account of the Tweed Rings rise and fall to this day from Myers book on Tammany Hall. Only recently has a dent been put into this account.  In 1977 TWEED'S NEW YORK was written by Leo Hershkovits and he pointed out that Tweed was working for the interests of all the newly arriving immigrant groups struggling to get settled in the U.S.  He was also backing civic improvements like the Brooklyn Bridge the Metropolitan Museum of Art Prospect and Central Parks the first attempt at a New York Subway system. His enemies suggested that his interest was in the boodling contracts he and his cohorts gave out but those same enemies were quite hostile to immigrants many were former Know Nothingsand most came from the rich part of society.  Also many were Republicans or ambitious Democrats with shady pasts they tried to hide Samuel Tilden the future Governor of New York and Presidential Candidate had been a supporter of the southern Democratic views of slavery and states rights in the Civil War.  Tilden and Tweed were enemies.  Herkovits may overstate the case but he does reduce the legend a bit.  The nature of political life in Tammany was to make profitable deals and they depended on the immigrants for votes.  However the evidence of the large scale thefts is simply not there.  The worst example of it the Tweed Courthouse behind City Hall in Manhattan overran the original two million dollar cost estimate by thirteen million dollars more.  It still suggests great corruption but not the two hundred million losses Myers throws out.  I might add that Tweed Courthouse more than has repaid it's original costs.  If you watch LAW AND ORDER in one of its various guises scenes in the courts are shot in that building.Believe it or not there have only been two films dealing at all with Boss Tweed.  More recently Jim Broadbent played Tweed in Scorsese's GANGS OF NEW YORK.  He played him as in cahoots with powerful thug and nativist! Bill the Butcher Cutter Daniel DayLewis.  Bill the Butcher was based on a real thug and killer Bill the Butcher Poole who was killed by rival gangsters at the Stanwix Hall Saloon in 1857 six years before the Civil War Draft Riots the film presents.  Tweed would never have been allied with Poole as Poole belonged to the American Party not the Democrats.  However Broadbent's Tweed at least looked more like the genuine article physically than his one predecessor.Tweed weighed over three hundred pounds his death was hastened by diabitis.  The actor playing Boss Tweed in UP IN CENTRAL PARK was Vincent Price playing him like a handsome powerful and powerhungry man.  In his dressing gown entertaining Deanna Durbin an Irish immigrant lass with education who learns that Tweed is out for his own good before anyone else Price is smooth and cultured.  No doubt Tweed was intelligent but his taste in art and literature probably did not match Price's characterization.  One wishes Price had tackled the role later in his career say about the time he did Matthew Hopkins in THE CONQUEROR WORM and possibly he could have fit the role properly.  It is hard to say.  He did not match the real Tweed.  This is not to say that he is acting poorly.  His performance gives the film some zest and even honesty when he falls he admits to Durbin that he was brought up to believe that you took what you want.  And to be fair Price's Tweed has enough guts to remain and face the consequences while his accomplices Governor Motley Thurston Hall and Mayor Oakley run off. By the way Tweed's allied Governor was Governor John T.Hoffman the last New York City Mayor to rise to the state's Governorship and the Mayor was Mayor Oakley Hall.The Sigmund Romberg score for UP IN CENTRAL PARK is not one of his best and parts of it have been deleted.  There was a number about Central Park where Durbin's father has a job through Tweed called It's the Big Backyard of the City.  Price also has a song Would You Like to See MY CURRIER  IVES which is reduced to the song cue in the dialogue before a scene ends. Durbin does her best but it is not her best film.  It is a mediocre movie which is best seen to remind oneself of the story of Tweed and his fall and how it still needs a master film maker to tell it properly.".

More recently Jim Broadbent played Tweed in Scorsese's GANGS OF NEW YORK.  He played him as in cahoots with powerful thug and nativist! Bill the Butcher Cutter Daniel DayLewis.  Bill the Butcher was based on a real thug and killer Bill the Butcher Poole who was killed by rival gangsters at the Stanwix Hall Saloon in 1857 six years before the Civil War Draft Riots the film presents.  Tweed would never have been allied with Poole as Poole belonged to the American Party not the Democrats.  However Broadbent's Tweed at least looked more like the genuine article physically than his one predecessor.Tweed weighed over three hundred pounds his death was hastened by diabitis.  The actor playing Boss Tweed in UP IN CENTRAL PARK was Vincent Price playing him like a handsome powerful and powerhungry man.  In his dressing gown entertaining Deanna Durbin an Irish immigrant lass with education who learns that Tweed is out for his own good before anyone else Price is smooth and cultured.  No doubt Tweed was intelligent but his taste in art and literature probably did not match Price's characterization.  One wishes Price had tackled the role later in his career say about the time he did Matthew Hopkins in THE CONQUEROR WORM and possibly he could have fit the role properly.  It is hard to say.  He did not match the real Tweed.  This is not to say that he is acting poorly.  His performance gives the film some zest and even honesty when he falls he admits to Durbin that he was brought up to believe that you took what you want.  And to be fair Price's Tweed has enough guts to remain and face the consequences while his accomplices Governor Motley Thurston Hall and Mayor Oakley run off. By the way Tweed's allied Governor was Governor John T.Hoffman the last New York City Mayor to rise to the state's Governorship and the Mayor was Mayor Oakley Hall.The Sigmund Romberg score for UP IN CENTRAL PARK is not one of his best and parts of it have been deleted.  There was a number about Central Park where Durbin's father has a job through Tweed called It's the Big Backyard of the City.  Price also has a song Would You Like to See MY CURRIER  IVES which is reduced to the song cue in the dialogue before a scene ends. Durbin does her best but it is not her best film.  It is a mediocre movie which is best seen to remind oneself of the story of Tweed and his fall and how it still needs a master film maker to tell it properly.";

	schema:reviewBody "UP IN CENTRAL PARK UniversalInternational 1948 directed by William A. Seiter stars Deanna Durbin in her next to last movie of her career. For her first 1948 release she stars in a lighthearted period piece based on a popular 1945 musical play of the same name by Dorothy and Herbert Fields. Aside from some changes from stage to screen regarding both story and selected song tunes the film in general is livably typical Durbin material which allows her to change from teenage Irish girl in pigtails to attractive young woman. What's most interesting here is casting Durbin opposite Vincent Price then not quite the horror film actor he was to become years later in his rare occasion cast in a musical story. Though Price would have done very well in the singing category all major vocals go to the pleasing voices by Durbin and 20th CenturyFox alumni Dick Haymes.In spite of the title the 88 minute story is not set entirely in Central Park. However it takes place in 1870s New York City where the plot introduces William Marcy Treed Vincent Price a corrupt political boss of the Tammany Hall Society advocating the re election of weak and drunken candidate Mayor Oakley Hobart Cavanaugh back in office so to resume his crooked deals. Going against Treed is New York Times reporter John Matthews Dick Haymes out to expose him but because of his lack of evidence that would stand up on court he's unable to do so. Later on a boat arriving from Europe to Ellis Island are immigrants including that of Rosie Deanna Durbin and her widower father Timothy Moore Arthur Sharpe coming to their land of opportunity where Rosie hopes to become a great opera singer. Soon after Mr. Moore is met by Regan Tom Powers one of Tweed's associates offering naive immigrants extra money voting straight candidate tickets under names of those unable to cast a ballot namely the sick and deceased even without being American citizens. Offered 2 a vote Mr. Moore earns 50 for voting 23 times for Oakley. Having fallen asleep in Tweed's office while awaiting to meet with him Treed believing Rosie has overheard him discussing with the board about embezzling funds through unnecessary renovation of Central Park gets on her good graces by offering her father a 3000 a year job as park superintendent plus living accommodations inside Central Park. As much as Rosie feels Tread to be a great man of honor it's up to Matthews who has taken an interest in the young lady to convince her otherwise.With music and lyrics by Sigmund Romberg and Dorothy Fields the motion picture soundtrack is as follows Vote for Treed sung by candidates Oh Say Do You See What I See sung by Deanna Durbinb Carousel in the Park sung by Dick Haymes and Deanna Durbin The Ice Skating Ballet photograph come to life sequence choreographed by Helen Tamiras When She Walks in the Room sung by Dick Haymes Pace Pace Mio Mio and Giuseppe Verdi's Opera LA FORZE DEL DESTINO sung by Durbin and The WaiterCanCan Dance instrumental. Though the songs are proved satisfactory including Durbin's Oh Say Do You See number and a couple of Dick Haymes song interludes they are in the most part unmemorable.While the legacy of Universal Studio rests mostly on its reputation for horror films andor Abbott and Costello comedies one of the biggest money makers for the studio since 1936 were those films starring Deanna Durbin. Making no attempt speaking with an Irish brogue which is left to the Barry Fitzgerald sounding voice of costar Arthur Sharpe Durbin's Rosie is less typical Irish stereotype than most though her Irish temper does flare up on a couple of occasions with her giving face slaps to those who make her angry. When watching Durbin playing opposite Vincent Price one would have to feel their missed opportunity for not being cast together in the sound remake of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA 1943 in place of the casting of Susanna Foster and Claude Rains. Interestingly with this combination for UP IN CENTRAL PARK that Price presence gathers the most attention with his scene stealing performance while Arthur Sharpe gets some moments to himself in a scene where he attempts to get his education by learning to read by attending school seated in a classroom surrounded by third grade students. A satisfactory presentation with authentic recreated costumes and settings that blend in perfectly with its time frame it's a wonder why it wasn't produced in Technicolor. Though UP IN CENTRAL PARK did have some limited TV revivals in the 1980s especially on public broadcasting television it did become available on video cassette in 1998 and years later on DVD as part of the Deanna Durbin collection simply indicating the Durbin name isn't as unknown or forgotten as legend may have it believed to be.

It has a lot of things to like there are a lot of omissionsWe'll be close as Pages in a Book though it's used as a cue at the end and Fireman's Bride being the glaring omissions but the music is still absolutely beautiful the sprightly Oh Say Can You See standing out. Pace Pace Mio Dio from La Forza Del Destino is beautifully sung and is one of Verdi's best but most difficult soprano arias. The script is delightfully witty and the story while not the most exceptional in the world is compelling. The choreography and dancing is professional and danced with elegance. In terms of scenes Durbin's and Price's scenes are a joy but the highlight is the great Currier and Ives ballet. Deanna Durbin is just radiant and brings girlish naivet to good effect she's in great voice too love the richness. Vincent Price is perfectly cast while he's at his best in the menacing yet sympathetic roles he'd take on later it's easy to love how suave handsome smarmy and charismatic he is. Albert Sharpe is also good. Other than the omissions of some of the best songs of Up in Central Park or reducing them to musical cues the scant length and Dick Haymes' at times likable but stiff performancehe does have a nice voice though and in all fairness his material is not as juicy as Durbin's and Price's it's in the production values where Up in Central Park falls down most on. The costumes are fine but the sets are rather stuffy and the use of locations are far too restricted any opportunities of seeing the locations properly are not used to full effect and the likes of the zoo and carousel are only seen in as much as a few shots. In conclusion a pleasant film and a good vehicle for Durbinessentially what it was billed as though Price comes extremely close to stealing the show from under her but at the same time it's disappointing. 610 Bethany Cox".

The first one I noticed was that although Rosie's dad has a thick Irish accent Rosie sounds like a nativeborn American! She didn't even attempts a trace of the Irish accent...and it made little sense. The second was that even for a Durbin film the musical numbers were dull and too high brow...especially the ballet sequence. Third and worst of all the ending was very abrupt and unsatisfying. On the positive side Vincent Price was great as the slimy Tweed and the story mildly interesting. But to me the negatives slightly outweigh the positives.".

	schema:reviewBody "Boss William Marcy Tweed is a much maligned political figure of New York City's Tammany era and in paintings and cartoons of him comes off as a rather gluttonous looking fat man corrupt in every way pear shape and form. He is one of several dozen notorious figures out of the big apple's history who is still talked about today and one which can be epitomized as the archetype of a style of government and attempted control that continues 140 something years after his time in power. For the film version of this hit Sigmund Romberg musical one overdue for revival simply for its historical coincidences of the past as aligned with the present Boss Tweed was presented as a suave and debonair man about town played by that man of many horrific faces the versatile Vincent Price who is ruthlessly charming a phrase you never hear when Boss Tweed is talked about in a historical context today. Get past that lapse of historical accuracy and the much needed color for this period romantic musical and you have a film that is a slight letdown even if its entertainment aspects are clearly present.Had this been done at MGM starring Walter Slezak as Tweed along with Gene Kelly and Judy Garland the three stars of The Pirate done the same year you would have had a Technicolor musical that could have sumptuously presented the era of Currier and Ives which they had reflected in the same year's Summer Holiday. But this was done at Universal then a popular if second string movie studio who ironically filmed two other stage musicals the same year Are You With It? and One Touch of Venus that curiously lacked the stylish touch of MGM Paramount or 20th Century Fox. As with many of the movie musical versions of hit Broadway shows at the time much of the score has been greatly edited or completely cut out and the famous ice skating ballet is only seen briefly shown to star Deanna Durbin through the picture postcards presented with the fancy glass slide projector by the lecherously inclined Price.What remains is the importance of the story the historically proven facts of the graft manipulated by Price's Tweed and how his empire of corruption falls due to the foibles of the fools around him. When you've got a no brain mayor like Hobart Cavanaugh under your thumb you have to make sure you keep a close eye on him and with blowhards like Thurstan Hall on your staff it's only a matter of time before somebody blows the lid off. That's where the conflict comes in for newspaper reporter Dick Haymes who warns Irish immigrant Albert Sharpe and his daughter Durbin of Price's villainy. Price gets on Sharpe's good side by making him the head of the Central Park Zoo and that leads Durbin into Price's clutches. I object to the casting of Price due to his total likability and obvious miscasting. An actor like Charles Coburn who had played Tweed in a short film Slezak or the original Broadway Tweed Noah Beery Sr. would have been much more appropriate and having recently seen Coburn as another legendary New York figure then New Amsterdam Peter Stuyvesent in Knickerbocker Holiday that lack of creative casting befuddles me. But for what this is entertainment wise I am perfectly fine with what was done with it. Just the lack of reality in several ways and the bland black and white photography for a colorful setting make this one a missed opportunity even if it does include a good portion of Romberg's sweet score which up until seeing this I was unfamiliar with.".

After buying a huge town house confiscated to a Roman count during the war she buys some pictures e some furnishes it elegantly giving hospitality to the count. She also goes round with an old lady whom she believes a countess. Actually that countess is a French thief who swindles Gioconda by selling her a false diamond. Gioconda finds out also the pictures she has bought are false. So she is made to abandon that style of life and thanks the count because he has always given her good advices.This is a gay neorealist film directed by Gennaro Righelli. It is based on a excellent interpretation by Anna Magnani. She acts the part of a Roman lady dazzled by her rich financial position and convinced of changing her origin. Anna Magnani represent the part of Roman low extraction popular ladies better than other part. However she was very good at dramatic roles too and she also had a notable theatrical experience. This film is excellence from all the points of view but the dialogues are all dubbed and this is its drawback. The audio is not well synchronized in lots of scenes above all in those ones where Gioconda sings. Although Anna Magnani dubs herself we cannot feel the same attraction that we could with an original audio including the background sounds which Italian productions were allowed to eliminate. Thinking about that period it has to be said that it was not possible for Italian actors playing in direct sound and unfortunately Anna Magnani was made to be dubbed too. If the films of this period were called neorealist what sort of neorealism did they represent as to the sound?".

I don't know if I could get away with saying it's one of Hitchcock's ten best features but I found it to be easily one of his top ten most entertaining. I enjoyed watching Torn Curtain a lot more than some of his established classics like Notorious and the Birds even if it's not quite as psychologically complex as those films.The main thing about Torn Curtain is the photography. It's full of pretty picturesone of the most beautifully filmed of all Hitchcock's films with lots bold swaths of primary colors and attractive and constantly changing locationssome scenes look like they were shot on location while others are wonderfully artificial studio creations and they're blended together perfectly. Another cool thing about Torn Curtain is that it's constantly on the move. It never stagnates. The pacing is deliberate but engaging. It's wellplotted and suspenseful. It's full of fantastic little directorial touches like the scene where Paul Newman ducks into a bathroom to read his secret spy message. Hitchcock never shows us the room. He keeps the camera tight on Paul Newman so we can't tell who or what might be in that room with us just out of frame. It's totally simple but it creates a highly effective feeling of uneasiness and paranoia. This movie also features one of the strangest and bestfilmed death scenes I've ever seen. Hitchcock was still on top of his game here.Most of the bad reviews for Torn Curtain seem to focus on the acting. I don't know why. A lot of people bash Julie Andrews just for being Julie Andrews and that hardly seems fair. Typecasting sucks. And while I wouldn't say she turned in one of the most memorable and overpowering performances of all time her role didn't call for that. Torn Curtain wasn't a complex character study it was a plotbased thriller. And Julie Andrews was perfectly adequate for that even pretty good when she was given a chance to be.Paul Newman was perfect. He wasn't his usual charming self here. He was grim and tightlipped and stiffas would be appropriate for a scientist feeling out of his league playing a spy in a hostile country having to pretend to be a traitora role which he found objectionableall with his girlfriend annoyingly tagging along and complicating everything. I understand that Paul Newman found working for Hitchcock objectionable. It makes me wonder if Hitch deliberately made life unpleasant for Paul just to get this kind of toothgritting performance from him. Whatever Hitch and Paul were both great.And so was this film.".

It's difficult not to conclude that the master director's age was beginning to take its toll by 1966.  It could have been a great film except for some major flaws.First the main characters.  Newman and Andrews look distinctly illatease and their acting is wooden.  There is very nearly no chemistry between them and viewers are not really drawn into their somewhat implausible situation. Both actors are compelling in other films but for some reason not in this one.Second Hitchcock would have done better to keep his villains' identity less specific.  In The Lady Vanishes The Thirtynine Steps and North by Northwest the identity of the foreign agents is left deliberately vague and thus little plausibility need be attached to their actions.  Here they are East German communists of which we know rather a lot.Third there are inconsistencies in the plot.  At one point Newman and Andrews are forced to go out into an open space to avoid being overheard. But in another scene a prowestern spy communicates confidential information to Newman in a hospital room seemingly oblivious to the possibility of wiretaps.Finally there's John Addison's score which seems to have been written quite independently of the film's action.  A suspenseful scene is inappropriately matched with cheerful melodic music.  Everyone knows of course that Hitch's longtime musical collaborator Bernard Herrmann wrote a mostly complete score for the film but the two had a falling out on the set and Herrmann was dismissed.  Another example of poor judgement on Hitchcock's part.  Herrmann's score would have immeasurably improved a mediocre film.  Look at Obsession nearly a decade later.  With all the recent film restorations I would love to see someone redo Torn Curtain and put in as much of Herrmann's score as the composer was able to finish. But perhaps there would be copyright problems.  Had Herrmann's score been used the murder sequence in the farmhouse might have become as famous as the shower scene in Psycho.As I was watching the protagonists flee through the East German landscape in their efforts to reach the west I found myself thinking that if they had only waited another twentythree years the wall would have come down anyway and they could simply have walked out!  That's how much their plight gripped me.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hitchcock's 50th movie Torn Curtain is considered by many experts to be a major disappointment but I didn't see it that way.  It is not one of Hitch's top 10 but it is still a very good movie.  Both Paul Newman and Julie Andrews give fine performances and I loved Ludwig Donath who was excellent.  The scene in which Professor Armstrong murders Gromek is classic Hitchcock and the blackboard scene between Newman and Donath is great too. I think that this movie suffers from the fact that the 2 main stars were really mismatched for Hitch.  There is a story that Hitchcock along with his wife insisted that Newman drink wine with them.  Newman refused wanting a beer instead and he wanted to drink it from the can!  This request mortified Hitch and his wife.  Needless to say those 2 had their differences.  As for Andrews she was suffering from Keanu Reeves syndrome.  Keanu Reeves syndrome is when an actor or actress is hugely successful in a role and then is never taken seriously in any other role especially something radically different e.g. Reeves as Ted in Bill  Ted's Excellent Adventure was never taken seriously in movies like Speed Point Break etc.  The same for Andrews who was coming off Mary Poppins and The Sound of Music.  This is unfair but it is true.  I feel that if this movie was remade with 2 people who were more suited to the roles then this become a masterpiece.".

	onyx:emotionText "Hitchcock's 50th movie Torn Curtain is considered by many experts to be a major disappointment but I didn't see it that way.  It is not one of Hitch's top 10 but it is still a very good movie.  Both Paul Newman and Julie Andrews give fine performances and I loved Ludwig Donath who was excellent.  The scene in which Professor Armstrong murders Gromek is classic Hitchcock and the blackboard scene between Newman and Donath is great too. I think that this movie suffers from the fact that the 2 main stars were really mismatched for Hitch.  There is a story that Hitchcock along with his wife insisted that Newman drink wine with them.  Newman refused wanting a beer instead and he wanted to drink it from the can!  This request mortified Hitch and his wife.  Needless to say those 2 had their differences.

The story of a double agent and his involvement on both side of the political wall was too convoluted and too unfocused to create any real tension any suspense and according to accounts Hitchcock became totally uninterested with the product. So did I on viewing this.The introductory setup is good. Michael Armstrong Paul Newman defects to East Germany and his girlfriend Julie Andrews follows. There he meets Gromek Wolfgang Kieling who has been sent to do away with him. Their encounter leads to one of the most excruciating murder sequences committed to celluloid and this is by far the best part of the movie. From there on the plot meanders and it's as if Hitchcock had decided to go on autopilot and let matters resolve themselves most notably in a lousy theatre sequence in which Armstrong in an escape sequence yells Fire! into a room full of nonEnglish speakers.That it could have been better is obvious but I believe Hitchcock had succumbed to the times and was in his short Cold War transition in which some of his technique shows but his choice of actors and story fails. Newman and Andrews have zero chemistry together and Andrews at times doesn't seem to know why the hell she's in this movie anyway. Lila Kedrova sticks out as a sore thumb  why would a countess of all people be panhandling for American sponsors when her diplomatic status would have her able to come to the US with no problem? A complete distraction. Snippets of the theatre sequence are interesting as when ballerina Tamara Toumanova whirls around in dance and spots Newmann hiding among the crowd in photographic freezeframes she pinpoints him out.Other than that this is a fairly routine effort like the many routine efforts directors sometimes do when they're either in an unsettled period or want to buy themselves out of their contract with a studio. Hitchcock would do one more Cold War themed film the disastrous TOPAZ before returning to almost full form and his English roots in FRENZY.".

	schema:reviewBody "Torn Curtain 1966Hitchcock was on an odd path in the 1960s toward more contained and artificial films beginning in a way with North by Northwest a masterpiece of control for sure but getting overtly stylized in Birds and Marnie. Here in a bizarre casting choice we replace the doubtfully capable Tippi Hedron with doubtfully appropriate Julie Andrews fresh out of The Sound of Music. And of course there is Paul Newman who had recently filmed Harper and before that Hud. A weird mix and it has its moments. In fact the chemistry between the two leads in the first scenes is surprising and you might expect or want more of that later onand you won't get it.Add to these actors a tense milieu from the time Cold War defections and the atom bomb and you have an intriguing basis for making a movie. You can see why he gave it a go. The plot for what it's worth is ultimately thin and not convincing hints of Cloak and Dagger with Gary Cooper way back in 1946 but Newman at least pulls off his role as Dr. Armstrong atomic scientist with intense restraint. Andrews? She doesn't sing and there are no children to be seen except briefly on Hitchcock's lap in his cameo! and frankly sadly she comes off a little out of her element. But then her character as Armstrong's assistant is also meant to be a bit out to sea. We don't see too much of her. We do see lots of various bit characters little known and not very interesting men mostly with Swedish or German accents. I say it that way because they are almost just cardboard props for types of peopleyou know those cold hearted Stasi types or the cool and cunning Swedes you can't quite figure out neither of which is especially true or helpful for the plot.Of course Hitchcock doesn't intend to make this a Cold War commentary. The Spy Who Came in from the Cold with Richard Burton the previous year is the film to see for that. Hitchcock uses the East German scene as a backdrop for the suspense of deception and of ordinary people trying not to get caught a perennial theme he manages so well. Besides Newman there is a fabulous small role by the great Soviet actress Lila Kedrova that brings the last half hour to life. In the middle of the movie there is one scene that's totally brilliant and wordless with Newman and Carolyn Conwell in a farmhouse and it's worth the ride alone. Don't miss that for the world.This can't be Hitchcock's or Newman's or Andrews's best movie for a lot of reasons. But it's a very good movie which is enough for most of us and an essential for any Hitchcock fan and a enlightening surprise for anyone who thinks they know Paul Newman and want to see yet more of his impressive range.".

Here in a bizarre casting choice we replace the doubtfully capable Tippi Hedron with doubtfully appropriate Julie Andrews fresh out of The Sound of Music. And of course there is Paul Newman who had recently filmed Harper and before that Hud. A weird mix and it has its moments.

	schema:reviewBody "Too bad Hitchcock had to create this film in 1966. The spy vs. spy craze was at its height with superspy James Bond played by ebullient Sean Connery at the top of the movie ladder. Dozens of Cold War espionage thrillers were marketed that year. Even nonspy films touched on espionage from time to time. Adding to the spy mill in 1966 were several espionage television series including the classic spy spoof show Get Smart created by the comedic giants Mel Brooks and Buck Henry. So to most movie goers of the day Torn Curtain was just another film capitalizing on the spy vs. spy trend. Torn Curtain however is one of Hitchcock's best with two scenes that are among his most intense the almost endless killing of communist agent Hermann Gromek played with skill by Wolfgang Kieling and the bus getaway that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The crying fire in a crowded theater is exciting but predictablethe viewer is just waiting for Professor Michael Armstrong Paul Newman to jump from his seat and yell. Lovely Julie Andrews has a juicy role as Dr. Sarah Louise Sherman the soon to be Mrs. Armstrong if the good professor doesn't run away and leave her. When my wife watched this movie for the first time she asked in a surprising tone of voice Is that really Paul Newman and Julie Andrews together? This unlikely combination works. It works better than the movies Newman made with his wife Joanne Woodward. The role of Dr. Sherman is also somewhat unique in that she is unwittingly involved in espionage without her knowledge following her fiance to Communist East Germany without knowing that he is on an extremely dangerous assignment which only a nuclear scientist can carry out. Hitchcock's film making was beginning to taper off in the twilight of his years. But the masterful hand was still orchestrating film techniques highly original and creative. Lesser directors would have used just anyone to play the small but significant part of the prima donna Countess Kuchinska. Instead Hitchcock searched and found just the right person with the right face and attitude for the role. Lila Kedrova was chosen because she could actually sing opera and because her face and mannerisms stand out in a crowd. In her first appearance when she is getting off the plane she becomes agitated because Professor Armstrong is receiving all the attention from the press. Hitchcock zooms the camera in for a closeup of her face with its distinctive features. It's well over an hour later that Countess Kuchinska reappears. This reappearance is crucial for the development of the film. Because of Hitchcock's methods the viewer automatically recognizes the Countess instantly remembering that she had been upset with Professor Armstrong because of all the attention taken away from her and showered on the professor. She definitely has an ax to grind.Though it has not received much attention compared with many other Hitchcock films Torn Curtain is among his best and should be savored by all. Even though political conditions have flip flopped since 1966 and there is no longer a communist East Germany this Cold War delicacy is worth a bite. Oh and watch the somewhat hidden ironic humor at the beginning where there's a room full of top scientists during the Cold War and the heat doesn't work.".

It's natural to want to rehabilitate one or other of these and most fans and critics following of course Franois Truffaut pick Marnie.  But the real hidden gem is Torn Curtain.People have found all manner of trivial things to complain about.  The leads it is said aren't Hitchcock leads.  Julie Andrews certainly isn't unlike most of Hitchcock's American actresses she imbues her character with warmth and good sense qualities that may well be out of place in other films  certainly they'd be out of place in Marnie  but which are needed here.  And Paul Newman is as convincing and sympathetic a Hitchcock hero as any other.  ANY other including my personal favourite Robert Donat.  It's hard not to like Jimmy Stewart and Cary Grant but this cannot be denied for some reason they're never at their best in Hitchcock films.  Paul Newman is.Then there's the score  everyone has to take turns sinking their boots into the musical score.  Yes it's not by Bernard Herrmann.  Yes Bernard Herrmann was unceremoniously dumped from the project.  Yes Bernard Herrmann was one of Hollywood's best composers.  Yes if his score had been used instead not that I've heard it it would probably have changed the character of the film.  For the best?  That's hard to say.  There's more than one musical personality capable of complementing a Hitchcock film and if you ask me Mikls Rzsa Spellbound and John Williams Family Plot writing very differently do just as well as Herrmann would have with similar material.  John Addison's score for Torn Curtain isn't quite as good but it's pleasant and it casts a warm glow over chilly grey surroundings just as the photography does.  And everyone admits the photography is wonderful  Technicolor greys and beiges with flashes of red.  Hitchcock had never been quite this good with colour before.  And no wonder.  I just noticed this in the credits the production designer was the Hein Heckroth  in fact it was his last film.  His first was The Red Shoes.Moreover it's one of Hitchcock's better stories.  A man is sent to a foreign country on a mission he finds distasteful his girlfriend follows him suspicious about what he's planning to do they must escape together.  It's one of those stories where we can happily follow one party or the other without feeling cheated out of the other storyline.  It was Hitchcock's first stab at the distasteful mission theme since The Secret Agent 1936 which was a failure  not BECAUSE the hero's mission was distasteful to us but simply because it wasn't a good film in other regards.  Hitchcock was wrong to think that when a character does dirty things we'll cease to like him.  There's such a thing as moral sympathy the compromising moral position into which Michael is pushed makes us care about him all the more.I'll never understand critical consensus about Hitchcock.  When he takes one of his successful British films The 39 Steps one that can hardly be improved upon and makes a pale imitation of it North by Northwest critics and audiences cheer.  When he takes one of his weaker and more muddled British films and turns it into gold nobody not even Hitchcock himself has a kind word to say.  I don't get it.  Torn Curtain has two fantastic scenes as good as anything Hitchcock ever did the fight with Gromek the consultation with the East German scientist and one of his best bitpart characters the older middleaged woman who wants to migrate to America.  And there's nothing  NOTHING  wrong with the rest of it.".

I love how we find out things in this movie as Sarah Julie's character finds them out particularly about the real reason Michael Paul's character and Sarah's assistantfiance is in East Germany.  It has all the suspense of Hitchcock's best films and even though you're pretty sure what's going to happen at the end just knowing that Hitchcock directed it makes you question until the end.  Could have gotten by just fine without Julie's bushy hairdo but for a chance to gaze into Paul Newman's eyes I'll take what I must.  The chemistry between the two stars isn't like hers with Christopher Plummer or his with Joanne Woodward but it's not a total fizzle either.  They're believably in love and if they weren't the movie wouldn't work since Sarah would have much less of a reason to care about what happens to Michael.

This got me to thinking about why these scenes were included. Obviously the woman slowed down their escape and drew attention at the post office.

Look at all the masterpieces the man has on his filmography list  from the classic Secret Agent and 39 Steps to Rebecca and Lifeboat to Strangers on a Train and Psycho to The Birds and Marnie.  The man NEVER had a BAD movie.  Torn Curtain possesses all aspects of classic Hitchcock  interesting locations clever storyline suspense humor stellar acting stars music among other features.  Perhaps this movie was criticized on preproduction.  Julie Andrews was under contract and her shooting time was very limited.  This posed a problem for Hitchcock who had to rush into production.  Hitchcock also had a problem with his newly trained actor Paul Newman who would always have it his way or the highway.  Torn Curtain is highly supsenseful and on DVD is a gem.  Presented in widescreen it also features the trailer a documentary and scenes with Bernard Herrmann's unused score.  Thank god Herrmann didn't get the job to score this movie  as much as Herrmann proved to be perfect for classics like Vertigo and Marnie known as his best  he was way out of his league here.  Torn Curtain was very ahead of it's time dealing with suspense romance and the Cold War.  John Addison performed an excellent score fitting the movie well with the recurring theme that can either make you jump or cry.  Andrews was excellent good to see she can also do straight movies without music as was Newman and the ensemble.  See it on DVD. ".

Paul Newman has a great performance in the role of a scientist obsessed to resolve the problem with some missiles but unfortunately Julie Andrews is wasted in the role of a silly woman and her participation is limited to complicate the situation of her fianc. The scene with the fight of Armstrong and the farmer's wife with Gromek is very tense and one of the best moments. The escape of Armstrong and Sherman in the bus of the Pi Organization is also exciting despite the dated technology of rear projection.

He is neither hero nor antihero. He is a waste of space. And the directionless movie can't even make up its mind on how to portray him because even though it disparages higher learning at every turn the disparagement is in direct opposition to the plot of the movie itself where Billy needs to graduate i.e. display that he has learned in order to claim his inheritance.And the smokin' blond first grade teacher Bridgette Wilson  instead of considering him the illiterate moron he is for trying to pass first grade  falls for him.

Directed nominally by Tamra Davis from an unfunny script by Tim Herlihy and Sandler Herlihy would go on to write all Sandler's comedies until 2002 Billy moves up through the grades via a montage not actually doing tests or learning anything but through attending camp playing basketball writing derogatory notes about the ugliness of his fourth grade teacher and having lice exams.Is it even worthwhile wasting my server space on this review or you frying your braincells reading it or Adam Sandler pretending to act in it?

They knew while making it that it wouldn't be an Oscar winner nor would it be the next Citizen Kane nor is it suppose to be some intriguing and involved plot but it in return has rightfully earned itself a major cult classic status among youth and film lovers since it's release. It has also become one of the most quoted and memorable films over the past 12 years.It's about a 27yearold man who makes a bet with his dad that if he repeats and passes grades 112 Where is K? he will take over for his dad's hotel company instead of his dad's obnoxious and sociopathic friend Erik played to perfection by Bradley Whitford despite Billy not having any experience in the field at all.... The film from there follows him in each grade.Does that sound like much of a plot? No. It is inept idiotic unrealistic and bizarre but it is one of the funniest movies ever made. It has endless amounts of memorable gags that will make you laugh over and over again it has the type of sense of humor that makes you laugh because it is so damned strange and nonsensical. Most of its gags rely on a hybrid of black humor and slapstick that produces hysterical results.I feel like I'm 10 years old quoting the movie to all of my friends but it's the type of movie that will make you do that. If you are in the mood for a very good and thought provoking movie this isn't your movie but if you are in the mood to laugh your ass off and not pay attention to how good it actually is... here is your movie.But that aside Billy Madison isn't just awful like many other goofball comedies of the 90's and 00's it is very entertaining and memorable... because it just manages to really make you laugh. And it's not dumb characters making stupid mistakes like Black Sheep for example just very weird characters making What the hell was that?! situations.".

	schema:headline " Mostly irritating with barely a laugh being registered MINOR SPOILERS";
	schema:reviewBody "Billy Madison Adam Sandler is the selfish obnoxious heir to a multimillion pound hotel chain that was set up by Billy's late mother and his father Brian Madison Darren McGavin. Billy's father is set to retire soon and opts to leave one of his employees Eric Gordon Bradley Whitford in charge of his business upon his retirement. Billy objects to this believing that he should be placed in charge of his father's business. Brian doesn't believe that Billy is responsible enough or smart enough to run the business but agrees to give him full control of the business if he can pass grades 112 in 24 weeks. Eric wants the business for himself and will stop at nothing to ensure that Billy fails this challenge.Even if you're prepared to ignore the obvious flaws in the plot a father handing his business over to his selfish and obnoxious son who has no business acumen and has had no prior involvement in running the company merely on the strength of him graduating from school. A teacher falling for a manchild rerunning grades 112 who is even more immature than the kids who he attends school with then the film still isn't very good. For the most part it relies on Sandler being in OTT mode and doing his utmost to make his character as irritating as possible. This is great from an 'acting' perspective but ultimately makes him difficult to endure across the running time.The idea of Sandler graduating 12 years worth of school in a matter of weeks certainly isn't a bad one and perhaps would have worked better if more thought would have been put into the concept. I personally felt that it would have been funnier if the film would have shown more examples of Billy failing and struggling his way through school  I found it perplexing that Billy was portrayed as being rather simpleminded from the outset but yet the film also represented him as a bit of a smartass at times which was puzzling. He seems to get through each school year far too easily and there also seemed to be a big continuity gap as well at one point he seems to jump about 4 school years in one go!!!! I also wasn't impressed by the fact that Sandler kept the majority of the focus on him he has a whole host of children as supporting actors but gives them absolutely nothing to do. It perhaps would have been better if he'd given a couple of the youngsters more defining roles so that he would have had people that he could have bounced off and built up something more in the way of a rapport with some of the youngsters. It seems rather arrogant and unfair for Sandler to give the rest of the cast so little to do he clearly thought at this point in his career that he was strong enough to carry this sort of project on his own but he simply can't and it really shows here.The film also substitutes intelligence and insight in favour of Sandler's overacting to the ninth in a performance that was more irritating than funny. He has a lisp in this film like his character had in The Waterboy but in Billy Madison it seems to come and go at will.Naturally with this type of plot there has to be a bad guy and the bad guy here is Eric who stops at nothing to prevent Billy from prevailing at the challenge that he's been set by his father and naturally sets about trying to scupper Billy's chances of succeeding. In this instance it is the head teacher that is used as a plot device as Eric digs some dirt on him although the reveal here is imaginative it is utterly ludicrous and not even remotely believable. There are also things in here that feel a bit random  such as an impromptu singsong which felt more at home in a musical and a final act that again was more stupid than funny.The only scene I actually liked was the 'peeing in the pants scene' and that was because that scene actually contained something in the way of pathos and actually had something to say it's a pity there were not more examples of this in the rest of the film. I also thought Bradley Whitford put in a solid performance as Eric and most of the time I found him fun to watch. However these are the only real positives I could find in this film.I'm not someone who is normally an 'Adam Sandler' hater heck I'm one of the few people who defended the first 2 Grown Ups films but Billy Madison is really lame and relies far too much on Sandler mugging and being OTT which unfortunately isn't enough to carry the film or make it worth watching.".

There is however a difference between a goofy comedy and 90 minutes of letting the kids run loose. This movie is so bad on every level the script the lame humour the bad acting and horrible cinematography that it is hard to fathom how anyone over the age of 10 walked away from the final cut thinking they had accomplished something. Clearly based on some of the other reviews this movie more than found an audience so anything I might say will only appeal to certain movie goers.Lesson 1 in any movie is that the viewer has to identify with at least some of the characters most importantly the lead character. Unfortunately there is nothing interesting redeeming or funny about the character of Billy Madison so there was no desire to watch him succeed. Unlike the Happy Gilmore character Billy Madison is nothing more than a driveling idiot from the start of the movie to the end.I had avoided watching this movie for years because I figured it would be rather bad but I figured that my kids after watching and liking Happy Gilmore would get a kick out of it. After 30 minutes my 6 year old leaned over and said I think this must be his first movie. 'Nuff said.".

He's perfectly cast as a young man manchild really forced to go back to grade school in order to inherit the family fortune. Why? Because Billy is such a dipstick that his daddy had to pay off his teachers to pass him the first time around. Now the jig is up and Billy must prove he's got what it takes to get through each grade on his own. Come on be honest... how can you resist that premise?Along the way Billy makes nonsensical inspirational speeches accepts a dare to touch his teacher's boob yes the same teacher... and yes Sandler was just as keen on boob jokes a decade ago and somehow makes it cool to pee your pants.

That the film is little more than a childish mishmash of bathroom and boob jokes.Is that a fair assessment? Objectively speaking you'd have to think so. But that doesn't make it a bad movie. Sandler wasn't trying to create something that would make the Turner Classic Movies lineup fifty years from now. He was trying to make a certain and surprisingly broad audience laugh and in that he succeeded.

	schema:reviewBody "Billy MadisonStory of a 27 years old spoilt brat of a billionaire  an owner of Madison Group of hotels  who  being fed up of his son's childish tactics decides to give away the power of attorney to one of his cunning subordinates. This comes to his son as a rude shock and he asks his father to give him a chance to prove himself. To this his father tells him of his brainlessness  dullness and the fact that he had somehow managed to pass each grade in his school with the help of his father's influence and money !Billy challenges his father that he will go through each grade for 2 weeks and pass it on his own or else the cunning subordinate will be made the hotel incharge .So begins Billy's silly journey 'back to school'. He disturbed the class made asinine remarks and basically tried to prove to the world that acquiring knowledge is basically futile for a rich boy  as he is assured of his future because of his rich father. Each grade he passed he threw a lavish party for his friends from all age groups  showed the utter wastage that the rich people make. Some shocking revelations were as follows  1. the principal of the school gives him a valentine's card  and gave him hints of his homosexulism ! shows what kind of principals the schools abroad have !!Other girls in the age group of 911 gave him Valentine's card and looked at him rather flirtatiously  which is unexpected from that age group  shows that in the US  children mature sexually a bit too fast 2.

This comes to his son as a rude shock and he asks his father to give him a chance to prove himself. To this his father tells him of his brainlessness  dullness and the fact that he had somehow managed to pass each grade in his school with the help of his father's influence and money !Billy challenges his father that he will go through each grade for 2 weeks and pass it on his own or else the cunning subordinate will be made the hotel incharge .So begins Billy's silly journey 'back to school'. He disturbed the class made asinine remarks and basically tried to prove to the world that acquiring knowledge is basically futile for a rich boy  as he is assured of his future because of his rich father. Each grade he passed he threw a lavish party for his friends from all age groups  showed the utter wastage that the rich people make. Some shocking revelations were as follows  1. the principal of the school gives him a valentine's card  and gave him hints of his homosexulism ! shows what kind of principals the schools abroad have !!Other girls in the age group of 911 gave him Valentine's card and looked at him rather flirtatiously  which is unexpected from that age group  shows that in the US  children mature sexually a bit too fast 2.

It is my number 1 personal favorite action film it is right there with the Rambo films. This is ultimate awesome 80's movie one of the best movie ever. It is rated R action film with special effects doesn't deal with CGI you have a lot of action blood squibs business mens. Good cop been blow away and he is pieces together part human part machine ultimate action film ever. Great Music Score by Basil Poledouris I absolutely love the theme for the RoboCop. Peter Weller is Officer Alex J. MurphyRoboCop the only one. The film has a satire and a message in here.You'll see lots of heavy automatic shot guns handguns and explosive weapons with multiple huge explosions with thousands of bullets fired in this movie. Bob Morton Miguel Ferrer is the heart of this film and I love him so much.They are now making RoboCop Returns which will ignore RoboCop 2 and I think it will be a horrible movie. The movie it self has heart and soul in it the fact is you have a human being who loses his humanity and it brought back to life he is resurrected and he is a superhuman super cop who once again regains his humanity and his trouble been robot and human. You really feel sad for Alex who loses his family and everything.As film as goes when a good cop Officer Alex J. Murphy Peter Weller gets blown away by ruthless thugs innovative scientist OCP Omni Consumer Products piece him together as an unstoppable crimefighting cyborg called RoboCop. But while cleaning up the streets of violenceravaged Detroit RoboCop is tormented by memories of his former life and now he's out for more than justice...he wants revenge.RoboCop is my comic book hero my childhood hero and the movie I grew up with it. This is the best movie ever my all time favorite action movie. It is the best of the best of all time. Clarence J. Boddicker Kurtwood Smith is really one of the best bad guys ever you want to party with him. I love the 80's movies and this is my movie. I love the RoboCop suit design and I absolutely love The Enforcement Droid Series 209 or ED209 are a fullyautomated series of peacekeeping machines created by Omni Consumer Products. The design for ED209 is brilliant and the best thing off the film. I love it.I grew up with this movie it has a special place in my heart and I love it to death. Here you have everything brilliant story good actors stunts puppetry models and good Special Effects. This is Paul Verhoeven and Peter Weller's best movie from the 80's they ever made. I used to had this movie on VHS the Rated R version but over the years the tape was eaten from VHS recorder so that I couldn't watch the movie properly anymore. 3 years earlier I got this movie on Bluray Unrated director's cut and my Bluray player scratched and eat the Bluray disc so I purchased the director's cut again on Bluray and I was blown away with the movie how good it is.You have great dialogues one liners great bad guys wonderful actors Peter Weller Nancy Allen Dan O'Herlihy Ronny Cox Kurtwood Smith Miguel Ferrer Robert DoQui Ray Wise Felton Perry Paul McCrane  Jesse D. Goins Del Zamora and Calvin Jung.I love that the movie it self's shows the future and the corporations that the city is lead by OCP Omni Consumer Products. This is the best the only film of the sequels and it was rebooted and reboot failed to be a RoboCop film. Paul Verhoeven directed this film with joy and passion one of the best films of all time. 1010 my personal favorite action film of all time.".

The list is endless. Granted the stop motion effects of ED209 look quite old today but you have to remember we're talking about a movie made in 1987. RoboCop has its faults like the rather embarrassing toxic waste scene but they are easily forgiven compared to all the good things.You must be thinking What is this guy on? It's just a dumb little action flick about a cyborg! .. Relax take a deep breath and watch it again.

	schema:reviewBody "RoboCop 1987 is the finest cyberpunk action movie one of my favorite films of all time. I grew up with this movie it has a special place in my heart and I love it to death. Here you have everything brilliant story good actors stunts puppetry models and good Special Effects. This is Paul Verhoeven and Peter Weller's best movie from the 80's they ever made. I used to had this movie on VHS but over the years the tape was eaten from VHS recorder so that I couldn't watch the movie properly anymore. 3 years earlier I got this movie on Bluray Unrated director's cut and my Bluray player scratched and eat the Bluray disc so I purchased the director's cut again on Bluray and I was blown away with the movie how good it is. RoboCop it's not an action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a 50 million budget in 1987! with multiple huge explosions with hundreds of bullets fired and scores of stuntmen used. 30 year's anniversary is coming in July since the movie was released and it is a shame that Miguel Ferrer aka Bob Morton died this year in January R.I.P. we miss you. This movie is what it is a perfect 10 because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task.The movie it self has heart and soul in it the fact is you have a human being who loses his humanity and it brought back to life he is resurrected and he is a superhuman super cop who once again regains his humanity and his trouble been robot and human. When Alex Murphy Peter Weller takes off his helmet we see a sad mourning man who lost everything. I felt really sorry for Alex who was shot and killed I was really moved and sad by his death who lost his family. Peter Weller stars in the film as Alex Murphy a Detroit police officer who after being gunned down by a vicious gang is resurrected by a megacorporation as the cybernetic law enforcement officer of the future. As he begins his new life as RoboCop Murphy starts to regain a bit of his humanity with the help of his former partner Anne Lewis Nancy Allen. The popularity of the RoboCop character would spawn a RoboCop franchise consisting of among other media two more feature films a 1994 liveaction series two animated television series a fourpart movie miniseries as well as a 2014 remake.Actors Peter Weller Nancy Allen Ronny Cox Kurtwood Smith and Miguel Ferrer do all job well and they deliver the movie as an entertaining action flick. I love the puppetry of droid ED209 who has a lot of fire power and the costume and the suit for RoboCop was beautiful designed. Themes that make up the basis of RoboCop include media influence gentrification corruption authoritarianism greed privatization capitalism identity dystopia and human nature. It is an rated R action film and I wish there would be movies like this today. I love the Music score by Basil Poledouris which it is my favorite score and it is a classic orchestra. The stunts are completely insane in scale we have a lot of glass scenes like Ed209 fires cannon guns on Robo and he flies trough glass door. Robo fires his gun on Dick Ronnie Cox and he flies trough window. Robo punches a terrorist in mayor's office and he falls from the window. Of course this wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it and it's perfectly done. The gunplay is delivered in perfect Verhoeven style as opposed to the slomo John Woostyle  you'll see lots of heavy automatic shotguns and explosive cannon weapons and you'll see them used well. The film is violent and bloody with real blood squibs.It is also up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. One often sees great performances in mediocre films... here the story transcends the performances  an impressive feat. The script delivers. The film is absolutely filled with great classic moments I counted TEN allstar ones during my last viewing and they're evenly spaced through the movie. I love how RoboCop prevents two armed robberies a rape which he shoots the rapist in the dick he bust a drug factory on by him self he stops and punches a terrorist and saves the hostages in the mayor office he stops a violent gang by himself and he stops a corrupt business man. Best scene ED209 moves its right gunarm cannon on RoboCop Peter Weller but Robo grabs it and shoves it away just before ED fires. ED continues firing as Robo shoves the gun towards ED's left gunarm destroying it. ED209 fires one of its missiles at RoboCop. The missiles were actual rockets guided with wires. RoboCop is a 1987 American cyberpunk action film directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner. The film stars Peter Weller Nancy Allen Dan O'Herlihy Kurtwood Smith Miguel Ferrer and Ronny Cox. RoboCop 1987 is a classic one of the best action films my all time favorite action films of mine that defines my childhood. This movie has a heart and that you cannot deny. Plus it simply rocks. 1010".

	onyx:emotionText "RoboCop 1987 is the finest cyberpunk action movie one of my favorite films of all time. I grew up with this movie it has a special place in my heart and I love it to death. Here you have everything brilliant story good actors stunts puppetry models and good Special Effects. This is Paul Verhoeven and Peter Weller's best movie from the 80's they ever made. I used to had this movie on VHS but over the years the tape was eaten from VHS recorder so that I couldn't watch the movie properly anymore. 3 years earlier I got this movie on Bluray Unrated director's cut and my Bluray player scratched and eat the Bluray disc so I purchased the director's cut again on Bluray and I was blown away with the movie how good it is. RoboCop it's not an action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a 50 million budget in 1987! with multiple huge explosions with hundreds of bullets fired and scores of stuntmen used. 30 year's anniversary is coming in July since the movie was released and it is a shame that Miguel Ferrer aka Bob Morton died this year in January R.I.P. we miss you. This movie is what it is a perfect 10 because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task.The movie it self has heart and soul in it the fact is you have a human being who loses his humanity and it brought back to life he is resurrected and he is a superhuman super cop who once again regains his humanity and his trouble been robot and human. When Alex Murphy Peter Weller takes off his helmet we see a sad mourning man who lost everything. I felt really sorry for Alex who was shot and killed I was really moved and sad by his death who lost his family. Peter Weller stars in the film as Alex Murphy a Detroit police officer who after being gunned down by a vicious gang is resurrected by a megacorporation as the cybernetic law enforcement officer of the future. As he begins his new life as RoboCop Murphy starts to regain a bit of his humanity with the help of his former partner Anne Lewis Nancy Allen. The popularity of the RoboCop character would spawn a RoboCop franchise consisting of among other media two more feature films a 1994 liveaction series two animated television series a fourpart movie miniseries as well as a 2014 remake.Actors Peter Weller Nancy Allen Ronny Cox Kurtwood Smith and Miguel Ferrer do all job well and they deliver the movie as an entertaining action flick. I love the puppetry of droid ED209 who has a lot of fire power and the costume and the suit for RoboCop was beautiful designed. Themes that make up the basis of RoboCop include media influence gentrification corruption authoritarianism greed privatization capitalism identity dystopia and human nature. It is an rated R action film and I wish there would be movies like this today. I love the Music score by Basil Poledouris which it is my favorite score and it is a classic orchestra. The stunts are completely insane in scale we have a lot of glass scenes like Ed209 fires cannon guns on Robo and he flies trough glass door. Robo fires his gun on Dick Ronnie Cox and he flies trough window. Robo punches a terrorist in mayor's office and he falls from the window. Of course this wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it and it's perfectly done. The gunplay is delivered in perfect Verhoeven style as opposed to the slomo John Woostyle  you'll see lots of heavy automatic shotguns and explosive cannon weapons and you'll see them used well. The film is violent and bloody with real blood squibs.It is also up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "The success of this movie can be credited to one man Paul Verhoeven. His special touch of violence gore and social satire make the movie more than just your average Bmovie with a lame title and simple story and characters. Yes without Verhoeven this movie seriously would had been nothing more like another Bmovie on par with sciencefictionaction movies like Timecop and Albert Pyun movies.The main story of RoboCop itself is simply and not that complex however Verhoeven manages to put many different layers for the story as well as the characters in the movie. The social satire in the movie works out brilliantly and is what makes the movie perhaps more entertaining than thrilling or tense. Especially those typical Verhoeven news sketches are brilliant! But also those who will not be able to understand or fully appreciate the social satire elements in the movie will have plenty to enjoy while watching this. The action itself is topclass and the characters are fun as well as cool. RoboCop himself looks awesome both in his movements and the way his costume looks. Oh and of course I may not forget his awesome gun!The movie is not only filled with some typical Verhoeven social satire elements but also with some trademark Verhoeven gore and violence. The way Murphy gets killed is very graphic and disturbing. But as always in most Verhoeven movies is the case the violence is so overthetop that it's not really shocking to look at but almost more comical like because it's just so overthetop. Especially what happens to Emil at the end the gore is way overthetop there and I absolutely love it!In a movie like this the characters are also always important. Especially the villains and yes RoboCop has some highly entertaining and good villains. The group of Clarence Leon Joe and Steve are a bunch of entertaining charismatic stereotypical villains. But also the more educated villains like Dick Jones Ronny Cox and Bob Morton a very young Miguel Ferrer who also isn't a very nice person. But also the mechanical villain ED209 is extremely cool and dangerous looking. The stopmotion effects for him are of course heavily outdated this days but it takes away nothing of his threatening appearance. All of the character are entertaining and well developed. Characters also worth mentioning are The Old Man Dan O'Herlihy who plays the president of OCP and you can tell by his face gestures that he's not very pleased with the direction Dick Jones is heading towards with the company and Johnson who is always smiling. And of course let's not forget Bixby I'd buy that for a dollar! Snyder he's a real classic! They should given that guy a real show on TV.Also the musical score by Basil Poledouris is what helps to make this movie a very memorable one. Poledouris delivers one of his best works. When will he finally get some more attention from the big awards? He has made some great stuff but he rarely has won anything of importance with it. A bit of a disgrace for such a wonderful composer.All in all this is a brilliantly entertaining sciencefictionaction movie that simply is perfect in every way mainly thanks to Verhoeven his input.1010httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

However this is one of his best films and has much in common with one of his other best Starship Troopers  ultraviolence funny black humour great action and tonnes of satirical digs at modern life.  Here the plot revolves around the creation of Robocop and his fight against crime that goes right to the top.  This is complimented by the subplot of him trying to rediscover his human side.

Verhoeven takes digs at TV with his advert filled news broadcasts at privatisation by showing the crumbling police stations and the huge corporate towers and at heroism by showing Robocop creating just as much mayhem and destruction as the criminals he pursues.  His strength however is the action scenes and the sense of tension he creates  I'll don't think anyone can forget the sheer terror of ED209's glitch'.Weller is good  cast because of his strong jaw and ability to project emotion through a suit of armour  and he does manage to bring out the human side.  Allen is good but a but dry.  The real support comes from the eccentric and well known villains and corporate bosses.  Ronny Cox Smith Ray Wise Perry O'Herlihy and Miguel Ferrer are all great in various capacities.  Criminal or greedy corporate leader  it's hard to tell which is which at times.A classic bit of scifi.  Verhoeven has sadly not had a moment as fine as this since and has recently had problems being excessive in Hollywood  the land of excess!  This is a landmark film that may not be to everyone's taste.".

His movies 'Spetters' 'The Fourth Man' and 'Flesh  Blood' are all brilliant and worth tracking down. His next movie his first Hollywood one could have been a complete disaster. Verhoeven initially passed on it without reading the script and wasn't experienced in working with special effects or a fan of science fiction. Thankfully his wife insisted he make the picture and the end result was a triumph. Apparently this was a very tough shoot for all concerned but the bottom line is what is on screen and it really works. Few movies if any have managed to juggle SF action and grim satire in such an entertaining and original fashion. Verhoeven was blessed with an excellent script a well chosen bunch of actors and a great behind the scenes team and added to his own vision 'RoboCop' turned out to be one of the best movies of the 1980s whatever the genre. Peter Weller 'Buckaroo Banzai' pulls off a difficult job  making the audience care about a guy in a monster suit. Probably the best performance of its kind since Boris Karloff in James Whale's 'Frankenstein' back in the 1930s. Nancy Allen 'Dressed To Kill' Kurtwood Smith '12.01 PM' Ronny Cox 'Deliverance' Miguel Ferrer 'Twin Peaks' and the rest of the supporting cast are all first rate and everything about this movie is perfect. Verhoeven stumbled with his next movie 'Total Recall' and apart from 'Starship Troopers' has pretty much failed to fulfill his potential but 'RoboCop' remains a classic SFaction movie and a fantastic way to end a great decade of work.".

Although I'm not gonna take a side in that debate but I am gonna give Robocop the recognition it deserves. He was something that was totally new at the time 1987 and since then the movie got 2 crappy sequels a comic book and a miniseries.Robocop is set in the future and portrays a very dark version of Detroit and its crime level has gone up considerably. In it a cop named Alex Murphy gets literally blown away by a gang of nasty criminals on his first day on the job. But later a company OCP uses his remains to build a mechanical cop in order to cut down on the crime in order to build Delta City to replace the corrupted dystopia that was once Detroit. Later on Robocop makes a name for himself around the city but unexpectedly he starts remembering what he was before his death and through this we start to learn more about Murphy since we didn't zilch about him before he died. And this is how he starts to regain his lost humanity. And the first rule about making a movie with a robot for a character is that you MUST make it human in some way that's the reason why Robocop worked so well and why Terminator 2 worked so well. Towards the ending after he takes off his helmet for the final battle reveals his face. And a little later after the Old Man asks him for his name he replies Murphy this is one of the most hearttouching moments in science fiction which generally don't have moments like those. The symbolism in here is perfect.Another thing that really got me were the bad guys. And the best of the gang is without a doubt Kurtwood Smith as Clarence Boddicker. Honestly I have never seen a guy who looks like a 50 year old pencil pusher to be so threatening. He delivers his lines with such ferocity and perfection that he becomes perhaps one of the greatest villains in the history of cinema. And his classic lines Can you fly Bobby? and Bs leave! will never be forgotten. Also his crew is worth noting Emil will be known for the gas station scene probably the best part of the movie Joe will be remembered for his laugh and his Does it hurt? Does it hurt? line. And Leon will be recognized for his hilarious expression he makes when the disfigured Emil confronts him and when Robocop pulls his hair in the dance club. And lastly Clarence will be known for pretty much everything he does and says in here. And all these guys are MEAN plain and simple. They basically kill and hurt others for their own amusement and express no pity or remorse at all. These guys are as real as movie villains could possibly get.The action is excellent the gas station scene was bad the drug factory shootout was fantastic and the ending when Robocop takes out all the bad guys in the same place where they killed him at the steel mill is unforgettable thanks to the Cobra Assault Cannons forgot what they're called but it's one of the sweetest weapons ever made up in a film.The one liners couldn't have been better. Dead or alive you're coming with me is a quote that should've been on the Top 100 but for some reason it's not. Your move creep is another worth mentioning. And the before mentioned stuff that the bad guys say are pretty cool to say in real life situations as well.Robocop is a classic in the golden age of science fiction when we didn't have too many of that overthetop unoriginal crap that we're getting now. I'm gonna cherish this movie forever and I hope you will too.".

	schema:reviewBody "RoboCop is a surprisingly impressive action film about a young cop Peter Weller who is killed by a gang of cruel criminals and is brought back to life with both human and robotic characteristics.  Now he is cleaning up the city of Detroit and going after those who brutally murdered him when he was 100 human.  This film is ultraviolent in every sense of the word.  Anyone under the age of 17 should be strongly cautioned before seeing this film. However the violence makes the film realistic and more exciting.  Paul Verhoeven does some of his best work as a director.  The screenplay is very smart for an action film and all the actors give bravura performances. Peter Weller will always be remembered as the original RoboCop.  Ronny Cox Nancy Allen Miguel Ferrer and an incredibly evil Kurtwood Smith all do the best work of their careers.  An impressive film from the action genre.  4 stars out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw Robocop on Showtime back in 1989 I was about 8 years old. It was definitely the most violent and one of the most sophisticated films I'd ever seen at that time...being 8 my dad had issues with showing me Blade Runner though he seriously wanted me to since it was first released. Everything about the film grabbed me on some level. A lot of people seem to really like this film though I've heard a share of people and critics say that it's a secondrate film due to the extensive violence and sappy dialogue calling it cartoonish. Well I have to say that the cartoonish quality to the film is part of its allure. It's not only a humorous device for the sake of entertainment but its significance to the story is great. This is a dystopian future where big companies control almost every part of our existence from the government to the police to our domestic lives. It's almost Orwellian anybody notice how the OCP building is the tallest in the city?. It's a future where criminals run rampant in every form from street thugs to business execs. Seriously the head villain is a greedy business suit who uses a street gang to create trouble so he can provide a solution in the form of a droid with enough firepower to put up a fight with a tank...only to have that blow up in his face and mutilate a fellow exec at its unveiling. Bill Gates never had a bad day like this. Or how about when the gang blows Murphy into a million pieces with enough shotgun ammo to make even the NRA cringe totally destroying any remnants of his right arm. It's cartoonish because it's a comentary on the direction the world could conceivably take while at the same time being a source of entertainment. Whether the entertainment value was intended for people who love to see guns blazing or for people who like to see horrifying sights Murphy's execution for as long as it was and as bloody as it was HAD to demand a lot of sympathy from people...if it didn't there's something wrong with you and let's not forget when Robocop was getting shot up by the swat team. This film has everything going for it. A plot that exists on more levels than its Bmovie surface. It's a social commentary a satire an action film a scifi film and at times even a comedy when Robocop dragged the guy away by his hair I laughed like mad. The acting is great the effects are great not perfect but that adds to the visual appeal because it's as gritty as the story the music is great kudos to Basil Poledouris on an amazing score and overall...this film is one of the greatest films of its genre. I wouldn't call it THE greatest but it's very high up there. I still have yet to see the uncut Director's version but knowing Paul Verhoeven's work as I do I know it must be far more brutal than the domestic version hard to grasp with how far this film goes but...it evidently went further showing just how cartoonish things can get I suppose. I give it a definite 1010!!!".

It is a great mix of action and scifi and it has a message. You would not have to look hard into this film to see some deeper meaning in it though it appears to just be a action film it is also a testament to human life. One of the most prominent messages in this film is that you can put a human in a robotic shell but he is still a human. It also has messages about corporations running our lives. There is a scene where the main character has been killed and the company that owns the police is about to turn him into Robocop and someone says is this OK and the corporate rep says we own him we can do whatever we like with him. It is a classic film and one that has to be watched by everybody. It disappoints me that in every top 100 movies list or somethings like that you will never see this film I think it is a classic and is one of the most underrated films of all time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robocop is one of those movies that inspires debate as well it should. The director Paul Verhoeven who later became an even bigger player with films like Total Recall and Basic Instinct has definitely indulged in extreme violence and has no qualms about presenting violence as an object of fun. But I would defend it even if its only virtue was its action sequences because those elements are handled so well. There's a number of imaginatively staged action scenes and it never devolves into an arcadestyle shooting gallery like so many 80s actions films do. The action is compelling because of Verhoeven's style and because he's given the characters enough substance that we care about what happens to them including at least a half dozen interesting villains.A lot of discussion has revolved around whether or not this film deserves to be called satire. Those looking for Molierelike pearls in Verhoeven's modestly amusing commercial interruptions are understandably disappointed. This isn't the kind of movie that you can look at or objectify in order to access its ideas on an intellectual level. It's a different kind of beast it must be entered into it must fulfill its function as an action narrative first and foremost and it carries its ideas like a wedding train dragged by a semitruck a prominent afterthought. At any rate I feel it's closer to camp than satire one of the first camp action films of the 80s style I would argue Remo Williams being another now largely forgotten. It's a good drinking movie and this most recent time when I watched it my friend and I were laughing and yelling so much that we probably missed half the dialog. But I don't think we missed much of the point. If it was a satire Robocop wouldn't emerge as such a serious figure invested with pathos and personality. The movie itself is best enjoyed in my opinion as a joyride with some interesting commentary about America's relationship to violence thrown in by way of farce you wait for each villain to meet his fitting end and watch the carnage pile up. The villains are all so easy to hate and all the actors playing them are having a lot of fun. Ronny Cox is fantastic as the corporate heel but I've always enjoyed Kurtwood Smith the most. Really this is a very wellcast movie all around. I love the scene where Miguel Ferrer has his coke party interrupted by Smith with his bomb and his video. It's easy to underestimate the kind of skill Smith shows when he's so funny and obviously has his tongue in cheek but still manages to be convincingly sadistic and evil. Honestly a comparison to Vincent Price in his heyday is not unwarranted.Weller for his part is adequate and it's a difficult role so that's no insult. I didn't care for Nancy Allen in the movie but I can't really put my finger on the reasons. I guess she just came across as very tentative. I think it was a small mistake for Verhoeven to have her play it in a more grounded mode his buttkicking females are more fascinating but he does always have problems directing female heroes see Showgirls and Total Recall for example.I think this is a pretty intelligent movie with some layers to it. It's better as science fiction than you would at first suspect mining Frankenstein territory in a number of scenes  particularly where the callous nature of the creator is shown lose the arm and when the police force turns on Robocop like the mob of angry villagers in Whale's film version. In Shelley's time perhaps a single scientist was a suitable object of terror but by choosing corporate monstermakers the writers of this film gave the story a far more prescient object for paranoia. Indeed even since I last saw the film in the late 90s the film's central premise has become even more relevant due to America's misadventures with corporate security forces in Iraq. This time around I noticed all the elements of Western parody in the film. Not just the twirling pistol which also interestingly performs a plot function by identifying Robocop as Murphy but also in various other scenes. For example one poster here complained about the generic or obligatory nature of the convenience store scene and the rape scene where Robocop is introduced as a hero. I couldn't disagree more. They parallel the arrival of the hero in a traditional Western the convenience store works for the trading post in Shane the nightclub scene doubles for a tavern brawl i.e. the beginning of Rio Bravo and the attempted rape parallels any number of damsel in distress scenarios. That's a very funny scene for me because of the way the girl goes up to Robocop after he rescues her and kind of drapes herself over him My hero! a very prototypical American bit that you'd see in a Randolph Scott Western from the 40s. Robocop's sterile reaction is perfect again a parody of the emotionless law enforcing gunfighter of the Old West of American mythology.I expect to find more and more interesting elements the more I watch the film over the years. I think recently its reputation has taken a slight hit  look at the interesting life this film has had. Originally it was a big hit both in theaters and on video. Over the years it was not forgotten because action movie fans would return to it and be surprised at how well it holds up and how many ideas are floating about beneath the surface. Then based on their recommendations moviegoers of a more intellectual bent gave the movie a chance and were disappointed. It's time for the pendulum to swing back and for the movie to be reclaimed as what it is  an intelligent violent film.".

It's better as science fiction than you would at first suspect mining Frankenstein territory in a number of scenes  particularly where the callous nature of the creator is shown lose the arm and when the police force turns on Robocop like the mob of angry villagers in Whale's film version. In Shelley's time perhaps a single scientist was a suitable object of terror but by choosing corporate monstermakers the writers of this film gave the story a far more prescient object for paranoia. Indeed even since I last saw the film in the late 90s the film's central premise has become even more relevant due to America's misadventures with corporate security forces in Iraq. This time around I noticed all the elements of Western parody in the film. Not just the twirling pistol which also interestingly performs a plot function by identifying Robocop as Murphy but also in various other scenes. For example one poster here complained about the generic or obligatory nature of the convenience store scene and the rape scene where Robocop is introduced as a hero. I couldn't disagree more. They parallel the arrival of the hero in a traditional Western the convenience store works for the trading post in Shane the nightclub scene doubles for a tavern brawl i.e. the beginning of Rio Bravo and the attempted rape parallels any number of damsel in distress scenarios. That's a very funny scene for me because of the way the girl goes up to Robocop after he rescues her and kind of drapes herself over him My hero! a very prototypical American bit that you'd see in a Randolph Scott Western from the 40s. Robocop's sterile reaction is perfect again a parody of the emotionless law enforcing gunfighter of the Old West of American mythology.I expect to find more and more interesting elements the more I watch the film over the years. I think recently its reputation has taken a slight hit  look at the interesting life this film has had. Originally it was a big hit both in theaters and on video. Over the years it was not forgotten because action movie fans would return to it and be surprised at how well it holds up and how many ideas are floating about beneath the surface. Then based on their recommendations moviegoers of a more intellectual bent gave the movie a chance and were disappointed. It's time for the pendulum to swing back and for the movie to be reclaimed as what it is  an intelligent violent film.";

Director Paul Verhoeven who has made great films like Turkish Delight Spetters The 4th Man and the awesome Starship Troopers directs with amazing skill and energy and injects a vein of black humor that elevates this to levels way beyond previous genre watersheds. No masterpiece lacks a brilliant screenplay and the screenplay here is just that. Few science fiction films in history have so masterfully combined great ideas with violent action sharp characterization and jawdropping special effects. The film's most brutal set piece  the gunning down of Murphy Peter Weller  is one of cinema's most harrowing and tragic achievements a hard cruel punch to the gut and emotions that sweeps us into the film's amazing second act.

True to form this how things worked out . Most the class despised it wondering why the class had to watch such a cartoonish commercial film . I however did state I loved it and considered it to be the third best SF movie of the 1980s behind THE TERMINATOR and ALIENS What makes ROBOCOP such a cerebral enjoyable film is the uncommon mix of social satire and no holds barred Verhoeven excess . While  greed is good  to a certain extent the idea of corporate capitalism is something to be rejected . A small self elected clique ruling over the Universe in order to maximise profits is a bad mix of capitalism meets self serving communism . Not so much a mixed economic system but more a combination of greedy speculators from one system being merged with the unthinking party loyalty of the other system . It's greed for money plus greed for power which is a marriage made in hell and being dead isn't enough to make you escape the clutches of OCP and the film revolves around the human element of Murphy remembering who he once was and it's this that is at the core of the movie Of course Verhoeven isn't a director who does sentimental mawkish stuff and I doubt if the audience was wanting to see a Walt Disney film . What they were wanting to see was bad things happen to very bad people and you can't help cheering as criminals get killed  maimed  mutilated and in one case melted . It's a violent film but one that is so cartoonish that the violence is not to be taken seriously  a fact reflected in the loud slightly unrealistic acting style . This attitude wasn't enough to stop its British network premiere on ITV becoming farcical with a TV version being broadcast with notorious lines like  you gonna be a bad mother crusher  along with key scenes like the ones with mister melty conspicuous by their absence There is of course a new version of ROBOCOP hitting the cinema this week but is a film I have no interest in watching judging by the clips I've seen of it . It's strange to think that another Verhoeven classic TOTAL RECALL was also recently remade . As it stands the original ROBOCOP remains one of the greatest genre films from the 1980s containing wit  satire and enjoyably mean carnage".

That's how films like 'Speed' and such were accepted so well. Audiences not only can recognize with the characters symbolically but they can also sit on the edge of their seats.

Peter Sellers gives us the best movie of his entire career. Paul Verhoevan has made some great film like Basic Instict Hollow Man Starship troopers and Total Recall. I think Robocop is still is best work out of the lot. It is the best out of the Robocop trilogy by a margin. The Second part was entertaining in some scenes and is worth watching.

Ronny Cox puts on a great performance but to me his role is similar to his role in Total Recall and Kurtwood Smith was good aswell. Miguel Ferrer was good and Nancy Allen looked good.

	schema:reviewBody "The main reason I decided to check this movie out was because I was in the mood for some lighthearted wacky Asian comedy. And I chose this one because it has Riisa Naka and enjoyed her performances in few other movies. When I first saw the trailer to this I was expecting a feel good comedy with some Japanese awkward humor. Yes it does have those elements but it can get serious at times as well especially near the end. Also this movie has it's way of grabbing the audiences attention although it starts out with normal life of Japanese people. And made me sort of be immersed in the scenarios and found the scenarios sot of engaging a bit. I guess it's because of the interaction and the awkward relationship between the characters maybe the cute eye candy as well. And it manages to accomplish this task even if the premise may seem a bit too normal and mediocre. Another thing I really enjoyed was how there is a lot of unexpected stuff in it when you may think you got certain things down it gives you a unexpected twist. Which made this movie stand out compared to other films that has a similar direction. And is the reason I am giving this a higher rating than I originally planned on giving since I thought I got the direction completely mapped out. On a negative side the movie does seem to get a bit tedious and drag after a while but that is just minor complaints. It's a view of the real life modern Japanese people with their conflicts but still engaging.7.810".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie I will describe like a coin  it has two sides. The first side is the acting  on the contrary from most of the other reviewers I found the acting very good. The characters are believable and the actors seem suited for their respective roles. I must admit that I watched this movie mainly because of the actors. I'm a big fan of Robert Patrick hold respect for Gabriel Macht and it was nice to see Kristana Loken even in a minor role which she played in style. The strong side of this movie are the actors and the characters  I like movies that make me sympathize with characters one way or another in a positive or negative note. If you evaluate the actors' performance based on the first SWAT movie with Collin Farrel and Samuel Jackson you might be a little disappointed but if you watch it as a standalone you might like it. Now for the things I didn't like. The flipside of this coin maybe some of you won't describe as something bad but I personally am getting a little tired of a trend in recent action movies  sloppy endings. Some may say this is an action movie just watch the action and don't think too much for the ending! But I like endings that make me smile and think to myself yes that was good!. In this particular movie the ending is not only sloppy but it just one more word  short. I fully agree with some other reviews that point out that maybe due to time restrictions the movie was cut short but unfortunately the part that suffers the most is the ending. There are a few scenes throughout the movie that are just seen so many times and maybe if they were cut in order to add up a few minutes to the ending the movie would have been better. One other thing is the pace. The story unfolds pretty quickly but the actual pace of the onscreen events is a little slow. Not that I find the latter as a flaw but it kind of builds your thrill I personally was expecting a grand finale that would blow me away. I like it very much when the good and the bad guy talk to each other before the final showdown. Like De Niro and Pacino in Heat. Maybe I'm too much of a yinyang person but I just would like to see something more of a clash of the titans endings in movies literally not like the movie by the same name. It doesn't matter if it is a happy ending or not the thing that matters is HOW it is presented to us viewers. It may sound a little harsh but I really felt robbed by this ending. And something else  I really feel Robert Patrick's character he is the bad guy was presented too shallow. He has too little screen time to convince the audience he really is the bad guy which is a big flaw of the script in my opinion. Patrick is a very very very underrated actor especially when he plays bad guys and this movie does't utilize his talent whatsoever. Don't get me wrong this movie is worth a watch if you like that genre police SWAT team action movies hostages tactics you will enjoy it. But it just isn't something you will remember. If you're looking for something unusual something that spans out of the box of the clich you may be a little disappointed like I was. This is just an ordinary movie. It could have been great movie but in my humble opinion it isn't. 610  because good acting is never enough to save a poor story or a poor movie as a whole.".

It doesn't matter if it is a happy ending or not the thing that matters is HOW it is presented to us viewers. It may sound a little harsh but I really felt robbed by this ending. And something else  I really feel Robert Patrick's character he is the bad guy was presented too shallow. He has too little screen time to convince the audience he really is the bad guy which is a big flaw of the script in my opinion. Patrick is a very very very underrated actor especially when he plays bad guys and this movie does't utilize his talent whatsoever. Don't get me wrong this movie is worth a watch if you like that genre police SWAT team action movies hostages tactics you will enjoy it. But it just isn't something you will remember. If you're looking for something unusual something that spans out of the box of the clich you may be a little disappointed like I was. This is just an ordinary movie. It could have been great movie but in my humble opinion it isn't. 610  because good acting is never enough to save a poor story or a poor movie as a whole.";

It's the confirmation of what we already knew five minutes after the movie started this is a bad written script and a bad storyline. It's also really unrealistic how the relationship of the main character unfolds Acting isn't great too but that's OK. To come to the conclusion It's a really an allAmericanmachomovie.

The script was particularly impressive instead of the usual 'gungho' or unrealistic machismo's there is a lot of normal down to earth banter that goes on between the team that is very true to life. the realism of the action and more importantly the justification and technical stuff is also well written. I would suggest they don't have a top class professional adviser but they got by. things to consider there are some albeit only some relatively well known actors some impressive hard wear and sets including some big explosions. all done on a budget of 8 million. overall although not on par with the 2003 original it certainly stands up on its own as easy to watch action movie.

When on call with this team things go badly and a hostage dies. Without giving too much away I'll say that there's a bad guy who doesn't take too kindly to the hostage dying and makes this team leader his primary target and everything pretty much goes from there.Now for the review the movie in itself is not bad the acting is pretty good here's the reason why its getting such bad reviews. What I imagine happened was that the director of this movie was told after it was created that.. it was simply too long and it had to be cut down. Naturally he cut it as short as he could. The problem is that in cutting it he took out the most important elements of the movie the leading up to the ending part and the actual ending. Up to where the movie escalates into running out of time its very good but as soon as it gets to the point of where the main character is racing the clock its missing.. well everything. The bad guys are literally 2 people they aren't anywhere near as badass or as hardcore as it was portrayed because it takes about 2 min to neutralize both of them they make the main bad guy out to be really smart when in fact his setup was nothing short of childish i.e. anyone with half a brain would have thought out a further trap plot then he did from these things I can only conclude that there is a mass amount of movie missing if there isn't however then the director knows nothing about how to end a movie and thats where the bad reviews come in. 810 because besides for the ending its actually a pretty decent flick.".

I loved him in The Spirit and he does a fine job here of being a leading man but also somewhat realistic in appearance he is not as perfectly handsome as Hollywood could have made him. Kristanna Loken is given very prominent billing but sadly a very small role  which is too bad given how much potential she has.Stealing the show is Robert Patrick as millionaire Walter Hatch.

There is no bomb on a bus or any bus at all. But Patrick seems to be playing a Dennis Hopper villain there are still bombs there is taunting there is a damsel in distress. There is a mysterious background to the villain wait for the twist  very awesome.I liked the film. Action good plot likable characters.

Super Stars like Sam Jackson Colin Farrell may be missing but the acting and drama between characters still exists. From the first encounter with the enemy you wonder how things will play out and why they happened the way they did. The story may not be as compelling as the original but still has its strong points with love tie in's and controversy met along the way similar to Gamble and Street in the original. Some scenes how ever were down right terrible for instance there is a scene inside a convenience store and a shoot out erupts the end scene shows them walking off instantly in slow motion to rock music... it just doesn't fit in that scenario. Yet after all is said and done the film wraps up with an exemplary scene of heroism and action. Action 910 Style 1010 Story 710 Overall 810".

The movie starts off well Sgt. Cutler an LAPD SWAT leader with a military background Macht is sent to Detroit to trainup their SWAT team for some special Federal hostagerescue certification. The film takes the time to develop the team members to some degree and includes the requisite tension between the new officer and the locals that leads to one of the more senior Detroit SWAT members Kellogg being reassigned despite the fact that he's by far the team's best sniper. I can't speak to the veracity of any of the training techniques that are presented in the movie as being updated postIraq and Afganistan procedures but it made sense to this lay person and was interesting to watch.When Cutler brings in a female former soldier sight unseen no police training or certifications no knowledge of Detroit and Michigan state law it's not very plausible but it was easy to overlook since it was fun to watch the team interact. The movie falls apart when instead of being a movie about a SWAT leader and his team going up against the bad guy it becomes a one man against the bad guy movie with the team fading into the background. Why take the time to build chemistry between and among the team leader and his squad only to have them relegated to the background? I would have bet the mortgage that Kellogg the best shot in the Department would show up to help Sgt. Cutler take down the bad guy. He shows up but only to be told to stay behind which he does!.But the worst part is the dismal ending. The Detroit police chief in charge of the SWAT teams asks Sgt. Cutler to stay on after the team's been decimated. But Cutler says he wants to go home. End of movie. Someone forgot to tell the screenwriter that the hero's supposed to have finally found his home and wouldn't dream of leaving his new buddies. Overall not totally bad but nearly so.".

	schema:reviewBody "I will keep this one short. I picked this film based on two things1 I loved the original. 2 I thought SWAT 2 would be just as entertaining.Well guess what... It was. Although the actors are relative unknowns they shine in this film. The story is believable the characters are magnetic and the sound and explosions are great. How on earth the previous IMDb reviewers came to collectively rate this film a 2  10 still has me scratching my head. I just watched two absolute shocker movies Hunt to Kill and Wall Street 2 which looked like they'd been made with a handy cam similar to Blair Witch Project. Let me assure you the directing and producing of SWAT 2 is as good as the original SWAT movie.SWAT 2 is not in the class of an AVATAR or TITANIC which are currently rated around 8.2 on IMDb but it is easily as well put together as any action movie involving Sylvester Stallone or Jason Statham. The acting is A1 and the film flows seamlessly. Nothing is cut as previous reviewers have stated and the movie is entertaining from start to finish. The relationships that form in the movie are intriguing and controversial exactly what you'd expect from a SWAT movie.The original SWAT is currently rated at 5.9 on IMDb. It should be noted that SWAT 2 has a completely different storyline to the original with the main character being a tactical response group instructor. Had this film included Samuel L Jackson or another highprofile character it would have ended up at the boxoffice.Overall this film is very good and in my opinion a solid 7  10. Loaded with action and suspense the characters will intrigue and entertain you and leave you wanting more. Very much a boys flick with the exception of the relationship that forms SWAT 2 is 90 minutes of genuine entertainment.".

Not much of a threat but as the movie progresses we get some twists and turns which escalate it into true movie territory. A real film about SWAT life would be great but these action ones are simple guilty entertainment. Macht is a decent lead and shouldn't be relegated to such movies for life. Sure The Spirit was painful to watch listen to and think about but he isn't completely to blame. Patrick is always a decent villain even if he does look a bit out of shape for some of his stunts.".

The intention of the producers of Redneck Zombies was to make a really bad movie. In fact if anyone has the Troma DVD they should watch the short interview with director  Pericles Lewnes. He basically says they wanted to make a really awful gory horror movie.  Knowing that movies shot on video automatically come off as being cheesy they went all the way with the bad acting bad jokes bad special  effects etc. And that is why this movie has become one of the gems of modern  day bmovie gore flicks. If this was shot on film it wouldn't be the same.I  wouldn't laugh in the same way. If the cast included well trained actors once  again I wouldn't laugh in the way that I do. This movie is the epitemy of being  so bad that it is good So for all of you wannabe Siskel and Eberts out there keep on renting Scream  1100  I know What You Did Last Spring or was it Summer?  and any other modern day over produced horror flick with a soundtrack by Creed. I'll keep watching and loving all the trash that goes straight to DVD. Of course you can't  rent any of the wonderful sleazy trash flicks at Blockbuster or Hollywood so I am  forced to purchase these fine films at conventions and off the internet. Thank  God for the internet. I will say I was happily impressed with the big budget Dawn of the Dead for the most part.".

Some rednecks get the drum thinking that it is Moonshine because they do not know how to read or they are just stupid and give it to people and become flesh eating zombies.The film itself is not meant to be a Oscar winner but it falls under the it's so bad it's good group. The special effects are very cheap but it still fun to watch. I could write a book on how corny and cheesy the lines in this movie are but I am not going to do that. The lines in this film are really bad but it's so funny at some of the stuff that is said in this film. The gore in this film is is at times over the top. There seems to be more gore in this film then Dawn of the Dead.The acting is over the top at times. Mainly Bob the prevet student is starts tripping while doing an autopsy on one of the zombies. Drinking Dude how could I forget him. He always drinks at out of no where pulls out bottles of liquor and drinks it.If you like Troma films then watch this. If you like gore b flicks then watch this.

Redneck Zombies is pure gold.  When I first watched it I kicked back on my couch cracked open a bottle of fine Belgian ale and laughed all the way through. This movie is SUPPOSED to be cheesy...it's supposed to be bad...it's supposed to be stupid and cheap and lame.  That is its purpose.  Deal with it or don't watch.There's plenty here for fans of the horror genre including some hilarious Texas Chainsaw Massacre parody scenes and of course fans of Full Moon andor Troma won't be disappointed.  My personal favorite scene involves the genuinely creepy Tobacco Man.  To this day at work or in social gatherings I'll occasionally pull out the line Dark times is comin'.  And when everyone looks at me like I've just vomited human excrement onto the rug I know deep down that I am the coolest person in the room.  But I digress.At any rate if you're a Troma fan like me definitely give this one a watch.  It's way up there with the original Toxie and Class of Nuke 'Em High.

The barrel is of course intercepted by a 4000 pound yokel with a gun no brain and a whole lot of curiosity played by the legendary Bucky Santini.

That is If you're into ridiculous backwards humor like someone I know.You can't really call Redneck Zombies a failure because this is exactly what they were going for well not a failure exactly more like bad horror then again any damn fool can see that. These guys really take the cheesiness to legendary heights. I guess we could always do without the fact that it was shot on video but if anything belongs on video believe me it's this. As ambitious of a production as it is Redneck Zombies most definitely knows its place in the Exploitation world. Be sure to get the not rated version otherwise you'll be one unhappy camper. For the complete Redneck Zombies experience check out the new Tromasterpiece Edition it's swell!! If you don't hate overthetop gore sleazy juvenile humor bad acting continuity issues or movies made for less than 100 million then you might not hate Redneck Zombies... oh you probably will what the hell do I know? 1010".

They leave it though and are impressed with the new stuff they've made.Meanwhile a group of campers are out looking for their campsite And it has a pond to piss in! unaware of the carnage about to unfold.I think we can all guess what happens next. The alcohol is distributed around town turning everyone who drinks it into a flesheating zombie. No one's safeespecially not the campers who find themselves attacked and killed off with no mercy all leading up to the bloody climax.This is truly a great movie. Especially for big fans of zombies and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Like I am. Fans of TCM are sure to notice the great spoofing even in the end with the gory showdown at the house between Lisa and the zombie family.For anyone looking for a fun horror movie this is it. It has plenty of gore plenty of comedy and plenty of fun for anyone. But if you're looking for the next Silence of the Lambs avoid this film at all costs. You will hate it.

It has no delusions of grandeur and simply spends all of its approximate 90 minutes trying to entertain through gore and humour. The fact that both the gore and humour are poorly executed really is beside the point. What matters is that the film is made with true Zgrade spirit from the ridiculous toxic waste mistaken for moonshine premise to the scene where a child extra actually waves at the camera while pretending to chew human flesh. Now that's classy.Further highlights include the music interludes I loved the Redneck Zombie theme song and the autopsy on acid.

	schema:reviewBody "Redneck Zombies bears all the marks of the classic so bad it's good low budget B movie. Those film fans who enjoy chilling with beers and buddies will likely find this effort from producer  director Pericles Lewnes and executive producer Edward Bishop to be well worth their time. Now admittedly it's pretty slow to start and as often as it's funny it's just tiresome. But it's worth sticking with because things really get interesting for the final third. Lewnes and company deliver what has to be the trippiest autopsy scene ever committed to celluloid before finally giving us plenty of action near the end. The gore is hilariously tacky and yes folks there's a lot of it. The acting is aggressively lousy with Anthony Burlington Smith rating as the biggest offender as craven coward Bob. Lewnes takes every opportunity he gets to take his movie in surreal directions and there's enough W.T.F. moments to make this a memorable bit of mayhem.A wayward barrel of toxic waste is appropriated by a backwoods backwards family and the contents find their way into the broods' batch of moonshine. After imbibing this putrid potion the guys turn into...well you can figure it out. At the mercy of the rampaging flesh eaters are an insipid bunch of back packers led by the moronic Wilbur James H. Housely.You gotta love a cast and crew that give themselves such colourful names as Zoofeet this is the pseudonym for Lewnes himself who plays femme redneck Billy Bob  Elly May and P. Floyd Piranha. And that's one of the endearing elements here as it always is in movies of this kind as this spirited bunch of actors and filmmakers have fun with their very silly material. You just can't beat independent horror cinema for this kind of goforit enthusiasm. Lisa M. DeHaven is a very feisty Final Girl who keeps putting up a fight.

	onyx:emotionText "Redneck Zombies bears all the marks of the classic so bad it's good low budget B movie. Those film fans who enjoy chilling with beers and buddies will likely find this effort from producer  director Pericles Lewnes and executive producer Edward Bishop to be well worth their time. Now admittedly it's pretty slow to start and as often as it's funny it's just tiresome. But it's worth sticking with because things really get interesting for the final third. Lewnes and company deliver what has to be the trippiest autopsy scene ever committed to celluloid before finally giving us plenty of action near the end. The gore is hilariously tacky and yes folks there's a lot of it. The acting is aggressively lousy with Anthony Burlington Smith rating as the biggest offender as craven coward Bob. Lewnes takes every opportunity he gets to take his movie in surreal directions and there's enough W.T.F. moments to make this a memorable bit of mayhem.A wayward barrel of toxic waste is appropriated by a backwoods backwards family and the contents find their way into the broods' batch of moonshine. After imbibing this putrid potion the guys turn into...well you can figure it out. At the mercy of the rampaging flesh eaters are an insipid bunch of back packers led by the moronic Wilbur James H. Housely.You gotta love a cast and crew that give themselves such colourful names as Zoofeet this is the pseudonym for Lewnes himself who plays femme redneck Billy Bob  Elly May and P. Floyd Piranha. And that's one of the endearing elements here as it always is in movies of this kind as this spirited bunch of actors and filmmakers have fun with their very silly material. You just can't beat independent horror cinema for this kind of goforit enthusiasm. Lisa M. DeHaven is a very feisty Final Girl who keeps putting up a fight. There are healthy nods to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre especially the amusing hitchhiker sequence. And as a bonus the music including some priceless ditties such as Squirrels from Hell is pretty catchy.All in all this is agreeable schlock.Seven out of 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "If you're thinking about watching Redneck Zombies let me first tell you that it's a very very strange film. The acting is almost mindbendingly bad the gore meter is high and it of course has a lot of redneck zombies. I recommend it but wow. The main word I will use to describe this film is Wow. So the film starts out with a black soldier in a Jeep bringing toxic waste to a different location. While he tries to give his dog a joint the toxic waste falls off of his jeep. The soldier tries to retrieve it but a redneck Ferd Mertz AKA Fatty because he is one of the fattest people I have ever seen holds a gun to the soldier's head takes the waste and gives it to a bunch of rednecks who think it is moonshine and start to sell it. The breakout redneck performance is BillyBob who thinks he's stuck in a girl's body and likes to be called Ellie May. Yeah. It's an odd film.Miraculously at the same time there are a bunch of campers camping out very close to the rednecks. They include a fat chick a black guy who is probably the worst actor I have ever seen more on that later a gay guy who carries around hundreds of bottles of deodorant and a guy who has absolutely NO lines and just drinks liquor the entire time.Soon it is evident that the moonshine turns everyone who drinks it into flesheating REDNECK ZOMBIES!!! What follows is an overthetop gorefest which is a bunch of fun but it's probably not for everyone.If you don't like Troma you're not gonna like this. If you want Hollywood production values you're NOT gonna like this. If you want Oscarworthy performances you're DEFINITELY not gonna like this. If you want some of the worst acting you've ever seen if you like Troma and if you want to watch a film that looks like it was made for 36.45 this is exactly what you're wanting.It's supposed to be bad and if you're wanting a good horror film you'll be sorely disappointed. First off the acting. This acting actually makes you sad. I don't know how but it actually is SO bad it makes you depressed. The black camper is most likely the WORST actor I have ever seen in my entire life but then again basically every performance in this movie are some of the worst I've ever seen. I don't know if they were trying to be the worst they can be but if they did they succeeded with flying colors.The gore is actually pretty good for such a lowbudget trash movie. There's some impressive kills and it's obvious that the only thing they spent any money on was the gore. It's probably the high point of the movie.I don't know what else to say about this. It's the definition of so bad it's good. I was gonna give it an average 6 out of 10 but upon seeing how low the average score for the movie was I decided I'll bump the score up 1 point and give it an above average 7.Watch out for the best parts the gay soldier that comes to the rescue and happily runs into a mob of zombies Haven't you ever seen Deliverance? the black soldier the only line he says to the gay soldier is F you. and the death scene where the actor suddenly changes shirts halfway through his bloody death. It's just great.7 out of 10 Go see it!".

The budget on this one must have been extremely low it had to be under 5000. The title is all wrong though. I think that a more fitting title would be Hillbilly zombies as there is a difference between rednecks and hillbillies. The gratuitous breast shot with the whipped cream and cherries was spectacular.

	schema:reviewBody "Although some like to compare The Towering Inferno to The Poseidon Adventure because Irwin Allen that master of disaster brought us both in point of fact The Towering Inferno is more like a landlocked Titanic than anything else.It has to be remembered that the Titanic was on its maiden voyage and was ballyhooed as an unsinkable ship when the tragedy occurred. The building that William Holden built that Paul Newman designed was also on its maiden voyage so to speak. The 135 story building in San Francisco was being dedicated and there was going to be a big blowout on the top floor with all kinds of VIPS in attendance. Little does Holden suspect that his soninlaw Richard Chamberlain cut quite a few safety corners in the electrical wiring. When the whole tower gets lighted up a fire breaks out in one of the circuit junction boxes and the party gets cut short.Paul Newman and Steve McQueen as the fire battalion chief head an impressive cast list of name players put in harm's way by Chamberlain's avarice. Fred Astaire got an Academy Award nomination for playing an elderly conman who tricks his way into the VIP gathering to fleece wealthy widow Jennifer Jones. This was Jones's farewell performance on screen she retired right after that to become just the kind of wealthy society matron she plays here.The film got an award for Best Cinematography deservedly so the shots are quite vivid and also the best song of 1974. During the party scene Maureen McGovern who had introduced the popular There's Got To Be A Morning After in Irwin Allen's The Poseidon Adventure sings We May Never Get To Love Like This Again. It won for best song but certainly didn't have the lasting popularity of the other.The most vivid moment of the film for me besides the climax is the illfated rendezvous of Robert Wagner and Susan Flannery. They agree for a boss secretary rendezvous in his apartment there and Wagner turns off the phone so word cannot reach them of the fire. The death scenes of both will tear you up.According to the Films of Steve McQueen the reason for the joint production by Warner Brothers and 20th Century Fox is that when two studios put out two Harlow films both cut each other up at the box office and no one made out. Warner Brothers purchased The Tower and Fox bought the Glass Inferno screen rights. Rather than have competing disaster films they made an historic interstudio agreement to have a joint production.I think it worked out well all around.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having struck box office gold two years earlier with The Poseidon Adventure Irwin Allen aided by the combined financing of Fox and Warner Bros. decided to do himself one better with The Towering Inferno.  No expense was spared as evidenced by Allen securing the services of two of the top box office draws available in Paul Newman and Steve McQueen. Next he hedged his bet with a supporting cast that ran the gamut from William Holden Fred Astaire and Faye Dunaway to soap actress Susan Flannery and football star O.J. Simpson.  Add a lot of fire a lot of smoke a lot of flaming and charred humans and you have the makings of a box office bonanza.  It's amazing that the budget was held down to a mere 14 million dollars even in 1974 dollars. Did it work?  The film grossed 116 million dollars which was quite a princely sum in those days so the answer to that as far as Allen Fox and Warner Bros. is concerned would be yes.Newman plays architect Doug Roberts who has been away in the jungle somewhere but is returning home just in time for the grand opening of the tallest building ever to grace California that he just happened to have designed.  Doug is also returning home to his mistress played by Faye Dunaway to persuade her to join him on his next project.  The head of the company building the tower is James DuncanWilliam Holden whom has left a lot of the details of the construction of the tower to his no good soninlaw Roger SimmonsRichard Chamberlain.  That turns out to be bad news for everyone unfortunate to find themselves in The Tower.  After some of the wiring in the building begins to have a major meltdown Doug investigates to find that Roger has cut so many corners it could lead to a major catastrophe.  Was there any doubt?Despite the abundance of headlining actors in Towering Inferno the true star of the film is the disaster itself just as it is in any of these concoctions.  Allen directed the action sequences with John Guillerman handling the rest of the chores.  Allen does himself proud.  Although we know of course that The Tower is not truly as tall as the filmmakers would have us believe it's not obvious enough to detract from the film.  It doesn't matter though as most of the action takes place inside the building or near the suite at the top where most of our stars end up trapped.  Of course this being a disaster film we do get the privilege of watching flaming bodies fall over a hundred stories be it it outside or down an elevator shaft.Allen also does well at piling on the suspense and keeps you on edge for long moments with such things as a long climb up a flaming stare well and a long decent down a scenic elevator that will have you wringing your hands. The fire sequences are all well staged as you can almost feel the flames leaping through the screen and smell the smoke circling around the room.The problem with most disaster films is that with the good there is generally some bad and Inferno is no exception.  Some of the dialog in this film is truly horrendous.Example Duncan How bad is it? Halloran It's a fire.  All fires are badJames Duncan Give me the architect that designed you and who needs Doug Roberts? Susan I do.In one truly silly moment after Dan BigelowRobert Wagner and his secretary Lorrie Susan Flanneryhave just finished love making the fire has engulfed the room next to theirs.  Lorrie being the ever observant secretary and mistress sniffs and delivers this line Did someone leave a cigarette burning?The best of the actors is easily Steve McQueen.  As Chief Michael O'Hallorhan who is called to put the fire out he seems to relish has role as a fire department head.  Paul Newman on the other hand is a mixed bag. When he's playing his scenes with McQueen Holden Dunaway or Chamberlain he's OK.  In other scenes especially when the fire initially breaks out he appears stiff and uncomfortable.  Fred Astaire is on hand as the whimsical con artist Harlee Claiborne out to bilk Lisolette Mueller Jennifer Joneswith some phony stocks.  Jones is one of the best things going in this movie turning out to be quite the heroine.  Dunaway as Robert's girlfriend Susan is dry enough that we wish they could have brought Joanne Woodward in to give the relationship some real spark no pun intended.  Wagner as Dan Bigelow is a charmer but we just can't buy into his relationship with Lorrie Susan Flannery.  Susan Blakely as Patty Simmons Holden's spoiled daughter and the wife of Roger Richard Chamberlainhas nothing much to do except chastise her husband for causing Daddy a big headache.  Chamberlain on the other hand seems to like playing the role of the villain and he does it well.  You'll have no trouble believing just how big of a jerk Roger is. Last  is O.J. Simpson as the security guard who seems to be smarter than everybody else.  The role requires little and in his big screen debut Simpson gives it just that.No matter.  The Towering Inferno will still entertain you.  At 165 minutes you'll only be looking at your watch in the first half hour or so as you wait for that one tiny spark to ignite a night of suspense.  Irwin Allen put quite a spectacle on the screen but unfortunately never again duplicated it and with each subsequent film his product went from bad to being truly mediocre.  Considering how much I really liked this film it's a shame. Now please put out that cigarette.My Grade B".

He then reports this to the buildings owner James Duncan but he doesn't think that it is a problem and still decides to go on with the opening ceremony which puts 300 peoples lives in the balance while trapped on the top of the 138 storey skyscraper when the building goes on fire due to the poor wiring this results in unpredictable explosions and fires breaking out everywhere in the building. It is now up to fireman Steve McQueen his crew and the aide of the Navy to rescue the 300 people on top of the building and put out the fire.By far the best disaster movie ever made with a terrific all star cast. Not to be missed!".

Contrary to conventional wisdom special effects and elaborate stunt work can actually be the star of a movie and provide ample compensation for poor writing clumsy direction and really amateurish acting. THE TOWERING INFERNO is of course a disaster movie the methodical destruction of a highrise skyscraper along with many of its tenants. It came on the heels of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE and quite honestly is no match for that film's delicious mix of sappy sentimentality and hammy heroics. But while its dramatic quality is only marginally superior to hack films like AIRPORT '75 and the atrocious EARTHQUAKE INFERNO provides a masterful blend of audience manipulation and technical craftsmanship. As Paul Newman pointed out to the press neither he nor his perpetual professional rival Steve McQueen are the star of the film the fire is the star. And as appropriate to any star the fire in all of its glorious mayhem is lovingly filmed and given a wide berth to overact with style.The rest of the cast should be so lucky. The remarkable onceinalifetime cast Newman McQueen Faye Dunaway William Holden Fred Astaire etc. behave like troopers even though they are primarily reduced to being little more than high priced props. Most of the scenes involving actual human interaction seem rushed and the inept line readings of the inane dialogue suggest that no one bothered with retakes let alone rehearsals. But such moments are little more than filler marking time between some of the most remarkable actions sequences ever filmed. The helicopter rescue of the derailed scenic elevator is heartstoppingly thrilling even as you realize that it is absolutely physically impossible. And it is overshadowed by the explosive final showdown with the villainous fire. Hollywood has cinematically destroyed greater amounts of real estate but seldom with such style.As art THE TOWERING INFERNO is a fizzle but as a cheap carnival thrill show it's pretty hot stuff.".

The 70's marked the age of the disaster movies evolving from the adaptation of Arthur Hailey's Airport then boost up by Irwin Allen's The Poseidon Adventure which was a hit. Allen continued the legacy of his work by doing another disaster film. It was The Towering Inferno. The Towering Inferno is heavily considered as the best of the long cycle of 70's disaster movies. It was wellmade wellacted and wellsold on the boxoffice. The problem though was it was too long. The first parts revolved on the celebration of the grand opening of the tallest office building on earth at the movies of course the Glass Tower. But when it gets to the disaster you see how great this film is. Impressive specialeffects and great acting by an allstar cast help make this film the classic it is. Recommended for any fan of the genre. They don't make 'em like this anymore and for that value alone THE TOWERING INFERNO is a bonafide classic allstar extravaganza. Rating  out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember it like it was yesterday. There I was a young kid sitting in my parents house on a cold bleak Saturday morning in Michigan. We had HBO back then so I turned on the cable box hoping to find something fun to watch possible cartoons. As I was channel surfing I came across a classic 70's disaster flick that remains to this day one of my all time favorite films. The Towering Inferno is a tense exciting and flat out entertaining piece of cinema. It has popcorn flick written all over it. At 165 minutes its got a long running time but it doesn't feel that way. Inferno moves by at an unbelievably fast clip and its got a huge cast of stars who look as if they all had a lot of fun making it. Its also got special effects that even today would hold up against any lifeless Michael Bay production.Inferno came out during a wave of other disaster flicks like Earthquake 1974 The Poseidon Adventure 1972 and Airport 1970. Safe to say it's the best one of the bunch. It's truly one of the reasons I love watching movies as well as reviewing them.It tells the story of the world's tallest building The Glass Tower in San Francisco having an electrical short that starts a huge fire 81st floor. The fire quickly spreads threatening to kill everybody on the top floor they're having a dedication ceremonyparty for the opening of the tower. With the help of a determined architect Doug Roberts played by Paul Newman and a fire department led by Chief Michael O'Hallorhan Steve McQueen  enormous efforts are made to try and stop the out of control blaze using any means necessary.The concept for The Towering Inferno was based on two novels The Tower by Richard Martin Stern and The Glass Inferno by Thomas N. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson. And although the film is minimal on plot it makes up with for it with relentless action and suspense. They didn't have PG13 movies back then and this film really pushed the envelope for PG fare. Yes there are death by fire scenes in the film that really shook me upon first viewing. But as I got older and viewed Inferno many times over I realized that this was an important element in keeping the viewer clinging to the screen helplessly wanted to know if the rest of the cast makes it out alive.Lets talk about that cast. We have William Holden as James Duncan the builder we got Fred Astaire as Harlee Claiborne Astaire was nominated for best supporting actor by the Academy we got Richard Chamberlain as Roger Simmons the electrical engineer and lets not forget former NFL running back O.J. Simpson as Harry Jernigan Chief Security Officer. With his huge 70's afro and confident demeanor he pioneered the whole athletes transitioning to acting thing. He gives a solid performance unlike the forgettable ones he gave in the Naked Gun movies.All in all The Towering Inferno is a bonified masterpiece. I normally don't say that about a lot of films because I have been critical in the past with movies of this genre. Edited splendidly by Harold Kress and Carl Kress and directed with gusto by John Guillermin and Irwin Allen Inferno has the real feel of a true Best Picture Nominee it was in fact nominated at the 1975 academy awards. It also kind of serves secretly as a public announcement about the dangers of fire and fire prevention.Inferno is dangerous epic exhausting stuff and when it does move closer and closer to its conclusion we get the pleasure of seeing two renegades Newman and McQueen come together to stop an out of control fire destroying everything in its path. I've gotta admit seeing these two Hollywood legends on screen gives me goosebumps. Oh heck the whole film gives me goosebumps. If you love movies and want to escape Inferno is pretty serviceable. Just get a big bucket of popcorn sit back and enjoy the ride.".

Together they were united summarily and christened as  The Towering Inferno.  Assembling a memorable cast caused this movie to be riveting and spellbinding.

Several other stories thread and interlace the surface story involving Hollywood's elite including Fred Astaire Faye Dunaway Richard Chamberlain Robert Vaughn and Robert Wagner. If you're seeing this movie for the first time be prepared for many action scenes and exciting hair raising stunts.

	schema:reviewBody "I don't want to be insolent with the Americans about skyscrapers and what they mean to American culture and World culture per se. It is in the aftermath of terrorists attack to WTO headquarters on September 11 2001 that fiction became reality. The ridicule of emergency telephone number 911 is obvious here which come to support my initial suspicion that someone who knows American lifestyle very well has been initially involved  either as instigator or advising consultant to the terrorists themselves Arabs by nationality but residing in America as exchange students. See it that investigating agencies shouldn't preclude local support either by exasperation or envy!Now lets go from fact to fiction. I have arranged my list based on metaanalysis with modifications from the present database and Wikipedia which means that I have watched all 10 movies and have consciously selected them before the September 11 2001 event. The younger generation of today maybe not aware but some 15 years ago when Internet doesn't existed the meaning of those tallest buildings and their symbolism was something to a commoner like me. I am a nobody person but sometime I used to travel around and attend some of those tall building and further reflected on what I have seen in cinema. There isn't much more to say except that you have to go inside in the masonry structure and see how that offset fittings are constructed ipso facto.See now my listing in order of importance but not of chronology1. Towering Inferno 1974  architect Paul Newman and fire chief Steve McQueen with Richard Chamberlain as the faulty electrician2. Fountainhead 1949  an Ayn Rand's novel who is a Russian emigrant with Gary Cooper as architect and Patricia Neal as finance magnate daughter3. Die Hard 1988  Bruce Willis as New York cop fighting terrorists at Nakatomi Plaza4. Blade Runner 1982  retired cop Harrison Ford pursues a murderous android Rutger Hauer in futuristic skyscraper city5. Metropolis 1926  directed by Fritz Lang which is a silent movie I didn't enjoy very much but still remains classic6. Entrapment 1999  aging Sean Connery and beautiful thief Catherine ZetaJones in Kuala Lumpur skyscraper robbery7. Jungle Fever 1991  black architect Wesley Snipes and Italian American Annabella Sciorra which I don't remember the plot8. King Kong 1933  first giant ape toppling on Empire State Building9. King Kong 1976  second remake where giant monkey climb the World Trade Center10. King Kong 2005  third appearance of savage monster this time shot in New Zealand and still grossed well on the market. Thank You!".

I have arranged my list based on metaanalysis with modifications from the present database and Wikipedia which means that I have watched all 10 movies and have consciously selected them before the September 11 2001 event. The younger generation of today maybe not aware but some 15 years ago when Internet doesn't existed the meaning of those tallest buildings and their symbolism was something to a commoner like me. I am a nobody person but sometime I used to travel around and attend some of those tall building and further reflected on what I have seen in cinema. There isn't much more to say except that you have to go inside in the masonry structure and see how that offset fittings are constructed ipso facto.See now my listing in order of importance but not of chronology1. Towering Inferno 1974  architect Paul Newman and fire chief Steve McQueen with Richard Chamberlain as the faulty electrician2. Fountainhead 1949  an Ayn Rand's novel who is a Russian emigrant with Gary Cooper as architect and Patricia Neal as finance magnate daughter3. Die Hard 1988  Bruce Willis as New York cop fighting terrorists at Nakatomi Plaza4. Blade Runner 1982  retired cop Harrison Ford pursues a murderous android Rutger Hauer in futuristic skyscraper city5. Metropolis 1926  directed by Fritz Lang which is a silent movie I didn't enjoy very much but still remains classic6. Entrapment 1999  aging Sean Connery and beautiful thief Catherine ZetaJones in Kuala Lumpur skyscraper robbery7. Jungle Fever 1991  black architect Wesley Snipes and Italian American Annabella Sciorra which I don't remember the plot8. King Kong 1933  first giant ape toppling on Empire State Building9. King Kong 1976  second remake where giant monkey climb the World Trade Center10. King Kong 2005  third appearance of savage monster this time shot in New Zealand and still grossed well on the market. Thank You!";

The ever competitive McQueen made his film debut with a bit part in Somebody Up There Likes Me in which Newman starred and one of his ambitions was to finally get top billing over his number one rival. Even with the socalled diagonal billing employed in the film and its advertising with Newman's name elevated slightly above McQueen's those of us who read from left to right can see that McQueen got his wish. He also got the best role. He's the firefighter a tight jawed man of action while Newman is saddled with the less sympathetic role of the architect. But the real star is the burning building. It burns and impressively at that but there's something very claustrophobic about this situation which results in less action than Allen's previous smash The Posiedon Adventure. But the acting is better. In addition to McQueen and Newman the cast includes Richard Chamberlain particularly good William Holden Faye Dunaway and Fred Astaire. That's an improvement over Carol Lynley and Eric Shea both of whom Gene Hackman had the misfortune of emoting with two years earlier. Whatever one thinks of this particular genre The Towering Inferno is probably the best of the bunch.".

	schema:reviewBody "The sight of people jumping off the World Trade Center's windows during the September attacks shocked the whole world but although I'm not minimizing it it wasn't something new fear of fire is deeply rooted in our unconscious behavior for it's as ancient as humanity itself. One of the most memorable moments on the film features an adultery couple discovering that they are trapped under the flames with no way to escape. Richard Wagner desperately tries to reach the door with a lousy wet towel over his head while Susan Flannery a young and beautiful Stephanie from The Bold and the Beautiful is pushed closer and closer to the window. And the inevitable happens when she jumps. The 'rather falling than burning' is a reflex any human would have fire scares more than heights and in terms of death at least a fall promises a quicker death but I don't think I need to go further on that subject. Beyond the spectacular premises filmmakers cherished disaster films for one main reason the need of an allstar cast to develop all the parallel stories would guarantee an immediate commercial success. The Towering Inferno directed by John Guillermin obeys the rule with the most bankable stars of the 70's Paul Newman Steve McQueen Faye Dunaway and William Holden not to forget the obligatory comebacks with two Golden Age legends Fred Astaire and Jennifer Jones who form a very sweet and endearing pair Astaire as a sympathetic twobit conman will get an Oscar nomination for the role in the same vein of sweet tenderness than Shelley Winters in The Poseidon Adventure'. By the way I wish Jennifer Jones as the elegant and goodhearted Lisolette got a nomination she was the heart of the film. And keeping on the stars' enumeration there's naturally the obligatory villain through Richard Chamberlain as William Holden's cunning and cynical soninlaw. Paul Newman is the architect who built the San Francisco's skyscraper but he's in no case responsible for the disaster it's Chamberlain the costcutting manager who didn't follow the specifications and ordered a wiring recommended by the Code while the highest building ever built needed a more sophisticated understand costly material. Every disaster film has one or two bastards the man who asks a Captain to go faster who believes a ship cannot sink their point is to identify the real antagonist in the film not Nature but Men's arrogance and disrespect toward Nature. It's because of men who believe that technology or industrial jewels can triumph over natural elements that catastrophes happen. As McQueen explains to Newman There's no sure way for us to fight a fire in anything over the seventh floor but you guys just keep building 'em as high as you can. These lines define the eternal discordance between men who respect nature and those who defy it. It's an eternal battle and if men triumphed on the longest term it was never without a few disasters that taught them lessons of humility. And The Towering Inferno takes us for more than twoandhalf hour of a thrilling combat between men and fire the film drags a bit too long but maybe some stunts or action sequences that get redundant were more interesting on the big screen. It starts with a shortcut with the wiring naturally and a small fire breaks out before it would take epic proportion and literally climb 70 floors at the top of the building on the 135th floor a reception is given to celebrate the building's inauguration talk about a bad omen the mayor couldn't even cut the ribbon with the scissors. Never mind a band sings We May Not Love Each Other Again a reminiscence of The Morning After from The Poseidon Adventure it even won the Oscar. It's only a matter of time before the fire would reach them and naturally they can't take the elevator the fate of those who tried immediately discouraged them. Disaster is a subgenre that follows many formulas but it works well in The Towering Inferno for three reasons the special effects are top notch and never suspend our disbelief the acting is superb and there's the writing. Not that the film impacted the minds through memorable details but it has a shocking value in the way it distributes death with the same blindness than fate would have. There's a consensus that it's not just the bad guys who die in disasters but they generally have the most gruesome deaths while the good ones die either heroically or tragically. Even having that in mind I was shocked like many others by the death of Lisolette not that I didn't expect her to die in the beginning but not after she risked her life to save a deaf woman and after Newman's struggle to rescue her group. Life is a bitch sometimes. The film avoided the knowitall kid or the overly scared young girl thanks goodness and it also allows some very subtle and profoundly human details especially during the climactic explosion of the water tanks. Wearing glasses myself I was pleasantly surprised when Holden put them off because this is something I would have done but the most poignant moment was the buildup when the remaining men were choosing where to tie themselves. Imagine yourself in a situation where a simple choice can determine if you live or die would you expect that a glass would break in your direction or a statue fall on you? Chilling existentialism.After air in Airport water in The Poseidon Adventure and earth in Earthquake it was only fitting that the most redoubtable and frightening of the four elements made the most spectacular and probably the best of all the disaster films of the 70's wave The Towering Inferno nominated for Best Picture among so many distinguished masterpiece as The Godfather Part II and Chinatown.".

If you like them this one is really good. Lots of tension great special effects for 1974 heart wrenching drama and excitement up until the very end!";

	schema:reviewBody "Sure there is a lot of hammy acting and bad soap operacameos in this film not to mention O.J. Simpson but there is also something quite eerie and predictive about the entire movie. Written from 2 similar books The Glass tower and The Inferno Fox and WB joined forces rather than create 2 competing films. The exploding watertank ending is implausible as nothing could have drowned out all that fire and everybody tied down would have just been washed away. Gravity and physics just doesn't work like that. Dated Today the couple trapped on the reception floor would have just called for help on their cell phone instead of burning to death! McQueen and Newman made a great acting team of heroes and saved an otherwise overweight and overblown production that somewhatworks in spite of itself. What I like and hate about the film overall The exploding windows and people dropping to their death inside and outside and on fire in the Elevator very graphic and true and the overall premise that the building failed due to shoddy construction and major code violations. Yes wiring in the walls can catch fire and explode. All the fire detection water sprinklers and stairs were centered in the core to save money. Cheap construction in the stair wells' walls and gas lines as well? Just like the Twin Towers maybe the entire building should have pancaked down but I guess that seemed way too impossible at the time of this movie in 1974. A rousing John Williams musical score with Best Song Oscar. The mattes bluescreens and large miniatures are firstrate so I can't fault most of the action but such terrible dialog and acting! Buy the BluRay! Much better sound and picture!".

Top of the line green Naugahyde seat covers with white piping lots of harvest gold material lots of bellbottom clothing O.J. Simpson and Bobby Brady  what else could you ask for?!?! I do think this movie has a high puckerfactor  some scenes may leave a hole in your 70's Naugahyde easy chair. I also like that this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat without using silly 60's horror movie terror buildup techniques.I guess my only gripe would be the number of explosions throughout the movie. I know Paul Newman finds a gas leak but why? Fire didn't cause it and it was just sitting in the stairwell leaking. So what you have is a room here and a room there on fire then BOOM!! Maybe I missed the part where OJ comes back with a list of tenants for McQueen saying Ok on 79 we got FullGasCans R Us and on floor 100 we got Bob's Quality Bombs and on 110 there's a TNT Mart. I just don't see what would be in a skyscraper that would cause such huge explosions and so many in the movie.Maybe that 1974 Walkman that Bobby Brady was wearing on his head was nitrous powered back then. Man talk about high tech  with those antennae McQueen could have just used HIM as the forward command communication post.I still think there could have been a lighter side in the movie if the elevator floors would have been shown covered with Twister mats. After seeing the gob of people crammed in there on top of each other trying to escape I thought that's what they were doing.Overall I wouldn't miss this movie if you have the chance to watch it. Just the opening scenes in the fire control rooms with OJ flipping switches have one of the highest BLF Blinky Light Factorlevels yet seen until Star Wars came along. Best rpoe".

	schema:reviewBody "Seen today it is impossible to watch THE TOWERING INFERNO without reflecting upon the tragedy that befell the World Trade Towers on 911. Perhaps even more disconcerting however is the discovery that the construction of the World Trade Towers actually prompted the two novels upon which THE TOWERING INFERNO was based THE TOWER by Richard Martin Stern and THE GLASS INFERNO by Thomas M. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson both of which concerned outofcontrol fires in skyscrapers.When the 1972 success of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE gave producer Irwin Allen the title Master of Disaster Allen set out to live up to it and moved to acquire the rights to THE TOWER. 20th Century Fox was outbid by Warner Brothersbut Allen saw a way to turn a big project into a bigger one and encouraged Fox to snap up the rights to the Scortia and Robinson novel. Allen then managed to negotiate a deal that found Fox and Warner combining forces on a single film THE TOWERING INFERNO. As written by Stirling Slilliphant the story concerned the world's tallest building on its grand openingwhen shoddy constructions causes a fire that traps hundreds of people above the eightyfirst floor.In a general sort of way INFERNO might have been called POSEIDON REDUX for while the specifics were quite different the concept was essentially the same an allstar cast trapped by a disaster and forced to fight for their lives. And the cast is amazing not only did Allen succeed in getting Steve McQueen and Paul Newman to costar he signed Faye Dunaway to play Newman's love interest and cast Fred Astaire against type as a conman. Even more astonishingly he lured reclusive and legendary film star Jennifer Jones out of retirement for the sympathetic role of Lisolette Mueller. Other notables include William Holden Richard Chamberlin Robert Wagner Susan Blakely Robert Wagner Susan Flannery Robert Vaughn and a prescandal O.J. Simpson.But POSEIDON and INFERNO differ in two very significant ways. POSEIDON focuses on the struggles of ten people who acted as a single unit throughout the film INFERNO casts a wider net with multiple story lines and the result is considerably looser in terms of plot and action. With the exception of long shots of the ship POSEIDON did not use miniaturesand indeed every set and effect was real time the sets were real the water was real the fire was real and the cast which did most of the stunts was very much in the middle of it. The fire and the heights involved in INFERNO however were too dangerous for such and consequently INFERNO makes considerable use of miniatures various process shots matte paintings and rear projection and stunt people. Some of this has not dated well at all.With its loose structure the occasional dated effect and a running time of almost three hours THE TOWERING INFERNO is sometimes less tense than simply wearingbut only occasionally and even with these defects it remains a visually fascinating display of preCGI state of the art in special effects. At its best it is an extremely exciting film and certainly 1974 audiences found it so it would play in theatrical release for close to a full year becoming one of the biggest box office hits of the decade.The current Special Edition DVD release is quite fine including a host of extras that range from a nicely done AMC Backstory documentary to an interview with Irwin Allen himself the various commentary tracks one of the scene specific re effects and stunt work are also well done although I did think it a pity that none of the surviving cast could be lured into commentaries of their own. The picture quality is excellent and the sound quality quite good. People will probably always argue about which is better THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE or THE TOWERING INFERNO. My money is on POSEIDON but there's no denying that INFERNO even with its occasional flaws is right up there in the genre. Recommended for disaster film junkies without hesitation!

	onyx:emotionText "Probable SPOILERS This is the first Irwin Allen production after the big success of 'The Poseidon Adventure the most OVERRATED escape adventure of our time to read my review of it click on my name' and without a doubt his best movie.Architect Doug Roberts Paul Newman 'Cat On A Hot Tin Roof' returns from a vacation to be at the inauguration party for the Glass Tower the skyscraper he has designed.Soon though he finds out that the wiring employed for the building is well substandard and asks explanations from the building's constructor James Duncan William Holden 'Picnic' who tells him he should talk to his soninlaw Roger Richard Chamberlain 'Dr. Kildare'.In the meanwhile a spark in a restroom at the 81st floor lights some rags and starts a fire which will put all the people at the party which takes place on the 135th floor and who live above the 81st floor in danger because the 'kooky wiring could make fires breaking out everywhere'.This movie is almost 3 hours long but when you watch it it goes at a way faster pace than a lot of the other disaster movies especially 'Titanic' and 'The Poseidon Adventure' and it's rooted in modern age's reality which makes it work better.AND it has a message cutting out safety for profit can only lead to disaster.With Newman Holden Chamberlain Faye Dunaway 'Bonnie  Clyde' Steve McQueen 'The Great Escape' Fred Astaire 'Top Hat' Jennifer Jones 'Love Is A Many Splendored Thing' Robert Vaughn 'The Man From UNCLE' Susan Flannery yeah Stephanie from 'The Bold And The Beautiful' back when she was HOT Robert Wagner 'Hart To Hart' and the nowinfamous double murderer OJ Simpson 'The Naked Gun' Towering Inferno turns its competition into ashes and still stays tall after 31 years!

Take a horde of starsold and newdress them up stick them in the world's tallest building light a match and watch her go. This magnificent film containing a galaxy of movie stars and effects that hold up more than 25 years later has been unfairly maligned since Sept 11th 2001. Suddenly it's no longer appropriate to watch and enjoy a film about a burning skyscraper. Anyone with a soul would be devastated by what happened to the WTC but it doesn't defray affection for this piece of Hollywood history which is unrelated to that recent tragedy except for the type of setting. Is it strange to find entertaining a film which depicts hundreds of people trapped in a blazing building fighting for their lives? Perhaps. But no more strange than finding Schwarzenegger Willis and Stallone films entertaining in which dozens of people are graphically slaughtered before the viewers' eyes as they cheer for more! At least this film has an emphasis on heroism. It shows characters having regret for what they've allowed to happen and displays the risks that firemen take to complete their duties. Aside from all of that there's an irresistible cast irresistible if you have any knowledge of films made before 1990! working in a landmark film the first pairing of two major studios to work on one film and delivering the goods in spades. Newman is flawless as an identifiable everyman who had a dream but let it get out of his hands. His disbelief at the events and his sometimes futile efforts to halt them are believable. McQueen is no cardboard hero. He has a smart mouth but a compassionate core. The weight he gives this role and the interrelations with Newman make the film special. Dunaway is a dream come true. Her every move every glance calculated for maximum impact and attention. She was never more beautiful though underutilized! and she and Newman are a couple to root for. Watch the way she maneuvers her gossamer dress to retain focus during the crowd scenes. Holden is perfect as the bureaucratic builder who's too busy gladhanding everyone to see what's gone on. The remaining cast performs beautifully as well in their underdrawn characterizations bringing life and in some cases a generation of movie memories to their roles. In the 1990's an effort was made to revitalize and rejuvenate the disaster genre. Audiences were treated to every conceivable type of havoc and chaos and almost every one of those films was AWFUL. And all of them except Titanic was missing the one ingredient that nearly all of the 1970's films had.....GLAMOUR! Who cares if a tunnel blows up or a small town gets razed or a barn blows over??!!! But if a luxury liner or a plush private jet or the world's tallest building is in trouble then you have people's attention. And so what if someone in jeans and a tshirt gets dirty? Try it in evening gowns jewels and tuxedos and NOW you have some visually arresting moments. Think not? Imagine Shelley Winters in Poseidon having her big swim in a pair of stirrup pants.....or Faye Dunaway on the roof of the tower in jeans.....or Stella Stevens in Poseidon just trotting up the Christmas tree in her khakis without having to change. Nobody got it. It's the tragedy of something beautiful being destroyed that's intriguing. In this film everything is splendid and opulent but when it's over only the important things remain....what's wrong with that?".

	schema:reviewBody "This 1933 version of the Charles Dickens masterpiece is a true oddity. Featuring performances ranging from very good to hysterically bad and camera work ranging from amateurish with glimpses of visual artistry and beauty. Dickie Moore is a very young Oliver Twist with the face of an angel but zero acting ability. This fact didn't bother me as some of the faces this kid makes are just so hilarious and inappropriate for the scene he is playing that you just gotta love him! It is actually an endearing performance. Sonny Ray the actor who played the Artful Dodger had to be pushing 40 which also brought about some unintentional laughter. He also was utterly devoid of any acting talent whatsoever which makes me wonder just why he was cast at all. However others fare much better here. William Boyd was quite effective and fearful as the sinister Bill Sykes and Irving Pichel certainly looked the part of Fagin. Also worth mentioning is an actress named Barbara Kent who played the part of 'Rose'. Again no acting talent whatsoever but she possessed that certain porcelain beauty that is associated with silent film stars and she is delightful to look at here. It must not be forgotten that this is a 1933 production and one of the first 'talkies'. This was a transitional time for cinema as actors were still employing the techniques that were used during the silent film days where body movements and facial expressions were greatly exaggerated in order to get the point across without spoken dialog. This kind of acting is sometimes present here and i do not think it hinders the production. The best performance has to be that of Nancy Sikes played wonderfully here by actress Doris Lloyd. She played that difficult part with the right measure of hardness with a heart and a good nature kept well hidden from scoundrels Fagin and Bill. The fact that this has such a low budget lends this old film a spooky sometimes surreal quality. There is some effective use of shadows and light. The dark murky quality here makes Fagin and the others appear as sickly degenerates. And best of all it follows the Dickens story quite faithfully omitting certain things for budget reasons most likely. I love the story so much and those who love to see these immortal characters come to life should get great enjoyment out of this film. This is the third film adaptation of Oliver that I have obtained. I enjoyed the Polanski version and the David Lean version even more. So by the time I got around to this version it was just a pleasure to see all these characters that I know so well come to life in yet another production of this timeless story. Also the fact that this film is so old lends it another level of mystery and strange beauty somehow. Sometimes a low budget adds to the grittiness of the material. And this is one of the few versions that includes the final scene of Fagin in prison where he is visited by Oliver an important scene that is sadly missing from the David Lean version. For fans of the book and the other films I recommend hunting down this lesserknown film version of a literary masterpiece. This should be a treat especially for fans of the earlier days of cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "This 1933 film is just adequate like a detailed synopsis of the story of OLIVER TWIST. Unlike the 1948 LeanGuiness blockbuster or the 1968 ReedMoody treat this one is soso. I only comment on it for two reasons. First Dicky Moore played Oliver not as well as John Howard Davies or Mark Lester in the later two films. Apparently the director and producer were looking for a child star to mirror the 1922 silent film version with Jackie Coogan as Oliver and Lon Chaney Sr. as Fagin. Moore was rather stiff in the role as were most of the performers. The second reason is that unlike the 1948 version and the musical this film did include one of Dickens' best written chapters Fagin in the Death Cell.Spoiler ahead  and I apologize as I have refrained from going into it in the two earlier comments.Fagin discovers through a spy that Nancy had contacted Mr. Brownlow and endangered the entire gang to help Oliver. Angry he goes to Bill Sykes and tells him this. Sykes hates informers and is doubly betrayed because he has in his rough way loved and protected Nancy. Fagin in the novel encourages Sykes to punish Nancy in a way to demonstrate what happens to informers. Sykes kills Nancy.A hueandcry goes up against Sykes. Brownlow tells the authorities what Nancy told him so the law also goes against Fagin as well also Monk the secret enemy of Oliver. Fagin is arrested fairly easily in the novel. Sykes is killed in trying to flee the mob.Now in Lean's film Guinness as Fagin did not order the murder. In fact he told Sykes to be gentle with punishing Nancy. He is trapped as the mob is breaking down the door of the warehouse he has been hiding in. Guinness suddenly shows his grit and spunk and as the door crashes demands to know what right the mob has to destroy him. We last see him arrested and taken away.In OLIVER the musical had Fagin and the Artful Dodger manage to evade the mob although Fagin loses the box of stolen jewelry and watches he has kept for himself. It falls into the Thames. Dodger pulls Fagin away. They see the end of Sykes and then Fagin considers his options. He's getting too old for this type of life. Dodger is not that thrilled about it either they've just barely escaped with their lives from a mob. Fagin decides it's time to reform. He and Dodger go off together presumably to try to build up a safer more respectable life.In the novel there is not second chance for Fagin. He basically ordered a hit by Sykes on Nancy and he should pay for it. He is tried for her murder There is no Sykes to share the odium with possibly pass the blame onto. He barely understands the trial  he's in a state of shock. So he only vaguely understands when he is condemned to death. We see him in the cell and he is slowly going mad. He sees the evil acts he has committed in the past and the lack of any friends to help him including the Dodger who was tried and sentenced to transporting to Australia in the novel. But hours before the end Brownlow brings Oliver to see Fagin because the boy asks him to. It momentarily raises Fagin's hopes. He whispers to Oliver a weird plan to escape the noose outside with Oliver pretending to lead Fagin out of the cell to safety. It's too much for Oliver and the boy cries for God to forgive Fagin's soul. Brownlow takes Oliver out and Fagin remains to be hanged.Oddly enough the chapter only appeared in this version of 1933 as opposed to the 1947 and 1968 films. It is not done very well  again the stiffness of the actors ruins it but it is shown. Also the moment of the execution is brought home to the audience when as Oliver and Brownlow leave the prison a black flag is hoisted up the flagpole symbolizing the death of Fagin.For showing that particular moment of the novel at all I'll grant this very inferior version a five.".

In case you don't already know the ending to this classic tale I'll stop here  and let you watch for yourself.There are apparently numerous versions of Oliver Twist which I have not seen.  This one seems to be panned by critics as sub par. Personally I found the movie interesting and watchable although it is nowhere near a classic.  I liked the young actor who played Oliver.  In fact the movie was inhabited by interesting characters including Irving Pichel as Fagin a memorable woman named Nancy the young thief called The Artful Dodger the old man who became Oliver's benefactor and his niece who lived with him as well as others.  Some comments have been that the acting in the movie was poor but I humbly disagree on that point.  I credit the vast majority of the movie's actors with doing a nice job of bringing their character's to life. The problem I fear lies with the director who obviously was into cheesy shots of the child smiling and inserting hammy silently movie style scenes that were overly dramatic and detracted from a movie which was unfolding rather nicely otherwise. Oliver Twist gets a 70100 on my scale a C  .    It is an interesting vintage movie of the classic book but it's nowhere near a classic.   This version is probably best recommended only to vintage film aficionados.".

I credit the vast majority of the movie's actors with doing a nice job of bringing their character's to life. The problem I fear lies with the director who obviously was into cheesy shots of the child smiling and inserting hammy silently movie style scenes that were overly dramatic and detracted from a movie which was unfolding rather nicely otherwise. Oliver Twist gets a 70100 on my scale a C  .    It is an interesting vintage movie of the classic book but it's nowhere near a classic.   This version is probably best recommended only to vintage film aficionados.";

There was notable plot and character development in early movies mainly because the special effects weren't very good if there were any at all. The acting was a theatrical type acting rather than cinematic. This was because of the connections to vaudeville that most actors and actresses had at the time. This is like the difference between a live Broadway Play and a Hollywood movie. As a modern movie this is a poor excuse of a movie. There is no graphic violence no adult language no space ships or aliens. If you want a movie that tells a story and will keep you wrapped up in a specific plot you won't be disappointed.".

It's an interesting alternative to the 1948 version though although admittedly that one is more detailed and more loyal to the book. The 1933 version moves at a faster pace. As a result it is considerably shorter. This version is also clearly made under a cheaper budget while the 1948 version looks more expensive but this fact doesn't bother me.The 1933 version isn't yet the first movie adaptation of this familiar story however it had the merit of being the first sound version. In this version Irving Pichel plays Fagin and frankly I prefer him over the 1948 version's Fagin who is just too ugly and creepy. At least Fagin here is nowhere near as creepy. The controversial William Stage Boyd stars as Bill Sikes in this version. Comparing to the 1948 version's Sikes this Sikes looks much bigger and more intimidating although more delicate in his speeches.I like Dickie Moore as Oliver Twist. Even though John Howard Davies plays Oliver Twist with more feeling and his acting seems more realistic I don't think that Dickie Moore is any inferior. His performance is just different. Dickie Moore is perfectly cute although he is a quite young and tiny Oliver Twist. True sometimes he makes hilarious faces which aren't appropriate for the scenes he is performing but I find that rather amusing instead of something to criticize and I like him for that.".

What with scrubbing floors and being underfed the spirited boy has the temerity to ask for more!!! After the workhouse is thrown into an uproar Oliver runs away  in a scene identical to the 1922 Jackie Coogan film Oliver performs cartwheels and handstands for the entertainment of a passing coach. Weary and footsore he reaches London and is at once swept into the den of the evil Fagin. He runs a gang of young thieves and it isn't too long before Oliver is in the streets trying to pick a pocket or two. He is caught by Mr. Brownlow who takes him home and treats him as one of the family. Fagin and his cronies are working to recover him and when Oliver is sent on an errand to the bookstall Nancy Doris Lloyd seeks him out claiming he is her brother. Nancy sees in Oliver an innocent child as she once was and is determined to save him and return him to his guardian Mr. Brownlow.For a poverty row film this is an entertaining adaptation. The general story of Oliver Twist is there and because it was made before the code it has all the grittiness and realism of the original book. There is a harrowing scene when Nancy is murdered that is shown in silhouette and another one where Sykes tries to drown his faithful dog Bullseye but the dog escapes. Both Boyd Sykes and Pichel Fagin are excellent in their roles.Dickie Moore one of the least cloying of child actors was given the biggest role of his career as Oliver. Irving Pichel before he settled in as a director was a quirky character actor. William Stage' Boyd usually played detectives or lawyers  his main claim to fame was having the same name as William Hopalong Cassidy Boyd. Stage lived a wild life he eventually died in 1935 due to alcohol and drug abuse. When stories started to come out about him in the papers  Hopalong Cassidy's picture was used and his career was almost derailed. Barbara Kent's who is still alive most famous film was Flesh and the Devil  she was the good girl as opposed to Greta Garbo's bad girl. She was also the girl in Lonesome an important silent film similar to The Crowd and directed by Paul Fejos. After that film she did nothing more of interest. Even though one reviewer questioned her acting ability  as Rose Maylie she wasn't called on to do anything other than stand around and look beautiful which she did. Funnily enough Nelson McDowall and Virginia Sale were mentioned in the cast as playing the Sowerbys but they did not appear in the film I saw.Recommended.".

Fortunately the rest of the film DID look period and the costumes and sets appropriate. But because it was Monogram the film is full of mostly unknown and lesser talents. By far the most famous star is young Dickie Moore who plays Oliver Twista bad casting decision but not a surprising one as Moore was about the hottest male child actor of the day. He was simply adorable. But he was also too young for the role and he was not a particularly good actorat least in this point in his young life. Also oddly the Artful Dodger was way too oldlooking like a man in his 20s instead of a precocious teen criminal. As for the rest however they were surprisingly good.As far as the story goes it was greatly rushedand that is the biggest deficit of the film apart from Moore. Instead of slowly unfolding it seemed to go way too quickly. But it did hit the important parts of the Dickens story and did something subsequent versions seemed to forgetthat in the end Fagan was hung for his litany of crimes! All in all worth seeing and surprisingly well done.NOTE I previously reviewed this one and was much harsher towards it. I am not sure why but it seemed better the second time around...".

COMMENT What we have here is virtually a Reader's Digest version of the Lloyd film in which each episode is either truncated or rigorously condensed. As with the previous version there are few if any intentional laughs but there are not too many thrills eitherand all of these are supplied by William Stage Boyd. Both direction and production values as might be expected are considerably below the 1922 standard. True the direction by Messrs Brenon and Cowen does exhibit a few traces of style but generally it is dull lumbering and heavyhanded.  Worse few of the players can compare either. In fact with only three exceptions the players here hit a standard that seems slightly below that offered by their silent counterparts. Those three players are Boyd Moore and Holman. Holman's part is small but important and he does succeed in making an impression. Boyd is great. His Sikes must rank as the definitive one against which all others are measured. Master Moore deserves a paragraph all to himself. Although he plays the title role the directors go out of their way to give him as little footage as possible. And no wonder! He is one lousy actor and is my nominee for Worst Performance by a Juvenile in a Lead Role.AVAILABLE on DVD through Alpha. Quality rating 810.".

	schema:headline " Not the best version of Oliver Twist but not bad";
	schema:reviewBody "For me David Lean's film is still the best version of Charles Dickens' great novel. However while flawed this 1933 version is worth seeing at least for curiosity value. It is too short at 70 minutes and feels rather rushed narratively. Dickie Moore is cute as Oliver but looks comfortable and his performance consists of a lot of overdone facial expressions. I also didn't find the performance of Artful Dodger very believable either Sonny Ray might have made a good Fagin but he is too old as Dodger. However while slightly stagey at times dramatically it is hardly cheaply rendered visually. And there are a handful of good performances. Lionel Belmore is a decent Mr Bumble if never really erasing memories of Harry Secombe and Francis L. Sullivan and Alec B. Francis a humble Mr Brownlow. But the three best performances are Doris Lloyd as a hardedged but vulnerable Nancy William Boyd as a frightening Bill Sykes and Irving Pichel as a suitably oily Fagin. So all in all not one of my favourite Dickens but better than anticipated better than the 1934 version of Jane Eyre anyhow. 610 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "OLIVER TWIST A Monogram Special 1933 directed by William J. Cowan stars child actor Dickie Moore courtesy of Hal Roach Studios in his first leading role in a feature film presentation. As much as this Charles Dickens based story had been told and retold numerous times during the silent era with notable screen adaptations being Paramount 1916 with Marie Coro Oliver and Tully Marshall Fagin and First National 1922 starring Jackie Coogan Oliver and Lon Chaney Fagin it would be a matter of time before the movie audiences would get some more OLIVER TWIST this time with sound. While major movie studios as MetroGoldwynMayer RKO or Universal might have started the trend of Dickens novels transferred to film the interesting fact was that the aforementioned major studios were the ones to follow Monogram's poverty row distribution of 1933. Universal provided GREAT EXPECTATIONS 1934 while MGM produced two of the finest of Dickens 1935 adaptations of David COPPERFIELD and A TALE OF TWO CITIES and three years later A Christmas CAROL 1938 but this I.E. Chadwick's production for Monogram very much on a lowbudget scale might prove worthy in spite of disappointing presentation.Following the opening credits the fadein begins with an open book on the first page to CHAPTER 1 that reads Among other public buildings in a certain town which for many reasons it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning there is one anciently common to most towns great or small to wit a workhouse and in this workhouse was born the item of mortality whose name is prefix on the title of that chapter. The story then revolves around a young lad named Oliver Twist Dickie Moore an orphan in 19th century England raised by a Mr. Bumble Lionel Bellmore who played Mr. Brownlow in the 1922 version who on his ninth birthday puts him to work in a workhouse. After running away from slave labor and deprived of more food to eat he journeys towards London where he encounters the likes of various people including the Artful Dodger Sonny Ray Fagin Irving Pichel and his gang of thieves consisting of Bill and Nancy Sikes William Boyd and Doris Lloyd Charlie Bates George Nash Toby Crackit George K. Arthur the kindly old Mr. Brownlow Alec B. Francis and his pretty niece Rose Mayley Barbara Kent through some twist of fate would all become part of his life.Though many feel Dickie Moore to be both miscast and way too young in the title role this edition to OLIVER TWIST has become his most memorable though not fascinating. Regrettably his performance somewhat weakens the story through scenes involving him appear to be seemingly under rehearsed. Moore reads some of his lines with no expression as if he's reciting them for the first time. In one scene he's scrubbing the brick floor of the dining room slips down by accident then smilingly looks towards the camera range loses his smile carries his water bucker and walks away. Brutal beatings are depicted by shadows of actors hitting of whipping the floor rather than their victims. The meeting place under the London Bridge at midnight involving Nancy Mr. Brownlow and Rose as properly captured by moments of their shadows on the wall but in spite of this being a secret meeting Nancy should have conversed in a whispering fashion rather than loud enough for all including one of Fagin's spies to hear. It's hard not to notice where Moore's face in close up to be covered with watery tears and next long shot face to be clear and dry.Aside from faults and goofs that might have been rectified before its theatrical release as well as elimination of certain major characters from the Dickens novel one of the stronger aspects for this production is Irving Pichel courtesy of Paramount Pictures. Assuming a role previously portrayed by the legendary Lon Chaney a decade ago Pichel offers an fine reenactment as Fagin. Doris Lloyd's Nancy is believably likable and sympathetic while William Boyd not the Hopalong Cassidy actor is quite intense as the menacing villain who kills without mercy. He certainly must have gotten some hissing and booing from movie audiences back in the day for a scene where he attempts to kill Nancy's dog Bullseye. Contrary to movie remakes it would be a matter of time before OLIVER TWIST would be retold on the screen again. Two superior adaptations followed the 1948 David Lean British made production and the 1968 Columbia musical adaptation to the Broadway play that won Best Picture of that year. Once watching those it's often hard referring back to the Dickie Moore version which with slow pacing sans mood musical score giving it that early talkie 1929 feel would be an endless 70 minute bore for contemporary viewers. Initially released in theaters with opening image of Charles Dickens on the book cover of Oliver Twist circulating prints replace that with different title placing Irving Pichel's name next to Dickie Moore's above its OLIVER TWIST title. Unseen on broadcast television since or about 1973 OLIVER TWIST which has fallen to public domain became readily available again in the 1980s on home video cable television CBN Nickelodian's 198889 presentation of Nick and Night Movie and public television part of its weekly series titled SPROCKETS before its latter transfer onto DVD and so forth.While this and Monogram's followup literary tale of Charlotte Bronte's JANE EYRE 1934 with Virginia Bruce are not perfect screen adaptations to become one of the family it would be the major studios and made for television movies that would over the years transcribe these stories again to much better results. 12".

The Artful Dodger and his band of kids are now a band of college age reprobates trying to be much younger. William Stage Boyd as Bill Sykes is mostly over the top thanks to a script that makes him a bit too manic and menacing.

It's hard to tell which group is worse as both tussle for control of the school and each other. Beautifully shot as are all Bellocchio's films. The film has the Church clearly starting to lose it's corrupted influence but it's not like we have much to be cheery about in the thought of these rich young thugs running the world either. The surprising thing is how much of this is quite funny. The themes may be depressing but the individual characters and their actions are often darkly comic sometimes too much for me one boy's voice has been dubbed with something that sounds like Mel Blanc created it for a cartoon.

He took the job she left and ironically they first met when he attempted to bribe her away from her job at a record store so that he could be near her coworker a girl he wished to date. Although considered a nuisance at first Aoi finds him a bit of a kindred spirit and casts him in a leading role in her college student film The End of the World which she has written and will direct. Aoi takes the leading role opposite Tomoya when her leading actress Kyoko refuses to do a kissing scene. The two continue to console each other about their lack of romantic relationships and job opportunities in an outwardly platonic manner but underneath deeper currents are running. Aoi's ...";

The pace of the movie is slow without much plot so for impatient viewers this might not be the best choice. I've noticed that with Japanese romances most people opt for the junai genre with two protagonists falling in love then one of them dies leaving one person behind sad but optimistic nevertheless and the story ends up being very touching but of course clich and lacking in cinematic creativity. Rainbow Song is definitely not that kind of a movie though it might appear so deceivingly. Here what's usually the ending in other romances is told first right in the beginning so there's no surprise in the plot. You should not watch this movie expecting a surprising ending that will make you go Wow! that's not the point of the movie. The point is to take viewers through the relationship of two young people who like most of us have their strong and weak points. Through the movie we watch their relationship develop or fail to develop for that matter through carefully constructed details of their time spent together and also apart. The filming is absolutely beautiful  melancholy but very realistic. All of the young actors here did their job very well particularly Ueno Juri and Aoi Yuu.Bottom line a subtle movie that will be very touching if you pay attention to the details the filming the changes in each character and not necessarily plot development.".

	schema:reviewBody "As the heading say's not a fan of these type of films. But the fact I was coming of after watching Swing Girls 2004 with the beautiful Juri Ueno. If you haven't seen Swing Girls do yourself a favour and go find a copy of the film It's one of the most joyous coming of age musical comedies you'll see. Ueno is the standout in that film and the actresses has the comedy chops to back it up. So Rainbow Song was next on the list.As a few have said this is more realistic take on romance then the stereotypical Hollywood or even Asian fluff you get with Romantic films. Sure I won't say it doesn't have it's moment of cheesiness but this film a bit like The Notebook gets away with it cause of it's tight script and fantastic performances. This is Juri Ueno's film all the way she isn't in the film that long surprisingly she's not in the first 20 minutes or good portion of the third act but she makes sure Aoi's is a memorable and loveable character and I do think the film is at it's strongest when Juri's is front and centre. The scene at the speed dating and the following scene on the bridge if that doesn't have the eyes a bit watery then I don't know what will.Hayato Ichihara as Tomoyo more then holds his own and delivers a fantastic performance. At times you want to slap him cause he can't see how much Aoi loves him but you can't help but feel for the guy by the end. The ending for me is a gut punch Tomoyo forever haunted by the girl he let go. It's a true tearjerker moment that isn't overdone.Also great to see Yu Aoi on a small role as Aoi's younger blind Sister even though in real life Yu is only two months younger then Juri and she leaves her mark I was slightly worried they were going to have her as the new love interest but they didn't go that route. Also a shout out for Shoko Aida as Tomoyo's older girlfriend. maybe it's just me I actually felt for her even though she lied. It's not perfect It's shot a bit like a TV Movie I think the film drags a little by the end and I'm not a big fan of the ending I think Tomoko deserves a better ending. But watch this for Juri's Ueno's fantastic performance aided by a great support cast.".

Geeky Casey has the idea that the staff have been infected taken over by aliens using their bodies as hosts.  Casey's theory spreads to a group of students who decide to take a stand.Oh my God  an enjoyable and quite clever teen movie!  Something must be wrong!  The plot is basically a teen twist on The Invasion of the Body Snatchers but is filled with clever references and jokes related to scifi. This makes it stand out from other teen movies in that it cleverly plays with the usual stereotypes and makes them feel fresh.  The group itself is close to the usual group that learns to get along and accept each other a la Breakfast Club  except here they get along through drugs and the battle against aliens!The director is better known for his big OTT action stuff but here he does a good job with a slow build up and a real feeling of paranoia.  Of course it's not as good as the actual Body Snatchers but it still has a real good feeling of fear and tension.  The effects are good but Rodriguez uses them sparingly for the most part helping the mood of uncertainty and fear.The cast are all good.  The teens play the stereotypes well but they are outshone by the adults who all get to ham it up in sinister roles.  Many of the adults are wasted in minor roles  Hayek for one is barely in it and MacDonald deserves more than a few minutes.  Patrick is very good considering that it could have easily been his T2 role again  running in that distinctive way etc but he is suitably sinister.  Janssen is also good  transforming from a shy flower into her usual vamp.  Cameos from Usher Summer Phoenix and a seemingly pointless role for Harry Knowles he's been bought! don't spoil this.Overall as a scifi horror it's pretty good if not great  there are better films around.  But as a teen movie it is head and shoulders above the rest of this rather sorry genre and has enough tension drama and references to be very enjoyable.".

This is a teen horror movie that gives you everything you'd want from a teen movie and everything you'd want from a creature feature all in one. But what else is to be expected when you got Robert Rodriguez behind the lens? Any other director and this film would be tossed aside as just a teen body snatcher movie. But Robert Rodriguez shows here that he has the style to make it more than that.Now I've read the script to this movie before I even saw it and I kept thinking to myself there has to be another draft of this no way this could really work and be taken seriously... or as serious as you can take a movie like this. Yet not only was I surprised to see how much of the original script Rodriguez kept in but I was even more surprised to see how well things actually played out. Sometimes I really love being wrong.This film delivers just as much as any other Rodriguez picture that calls back to the good old days of the Grindhouse and makes us forget that those movies weren't even close to par with these tribute films that somehow manage to surpass the movies they're tributing. You get everything you want and leave wishing you could spend more time in high school... or at least at this high school.This film to me is the second in Rodriguez's own unofficial Scifi Grindhouse trilogy. Starting with From Dusk Till Dawn and ending with Planet Terror. Want to treat yourself to some fun? Watch all three back to back to back. You won't be disappointed.710".

Zeke Tyler Josh Hartnett who is repeating the senior year and sells drugs to the other students has an argument with his teacher Elizabeth Burke Famke Janssen.

Delilah and Casey witness the coach and the teacher attacking Nurse Rosa Harper Salma Hayek and they stumble with the corpse of Mrs. Jessica Brummel Susan Willis who has recently died in the closet. They call the police but are discredited by Principal Valerie Drake Bebe Neuwirth. On the next morning Casey discloses to Delilah Stokely and Stan that he believes that aliens are taking over the planet through their high school.

The acting is pretty much all very good the actors nearly all give topnotch performances. The special effects are good and mostly pretty convincing. I've heard a lot of people complain that this movie is a ripoff of the Carpenter classic The Thing. While that film is the better of the two this is by no means a simple ripoff. The plot in this is not the same there are just a few striking similarities. I would rather think of it as a reference something to honor Carpenter's abilities  Rodriguez was inspired by Carpenter after all. I would recommend this to pretty much anyone who enjoys slasher movies scifi flicks or crossovers of the two genres. It's very enjoyable the only thing I hated was that they had casted Elijah babyface Wood in one of the leads... oh well. You can't always enjoy all aspects of a film. 710".

In place of large guns spectacular stunt choreography and a silly soundtrack Rodrigues made The Faculty with a classy ensemble cast and some awesome special effects. The script is also very good featuring strong characterization and interesting dialog. All of these elements make The Faculty a very watchable film and make up for the completely unoriginal and not very coherent plot.The film begins as a paranoiac comedy about a typical high school where the students and faculty see each other as alien species. Ho hum. However after about 20 minutes of setup the faculty really starts to become an alien species as they are assimilated by waterloving parasites with very bad attitudes and a kind of group consciousness straight out of Invasion of The Body Snatchers and Star Trek's Borg. Six kids very unlikely teammates representing the archetypal teenage personalities of the postmodern world team up to try to save the world once they realize that the aliens can be driven off by of all things caffeine. Especially impressive are Elijah Wood Piper Laurie Robert Patrick Josh Hartnett and Clea DuVall.Like most of Rodrigues' films The Faculty never loses its sense of humor and pulls off its own absurdity with artful visualization and a tight driving pace. Unlike many of Rodrigues' films however The Faculty is disposable  it's not really meant to be viewed more than once. See it if you're a Rodrigues fan or somebody who enjoys the obscure but growing genre of horrorcomedy.".

The idea is a fresh new twist on a common story and it has a great cast. Probably the best cast of any scifi horror that comes to mind.Its entertaining but not that scary.This movie is about a group of students that attend high school. Everything goes along as normal until one day they start noticing their teachers acting very strange. After witnessing the teachers attack another teacher they reason the teachers have been taken over by aliens and the students are next.This movie was actually pretty good even the monster that looked pretty cheesy didn't take anything away from this.

This isn't just a comedy it is shocking and has great twists and thrills along the ride. At times it is down right scary. Even sexy nudity! It is all around entertaining with some pretty good acting. My personal favorite is the couple that is always fighting watch out for them! If you loved at least one of the FOUR film versions of Invasion of The Body Snatchers then you will truly enjoy the satire of this film and how much it truly honors previous classics in the way that Scream did. Now some say this film is for Teenagers who don't know any better than to think this is a great scifi film but the biggest fan of this film that I know is my 63 year old mother and I am surely not a teenager anymore.This film is a classic and yes it does feature teenagers as the main cast not the actors. But the adult characters make a great performance and even Jon Stewart is pretty entertaining as the science teacher.One film that you should stay for the cast credits just for Jon's appearance!".

Well purely this is one of my favorite horror films.Movies like HALLOWEEN DRACULA and Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 PSYCHO are only held in such high regard as horror films because they were all novelties. Movies like those hadn't been made a thousand times over which is why most people are always calling them the scariest. Well no they are not the scariest. But since they were some of the first of their kinds they say that they are.Well the plot of THE FACULTY has been done before. But not quite so well. While I didn't really think Kevin Williamson's TEACHING MRS. TINGLE was all that good THE FACULTY is still one of his better works. Director Robert Rodriguez FROM DUSK TILL DAWN..also a good movie directs this hardhitting scifihorrorcomedythrilleraction movie. Literally there is a little bit of everything here. The movie is not scary but there is a small shock factor thrown in. All in all most people should be able to find something fun out this movie. THE FACULTY 55.".

	schema:headline " The Faculty Is A Lot of Fun!";
	schema:reviewBody "Teenagers thrive on science fiction and horror flicks because these renegade movies with their improbable pulp fiction plots appeal to youthful sentiments about alienation and the lack of power that juveniles wrestle with in an adultdominated society. Not surprisingly Desperado director Robert Rodriguez's clever but derivative creature feature The Faculty starring Elijah Wood Robert Patrick Salma Hayek and Famke Janssen ridicules those traditional authority figuresteachers parents and the policewho curtail adolescent curiosity. As scripted by Scream scenarist Kevin Williamson The Faculty amounts to an entertaining but irreverent hodgepodge of The Breakfast Club meets Invasion of the Body Snatchers with a scene or two from The Thing grafted on for good measure. While adults may cringe at the messages that crop up teens will revel in this spooky sometimes scary spectacle. Inevitably any movie celebrating a drug dealer as a hero is bound to arouse the wrath of either the PTA or the PTO.The teachers at Herrington High School in suburban Ohio have started acting a little weird. Weird enough so that several students suspect aliens may have turned their faculty into puppets and are using them to stage a hostile takeover of not only their campus but also their town and perhaps even planet Earth. Of course students have always felt that their teachers come from another cosmos and The Faculty winks mischievously at this premise. Initially nobody believes that anything adverse is occurring and The Faculty unfolds like a hip 1990s' update of The Blackboard Jungle where the kids ruled the campus and the instructors were the casualties of an apathetic school board. An early scene invites such a comparison when Principal Drake Bebe Neuwirth of Jumanji informs her burnedout faculty that only the football team will get any new funding. Everybody else will have to suffer. Forget those new computers for the classrooms the drama teacher will have to recycle last year's sets and kiss any field trips goodbye.Things take an XFiles turn for the worst when Casey Elijah Wood of Deep Impact a geeky nonentity that bullies love to bash discovers an eggroll shaped critter on the football field and lets his biology teacher Mr. Furlong Jon Stewart of The Daily Show analyze it. Like a gremlin this squirmy thing mutates after they dunk it in an aquarium. When Mr. Furlong sticks his hand in the tank the things sprouts teeth and rips a chunk out of him. What the students don't know yet is that the critter has already assailed their hotheaded football coach Dick Willis Robert Patrick of Terminator 2 and that he has attacked the Principal Drake. Furthermore this parasite thrives on water and eventually the entire faculty cannot seem to gulp enough water. Basically this critter slips into your ears and takes over your body a variation on Jack Sholder's The Hidden 1987 but The Faculty parasite adds recruits to its zombielike ranks instead of skipping from one host to another like The Hidden. Insidiously enough the alien parasite plans to use the popular Friday night gridiron contest to boost its numbers.Scenarist Kevin I Know What You Did Last Summer Williamson populates The Faculty with a generic crosssection of high school types played by a talented young cast of fresh but little known faces. Shawn Hatosy brings humility to Stan the star quarterback who quits the team in a fit of conscience to improve his grades. As his girlfriend Delilah who heads the cheerleading squad and edits the school newspaper Jordana Brewster of The Fast  The Furious is appropriately catty and snobbish. Delilah dumps Stan because his newly found academic efforts clash with her need for prominence. Wearing more makeup than Elvira Clea DuVall of Heroes impersonates Stokely a moody misfit unfairly accused of being a lesbian. Although Stokely isn't really gay she adopts the persona because she refuses to click with the cliques. Meanwhile Zeke Josh Hartnett of Halloween H20 pedals drugs and taboo videos out of the trunk of his GTO but he conceals more brain cells than any druggie could especially when he duels with his English teacher about poetry. According to the script his irresponsible parents have abandoned him so Zeke has the run of his house. Finally as Mary Beth the new babe on campus Laura Harris deploys her designing Dixie charms to ingratiate herself with even the most dispossessed. No matter what she does just about everybody shuns poor Mary Beth.Nothing is either as simple or as straightfaced as it first appears in Kevin Williamson's ingenious script. Although the kids have found a cure they must solve the mystery of who was first infested so that they can kill the parasite and free everybody. Complicating matters is that the alien's army of zombies is multiplying like crazy and the enemy has our heroes surrounded outnumbered and perhaps even infiltrated. Predictably too Zeke's stash of narcotics runs low and the kids have to run a gauntlet of zombies to grab what little drugs remain to destroy it. Director Robert Rodriguez generates sustained suspense as our heroes struggle to outfox the elude the alien spawn and rarely lets the momentum flag.Bristling with atmosphere issues and surprises The Faculty qualifies as a witty ripsnorting reptilian chiller that never takes itself seriously. Good paranoid thrillers that keep audiences guessing up to fade out are few and far between. Indeed the characters get the short shrift but action rather than characterization propels The Faculty to its nailbiting finale. Nevertheless the filmmakers offset the lack of character development with cinematic and literary references to genre classics. Stokely and Casey engage in an illuminating colloquy about scifi literature and point out that Robert Heinlein's The Puppet Masters beats Jack Finney's Invasion of the Body Snatchers to the book racks. On the other hand they reveal that Hollywood has exploited Finney more frequently than Heinlein. Even if you abhor horror movies you might be able to tolerate this playful wellpaced hellraiser.".

In fact there's no such thing as an original story since long before my lifetime so the problem is trying to bring an unoriginal story to the table and developing in an entirely new way . What about a new spin on INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS ? How about setting it in an American high school and doing everything in a post modernist manner where the characters refer to all these alien infiltration movies ? If that isn't bad enough get Robert Rodriguez to direct it and you'll have a recipe for disaster I'm happy to report that years after THE FACULTY was produced it's far from a disaster but it suffers from two slight problems that it can't overcome . First of all the story is too overly familiar to be entirely successful . The 1978 remake of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS really surpassed the original and the terrifying premise was developed to its full potential and isn't a film you'll forget in a hurray . Compared to that masterpiece anything else is going to be lacking in comparison . Secondly there was a whole slew of movies in the 1990s either written by or inspired by screenwriter Kevin Williamson like SCREAM where smart ass teenagers find themselves in the same situation as other cinematic teenagers have been and feel the need to reference this . This fad died out as quickly as it appeared which means there's a very dated quality in watching these type of films almost twenty years later Not to be totally negative it is one of Rodriguez better films and he resists the temptation to bring stupid humour and unneeded gore to the movie . In fact the lack of gore makes it a strangely likable film in an era where horror films revolve around torture porn . The likability extends to the characters where even the rebellious drug dealing bad kid is a good kid at heart and seizes the opportunity to save the day . Compare this to the antiheroes of ATTACK THE BLOCK who are total and absolute scum throughout the entire narrative and you notice the world of difference . . One thing Rodriguez could have done a bit better is bring a sense of crushing fear that seems to be missing here . That said as a scifi horror movie there's been a lot worse before or since this one".

Their assumption proves to be correct and soon the high school is crawling with alien bodyseeking creatures! The starring teenagers are nerdy geek Elijah Wood as Casey outcast lesbian Clea DuVall as Stokely sexy cheerleader Jordana Brewster as Delilah football jock Shawn Hotosy as Stan nubile newby Laura Harris as Marybeth and rebel stoner Josh Hartnett as Zeke. Their mission becomes discovering and destroying the Queen of the earinvading slugs.I saw this film shortly after its original release and was able to enjoy it again recently. Perhaps I wasn't paying a whole lot of attention originally because I didn't experience the certainty of dj vu until the scene where the six students are in Mr. Hartnett's home lab wondering of one of them might be infected. This scene highlights the good characterizations writing Kevin Williamson and direction Robert Rodriguez in The Faculty. The script has some wit the cast is great and the story moves though it doesn't really achieve the above ordinary status obviously intended  it's no Scream.Of the adults coach Robert Patrick is the main villain he and the other adults play their roles with a good amount of creepy teacher edginess. Science professor Jon Stewart is a treat. Usher has a small nonsinging role. The kids don't look too too old to pass for high school seniors but a college setting might have been more interesting and believable. Neglected genius Hartnett who is repeating the twelfth grade and Ms. DuVall give the younger standout characterizations. DuVall's character is introduced as a lesbian but don't get your hopes up she's only pretending wtf?. The Faculty 1998 Robert Rodriguez  Elijah Wood Josh Hartnett Clea DuVall".

A High School in a small sports town is invaded by an alien parasite that can replicate the human body and blend in undetected. Sound familiar? So be it. Director Rodriguez pulls off this one with style and humor. From its brutally violent opening to its exciting climax as misfit students battle the unseen extraterrestrials and of course parents and police don't believe them and fall victim themselves until the whole town is taken over with the exception of a football jock a geeky halfpint a bitchy beauty a tomboy and a resourceful druggie.At times this seems like a metaphor for misunderstood teen angst and paranoia but comes off pretty slick due to Rodriguez's direction and good pacing. Lots of great lead performances including Elijah Wood before his 'Lord of the Rings' fame gorgeous Jordana Brewster and a menacing Robert Patrick. Some pretty cheesy effects make this a fun throwback to 80's films and a tight script brings life to the action. This is only dampened by an unneeded high school meanspiritedness that makes some of the characters unsympathetic and withdrawn. Although with that aside this is pretty solid stuff from the director of the equally entertaining 'From Dusk Til Dawn'. All the action is finally wrapped up in a good reinvigorating ending. Look for appearances by Salma Hayek Piper Laurie and Usher Raymond.".

The characters are all likable and have their own different personalities to where we care for at least one. The dialogue is spectacular with tons of references to film industry legends and marvels that you're bound to find nifty.The opening chase scene pulled me in and then the rest of the script and acting was what kept my attention because of how admirably it's played out as I have mentioned. I found myself loving the whole atmosphere which was set up perfectly and the story is fun and entertaining. The main alien when you find out who it is is not scary or even fresh but they're intimidating and exciting because of how well the plot is revealed and how wonderful the characacter's work. Another venerable trait is how they are intimidating without the crew trying way too hard to make them seem like they're this cool edgy alien that you should all be terrified of.The Faculty delivers and it's an exhilarating ride from beginning to end loaded with humorous dialogue great action and is brimming with virtuosity. Though some find it average and a bit overrated I think it is deserving of much more appreciation and acclaim than it receives. Magnificent film job very well done.".

Also the title was vaguely familiar  hmmm did it have a good rep but I had never seen it?So I taped it it was on at 2 a.m. on a network station and finally got around to watching it. Loved loved loved this movie! And that's coming from me a hater of teen horror flicks. First there's the distraction when you don't know what film you are watching of all the 'Oh Bebe Neuwirth! Oh Josh Hartnett! Oh John Stewart! Oh Usher! Oh Salma Hayek!' etc. etc.' when you really aren't expecting much. Then there are no distractions as the movie zoomed along steadily dropping clues setting up conflicts only to have alliances shift and new conflicts reveal themselves.One reason I never watch teen horror flicks is the pace is too regular. It's as if the director and writer can't gamble letting 3 minutes go by without someone dying a gory death to some telegraphic music.There wasn't too much of that in this movie. I was surprised when Josh Hartnett's character took off with one of the aliens in the back seat. In a cheesier movie there would be a cut to some other fast and furious slasher action to sort of bring up the intensity. There was just enough time in the wild car scene to keep your attention while you didn't have enough time to ponder how he was going to dump the alien. I liked the tired looking high school and the ordinary houses the kids lived in. None of that 'we're living in Ohio but the houses came from Sherman Oaks.'This movie did everything a movie is supposed to do  entertain. When I saw that it was a Robert Rodriguez film there was an 'A HA!' moment because this is just what I thought his film 'El Mariachi' accomplished  it entertained. After the movie ended you had that satisfied feeling that you had been amused and involved and sat on the edge of your seat sometimes.Good flick! That's high praise for this genre.".

	schema:headline " A true follow up to the original a masterpiece Elm Street best slasher ever my second favorite";
	schema:reviewBody "The best sequel since the original was much better sequel than Part 2 Freddy's Revenge was a huge improvement over lackluster part 2. A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors is definitely the masterpiece slasher sequel of the series. The movie is so much fun has the most creative deaths in the series has a lot of gore style imagination and good premise. Has also the most depth characters of all the franchise and these special effects are great. It is a badass supernatural slasher horror film. Third installment in the series is awesome clever and so unique sequel It has one of the best kills in the series. It is my second personal favorite Freddy slasher horror film in Elm Street series. I am a big big big fan and I love this movie to death. Directed was by Chuck Russell who genially directed the movie it is my number 1 favorite Chuck Russell film the second one is The Blob. I love this movie to death it is my personal favorite slasher film. This movie should have been part 2. This movie was directed by Chuck Russell the screenplay and the story was written by Wes Craven master him self with Chuck Russell Bruce Wagner and Frank Darabont that is why the movie was such a big success. Another thing is that the kills are some of the best kills of the series. I appreciate A Nightmare on Elm Street 3. Dream Warriors to death best 80's slasher Chuck Russell Wes Craven Bruce Wagner and Frank Darabont worked hard on the screenplay and the story.The Dream Warriors are Kristen Patricia Arquette  Kincaid Ken Sagoes WillIra Heiden  Taryn Jennifer Rubin and Joey Rodney Eastman. I love this kids portrayed in the movie I love them so much. This one has a creative idea where each kid has their own ability in a dream sequence. The soundtracks were performed by Dokken Dream Warriors and Into the Fire great songs. A lot of people prefer this movie over the original is their favorite film. This is a great horror slasher film and it is a 10 for my opinion. Fantastic story well acted from the cast. Freddy Krueger is still menacing and dark but Robert Englund's performance from the original is different he is not scary creepy like he was in the original but he is still terrifying as slasher villain.Heather Langenkamp returns as Nancy Thompson from the first movie for this sequel after 6 years after the first film. We finally see what happened to Nancy Thompson she become Westin Hills Psychologist to help kids in the hospital to defend them self against Freddy's fear. Heather Langenkamp is my favorite scream horror actress I am huge Nancy Thompson fan and I just love her in this movie so much. Heather Langenkamp is not quite up to par with her performance the first A Nightmare on Elm Street and New Nightmare still she was unique heroine but she still could have done it much more job like she was in the original.The future Oscarwinning Patricia Arquette as Kristen Parker is excellent unique as teenager who get's sucked in to this dreams by Freddy Krueger and she is excellent I love her performance in this movie so much. Kristen has such a creative power in which she has ability to pull people into her dream sequence that was awesome. Laurence Fishburne is one of the paramedics of the hospital as Max he is so skinny and young he was not always fat and ugly he was so like able in this movie. I love his performance so much that time his name was Larry before he changed in to Laurence. Craig Wasson as Neil Gordon psychiatrist I n the hospital was unique here in the movie ever he was one the reasons he helped defeat Freddy he found Fred's remains with help from Lt. Donald Thompson John Saxon. John Saxon retunes as Lt. Thompson in this movie that is why I think it is almost good as the original I didn't not want that the main heroine dies but still a badass supernatural sequel my second favorite Freddy film.Will was excellent who was a wizard blasting Freddy and the wheelchair with his green light awesome. The salvage yard sequence is my favorite scene of the in tier film in which Neil and Donald finds Fred's remains. The skeleton fighting with Neil and Donald was excellent and the best action horror scene ever. I love the holly water using on Freddy in the movie. We can say the third sequel A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors is the best sequel in the Elm Street series it is a masterpiece slasher horror film it is my second personal favorite Freddy slasher film in the series.".

	schema:headline " The best Nightmare on Elm Street film ever made! Dream Warriors is awesome!";
	schema:reviewBody "A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors 1987 is definitely the best sequel horror slasher film in the series franchise! It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 is my second favorite best film in the franchise that I just love this film to death! I love A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984 this one A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors 1987 and New Nightmare 1994 to death! This one is the first best favorite film of mine and I just love everything they did in this film. My awesome favorite heroine Nancy Thompson Heather Langenkamp is back and better than ever! She is a bad ass! I love everything about this film everything and I love it to death!P Welcome to Prime time Bitch!This was a MAJOR improvement over the disaster part 2 The Gore FX were excellent and the story was well written. It's too bad Nancy was killed off it would have been nice to see her in future sequels. I love this horror slasher film to death it is very imaginative entertaining a good set of characters some fun catchphrasesdialogue a great Dokken song aka Dream Warriors...a lot of awesome stuff is in this one. Why I love this film? Nancy Thompson Heather Langenkamp returns which you already know I love the main heroine so much in the series franchise. John Saxon also returns as Det. Donald Thompson. Wes Craven is back as writer in this film the movie is a little longer than the first and the second film. This is Patricia Arquette's first movie. In my opinion it is her first best movie alongside with Stigmata 1999 in other films she made were just awful or some sucked! Anyway I love Patricia Arquette here She's beautiful vibrant and has so much emotion in her lovely eyes. A really essential female lead for a film this big. This is how you correctly make a sequel. This one really felt like Part 2 to me because of the continuation from the 1st movie. The hospital setting fit the theme perfectly and this one contains one of my favorite death scenes in the whole series. Also 80's band Dokken recorded a few songs for the movie which is another reason why this is a mustsee for Nightmare fans.Chuck Russell is one of my favorite directors he directed The Mask 1994 with Jim Carrey that I love Eraser with Arnold Schwarzenegger and The Blob 1988 a year later which I also love so much. I think he made great choose of casting the actors alongside with Wes Craven the idea and imaginative of the film flick were just really awesome how they scramble in to making a movie! Robert England is pure gold in this film seriously I just love his imaginative and portrayal of Freddy Krueger in this film! The man is the main legend as the villain in the series! It has a cool premise and I really enjoy The characters. To me this is the 1st best horror sequel ever made after A Nightmare on Elm Street which is the second favorite one in the franchise. I Love this film so much.I only have one major problem with the film and that is Nancy dies on the end of the film here. Even tough she dies the death scene was awesome because it was honorable death! She stopped Freddy for hurting anyone else and Kristen Parker. The death scene was honorable to me because Kristen  Patricia Arquette was crying over her death and just love how Kristen showed how of a heart she has and that she is a good wonderful person and a human been. Wes Craven did not wanted to kill Nancy off. He did not like the idea that they killed her off! Jason Saxon as Donald Thompson is also killed by the end of the film which that shouldn't be in here also! The idea for local psychiatric hospital for teens in this film was just very brilliant and very imaginative praise to Wes Craven. A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors Freddy Krueger Robert Englund who invades the minds of a new group of teens  and the nightmares begin again. Local teenagers start dying and only Nancy Thompson Heather Langenkamp knows the truth. Now a doctor at the local psychiatric hospital she is the lone survivor of one of Freddy's previous killing sprees. Now it's a fight against her coworkers' disbelief and a race against time to stop Freddy before he kills again. That's your basic plot. It does involve travel and invading in to the minds of a teen's dreams. 1010 Grade Bad Ass Seal Of Approval".

It's one of the better 'ELM STREET' films in the series and was one of the cinematic highlights of 1987. Like THE LOST BOYS which was also released in 1987 it has style imagination a good premise and gore. It does have a few faults though. Some of the special effects are dated and look quite cheesy and the flick seems to rely more on blood than genuine scares at times. Also while by no means terrible Heather Langenkamp's performance is not quite up to par with her performance in the first 'ELM STREET' and NEW NIGHTMARE. Occasionally it feels like she's phoning it in. These faults don't hurt the movie too much. It's still a enjoyable horror picture that holds up relatively well today. It may not be as good as the first A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET but it's much better than most third installments are. I give it 710.".

Brilliant!This is where the deaths became more elaborate and Freddy started to spout out catchy oneliners.

	schema:reviewBody "A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors is the third installment of the Nightmare on Elm Street series. It's actually one of the better sequels that I enjoyed. I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street series boxed DVD set for my birthday. So I've now seen all the sequels and A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors is a decent sequel. Not to mention it was pretty cool to see Patricia Arquette's first big role I can't believe a lot of these movies how many stars started out in this series. It was also a nice touch that they had Nancy back for this film. The deaths are gory and Freddy is back and meaner than ever! This time he's after the kids in the mental institution and he's not going to go easy on them at all.Nancy has now grown up and she's become a therapist for dreams she starts her work at the mental institution where she meets Kirsten a girl who has the power to pull other people into her dreams. Kirsten is a bit scared of her powers though and knows that Freddy wants to use her so he could pretty much squish several bugs with one stomp. But Nancy knows that Freddy is up to his old ways and wants to help Kirsten along with the other teenagers at the hospital that Freddy is after but hopefully she can do it before it's too late.A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors has one of my favorite nightmare sequences. I loved the puppet on the strings only well I won't spoil it you're going to have to trust me when I say that this was a very cool death scene. This is a must see for the Nightmare on Elm Street fans of course but even you're just looking for a good scare I promise you that you'll get a few chills from watching this nightmare. Freddy isn't going light when it comes to scaring these kids... to death.710".

Nightmare on Elm Street 3 is a fastedpaced cleverly written horror fantasy that's the most entertaining of the Elm Street followups. The movie plays out as a gripping thrill ride that's both chilling and darkly funny. There's a number of smart twists thrown in as well. 'Elm Street 3 also has the most dazzling and impressive special FX of the series as well as some of the greatest nightmare and murder sequences. The marionette sequence with Bradly Gregg is a big favorite. The direction of Chuck Russell is slick indeed delivering plenty of atmospheric darkness and energetic action. Even the mazelike sets are impressive. Charles Bernstein's Elm Street theme music is used once more. In addition there's also an awesome title rock anthem by the group Dokken.Another high point in the film is the cast. Heather Langenkamp reprises her role well as does John Saxon who appears once again as Langenkamp's father. Craig Wasson is a good hero as a doctor attempting to help the teenagers. Patricia Arquette Ken Sagoes Jennifer Rubin Bradly Gregg and Rodney Eastman all make for solid teenage characters. Of course Robert Englund is back as Freddy who has a bit more of a cheeky sense of humor this time around.One couldn't ask for a better Elm Street sequel than this one. It's a fun ride all the way for fans and is one of the best horrorfantasy films out there. Check it out.Followed by a number of inferior sequels. 12 out of ".

	schema:reviewBody "a nightmare on elm street 3 is a film that manages to solidify its villain as a memorable anti heroicon. the original nightmare on elm street was an excellent film in terms of scaring the living hell out of audiences with a truly demonic villain. this film on the other hand takes its source material and stays true to it while at the same time opening up a new direction for the character. the comedic one liners add a really nice touch to a series that could have easily grown tiresome after a few sequels. the comedy isn't exactly straight comedy but is black comedy which works very well for the character of Freddy. his character still remains scary in terms of how devilish and evil he truly is and the creative ways in which he chooses to kill the teens of the film. mostly using their fears past experiences and lifestyles against them. very creative and entertaining to watch. this is an important aspect to keep in mind when trying to understand what makes this film as well as the original work so well. the acting is by no means great but the cast does do a solid job. I don't really have very many complaints in the acting department john saxton returns and gives us a good performance. heather langdenkamp I believe that's how you spell it returns as well and gives a decent performance. here and there some of her dialogue seems a little forced and unnatural but I think she did a good job in the grand scheme of things. the rest of the cast all do well in their roles they are after all just teenagers and aren't meant to be the most complex characters in the first place. and last but not least Robert England of course does an amazing and captivating job as Freddy. the script is honestly great! the concept of the characters all having a dream power to fight back against Freddy is interesting. it did feel slightly rushed but I don't think it really affects the film. what we get is good and I can't complain about that. we also get a bit of backstory on Freddy and his birth which is welcome it adds to the mythos of the character and I think it makes him that much more of a dark character. chuck Russell does an excellent job directing. his way of bringing the dream sequences to the screen is great and I found myself and still find myself thoroughly entertained. it isn't world class direction like say the likes of fincher or Hitchcock but it does the script justice and is not in any way bad directing. the gore and special effects all look so good you can tell the effects team put a lot of heart and effort in it definitely showed. I am to this day still wowed by the effects and wish more horror films from the modern age would use practical and organic effects like the ones used in this film. all in all the film is truly great not only is it a good slasher film and a good sequel but it really is a great film in general. I would recommend it to anybody who likes a good time or horror films. 9.510".

Chuck Russell makes his debut for this one as it lead him to make The Blob in 1988 and The Mask in 1994 this installment delivers all the goods that a fanboy and fangirl can enjoy. The film costars Laurence Fishburne and John Saxton with appearances by Dick Cavett and Zsa Zsa Gabor this horror fantasy thriller has good scares and some gory violence abound. The special effects even for it's day are just incredible like the Freddy Snake critter and the acting is superb this movie made Freddy more popular thanks to witty oneliners and a dark sense of humor. Greg Cannom and Kevin Yagher did a nice job on the makeup and gore effects for this production the film also gives us a nice look into the mythology of Nightmare on Elm Street with some nice twists and turns even by the ending.This is one sequel that still holds up and rocks! i highly recommend it.P.S.

	schema:headline " To be honestly accurate this is not a movie about dream warriors though it has some warrior wannabes in it.";
	schema:reviewBody "Before I saw this movie I already had the notion it is considered by many as the best sequel on the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. So I rented it not only because I like the concept of the NOES movies but also to see for myself what is this movie all about.And boy was I disappointed...It has been many years since the movie was made so I managed to be condescending even though I believe good movies survive time.This time and for a change we have a multiplot storyline where we have three main characters able to throw the story ahead but the really one that matters because he is the one who really solves the movie throughout is the one that never seems to interest the viewers. I'm talking of Neil Gordon Craig Wasson the doctor who the mysterious Nun Krueger's mother talks to and finally destroys Freddy Krueger's body in the end. All the rest of the characters are used to distract the audience from this story. And that's sad because the warrior background is good material. If it's Neil who finds out how to kill Freddy and if it's him who really does it at the end what's the importance of the other characters if not only to feed up opportunities for gore moments? Even though it never really goes anywhere with it Nightmare 3 has a good storyline if we stick with the wrong idea that this is really about kids who face Freddy Krueger through their powers in dreams.But if we again  are accurate onwards the story we understand that when the characters finally know their point in the story to confront Freddy using their powers connected as a group to survive and they jump into the dream to do as they think it's best they die. They only use their powers once and lose. The first time the wizard kid uses his powers he dies the first time the drug addict girl uses hers she dies too and the others never fully use theirs against Freddy. Only Patricia Arquette completely uses her kickboxing features at Freddy only to fall to the ground easy and if it isn't for Neil Gordon's help they would all die.What irritates me is not the fact that the characters fail miserably when put face to face with Freddy but the fact that this is supposed  as the title indicates  to be a story about dream warriors so at least they could give a bit of a fight and show at least once a cohesion as a group. It never happens. So the best idea of the movie is wasted completely upon his failure to deliver what it promises.Another annoying thing is how shallow Nancy's character has become. She seems like a doll acting almost without expression as if she was an angel. And in fact her role is not that important in the movie if we watch it as a whole. If there was no Nancy in there the story would go exactly where it goes only with the five special warrior kids. So why bring back such a rich character if not to make her unforgettable in her final goodbye to the saga? The only thing she's useful for is to stall Freddy Krueger while Dr. Neil Gordon destroys the skeleton.Oh and more... What about the rules on Nightmare movies? If there's one thing that I think about movies is that if they create rules they can't bend them willingly without explanation. Since the first movie the basic rule is Freddy Krueger exists only in the dreams of people nothing more and he only has powers within that world. So how the hell can he make his skeleton come back to life if that scene doesn't take place in the dream world? Where's the explanation for that? It's lame that they never give it. They could use the whole skeleton idea which is very good in fact but at least they could explain how it is Freddy has powers over his reallife skeleton.OK people can refute me try to talk back and say that this was a b movie so it's normal that there are flaws but I cannot accept that as an excuse. As a spectator I want to watch a movie regardless if they spent a zillions more or not on the script or effects. It has to be logical. Especially when all of the flaws that I pointed out are storyline mistakes and a screenwriter takes the same money if he writes good or not.But this is movie with good moments too so it's not all about negative things for me it has great special effects and creepy atmosphere when we are in the dream sequences. Everything within the special effects in the movie is kind of mindblowing and overall that's what stands off in the movie the marionette sequence the TV eating the star wannabe or the curious penislike Freddy Krueger eating up Patricia Arquette.This movie could have been much better if it was told with fewer characters and that is to me what cripples this movie. There was no need for Dr. Neil's character Nancy could fill up his role and be more active on the storyline with no harm done to the story. And I would like pretty much to see the whole group of dream warriors fighting together as a group and not only the small showoff scene when they go and save the mute captive. But enough is enough for this movie stands off as a sequel better than others did Friday The 13th Chucky Scream and managing not to be a terrible movie this Nightmare sequel has style and creativity. And that has to mean something.".

	schema:headline " Almost there to being the best in the series!";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite the negative critical reaction that Freddy's Revenge got the movie was a financial success and in 1987 Wes Craven returned to write A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors which was the second sequel in the Nightmare on Elm Street film franchise.In the second sequel Freddy Krueger is systematically killing the last of the Elm Street children. The few remaining children have been placed in Westin Hills Mental Institution for allegedly attempting suicide. Nancy Thompson arrives at Westin Hills as a new intern and realizes the children are being killed by Freddy in their dreams.With the help of Dr. Neil Gordon Nancy helps Kristen Taryn Joel Kincaid and Will find their dream powers so they can kill Freddy once and for all. But in all scary movies the killer never dies. Neil unknowingly until the end meets the spirit of Freddy's mother Amanda Krueger who instructs him to bury Freddy's remains in hallowed ground in order to stop him for good.Neil completes his task but not before Freddy kills Nancy but Kristen kills Freddy. The film ends with Neil sleeping in his own bed with a dream doll and Kristen's model of 1428 Elm Street. As he sleeps the bedroom light in the model comes on revealing that Freddy is still alive and setting up a new installment.I had to say I almost did not watch this film because I thought it was just a ripoff of the previous film Freddy's Revenge but after watching the trailer for the film in 2010 I actually really wanted to see how this would turn and finally in 2013 I got to see this movie and it was one of the best viewing experiences ever.Unlike other franchises like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre this franchise along Halloween and Friday the 13th knows how to stay true to it's source material and this was the 80's and still today. This was the movie that changed Freddy Krueger turned from just creepy to creepy and funny at the same time.This film has the old cast with a new set of character and that works for a movie like this. The cast strikes an awesome balance of suspense and comedy this definitely goes to Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger he does a darn good job this time around. The effects were cheesy but also good for the 1980's and were very awesome as hell. The dreams are as creepy and intense and just like the first film they build up to each other with suspense.The cast is really strong here and we can tell that they care about their characters that they are playing especially Heather Langenkamp and John Saxon who says that this is their favorite film and also had the best roles in the original 1984 classic film A Nightmare on Elm Street.Patricia Arquette is really amazing as Kristen and she did a damn good job making her performance believable as I thought she would.The only person that I was not expecting to be in A Nightmare on Elm Street film was Laurence Fishburne who is known as Ike Turner in What's Love Got to Do With It and as Morpheus in The Matrix trilogy. He does a darn good job and really awesome to play in this film. Really cool and really amazing casting choices.It's a good scary movie flick where the characters actually fight between the dream controller and the ending may have you crying because Nancy dies but it also makes you really get scared of the way it ends. It is really cool.Freddy Krueger has the coolest lines ever written and I am really glad that Wes Craven came back and help with the screenplay. He is still scary still creepy but can also get very comedic at points especially in the TV nightmare sequence where he tells the girl Welcome to prime time girl! and that is one of the best lines ever written for an iconic horror movie character.This film is just spectacular. From the music to the acting to the effects to the incredible performance of Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger you will find an incredible experience in seeing this film.Overall there may be a couple of flaws but it is easy to see why people watches this one second instead of A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 Freddy's Revenge. I love it for everything that it does right and I like this one better than the second one but I still watch the second one the first one the fourth fifth sixth seventh film. I also like Freddy vs. Jason and the 2010 remake of the original film.My rating is going to be 6  10 not a bad rating but it is a little bit good.".

	onyx:emotionText "Despite the negative critical reaction that Freddy's Revenge got the movie was a financial success and in 1987 Wes Craven returned to write A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors which was the second sequel in the Nightmare on Elm Street film franchise.In the second sequel Freddy Krueger is systematically killing the last of the Elm Street children. The few remaining children have been placed in Westin Hills Mental Institution for allegedly attempting suicide. Nancy Thompson arrives at Westin Hills as a new intern and realizes the children are being killed by Freddy in their dreams.With the help of Dr. Neil Gordon Nancy helps Kristen Taryn Joel Kincaid and Will find their dream powers so they can kill Freddy once and for all. But in all scary movies the killer never dies. Neil unknowingly until the end meets the spirit of Freddy's mother Amanda Krueger who instructs him to bury Freddy's remains in hallowed ground in order to stop him for good.Neil completes his task but not before Freddy kills Nancy but Kristen kills Freddy. The film ends with Neil sleeping in his own bed with a dream doll and Kristen's model of 1428 Elm Street. As he sleeps the bedroom light in the model comes on revealing that Freddy is still alive and setting up a new installment.I had to say I almost did not watch this film because I thought it was just a ripoff of the previous film Freddy's Revenge but after watching the trailer for the film in 2010 I actually really wanted to see how this would turn and finally in 2013 I got to see this movie and it was one of the best viewing experiences ever.Unlike other franchises like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre this franchise along Halloween and Friday the 13th knows how to stay true to it's source material and this was the 80's and still today. This was the movie that changed Freddy Krueger turned from just creepy to creepy and funny at the same time.This film has the old cast with a new set of character and that works for a movie like this. The cast strikes an awesome balance of suspense and comedy this definitely goes to Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger he does a darn good job this time around. The effects were cheesy but also good for the 1980's and were very awesome as hell. The dreams are as creepy and intense and just like the first film they build up to each other with suspense.The cast is really strong here and we can tell that they care about their characters that they are playing especially Heather Langenkamp and John Saxon who says that this is their favorite film and also had the best roles in the original 1984 classic film A Nightmare on Elm Street.Patricia Arquette is really amazing as Kristen and she did a damn good job making her performance believable as I thought she would.The only person that I was not expecting to be in A Nightmare on Elm Street film was Laurence Fishburne who is known as Ike Turner in What's Love Got to Do With It and as Morpheus in The Matrix trilogy. He does a darn good job and really awesome to play in this film. Really cool and really amazing casting choices.It's a good scary movie flick where the characters actually fight between the dream controller and the ending may have you crying because Nancy dies but it also makes you really get scared of the way it ends. It is really cool.Freddy Krueger has the coolest lines ever written and I am really glad that Wes Craven came back and help with the screenplay. He is still scary still creepy but can also get very comedic at points especially in the TV nightmare sequence where he tells the girl Welcome to prime time girl! and that is one of the best lines ever written for an iconic horror movie character.This film is just spectacular.

	schema:reviewBody "A Nightmare On Elm Street 3Dream Warriors is easily one of the best films in the Elm Street seriesan excellent sequel that's filled with wonderfulatmospheric directiongreat charactershaunting imagery and great special effects. It's not only one of my favorites in Elm Street series and one of my favorite Horror movie sequelsbut one of my favorite sequels in general.Set six years after the first filmDream Warriors tells the story about a group of troubled teenagers who are patients at psychiatric hospital who are all having nightmares and are being stalked by dream demon Freddy KruegerRobert England. Now with the help of Nancy ThompsonHeather Langenkampsurvivor of the first filmand Dr. Neil GordonCraig Wassonthe teens are going to figure out how to stop Freddy and get rid of him once and for all.I think one of the reasons Dream Warriors is an excellent sequel is because this takes the concept of Wes Craven'swho cowrote the script for this filmbrilliantgroundbreaking first film and takes a step further with this film. Instead of having Freddy come into your dreams and your nightmares and killing youDW has Freddy going into teenagers dream worlds and nightmares and taking the things that teenagers like or dislike and turning it against them. It's a scary concept for this film because it makes Freddy more powerful not just from a physical advantagebut a mental advantage. The Nightmare and dream sequences are effectivedark and imaginative and will have you on the edge of your seat with lots of tension and suspense that is like a tightrope and you will feel like you are inside the nightmares and dreams and you want to wake up. The first 1015 minutes of the film set the tone for the rest of the filmshowing viewers a world where teenage suicide is just a normal occurrence and happens all the time. It was pretty daring for a film to take on such a taboo subject like suicide during the 80sremember this was 2 years before Heathers hilariously tackled the subject of suicideand I think that's one of the thingsalong with the dream sequences that add to the dark and Gothic tone of the film and make the film bleaker than it is. The characters in the film are welldeveloped and likable and when things start to go wrong you will feel sympathy for them and root for them as the film goes on. One of the things that I've always liked about the Elm Street films and what sets them apart from other slasher films is that the characters are not just faceless victims waiting to be killed or slaughteredbut are welldeveloped characters that viewers can relate to and identify with and this film is no exception. The Action and violence in the film is welldone and fits the tone of this film and while the film is not as completely bloody or gory as the first two films DW has a few moments of blood and gore. The character Freddy Krueger is creepy in this film and spits out darkly funny oneliners something which has divided Horror fans for years as many have said that the film made Freddy from a scary villain to comical one I say yes and no to that. Yes because the later films made him less scarier and more of a comedian and the star of the films no because many fans seem to forget that Freddy had always had a twisted since of humor especially in the first two films that is often overlooked because Freddy was always in the shadows and dark. Freddy's an excellent character and has never been a silent slasher movie villain and the character had to evolve and do more things otherwise the series would've never gone on. I can understand most fans complaints about the Freddy characterbut maybe because of his personality and oneliners Freddy's one of my favorite movie characters. The ending of the film will shock and surprise viewers because it's a twist that you will not see coming or expect and is one of the things that adds to the greatness of the film.The whole cast is great in their roles. Heather Langenkamp does a wonderful job as Nancy who returns from the first film to help the teenagers fight Freddy. Craig Wasson does a great job as Dr. Neil Gordanthe doctor who cares about his patients and Wasson has a great chemistry with Langenkamp. Patrica Arquettein her film debutis excellent as Kristena girl who has a powerful gift. Robert Englund is scary and menacing as Freddywhile saying great oneliners. Laurence Fishburne does a wonderful job as Max an orderly who cares for the patients. Jennifer Ruben does a good job as Taryna recovering drug addict who is tough. Ken Sagoes is great as the shorttemperedbut sympathetic Kincaid. Nan Martin is creepy as the mysterious nun Sister Mary Helena. John Saxon returns from the first film as Donald Thompson and gives a good performance. Ira Helden does a fine job as Will. Rodney Eastman gives a good performance as Joeya teen who doesn't talk. Bradley GreggPhillipPenelope SudrowJenniferPrisilla PointerDr. Simmsand Brooke BundyElaine Parkergive good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Dick Cavett and Zsa Zsa Gabor.The direction from Chuck Russell is greatwith Russell effective and dark atmosphere giving the film a sense of dread and energy. Great direction.The score by Angelo Badalamenti is creepy and scary and fits with the film's dark tone. Great score. The film also has great songs from Dokken including the great title track Dream Warriors and Into The Fire. Great songs.The special effects in the film are amazing especially with the Freddy makeup and the special effects hold up well.In final wordif you love Horror films or the Nightmare On Elm Street films I highly suggest you see A Nightmare On Elm Street 3Dream Warriors a great Horror film that is one of best films in the series. Highly Recommended. 1010.".

Angelo Badalamenti provided the effective score while the heavy metal band Dokken provided the film's two catchy tunes Dream Warriors and Into The Fire. Roy H.

Wes Craven and Bruce Wagner worked on the script but the results aren't confusing but interesting. Here we get to find out about Freddy Krueger's past. Krueger kills his victims in a number of inventive ways all of which are aided by excellent special effects. The sets in the dream world full of atmosphere are memorable. But my favorite set is the auto salvage yard. I can list other reasons why this film is such a treat. It's a neat product of the 80s and it showed that sequels don't have to be inferior.

Nancy Thompson is now a psychiatrist at a hospital for disturbed children. She ends up discovering that all of the children in her care are not suicidal but were attacked by Freddy Krueger because they are the last children of the lynch mob that killed him. Nancy ends up teaching the children that they can fight Freddy because in your dreams you can do what you want. The children form a small army calling themselves the Dream Warriors and set out to take Freddy on. This isn't a perfect movie but it is much better than the terrible part 2.Due to the return of characters Nancy Thompson and her cop father Donald who is now an alcoholic after the events of the first film this movie makes a return to what the first movie was all about. The mood and the creepiness return and Robert Englund plays Freddy the way he's supposed to be played...As a wise cracking maniac. The movie is generally creepy throughout but unfortunately toward the end it gets a bit silly. The children become kind of like superheroes in their dreams to fight Freddy and it gets a bit goofy especially when one of them becomes the Wizard Master and starts pulling some Dungeons and Dragons crap of Freddy. Another silly scene is when Lt. Thompson digs up Freddy's skeleton and it climbs out and starts fighting with him.The acting in this movie is pretty good. Heather Lengenkamp John Saxon and Robert Englund are just as good as in the first movie and newcomer Patricia Arquette is very good. Also look for a young Laurence Fishburne as a hospital orderly.Overall this is one of the more entertaining Nightmare films and should be watched by fans of the series.610".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS   SPOILERS THE BEST FREDDY KRUEGER FILM!.A Nightmare On Elm Street 3  The Dream Warriors apart from being the best film in the ANOES franchise it's one of the best horror movies of the 80's. Seriously for a 3rd. insalment this movie is very good. Also it had the big responsability of returning the originality and quality factor the series after the mid success of part 2. Part 1 is a horror classic it's almost perfect and that  means big problems when it's intended to create a franchise because it's very hard to match the opera prima. Part 2 did quietly good but never stood a chance compared to the original. The Dream Warriors was produced with the intention to capitalize the Freddy Krueger phenomenom of the 80's. The film created a strong image for Krueger and gained him a place in the horror icons haven.The good things about THE DREAM WARRIORS1. Likeable characters with a developed story. Probably the best character development in the series. You can say that you feel sympathy for the children. The actors did a great job by giving life to disturbed children that were afraid for falling asleep in concrete they were hugely threatened and scared of Fred Krueger. You feel sorry when one of the dies it's like you are part of their group. Join Kincaid Taryn Brian Joey Jennifer and Kirsten for the ultimate fight between the Elm Street children and Krueger. Kirsten Parker is this time's heroine she'll be Freddy's deadliest enemy and the key to discover where to attack him in order to defeat him. I want to add that the acting is top notch for the series. I mean Patricia Arquette John Saxon Heather Langerkamp Laurence Fishburne Craig Watson Ken Sagoes and of course Robert Englund deliver great performances the best cast in the series.SPOILERS 2. A great story. Frank Darabont which years later was involved in the 94's masterpiece The Shawshank Redemption and Wes Craven created the PERFECT ANOES script. The best hands down. Have you ever thought what would be your special powers in your dreams? In this movie these thoughts materialize and you feel related to them. Having powers in your nightmares now it's a more serious issue and it's well treated in the movie. The children know that everytime they sleep their life is in risk so that means they have to fight for their life using their abilities. Freddy is back and he has to eliminated the last Elm Street children. Freddy attacks them in their dreams that hasn't changed but now these children are internated in the Westin Hills hospital. The children receive medical attention in order to stop their nightmares and conduct disorders. The doctors don't believe their stories about this skin burned man with a hat and they attribute their dream problems to a massive psycosis. The Dr. in charge Neil Gordon    aided by Nancy Thompson believe the children's story and research about Freddy Krueger. Kristen Parker is now Freddy's new victim. Kristen has the special ability to call people for help in her nightmares. This ability is the way to end for once and all with Krueger. Dr. Gordon and Nancy use Kristen's ability to fight Krueger the children and Nancy against him in the same nightmare.At the end who will survive? How will they use their special powers against Freddy?The return of the favorite ANOES character Nancy Thompson was a great addition to the film. Nancy is the first person to ever defeat Krueger and this time she won't be alone. Nancy encourages the Dream Warriors to don't fear Freddy and stay alive. Also bringing Freddy's mother to the story was a nice and scary element at the same time. Mother Mary Helen is a dark character in the series and surely plays an important part in this film as she's the key to defeat Freddy. This time Freddy Krueger is not as mean as in the original but still he knows how to scare and impose his presence. Krueger has gained more abilities and this time he's stronger than ever! That means a difficult job for the Dream Warriors.3. The directionScoreFX Visually THE DREAM WARRIORS is perfect for being a horror film. Chuck Russell's direction in no way  matches or is better than Craven's but still it's fantastic he gave it a fantasy and scifi touch to this horror feature. The FX are great! The puppet death Jennifer's death and Freddy's demise are the best scenes where the FX were needed. The Krueger makeup is decent but not the best. The score is great mixing 80's metal pop tracks with the characteristic ANOES themes. It's the perfect soundtrack in a horror movie a mix between scary themes and rock 'n roll.4. The best scenes... The puppet death Freddy's demise when Kincaid Joey Alice and Nancy escape from Krueger overall all the deaths. The ending is chilling and in my opinion is the best in the series. END OF SPOILERSOverall this is a great horror film you can't ask for something better. It's not HALLOWEEN THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE EVIL DEAD or THE EXORCIST but still THE DREAM WARRIORS matches the fun factor and the quality.I'd say that this is the best in the series without a doubt.This film inspired in great amount the script and settings used in FREDDY VS JASON.Watch this film even if you're not a fan of the ANOES series watch if you are hungry of a good horror film with some dips of scifi.Very recommended 810. 1010 IN THE ANOES SCALE.".

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS   SPOILERS THE BEST FREDDY KRUEGER FILM!.A Nightmare On Elm Street 3  The Dream Warriors apart from being the best film in the ANOES franchise it's one of the best horror movies of the 80's. Seriously for a 3rd. insalment this movie is very good. Also it had the big responsability of returning the originality and quality factor the series after the mid success of part 2. Part 1 is a horror classic it's almost perfect and that  means big problems when it's intended to create a franchise because it's very hard to match the opera prima. Part 2 did quietly good but never stood a chance compared to the original. The Dream Warriors was produced with the intention to capitalize the Freddy Krueger phenomenom of the 80's. The film created a strong image for Krueger and gained him a place in the horror icons haven.The good things about THE DREAM WARRIORS1. Likeable characters with a developed story. Probably the best character development in the series. You can say that you feel sympathy for the children. The actors did a great job by giving life to disturbed children that were afraid for falling asleep in concrete they were hugely threatened and scared of Fred Krueger. You feel sorry when one of the dies it's like you are part of their group. Join Kincaid Taryn Brian Joey Jennifer and Kirsten for the ultimate fight between the Elm Street children and Krueger. Kirsten Parker is this time's heroine she'll be Freddy's deadliest enemy and the key to discover where to attack him in order to defeat him. I want to add that the acting is top notch for the series. I mean Patricia Arquette John Saxon Heather Langerkamp Laurence Fishburne Craig Watson Ken Sagoes and of course Robert Englund deliver great performances the best cast in the series.SPOILERS 2. A great story. Frank Darabont which years later was involved in the 94's masterpiece The Shawshank Redemption and Wes Craven created the PERFECT ANOES script. The best hands down. Have you ever thought what would be your special powers in your dreams? In this movie these thoughts materialize and you feel related to them. Having powers in your nightmares now it's a more serious issue and it's well treated in the movie. The children know that everytime they sleep their life is in risk so that means they have to fight for their life using their abilities. Freddy is back and he has to eliminated the last Elm Street children. Freddy attacks them in their dreams that hasn't changed but now these children are internated in the Westin Hills hospital. The children receive medical attention in order to stop their nightmares and conduct disorders. The doctors don't believe their stories about this skin burned man with a hat and they attribute their dream problems to a massive psycosis. The Dr. in charge Neil Gordon    aided by Nancy Thompson believe the children's story and research about Freddy Krueger. Kristen Parker is now Freddy's new victim. Kristen has the special ability to call people for help in her nightmares. This ability is the way to end for once and all with Krueger. Dr. Gordon and Nancy use Kristen's ability to fight Krueger the children and Nancy against him in the same nightmare.At the end who will survive? How will they use their special powers against Freddy?The return of the favorite ANOES character Nancy Thompson was a great addition to the film. Nancy is the first person to ever defeat Krueger and this time she won't be alone. Nancy encourages the Dream Warriors to don't fear Freddy and stay alive. Also bringing Freddy's mother to the story was a nice and scary element at the same time. Mother Mary Helen is a dark character in the series and surely plays an important part in this film as she's the key to defeat Freddy. This time Freddy Krueger is not as mean as in the original but still he knows how to scare and impose his presence. Krueger has gained more abilities and this time he's stronger than ever! That means a difficult job for the Dream Warriors.3. The directionScoreFX Visually THE DREAM WARRIORS is perfect for being a horror film. Chuck Russell's direction in no way  matches or is better than Craven's but still it's fantastic he gave it a fantasy and scifi touch to this horror feature. The FX are great! The puppet death Jennifer's death and Freddy's demise are the best scenes where the FX were needed. The Krueger makeup is decent but not the best. The score is great mixing 80's metal pop tracks with the characteristic ANOES themes. It's the perfect soundtrack in a horror movie a mix between scary themes and rock 'n roll.4. The best scenes... The puppet death Freddy's demise when Kincaid Joey Alice and Nancy escape from Krueger overall all the deaths. The ending is chilling and in my opinion is the best in the series. END OF SPOILERSOverall this is a great horror film you can't ask for something better. It's not HALLOWEEN THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE EVIL DEAD or THE EXORCIST but still THE DREAM WARRIORS matches the fun factor and the quality.I'd say that this is the best in the series without a doubt.This film inspired in great amount the script and settings used in FREDDY VS JASON.Watch this film even if you're not a fan of the ANOES series watch if you are hungry of a good horror film with some dips of scifi.Very recommended 810. 1010 IN THE ANOES SCALE.";

Slater was good not true romance good but good Connolly is great but the man who steals the shop is Allen who is the funniest hitman since Grosse Point Blank Aykroyd or Cusack. And not only is Allen funny but he holds the movie together in what is by far the toughest role.I cannot believe more people have not seen this movie. This is a cult classic all about films I think every movie junkie out there should see this movie right now. I don't know why the director isn't getting work after this other than its failure to make any money but I urge any future directors to look this man up and give him some cash.If you're reading this review ignore this movie no further.".

Tim Allen seems to relish toning down the roguish chortle the trailer of S. C. II points to a huge potential comeback....and an even huger potential for further typecasting.

Tim Allen who is cast against type here is a movie loving hit man who takes both old movies and his profession extremely seriously but alas does have a heart as we see at the end.  Christian Slater who has to be the most underrated actor in Hollywood gets to show the world he can indeed act and with vigor indeed. Richard Dreyfus and Portia DeRossi who I sadly have learned is gay...darn it! are given less to do but handle their parts well.

There was nothing original or interesting in the script.  There was nothing laudable in the acting.

Tim Allen plays a different character a hitman of some sort but yet still finds many times to insert his brand of humor in the flick.  Slater plays about the same kind of average role in this one that he always seems to play in most movies meaning he doesn't hurt the film but yet he doesn't oooh and ahhhh us either.  Basically Slater is a prison escapee who assumes a false identity of a man that the mafia thought they had taken out.  So now Slater finds himself on the run claiming that of all the dead people who could steal an identity from he had to choose the one dead guy that everyone wanted to kill.  So yes there is a bit of attempted comedy in it but for the most part it is dry and not laugh out loud funny.  Then there is the girl you know the girl that the escapee falls for the girl that at first is too good for him but who then later begins to warm up to him.All in all if you rent this expecting it to be just a B rated type of movie meaning not that good but not too horribly bad you won't be disappointed.

This film fell down in nearly every respect. What began as a potentially funny hook the hit manmovie buff became a crutch used to artificially move the story along. The music was trivial and at times laughable. The editor didn't seem to even understand the point of the movie and in a rush to just end it as the sound at FADE OUT emblematic of the overall editing problem just dropped as if the editor just couldn't wait to see the thing end. I even have to wonder if the director understood what the movie was about particularly distressing in this case as the director wrote the script!

This film fell down in nearly every respect. What began as a potentially funny hook the hit manmovie buff became a crutch used to artificially move the story along. The music was trivial and at times laughable. The editor didn't seem to even understand the point of the movie and in a rush to just end it as the sound at FADE OUT emblematic of the overall editing problem just dropped as if the editor just couldn't wait to see the thing end. I even have to wonder if the director understood what the movie was about particularly distressing in this case as the director wrote the script!

Most of the characters are annoying at best and all of them are two dimensional.  Scenes snap by quickly with only the dialog necessary to drive the weak plot forward. Tim Allen's character was very disappointing.  He is constantly going stupidly on about movies.

The number 6 means regular movie but doesn't necessarily means some good and bad elements.For example this is a comedy and it doesn't generate much laughs. I mean it is not that you're crying during the film. You're smiling but not laughing outloud. The premise for the film is a totally original and a very good one. The problem is that it doesn't convince. The story isn't that believable because it is impossible for the filmmakers to make something different. You can tell they are afraid being different won't work. Maybe they should be but people will never find out if this movie could have been a lot better it had the elements to achieve that goal.I was loving it creating a character in a movie that loves movies and wants to make another movie. Not so confusing as it sounds. Critical Jim calls himself a critic. The interesting thing is that he is a murderer but loves old movies classics. He loves movies that much that he knows the best lines of each classic and says the line together with the name of the movie and the studio. Impressing. He loves movies that much that he creates secret codes with the letters of director's and actor's last names or names. This is an incredibly original character. I don't remember seeing something similar before. But is just Critical Jim the only original character. The others we have seen them before. Another disappointment is that the premise is based on Critical Jim's character and his love for movies. But the movie betrays Critical Jim betrays its story and it ultimately betrays itself. Not funny but with comedic actors in it. Tim Allen plays Critical Jim in a delightful and surprising performance at the same time. This film could give him a lesson about choosing partsroles. He plays Critical Jim like you've never seen him totally distanced from his usual roles. It's the first time I have seen him acting naturally and not doing the stupid things he usually does. It actually works better for him that way or at least better than in The Santa Clause and Jungle To Jungle. This is his best performance alongside with the one in Galaxy Quest.As I said the rest of the characters are familiar. Christian Slater's Finch is just another character that doesn't need any special gift to be played. It could be played by anyone but I was not disappointed by Slater's performance which doesn't mean I was amazed. He is not the greatest actor. He has had a calmed career and I hope he continues that way. I remember loving him in The name of the rose. Portia de Rossi is not the right choice for her role and doesn't seem comfortable playing it but gives her best anyway and that's not much. Dreyfuss could be playing a small part more than a title one. He is natural and gives some of the comedic rhythm the film lacks. RuPaul is in the cover but...why?Finch tells the story to Critical Jim because the critic likes old movies and wants to make a movie of the story. A movie with the elements of an old movie a classic. Unluckily the flashback they create doesn't have the elements of an old movie as they suppose it has. It has the elements of the movies we see everyday.".

Apparently it is completely easy for a magician to steal a handful of diamonds and also to escape from prison several years later by using his tricks. Much of the acting was great and some of the dialogs were good too. I personally enjoyed Michael Conolly's monologue at the morgue though it proved pointless to the plot. I hated Portia de Rossi's character. There's no explanation of why she's such a bitch and she's annoying most of the part. RuPaul was totally unnecessary. He's just some weird transvestite neighbor who has the hot's for Finch. And of course he has to act all macho in the end I don't know why. Tim Allen was good interesting character. My favorite scene with him was in the subway. It was a little disturbing to see him curse like that but it was funny. The mobsters were very good but they had too much development for what the central story was. Good music although it was too dramatic for chase scenes average script great actors not to good of an ending. It's not very good but it isn't really that bad. It's sort of in between. Either way it's watchable.".

Although I am a big fan of older black and white movies I must say that the lack of color here is a negative. Also based on memory too many scenes were shot on a sound stage.

Garner sells the idea of having an Americanized version of the British commando spearheading the American landings wherever they may be.Trained by the British Commandos Darby's Rangers or as it is officially known the First Ranger Batallion comes into being. We follow the Rangers from their first blooding at Dieppe through the North African and Italian campaigns until they were nearly annihilated at Cisterna protecting the Allied landing at Anzio.The film is narrated by Jack Warden who plays Garner's chief noncommissioned officer in the unit. We meet all the Rangers some of them not the noblest of characters such as womanizing Corey Allen who takes up with married British lady Andrea King. Young shavetail lieutenant Edd Byrnes gets a baptism of fire on many fronts both in battle with Garner and in love with Etchika Choureau.After the action of this film is concluded Darby was killed on April 30 1945 just days from VE Day in action. Coincidentally on the same day that Adolph Hitler committed suicide. Maybe it was better for the film to end as it did however for entertainment value.It's a fine World War II film about a true story.

	schema:reviewBody "Battleground director William Wellman made several great combat movies but Darby's Rangers is not one of his best. This standardissue World War II movie deals with the first actual commando force in the United States Army. Darby's Rangers is a good adventure movie set against the reallife background of war in North Africa and Italy. Virtually first hour is spent with Darby and his men learning the ropes about commando operations from the British in Scotland. When these G.I. Joes aren't being run ragged by the Brits they are running British women ragged. The second half of this 121minute epic follows our heroes into North Africa and they are finally shot to pieces so badly blunting an attack after Anzio that the powersthatbe break up the unit and Darby goes off to the Pentagon. Several familiar faces crop up here including Peter Brown of Laredo fame Ed Byrnes of 77 Sunset Strip Stuart Whitman Murray Hamilton and Jack Warden. Indeed Darby's Rangers is basically a remnant of the 1940s rather than the 1950s. Wellman provides more sexual escapades for these young lions while Darby James Garner of Maverick leads the attack. You will not find any antiauthority issues in this war movie or soldiers complaining about wanting to kill their officers. Like most World War II movies of the 1950s we do not get to see the German soldiers except during an ambush. Meaning the Germans are depicted as an impersonal enemy. In fact there are no real emotional villains on the enemy side. Wellman orchestrates several interesting combat sequences but too many officers parade around unrealistically with their rank displayed on their helmets. One scene here that Sam Fuller used in his classic World War II combat movie The Big Red One has troops crossing a road in front of German tanks. As the noisy tanks roll over a hill the G.I.s slip past it narrowly missing being hit and escaping the notice of the enemy. Max Steiner provides a suitable martial score to underline the combat scenes. Edd Byrnes is good as a green shavetail lieutenant who grows up quickly.".

And some terrible plots. They try to mix training scenes with scenes concerning the personal lives of the men but it's all a mess.I wish I could list all the times I cringed in response to a particular line but that is not possible. They follow one another like lemmings.Some visual effects were also offputting like when they trainees are rappelling up a cliff and one man's line comes loose and he plummets to the ground. The entire scene was contrived amateurish and poorly done.Obviously there are some people who liked this film but I cannot recommend it.".

Consequently Darby's Rangers are trained. They face tough action have relationships with beautiful women abroad and face the inevitable tragedies you've see in many other war movies. Based on reality this was the penultimate film from director William A. Wellman. He still has a knack for battle scenes light interludes like the dusting bit and can punctuate blitzkriegs with the sound of a tea kettle...Darby's Rangers is well produced freshly cast but hardly ever less than obvious. Believable on the big screen in his first starring role Mr. Garner is absent much of the running time as this is really an ensemble war drama. An unsubtle Jack Warden as Saul Rosen provides narration. The other soldiers' stories are more interesting with nicely styled Edward Edd Byrnes as Arnold Dittman essaying arguably the bestwritten role handsome young Peter Brown as Rollo Burns making the greatest emotional impression and card shark Stuart Whitman as Hank Bishop leading the rest of the pack.

We get to see their rough training initial actions numerous encounters with women and a final big battle in which they allegedly played a major role  the landings in Anzio Italy. The training segment is well done but again hampered by the love interludes. Things finally seem to get going when they set off for their first landings in Algeria in 1942 when they had to fight French Vichy troops but as with the Germans the enemy is hardly seen in this movie. Then it's off to Sicily and then Italy where they encounter some fierce opposition from Jerry.I have to admit I really do not know what to think of this movie  the battle scenes are rather wellstaged although mostly shot an a sound stage. There is a harrowing scene when they have to move between some German panzers some close combat in an Italian village etc... So everything is there to make a good typical 50's war drama the perfect all goodguy commander Garner his sidekick sergeant Warden and a whole bunch of colorful characters as the dapper Rangers not to forget a high number of love interests. But unlike some previous efforts by director Wellman in the war movie genre as the classic The Story of GI Joe on war correspondent Ernie Pyleand the supremely Battleground on The Battle of the Bulge this almost drowns in its own clichs. Especially the love interludes come over as rather silly and almost ruin the picture.What's left is a soandso war movie with all the right ingredients but somehow it just doesn't work. An average timepasser but that's all.".

Then they fight successfully in North Africa Sicily and Anzio in the Battle of Cisterna with only 7 men out of 767 left alive. And in the end we see bits of the remaining rangers after war Darby leaves Anzio boarding a landing craft and two of the central characters get married to their girlfriends.I loved the cast James Garner in his first leading man role is excellent as Colonel William Orlando Darby and also Jack Warden as his sidekick top Sergeant Saul Rosen who also narrates the movie. And there are some upandcoming actors Murray Hamilton as Sims Delancey Stuart Whitman as Sergeant Hank Bishop that gets along with proper Wendy Hollister Corey Allen as the sleazy lover boy that falls for the older Sheila Andrews the wife of an Archeology professor Edd Byrnes is good as Lt. Arnold Dittman and goes to struggle with his girlfriend Angeline de Lotta's illness and Peter Brown in one of his first movies gives his best role to date especially in the scene when he is conflicted after killing a German sniper.By the way it's a nice and entertaining World War II movie and maybe one of the best made in the 1950s!

I really detested the hick American lover boy and it didn't bother me at all when he fell to his death. Nor when the husband where he had been staying left his wife because she was in love and had been screwing the lover boy. She goes to the camp only to find out lover boy was dead. I guess that could be called poetic justice huh? The last action the Rangers go on will be their last as a unit. Two battalions are trying to infiltrate the German lines when they inadvertently run into a German offensive push. Only 7 of 767 men return from the two battalions most of the others are captured. The movie ends with Darby going back to Washington. Darby returns to Italy and while planning the Trento assault is killed by an 88 shell.".

Arnold Dittman who comes straight from West Point with no knowledge of the real world either on the battlefield or in dealing with people. Spoilers There is one scene where he kills an Itallian Soldier and feels incredible guilt about it and Darby has to explain why he had to do it. Later on he and his men are ordered to disinfect some Itallians and one woman Angelina De Lotta Etchika Choureau objects because it is degrading and will only allow herself to be disinfected if he does it. He gets himself involved with her and she is essentially using him because she is extremely desperate and very sick. When she tells things about her he is disgusted and leaves. He gets drunk and is complaining about her Including the statement Do you think you were the first?. Darby goes to investigate and finds out that she slept with an Itallian Partician Someone fighting Mussolini and was killed. The problem is she got pregnant and although she fell in love with Dittman was ashamed to say it it to him and is dying. Darby wakes up Dittman and explains what happened and said This woman has been through hell I am not saying what she did is right but compassion does not come out of an Army Manual this is a big mess and it takes a big man to clean it up. He goes to a Doctor and and the Doctor explains that sulfur will not help she needs penicillin and when he tried to get some from the Army it was explained that It is only for soldiers and in rare cases for their Dependants. Basically the options are marry her or let her die. He decides to get a local Priest who could not speak English but the Doctor translates and explains why they must be married. She is able to be saved but the baby inside her died. After the final military scene where the Rangers meet up with a German Panzer Tank Division and the conditions were summed up well by Rosen. This was the low clinging kind of fog I used to see when I was hunting duck out on Long Island... Now I know how the duck felt. Dittman is one of the few Rangers to survive and comes back to her and is sad that the baby died but as she pointed out that We can have lots of babies together. What I like is not only did he love her enough to marry her but she really loved him as well and was elated he came back to her. You can tell they will have a fresh start and spend a lifetime together. Byrnes performance and the relationship with Angelina is what makes it a good film. 710 stars.".

Of course they have connections to earlier types of specially training units used for specific missions. But this is the story of the formal organization of the first Rangers units. It's based on a 1945 book by Major James J. Altieri a Ranger veteran. The film shows that the idea for the Rangers came from Darby himself but it was actually from higher up. But Col. William Orlando Darby then a major was the man chosen to organize and command the first Ranger units. They did this by going to Scotland where they were trained by the British commandos  then the toughest fighting unit in the world. This is a good film that shows the training that was eventually duplicated at the U.S. Army Ranger school in Ft. Benning GA. The cast all are very good. James Garner plays Darby and jack Warden plays his close confidante and top kick MSgt. Saul Rosen. He also does some of the narration over film segments. The movie has some top actors in supporting roles Stuart Whitman plays Sgt. Hank Bishop Murray Hamilton plays Pvt. To Sgt. Sims Delancey and Edd Byrnes plays Lt. Arnold Dittman. British actor Torin Thatcher is very good as the tough Scot commando training leader St. McTavish. The film shows the Rangers in some of their actions in World War II. It could have been a much better war film had it stuck to the combat after the training. But as with many another war movie this one combines romance  not just one but a few. Quite a bit of film time is given to these asides so it diminishes this some as a good war film. Still it's a good look at the start of the American Army Rangers and their history.".

This movie shows a man who is driven to see his idea for a special fighting force come to life. Now there are some things that people see as goofs or problems with this movie. I mean the tanks are not real Panzers but come on it is the late 50's and making every detail as real as possible is not going to happen because movie budgets are not that big. There are no summer blockbusters and if they are they are few and far between. As to some of the scenes being done on a sound stage in Hollywood again that magic word budget. If you want to enjoy a tale of men in war then this is enjoyment. True James Garner is not on camera all that much well he was in command and you don't see the commander that often in the field. It was nice to see what you would call an ensemble cast in this movie. I know that Edd Byrnes and Peter Brown were the heartthrobs of the movie. Stuart Whitman and Murray Hamilton were the cynic tough guys. Jack Warden was the hardbitten old veteran from earlier wars. There is the comic relief guys. Of course you have to have the sleazy guy that everybody hates in Corey Allen's character. The Brits who are old hands at a dirty business. So clichd it may be but who cares it is a good if not great little war film.".

There's very little action in this film. This is a melodrama a soaper even as evidenced by the fact it stars Kay Francis. She was one of the queens of the melodrama in the '30s often torn between two men as she is here. The plot is trite. Francis plays a woman who lost her pilot fianc in an accident. She meets honorable and allaroundswellguy Ian Hunter who quickly falls in love with her and proposes. She marries him despite not being in love with him. Later she meets hotshot pilot Errol Flynn and well you can figure the rest. For his part Flynn is as charming as ever and has good chemistry with Francis. The highlight of the film is the Erich Korngold score which makes things seem more exciting than they ever really are. A nice production great actors and a beautiful score are nothing to dismiss. Still how much you enjoy this will depend on how much you enjoy romantic melodramas from the 1930s where everyone stares off at some point and recites a soliloquy like they're in a stage play.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is not the sort of movie you'd think it would be as the film is set abroad and is about a British outpost. Considering this AND that the film stars Errol Flynn you would expect that it would be an adventure film like LIVES OF A BENGAL LANCER or CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADEand if so you'd be wrong. The film is purely a romantic melodrama about a woman Kay Francis who marries a man he likes and respects Ian Hunter but eventually falls in love with suave and romantic Errol Flynn and in 1937 who WOULDN'T have fallen for Errol?!. The problem is exacerbated because Francis genuinely loves Hunter as a friend and Errol is loyal to Hunter because he's his commanding officer but their glands won't be satisfied until they break the awful news to niceguy Hunter. This is overall a very sappy and sticky movie. Some will no doubt like it but the ardent and more wussified Flynn isn't as satisfying a character as he played in most of his other films. And the plot itself seems very old fashioned and...well...silly. Not a bad film but certainly a lesser film and one that is mostly of interest to those who want to see every film Flynn madeeven the weaker ones.".

So this is an opportunity to see the early Errol Flynn and I think he does rather nicely.Kay Franics had been Warner Brother's biggest star but regrettably they handed her a number of projects that were just plain stale. A year after this film she was labeled box office poison but not due to this film. Here she proved once again what an appealing actress she was when she had a good script.The third star of the film was the story. This was another of the the sun never sets on the British Empire films that were so often popular after all Flynn had starred in The Charge of the Light Brigade just a year earlier. Those films don't set quite so well in our era but at the time this was a box office success.Three supporting actors are worth mentioning here. As time goes by I am more and more impressed by Ian Hunter who here plays Flynn's commanding officer. I don't think I'm familiar with Frieda Inescort but as Hunter's sister here she is quite good. And Herbert Mundin...not that impressive but her quite likable and one feels sympathetic toward his plight.As I said it's not a great film but it is a good film. You could do lots worse.".

She's a widow who marries Flynn's commander though she still mourns her late husband. When she meets Flynn guess what she finds she can love again. Yeah like who couldn't. They're both too honorable to do much about it though.Most of the film takes place postWorld War I in a Sahara outpost so there is lots of sand and some battles. Flynn is subdued in this and Francis is radiant. Some of the dialogue is actually quite poetic  probably because they're quoting poems  and if it were in say The Rains Came it would have worked very well  but it only adds to the melodrama in this film.Films such as Another Dawn are interesting as artifacts of a lost time when I suppose people had stronger values and lived for the greater good. When it's a stronger script and production of course these marvelous qualities are worth revisiting admiring and feeling guilty about. Alas however nobility is not well served by Another Dawn.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fans of Flynn's swashbuckling sagas or western dustups may be disappointed to find him here in a rather talky restrained melodrama in which he is offscreen for a startling amount of the run time. The story is really Francis'. She plays a forlorn American whose threeyear love affair with a daring pilot was cut short when he died during a flight. She is wooed and uneasily won by British Colonel Hunter while he is on a trip away from his remote desert post. Upon arriving back there with his new bride who has sworn she will never truly love again after suffering the loss of her previous mate he is called upon to leave on a mission leaving Francis to get to know his secondincommand Flynn. Not only is Flynn dropdead handsome but his laugh reminds Francis of her deceased love and soon the pair is flirting with the possibility of an affair. In order to salvage her marriage to Hunter Francis recommends Flynn for the next dangerous assignment but then frets over him the entire time. When a third mission comes about the two men who by now realize the position they are in with Francis haggle about who will end up flying off into the sunset and quite probably not returning. Francis showing off some fancy OrryKelly gowns is lovely and charming despite her sometimes dreary drippy character. Flynn is beautiful and dapper but gets little or no chance to show off the roguish impish charm that made him a superstar. He and Francis do share one very romantic embrace in a garden and he also gets to engage in one rather minor action sequence but it's a bit of a letdown to see him trudging through this story which is more a study of honor and selfsacrifice than a powerful love story. Hunter does a good job but is understandably less captivating than Flynn. Inescort portrays Flynn's sister and doesn't have too awful much to do. Her oncoming MS can be noted in a telephone scene in which she holds her hand in an awkward position. It's an acceptable wellappointed but unspectacular film that's also thankfully brief! that's an okay timekiller but not likely to be ranked very highly in the canon of its stars especially Flynn's.".

With a script of poetic mutterings by Flynn how could she not? But for Flynn's sister the noble Frieda Inescort having been in love with Hunter for years realizing what's going on is a crisis for her conscience and for these four beautiful noble people it must be as heartwrenching for them as it is dull for much of the audience.With no key villain involved in this triangle pretty much a sexless one there's little sizzle between the leads and that causes this oh so nice romantic soap opera to suffer from slow pacing and unrealistic situations. The four stars are all fine but outside of the intrigue concerning their mission Hunter and Flynn are dull and lifeless. Flynn sounds silly with much of his lines and when Hunter has to become commanding he's unconvincing.That's not the case for the two ladies putting glamour and feminine charm in what was essentially a man's film. The generic title just seems to lay there with no purpose. Herbert Mundin provides a bit of comedy and Ben Welden is amusing as a wealthy Russian letch who makes a play for Francis prompting a great reply from her which indicates bluntly No dice. I had hoped for more heat between Kay and Errol but that is lacking. The over nobility of the major characters leads to a ridiculously clichd finale that even after multiple viewings had me rolling my eyes. As a huge Kay Francis fan I would watch this over and over but as a film historian call it a second rate finale to her A list years at Warner Brothers.

The cinematography is great Flynn is OK but Francis is way over the top and the plot such as it is not particularly involving.";

When Mahalia started to sing Troubles of the World all of her troubles started to come back to her and she got up and ran out of the church. They had to run after her and bring her back to complete the scene.";

Lora brings Annie and her daughter to live in her small apartment in New York and they become close friends. Lora has a love affair with the photographer Steve Archer John Gavin and sooner he proposes her. But the ambitious Lora dreams on becoming a star in Broadway and prioritizes her career and also neglects Susie Sandra Dee.

Ten years later she meets Steve by chance and he gives attention to Susie while Lora is shooting a film in Italy. When she returns she decides to get married with Steve but Susie has fallen in love with Steve. Meanwhile Sarah Jane run away home to work in fleshpots.Imitation of Life is Douglas Sirk's last melodrama with an engaging and emotional story with romance ambition friendship love and rejection. The drama of Annie that is rejected by her daughter in a time when color of people was a watershed is heartbreaking and the best subplot. I do not recall any other film from this period that brings the division in the American society between black and white people so clearly. Susan Kohner has an impressive performance in the role of an outcast girl that does not accept the way the society treats black people but prefers to deny her color. The sequence in the alley where she is beaten up by her boyfriend reflects the mentality of the American society in those years. My vote is eight. Title Brazil Imitao da Vida Imitation of Life".

	schema:reviewBody "As others have pointed out IMITATION OF LIFE is an important film for many reasons. Seeing it again recently I was reminded of the top three reasons why it has earned a cult following among women African Americans and gay men. For women it's all about letting go of a child and allowing them to live their own life. For African Americans it's a reminder of how much they've had to struggle for equality in American society. It's the message of not hiding who you are and not living a lie just to please other people that resonates with gay men. This film was one of the first to expose the cultural divide between black and white in America. That really wasn't being addressed in the cinema up to that point. So it must be put in it's historical context to be fully appreciated.This film marked a crossroads not only for American society but for the acting profession as well. Sandra Dee and Susan Kohner seemed to be of the new school of method acting. By contrast Lana Turner and Juanita Moore seemed to be of the old school of melodramatic acting. Perhaps this is why the older actors come off as far less believable than the younger one's do. That's what makes Sandra Dee's line Oh mother stop acting! so hilarious. I really thought Sandra Dee was too perky to be taken seriously until that scene. Then she showed she could act by keeping it real. Compared to Lana Turner she's Katherine Hepburn! Also anyone serious about an acting career should study Susan Kohner's amazing performance. She steals the show in a role that would be a challenge for any young actress. I think she was one of the most talented actors to ever leave the business for married life.IMITATION OF LIFE is one of those rare films that gets better every time I see it. I guess that's because it's important on more levels than you can take in on a single viewing. I could go into how it's also about a single mother's struggle for independence in 1950's male dominated society. I could argue that it's not as sappy and melodramatic as it's reputed to be. I could argue that John Gavin's performance was better than a lot of people say. However I think I'll save those discussions for when I see it again.".

	schema:reviewBody "The conflict between mothers and daughters has long been a Hollywood plot device. Sometimes it is done badly Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood sometimes it can be campy the immortal shriek fest Mommie Dearest and sometimes a film does it really well Mildred Pierce. Imitation of Life Douglas Sirk's 1959 film starring Lana Turner and Juanita Moore squarely fits into that last category.Lora Meredith Turner is a young widow a single parent and struggling actress. One day when she loses her young daughter Susie at the beach and with the help of a photographer she encounters Steve Archer Gavin she finds her with Annie Johnson Moore an AfricanAmerican woman and her own young daughter Sarah Jane. After Lora and Annie talk for a bit we find that Lora is having a hard time juggling her career with having a young child and that Annie and her daughter are newly arrived in town and do not have a place to stay so after Annie asks to work for Lora in exchange for room and board they strike up a close friendship as do their daughters. The film spans about ten years and during those ten years Lora becomes a very successful Broadway actress and Susie is sent away to an exclusive boarding school. Meanwhile Annie is still her loyal righthand having decided to continue working for Lora even though she has been putting the money that she has earned away. Sarah Jane however a very lightskinned girl who is able to pass as white cannot get past her hatred of her own race and her embarrassment of her mother's color and position. She is continually scheming and running away in order to rid herself of her true heritage which ends up literally breaking her mother's heart.Imitation of Life is outwardly a very pretty film with gorgeous coloring beautiful actors and costumes to die for. When this veneer is peeled back however the true nature of the film is revealed and its conflicts are painfully apparent. Lora and Steve are clearly meant to be together but her career repeatedly gets in the way until Steve is no longer able to sit by idly waiting for her while realizing that he is always going to be low on her priority list. While Sarah Jane envies Lora and Susie's looks money and ultimately color it quickly becomes clear that their problems are substantial. While they had a close relationship when Susie was six with the advent of Lora's career the love Lora had for Susie did not diminish but her attention and time for her did. When Susie returns home from a break at school it is in her mother's absence that she latches on to Steve newly reunited with the family after ten years and ultimately falls in love with him. In regard to Annie and Sarah Jane there is nothing that the kindhearted completely selfless Annie can do to appease her daughter a realization that is so hurtful that it makes her physically sick.The great Douglas Sirk weaves all of these conflicts masterfully. Sirk often marginalized as a fluff piece director due to the strong melodramatic content of his films is at his very best with this film. Imitation of Life does not stray from his other films in terms of formula We have a conflict that is socially relevant and somewhat inflammatory beautiful actors and actresses playing the part rich lush colors throughout the entire production and loads of expensive jewelry and costumes. While there are Douglas Sirk movies that I really like for their camp value Magnificent Obsession immediately comes to mind Imitation of Life is so much more. Just when you're about to laugh at a line or a gesture that seems really over the top Sirk beats you to it. The best example of this is when Lora and Susie are having a fight over the fact that Susie has fallen in love with Steve after Lora announces their intention to marry. When Lora looks directly at the camera puts a stoic look on her face and says in her best Joan Crawford imitation Then I'll give him up Susie immediately says grimly Oh mother don't act for me. The performances by the actors are all good particularly the Oscarnominated performances of Moore and Kohner. Here's a warning about the film however  chances are you'll get upset. My boyfriend who will probably kill me after he reads this very rarely cries at films. I've personally seen him cry once at a movie and that was at Return of the King where everyone in the theater was honking. He had the waterworks big time at the end of this movie much to my surprise. And yes personally I was a big mess I had to blow my nose about three times. Imitation of Life has both beauty and substance. It is a multilayered film wrapped up in an exquisite little package which is often cast away as fluff but is really so much more. Watch it and judge for yourself but this judge gives it a solid 810.Shelly".

	schema:headline " Top drawer melodrama with many layers";
	schema:reviewBody "Not only is this film one of the alltime great women's pictures but it also is a visually and psychologically intriguing piece of art.  Veteran director Sirk went out with a bang with this his last film.  The title refers to any number of subjects covered in the movie  an actress imitating people for a living her daughter imitating her mother's romantic life a Black daughter imitating white people etc...  The title means more in this version.  The imitation dimension has been heightened in this glossy remake....The original 1934 film already veered greatly from the book.  By now only the barest of story threads from the original novel remain. Turner an actress with imitation eyebrows and hair and some say talent! plays a widow who drags her young daughter to New York while she belatedly pursues a career in the theatre.  She comes upon a Black woman Moore whose own daughter is nearly white in appearance.  The children hit it off and soon the woman has completely embedded and inserted herself into Turner's life.  The relationship turns out to be mutually beneficial as Turner needs someone to watch her daughter and Moore has no place to live and few job opportunities.  Eventually Turner becomes successful but she finds that she has sort of left her daughter behind emotionally.  Moore meanwhile has an even tougher time of it because her daughter insists on passing as white much to Moore's dismay.  Dee plays Turner's daughter as a teen and her bright presence brings a lot to the part.  Kohner is the pale Black daughter and does a fine job displaying the torment she faces often acting out towards the other ladies.  Moore is an acquired taste.  Some viewers see her as perfection a doting caring loving selfless mother who is rocked by the venom of her troubled daughter.  Others see her as a pushy bullheaded relentlessly defeated annoyance.  In any case considering the Negro condition in the 1950's it's hardly difficult to understand why Kohner's character wanted to break free and get more out of life!  Moore will have none of it.  Turner looks about the best she ever did especially in the second half when a dizzying array of Jean Louis concoctions parade across the screen and she's dripping in every kind of jewel.  She has many insincere and stiff moments in the film but also has several great scenes including when she tells lover Gavin that she's going to make it and later when she's at another character's deathbed.  Mercifully her character's acting scenes are never shown....just the curtain calls.  The film is a Faberge treasure box of interesting sets lighting color costumes and shadow.  Despite the relatively simple storyline term papers could be written about the psychological behavior in the film and the irony of the editing and storytelling.  Anyone averse to soap operas will have already run screaming from the room the moment the UniversalInternational logo comes up and Frank Skinner's gloriously sentimental scores begins to howl. Those who are game for some histrionics and glamour mixed with silliness and sorrow should be in hog heaven.".

And of course Juanita Moore and Susan Koehner are excellent in the crux of the story the loving black mother housekeeper for Turner whose more lightskinned daughter chooses to try to pass for white. Sirk is not judgmental on Koehner's rejection of her mother because we are shown just how bad the treatment of AfricanAmericans was. The Cinemascope used here is positively breathtaking.".

Director Douglas Sirk was a genius at creating largerthanlife star vehicles. But his films were not only aesthetically pleasing. They were also smart social critiques on America and its issues and ideals. This is an incredible movie that uses the best elements of soap opera fashion music and high drama to convey Sirk's scathing comments of 1950's society.The film revolves around motherdaughter relationships with a hint of romance thrown in for good measure. Lana Turnerspruced up in her Jean Louis gownsdoes her best to portray a neglectful mother to Sandra Dee. So consumed with fame and fortune is she that she doesn't look at her daughter's needs. Meanwhile Turner's black housekeeperplayed gloriously by the underrated Juanita Moorestruggles with her own lightskinned daughterSusan Kohnerwho tries to pass for white.There is no element too small in this film for Sirk and producer Ross Hunter to give the ultradramatic treatment to. Frank Skinner's campyby today's standardsmusic thunders and swells throughout while Turner emotes and the alwayswooden John Gavin poses and preens for the camera. Imitation of Life may not be for all audiences. But those who enjoy Technicolored highdrama bordering on brutal soap opera this film is probably the best of the best.".

But today November 23 2005 while making my potatoe salad I realized something that I had never really paid much attention to in my earlier review. The down on her luck actress became blessed the moment she provided shelter to a God fearing woman and her daughter. I saw how four people opened their hearts and gave life a chance without the remarks and concerns of outside people voices. The respect and kindness and touchy moments grabbed and captured me completely. The classic attire was sensation and I love mink trimmed suits and nice earrings that match the necklace. This movie should be celebrated on a whole knew level. And the character Steve makes my heart melt every time. He is very charming pure heart and with strong character. I have tried so many times to share that love can happen at first sight as so it was with Adam and Eve Isaac and Rebehak the moment she slide off one of the ten camels and I will not take it back. Steve is the kind of man that I would marry and as a matter of fact there is a young man in my church which is a mega church whom has the characteristic of the character Steve and they kinda favor...you know he has been watching me and he too is 6'4 and with a special charm and strength combined. Who knows he might become my husband. I already love him. I have this movie now on DVD and someone asked to take it home with them to watch...I am sorry this movie does not leave my home! I have seen many movies for I do appreciate and love movies. The funeral of Ms. Annie Johnson which is my real mothers name makes me think of Elijah how he was carried to heaven by horses and chariots of fire II Kings 211. The flowers over her casket...simply beautiful and warm. Ms. Jackson singing a song that reminded me that we are to celebrate such homegoing...Elijah went home in high fashion heaven style. The Troubles of this world. Proverbs 2123 Psalms 2522 Mark 138 and Revelation 1914. Such a wonderful movie and the acting is just marvelous.".

Basically aspiring actress Lora Meredith Lana Turner with 6yearold daughter Susie Terry Burnham and homeless black woman Annie Johnson Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Juanita Moore with 8yearold white daughter Sarah Jane Karin Dicker and their kids  meet each other at Coney Island beach and soon enough move in together Annie acting as maid to maintain her keep. Lora manages to get herself an acting part while Annie is having to cope with Sarah Jane denying her heritage. The years pass and Lora's career has blossomed to the point where she isn't at their now bigger home much to spend time with now 16yearold Susie Sandra Dee. As for Annie 18yearold Sarah Jane Golden Globe winning and Oscar nominated Susan Kohner is out of control with hatred for her mother being black and she is trying everything she can to hide her origins. Eventually once devoted mother Annie decides to let Sarah Jane live her own life as she wants and sadly with Lola by her side she dies from sickness. After a very heartfelt funeral song from Mahalia Jackson Sarah Jane lets her true feelings out blaming herself for her mother's death. Also starring Psycho's John Gavin as Steve Archer Dan O'Herlihy as David Edwards and Robert Alda as Allen Loomis. This really uses all the emotions you can think of but mainly the bad ones the performances are all very good and the racial complexities make for very essential viewing. Very good!".

I was only 7 when this movie came out and I remember when the Civil Rights movement started and what trouble it caused. This movie showed the suffering that racism was causing in a way that helps nonblacks empathize with the tragedy. The screenwriters cleverly wove all kinds of subthemes into the plot including the challenges women had to overcome to land a decent job. The story also addresses the question of what should happen when a working woman gets married does she quit working and let her husband be the breadwinner or should the husband support the wife in her work? These were unusual questions in the early years after World War 2 before which almost no women held professional positions.Given the year this movie came out it dealt fairly with all of these social challenges.".

The '59 version changes a few plot points  the Turner character isn't a Jewish businesswoman and there's no pancake batter and a big business success for the two women. Rather Turner plays an an aspiring actress with a small daughter who meets Juanita Moore and daughter at the beach. As with the original Moore just kind of moves in needing a place to live. When her daughter gets older she tries to pass for white.The '59 version is done as a glossy soap opera  and why not it stars Lana Turner in all her glamour and beauty and is directed by the master of this type of film Douglas Sirk. Sandra Dee plays Turner's daughter  great casting  and beautiful Susan Kohner is Moore's daughter Sarah Jane. Kohner's real life mother was an actor and her father a bigtime agentproducer Paul Kohner. Susan Kohner retired from show business when she married the designer John Weitz. Today their two sons are producers.The acting kudos in Imitation of Life belong to Juanita Moore who gives a touching performance as Annie and just breaks your heart. Kohner is excellent as well in fact the two were nominated for best supporting Oscars. John Gavin Robert Alda and Troy Donahue also appear in the film Donahue in a nasty small role and Gavin as Turner's love interest.One of the great tearjerking melodramas of all time  a very different experience than the original  if you can see both do so.".

They certainly don't make movies like that anymore! What's basically wrong with the story is that few things turn out this well in real life.The 1959 version of the Fannie Hurst book had already made it to the movies in an early picture starring Claudette Colbert. This new take on the novel was a vehicle clearly tailormade for Lana Turner who was at the height of her beauty in a mature kind of way. She was a natural that the camera loved. Ms. Turner was lovingly dressed by Jean Louis. Everything is impeccable in the way the star carries herself as a struggling mother who has not been employed in a while to the days in which she is the toast of Broadway.Juanita Moore among the cast members had the best moments. Her Annie Johnson was perhaps the best character she played. Susan Kohner a young actress who showed promise is also good as the mean Sarah Jane the ungrateful daughter who is a freak of nature by appearing white when she is really black. John Gavin plays Lora's love interest. Robert Alda is good as the man responsible for giving Lora a start in the business. Sandra Dee is seen as Susie the teenager who also has her eyes set on the man that loves her mother.

He has three children one son and two girls from whom one is blind.The movie is about his struggles to live an honest life and be a role model of goodness to his children.He lives in a slum where he meets a neighbor lady Actress Padma Priya who also begs and does odd road side jobs. She takes care of his children.Murughan goes to iron clothes at the house of a rich lady Actress Meena who is ailing and is about to die.Both of them bond with each other because of the blindgirl as their link. Meena feels for the struggle of a single father raising three kids on his own in this cruel city.She wants to donate her eyes to the blind girl when she dies but her husband is against it and does not like her special emotional bond with ironing man Mammoothy. It is a bond of PURE TRUE AGAPE LOVE. When they see each other in the eyes they know there is a special connection between two human beingsThere are so many moments in the movie that will make us cry  not because it shows the tragic lives of poor  but because it shows how resilient they are to show kindness love compassion and humanity even in trying times of struggle.BEAUTIFUL movie  I cried many times during the movie.The direction by Director Kamal is fabulous. To come out with such story idea and weave a movie around it is brilliantMeena dies but her family is not able to fulfill her wish to donated her eyes to the young blind girl.In the end Mommothy goes back to the village after that along with his 3 kids and that Padma Priya.Director Kamal is famous for making social based family dramas in Malayalam cinema.The setting and feel of the movie including the dress and makeup and looks are so real. All the characters are well crafted and everyone have acted so well.The music by Mohan Sitara is very good and songs are beautiful.The movie won The National award for the Best Family Movie for 2006 and several state and filmfare awards. Mammoothy Padma Priya and the blind girl too won awards for best acting.A wholesome humane drama that everyone should watch.I would go with 7.6 out of 10 for this gem.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based loosely on an famous unsolved murder mystery the multimillionaire Sir Harry Oakes who was brutally killed at his island retreat Nicolas Roeg's Eureka takes this bare bones idea and transforms it into one of the most daring ambitious and insightful films of all time. The film's screenwriter Paul Mayersberg packs each line of dialogue with thematic clues. The opening half hour is so stunning that it makes your head swim the camera sweeps into the snowfields of British Colombia whilst Stanley Myers' hauntingly repetitive theme throbs on the soundtrack. Jack McCann Gene Hackman is prospecting for gold and ditches his partners. Surrounded by wolves he gets a small talisman that he takes back to a brothel. The madam Frida fortells the future You'll find what you're looking for. But afterwards? Jack sets off and discovers the gold a genuinely amazing sequence. His ecstasy is short lived when he returns to his dying mistress. A burst of flame shoots forth and the film cuts to twenty years later when Jack is nostalgically telling the story to his daughter Tracy Theresa Russell. Tracy is in love with an insubstantial dilettante Claude Mio Van Horne Rutger Hauer who Jack loathes. At that moment in time Tracy is looking forward Jack is looking back. Jack is bored. He says Once I had it all. Now I only have everything. He is aware that his daughter is his soulclone. On the surface they appear quite different he's bitter she's a hedonist. Yet small details both admonish Jack's alcoholic wife Helen to lay off the sauce and they both have a stunning gift for mathematics tell the truth. They understand each other perfectly. Jack is under siege from a pack of wolves who come in the shape of gangsters who want to develop Jack's island. Eventually the gangsters and Claude invade the house and Jack is brutally murdered. After this terrifying yet beautiful sequence the film becomes more problematic. The courtroom scenes that follow contain dialogue that spells out the movie's themes and Russell's performance is hysterical. But the punchline as Tracy emasculates her husband is a doozy Claude...they despise you because you have me and I'm worth having. They despise me because I'm Jack's daughter and I have too much. And of course they still despise Jack because he found what they're all still looking for. The movie atones for a lot with its gorgeous final moments as Claude paddles away. It's difficult to articulate the power this movie has. It has an extraordinary power to sweep you away it's a crazy violent lovely magical experience. It's about the human condition and it deals with issues that are almost never talked about the price we pay for getting what we want the moments in life where we find our purpose the essence of people that is passed down through the generations the difference between old and new souls. The film's main flaws clumsy dialogue are directly linked to the main virtue the sheer overwhelming density of the material. Its a movie that will speak to you personally or leave you cold there's no middle ground and I find it almost an affront when somebody doesn't respond positively to it.".

	schema:headline " Eureka is about desires!";
	schema:reviewBody "Eureka is the kind of film you think you'll hate unless you give it a fair shake. It is a interplay between many characters much like a soap opera. It works only if you take a general interest in the trivialities of each character. Jack McCann Hackman is the center of the film. His life is all about the gold he felt he earned and the principle that he will never have any partners to share a percentage with. His life is ravaged by Mayakofsky Pesci and his henchmen. Charles Perkins a friend of Jack's spent much of the movie trying to warn him that these men were dangerous. Jack's dilemma wasn't that he was waiting for his death but the fact that he thought he was invincible. Being stubborn and set in his ways Jack refused to give in to Mayakofsky. Jack was a man preoccupied with gold but not loveless. He seemed to love all the women in his life. Also his daughter Spacey Tracy. A loose young woman married to Claude Hauer. Tracy had her head in the clouds and wanted to live in a fantasy world. She did not provoke the fights between her father and Claude but instigated them. She wanted Claude to fight as a proof of his love. Claude was most elusive. You never get his angle. If he loved Tracy or was just using her. She even used the witness stand as a way of finding out where Claude stood with her instead of pinning for the guilty ones involved in the tragic end of her father. Claude did his own defense in court! The movie has it's funny points. Like the dinner table scene at the McCann's where Jack makes some insulting remarks to the guests. Some of the best scenes involve Aurelio D'Amato played by Mickey Rourke. He's cast in another glossed over film where he is perfect but forgotten. D'Amato is a yiddish associate of Mayakofsky. And one of the main guys pestering Jack to sign the Luna Bay deal.Mayakofsky wanted to build a casino on it. There are scenes where D'Amato is begging Jack to sign. His baby face and soft voice should have gotten the devil to sign the document but Jack wasn't so easy. Rourke's performance alone is reason enough to see this movie. And its not surprising he has a night with Tracy. Tracy loved Claude but how could she resist D'Amato? Eureka is more of a film about the desires of man. Each character wants something and they spend the entire film in pursuit of those things.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is an odd one even for Roeg fans. In one sense it's much more straightforward linear and narrative than his other works. It's metaphysical attributes are also more directly stated instead of the kaleidoscopic mix of character and occult you find in other Roeg works. On the other hand that straightforwardness makes all of his subversive use of editing and narration even more effective as this movie tends to cause a sense of security right before dealing a blow.The plot as it exists in relatively straightforward form is about a man named Jack played by Gene Hackman who strikes it rich finding gold a surreal moment made all the more effective by the waterlike quality of the valuable substance. The movie then jumps forward over a decade later where Jack's wealth and happiness on his own private island surprise surprise is filled with ennui and unhappiness made all the more dramatic with his increasing selfishness his constantly drunk wife and his daughter's Theresa Russell proving that her partnership with Roeg has a lot more power than mere outsideofwork relationship romance to a womanizing French man Rutger Hauer in the best role I've seen him in since Blade Runner. Jack since he's such an unlikable person AND rich is a target to everyone else's priorities so he gets killed. The husband of his daughter is framed and suddenly the movie becomes a courtroom drama.The story is Roeg's most dramatic and poignant along the human level. But what seems incongruous to that aspect of the film is the Voudou the religion the Tarot the Kabbalah and all the other religious and occult symbols and dialog welded into the frame like some kind of scrapheap onto a statue. However what all that symbolism reveals along with the dialog I think this is Mayerberg's best collaboration with Roeg is the fact that this movie is neither a goldsearching adventure story nor an idleclass ennui drama nor a courtroom thriller... it's a meditation on life and success. But saying it like that doesn't really give credit to the type of meditation it is for this is far from the typical arthouse let's deconstruct modern life style meditation on an upper class it despises it's much more a question onto the nature of what part of success is really important and above all what part of life can actually be called life. Putting it into the context of a metaphysicalspiritual realm makes it all the more powerful as in most cases the camera is set at a God'seyeview. The trial is a different type of judgment than you think. The title Eureka isn't just about finding gold.Finally a note about the cinematography along with being a much more narrative work than Roeg's previous films Eureka also is a lot less flashy. Despite that the photography is still completely stunning more so than ever in the lighting of the trial which is probably one of the most reserved and subtle aspects of Roeg's filmmaking to date.PolarisDiB".

Surprisingly enough it's not as cryptic as the director's earlier work though still not for all tastes particularly given an irrelevant voodoo dance sequence involving a snakeinfested orgy. The script is by exfilm critic Paul Mayersberg who had already written THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH 1976 for Roeg. The film which could comfortably be divided into three parts is aided by a plethora of talent both in front  Gene Hackman Theresa Russell Rutger Hauer Jane Lapotaire Ed Lauter Mickey Rourke Joe Pesci and Joe Spinell a bit part as a thug  and behind the camera cinematographer Alex Thompson and composer Stanley Myers.The first part in which Hackman strikes it rich is the best with two scenes that are particularly memorable a despairing prospector blowing his head off in front of Hackman and then when the latter discovers the gold mine  an almost mystical sequence however one still has to contend with Helena Kallianotes' eccentric performance as a fortune tellerwhore who befriends Hackman. The second part in which we see Hackman twenty years on as a tycoon with a family  allpowerful but emotionally void this section creates some added tension with Hackman's clashes with playboy Hauer who marries his daughter Russell without her father's consent and unscrupulous business partners Pesci and Rourke and culminates with his violent death quite a graphic sequence occurring about 80 minutes into the 130minute picture! at the hands of the latters' thugs. The third and final part then involving Hauer's trial for Hackman's murder is the least compelling  given the latter's obvious absence but also the silly contrivances which dominate this section and particularly the preposterous scene of Russell's hysterics on the witness stand with Hauer acting as his own defense attorney!.EUREKA was shot in 1981 but the company that financed it couldn't make head or tail of it and decided to shelve the film eventually it was released in the U.K. in 1983 I own a copy of the Movies  Video magazine from that time which carries a reasonably favorable review of the film and according to Leonard Maltin's Film Guide didn't open in the U.S. until 1985!".

He ends up living on a Caribbean plantation named EUREKA with an alcoholic wife and a a lot of trinkets made of gold. What points Roeg is trying to make around greed and ego are buried beneath far too many story lines and far too many characters popping in and out. Hackman is fine in a blustery role that suits him and the supporting cast includes Theresa Russell Rutger Hauer Ed Lauter and Mickey Rourke. Joe Pesci is a Miami mobster looking to buy Hackman's island. Helena Kallianiotes has a great cameo as a psychic whore who sets Hackman on the road to riches and ruin. The whole film ends in the most apocalyptic ways. Completed in 1981 but barely released in the US until several years later.".

The movie had a good plot but seemed as though it could've been shorter. In the end I think that the main point to derive from the movie is that prestige makes people go crazy. Gene Hackman's character struck gold and it made him rich causing him to go nuts and the insanity extends to his acquaintances.

Gene Hackman stars as a gold prospector in Alaska during the final days of the gold rush. Most of the people have given up and gone home at this point but Hackman refuses. After a strange encounter with a meteor I think he receives some kind of lucky rock I think that gives him the extra push to find his gold strike. And does he ever. Cut to decades later and he's fabulously wealthy with a giant estate named Eureka. His grown daughter Theresa Russell has married a European playboy Rutger Hauer that dad doesn't approve of. There's also a shady consortium of some sort headed by Jewish tough guy Joe Pesci ! and represented by Italian lawyer Mickey Rourke ! that needs Hackman's financial backing for some new endeavor.The cinematography is beautiful as it usually is in Roeg's films but the plot is a mess of hamhanded symbolism and uninspired dramatics. The terrific cast which also includes Ed Lauter Joe Spinell and Corin Redgrave is good with Hackman the standout as usual. Rourke looks scared and uncomfortable which fits with his character but he comes across more like he's fully aware of how wrong he is in the role. Russell and Hauer are both beautiful and they both spend much of the film in various states of undress. There's also one of the most brutal protracted murder scenes I've seen in a film in a long time. It's starts off shocking but becomes rather ludicrous the longer it's dragged out. I can't really recommend this film to anyone except Hackman fans or fans of bizarre obscurities.".

Eureka boasts a great acrosstheboards cast with Gene Hackman giving his customary all in a driven and committed performance ably supported by Theresa Russell Rutger Hauer Joe Pesci and in a minor role Mickey Rourke. Director Roeg's use of locations his skill in cutting the harnessing of atmosphere and the adroit use of music add up to an intriguing whole loosely based on fact. It was made at the start of the 80's after an astonishing run of films by Roeg.Actually this is a very quirky film immersed in other things in this case it is the Kabbalah. This is made clear when Rutger Hauer wears a shirt with the Tree of the Kabbalah drawn on the front to a formal dinner in the middle of the film. I found this release of the film both impressive and a letdown. It is impressive because of its ambition as a film it is a letdown because the way it is edited most sense of suspense is replaced by puzzlement this is The Zohar meeting Hollywood and suffering from the meeting. In the end I don't feel this movie has any grand message for the world except perhaps the pointlessness of having so much wealth if you don't do anything with it.Overall rating 7 out of 10.".

Not terribly interesting even dull at certain parts in the first half plus it's messy and not always convincing.It starts off with a reasonable twenty or so minutes in Alaska or wherever then goes nowhere for a while with sometimes pointless and sometimes boring dialog. The second half gets confusing with scenes just being piled up without any kind of sequence that would make sense. The courtroom scenes are tedious throwing yet more confusion. Is Russell a part of Pesci's plan? Was she in on it? If not why did she sleep with Rourke? If she wasn't in on it then somehow her affair with Rourke doesn't make sense she said something in her neverending courtroom speech about having affairs herself sleeping around with men. Was that supposed to clarify her sleeping with Rourke while her husband was on trial for murder? It doesn't quite wash. Her impassioned dialogue with her husband acting as his own attorney goes on forever but unfortunately also goes nowhere. After this speech we understand both her and the plot even less. Then Hauer gets surprisingly acquitted and he and Russell have a little talk in the last part which doesn't really do much in the ways of shedding some light on anything.But easily the messiest part of the movie is the entire night of the murder scenes of ritualistic natives' orgy mix with Hackman going around the island first searching for Hauer and Russell and then bumping literally with his car into his business partner. Hackman is lead to Pesci's men but refuses to sign a contract and this entire scene with him and the gang members is unconvincing and almost silly. Hauer JUST HAPPENS to be there and witnesses this meeting I know it's an island but surely it isn't only ten meters wide and Hackman somehow sees him. Beforehand Hauer had taken part in the aforementioned orgy and escorts some women and a guy away from it telling them not to talk about it.The whole thing appears disorganized disconnected and lacks flow. The same goes for the scenes leading up to the ensuing murder of Hackman which are just scenes piled one on top of another as though put together by an editor drunk out of his mind. At the end of the film we hear Hackman's words again something about gold or whatever. I have no idea what Roeg's point was too many things here don't add up. The typically Roegian emphasis on the supernatural didn't help either. Hauer is very good. A film that strives for some profound message but fails to deliver it if it even has one.".

Directed by Nicholas Roeg who masterminded the classic Walkabout and Don't Look Now. Based on a riveting true story about a megarich gold prospector Harry Oakes who was murdered in his plush Bahamian mansion. With credentials as mouthwatering as they are Eureka is the closest thing you'd ever get to a surefire masterpiece. Yet somehow the handling is so over stylized and so preoccupied by meaningless artiness that the film emerges as a complete and utter failure. A mishap of a movie to rank alongside other moviesthatcouldn'tfailbutdid like The Adventurers 1970 and Inchon 1981.After years of gold hunting in the frozen Arctic wilderness Jack McCann Hackman hits upon a massive gold claim in 1925. Immense wealth is thrust upon him. The story moves on twenty years and McCann now owns a sundrenched Bahamian island and has every luxuryinlife at his fingertips. However wealth brings him little happiness. His wife Helen Jane Lapotaire has become an alcoholic his daughter Tracy Theresa Russell has grown distant from him since marrying an ambitious playboy Rutger Hauer and he is being leaned on rather heavily by murderous Florida mobsters who want to build a casino on his island.Featuring the most extreme and unwatchable murder scene from any film ever made and a host of surreal sequences Eureka is an ultimate example of The Emperor's New ClothesSyndrome. You are asked to watch a long film about nothing and tricked into believing that it is some kind of deep and meaningful masterpiece. Unfortunately it is no such thing. Rather it is a confused cruel oversexed violent and grossly selfindulgent bomb. The stunning cinematography merely adds to the sense of regret that such promisingsounding material has turned out so utterly utterly awful.".

	schema:reviewBody "I too first saw this in London when it came out May 1983 at the Screen on the Hill. It was my Olevel year and I was a skinny awkward 15yearold desperately trying to get into my first 18rated film. It worked. But was it worth it? The film has an extraordinary opening section as Gene Hackman finds the gold under the snowencrusted earth culminating in a spectacular slowmotion explosion of rock and snow. Set to extracts of Wagner's DAS RHEINGOLD it's unforgettable thrilling cinema and had my jaw dropping into my cappuccino. We also have the sight of a dying halffrozen man blowing his brains out again and again bringing to mind the disjointed hallucinatory quality one recognises from the director of THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH and DON'T LOOK NOW. Stunning disturbing stuff.Unfortunately the momentum quickly slackens as we cut forwards in time to a rather dull plodding melodrama about a Kanelike man who in his anguish says Once I had it all...now I only have everything. Coming after the prologue this also applies to the film itself. There's some nasty scenes involving voodoo and Rutger Hauer doing something rather strange with a python some gutwrenching violence involving a blowtorch and the contents of a pillow and a soapopera courtroom finale that feels as if it's wandered in from an entirely different film altogether. There are rumours of a different film lurking in this exuberant mess one of the film's stars has hinted that it was not Roeg's final version that we saw. But I couldn't call this a success. Roeg fans should check it out as an oddity but be warned after the brilliant beginning it's downhill all the way.".

This works in one sense because the film as a whole is way too long. Seen without the boring and pointless trial scenes Eureka is a tight satisfying drama. I've tested this theory and shown it to friends stopping the tape at the moment Hackman is killed. Everyone who viewed the film this way loved it while those that saw all three acts felt the film had great moments but was severely flawed piece of work. Take my advice stop watching when Hackmen dies.

	schema:reviewBody "Young filmmakers take notice. Eureka is a case study in bad filmmaking which could be used in filmmaking andor film appreciation classes. The premise could have worked all right if the script had had about a half dozen additional rewrites and if the many cinematic tricks had been pared down. The storyline itself seems like it was recycled by outofwork screenwriters dumped from Days of Our Lives barring the opening sequence. Part of the problem is the film throws more symbolism at the viewer than all of Orson Wells' films combined which we'll explore later. The scenes are also so overly directed the resulting cinematic experience seems more like a desperate film student trying to prove he is the next Orson Wells or Fritz Lang rather than allowing the characters and the scenes to tell the story.In the 1920's Jack McCann Gene Hackman is a gold prospector in the arctic who finally hits it rich. He doesn't just become rich but purportedly becomes the richest man in the world so tally up silly problem number one. If you examine history almost no one became the richest person in the world from gold prospecting. Fastforward to the 1940's McCann now owns an island in the Caribbean. He has a daughter Tracy McCann Theresa Russell who has given her heart to an emotional walking soap opera Claude Maillot Van Horn Rutger Hauer. Of course Claude and Jack can't stand each other although when we first meet Tracy I thought she had had an affair with Jack not that she was his daughter! Tally up silly problem number two. They actually talk about having been in Paris similar to Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca! Hackman for about the next hour rants and raves about Hauer groping his daughter tally up silly problem number three. For being the richest man since John D. Rockefeller he seems unable to control these people! Couldn't he just hire some hitmen and off this irritant? At the same time two Italian mafiatypes played by Joe Pesci and Mickey Roarke are trying to finagle Hackman into starting a casino in Miami. Several times I couldn't hear what they were saying but more importantly I didn't really care! Tally up silly problem number four.Silly problem number five gets the silver medal the shots. The shots were too innovative for their own good. Zooming in on characters when they do something strange or become emotional occurs ad infinitum. If a character is unhappy zoom! If they're giving an endless tragic speech as a fortunetellerbrothel madam does at the beginning zoom! It's zoom in for this and zoom in for that zooming down from above zooming up from below. There was more zooming around than a typical Superman film. A strange episode at the beginning was supposed to be a dream sequence but there was so much zooming around and strange symbolism I didn't understand it was a dream or what it meant.Which brings us to silly problem number six the gold medal goes to the symbolism! Yes this film is so chock full of symbolism applied with a sledgehammer I started forgetting why I care about the story! Explosions candles and clocks get about as much screen time as the characters in Eureka! They also seemed to be overt homages to Orson Wells' Citizen Kane referring to the exploding crystal snow globe after Kane says Rosebud. Explosions run rampant at the beginning of the film in the arctic including a horrid blastyourbrainsout suicide which served no purpose at all. Later it's clocks and candles. And of course all the symbols are zoomed into again from all angles imaginable. Particularly towards the last half of the film we're zooming to clocks! Is the filmmaker running out of footage? Candles are also everywhere. People even walk around with candles as if we're in a bad Hammer Film from the 1950's! The film is essentially a cinematic mess. For all the zooming and symbols I couldn't get a hold of the characters. Hackman who often plays very resolved characters seemed strangely ambiguous. For a guy who has everything he seemed to be in a real rut! Hauer is little better. He's won Theresa Russell the most attractive character in the film and even he doesn't seem very happy about it. Actually Russell's character was the only one who was reasonably welldefined. But even she can't save this odd mess of a movie. Sadly it wasn't quite so bad that it was good. Essentially everything which should never be in a movie and more.".

The central story of Cotten and Johnson as two brothers who overcome their differences has been done so many times that it isn't much of a story. Ruth Roman as Cotten's wife is OK though her sexual frustration with Cotten they sleep in separate rooms and have been doing so for a long time is also not believable.

I like movies that show the middle 50's there's a really nifty house with a kitchen right out of a mid 50's design book it is beautifully shot with some nice scenery outdoors.The key for me to really enjoy a movie is when I get hooked into the characters. I have to be interested in them worried about them find them likable or appealing even if in a sinister way. This movie fell flat for me because frankly I didn't much care for any of the characters. I guess I felt a little sorry for Ruth Roman the wife who wanted children and her husband Joseph Cotten wouldn't 'give' her any... but Joseph Cotten just isn't the kind of person you can generate much warmth for. He's about as appealing as a firstaid cabinet. I like Van Johnson  usually  but his character here is a jerk even when he's sober. While his love and concern for his family makes him seem a little more human I just couldn't empathize with him. He and Joseph Cotten brothers in the story never seemed very brotherly to me and between them it's hard to say which one I cared less about.What happened to the horses when they crossed the river? I guess they were both just washed away and nobody cared? I didn't like that. They were Cotten's horses the least he could have done was ask 'are they all right' and look pained when he found out what happened but not even a mention.If you want to watch a movie that shows some dysfunctional family life in the middle 50's including people battling the bottle and other demons I would suggest the real gem 'No Down Payment'. I think it's ten times the movie that this one is. For me this one is a yawn. If I hadn't been exercising during the time it was on it would have been a total waste of my time. I'll give it five stars because it's not BAD bad but it's just not that good either. It's just a sowhat movie.".

	schema:headline " Arresting drama concerning an escaped convict and his respectable brother.";
	schema:reviewBody "A rather trim study of family discord and torment this film offers a surprisingly expansive cast of experienced actors along with some decent acting and a good set piece or two. Cotten plays a wealthy ranch owner living just north of the Mexican border in a fairly remote area. One night during a heavy storm he finds his estranged brother Johnson at his home freshly escaped from prison and eager to cross into Mexico where his wife and children are already waiting. Before Cotten can get used to the idea that his convict brother has invaded his selfcreated paradise his wife Roman bursts in with a passel of their rich heavydrinking friends. Cotten decides to pass Johnson off as a long lost friend but must wait out the rain and the dangerously high river before getting Johnson out of the picture. Unfortunately Johnson may become too much to deal with before that happens. Cotten has a fairly one note role to play and does it adequately if not spectacularly. It's kind of a stubborn bitter role without a ton of dimension. He and Johnson are very unlikely brothers though they try hard to make it work. Johnson comes off surprisingly well. Best known for boynextdoor roles and colorful froth he is wonderfully dour and serious here and has a manly rugged presence. It's among the best of his screen roles. Roman really only gets to register heavily in one scene against Cotten and otherwise is used more decoratively. Her nicotineladen voice can take some getting used to however. The society friends are played by a familiar gaggle of faces though most of them have to scratch for anything notable to say or do. Carson for example is capable of doing more than he's given though Hayes as his wife enjoys a gossipy part. Also to be spotted are Dexter Davis and Lindsay. The film was shot in widescreen without a lot of closeups which means that smaller TVs cannot give full justice to the actors when they're shot in group situations something that happens a great deal here. Former Olympian and movie Tarzan Bennett plays the local lawman. Gates has one scene as Johnson's anxietyridden wife surrounded by three children all of whom had busy careers before the camera in their youth. One thing that helps the movie a lot is the location filming. Interior scenes though take place on the spacious and sometimes patently falselooking Roman's kitchen for example sets that 20th Century Fox favored during this time no doubt meant to glean best use out of the Cinemascope lens. Some of the dramatics get a little overheated at times but many solid scenes appear as well one involving Morgan as a bar proprietor. There's also a convincingly treacherous river that figures into the climax. It packs a fair amount of entertainment into its hour and a half running time.".

The brother played coldly by stolid Joseph Cotten is a wealthy rancher but has problems of his own having married for reasons never quite made clear but mired in a longtime childless relationship with svelte intelligent Ruth Roman here as in so many films holding an anchor on some out of control emotions.Except for what I felt was an unnecessarily saccharin final five minutes the plot zips with some intensity along the MexicanAmerican border and the assured direction of veteran Henry Hathaway assures the viewer of a CainAbel story with modern ranch trimmings.Johnson who passed away in 2008 could always be relied upon to be an easy leading man in musicals from Two Girls and A Sailor In The Good Old Summertime with Judy Garland but also served well in wartime dramas Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo and Caine Mutiny in this film however Johnson stretched his talents beyond the usual and turned in his most distinctive role.".

But he is on the run and looking for help from his attorney brother Joseph Cotton who didn't exactly put himself out to help him in the first place. Joseph is not glad to see him and Van is not happy about asking him for help now. In the middle of a deluge washing out roadsVan is trapped and hiding out at Joseph's and wife Ruth Roman's house. They have rich and drinking neighbors in their area which no one can leave due to the torrential downpour And the rivers won't subside for three to four days. Van Johnson has a wife and three children that needs money and care. He's asking Joseph for immediate help for them. The Bottom of the Bottle sounds like a film about an alcoholic. But while Van does a history of drinking and can't hold his liquor well the film is about so much more. I like movies like this where the true star is the human story or the family dynamic. The childhood Van and Joseph shared was something less than ideal and there is much resentment there. In fact this plays out a little like Touched by an Angel. But that is not a criticism just a comparison. All the actors give fine performances and Van is especially good in a meaty role for him. The only criticism is that it does get rather melodramatic as it nears its conclusion. One would think this has no good ending with a runaway convict but it plays out rather well despite some corny andor sappy dialogue. But that element only makes the viewer feel that much more satisfied with the good resolution and is one reason why I compared this to Touched by an Angel. If you like good actors in good oldfashioned movies with real plot and real characters then this definitely is worth your time.".

The problem is that Donald's family is waiting for him in Mexico...and they are broke and need him. So what's next?? Well quite a bit....but I'll leave it up to you to see this movie.This one starts slowly and didn't grab my interest until about midway through the picture. So hold on....it's worth it in the long run and it's an excellent story that's about so much more than a prison escape.";

	schema:headline " The gloom of an outer planet as seen in a French village";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the film which Claude Berri directed immediately after his worldfamous pair of films based on Marcel Pagnol stories JEAN DE FLORETTE 1986 and MANON DES SOURCES 1986. This film is based upon a novel by the wellknown French author Marcel Aym 19021967 59 films having been made between 1934 and 2016 either based upon his works or incorporating his written contributions to dialogue or scripts. The film contains spectacular bravura performances from both Philippe Noiret and Gerard Depardieu. Anyone interesting in seeing superlative acting by two of France's finest actors need look no further than here. They both have scenes of such shattering force and power that the screen shakes. Noiret's rant is a philosophical one and is a real tour de force of writing as well as of delivery. This film deals with the tensions of a French village in central France subsequent to the end of World War II. 'Collabos' i.e. collaborators who aided and worked with the occupying Nazis or who were officials of the ousted Vichy regime are being rounded up and summarily executed by local committees some official and some not. For the moment the Communists are in control of the village and they are the most bloodthirsty. Many cynical comments are made by the characters about how huge numbers of people not only now claim to have been members of the Resistance but have actually faked papers and evidence to try to prove it and thus escape being executed as collabos. In the midst of all this is the naive idealist Leopold who runs a tavern played by Depardieu. He is a man of no education who has become obsessed with a love of classic poetry and drama. He keeps quoting from Racine's 17th century drama ANDROMACHE and attempting to write properly scanned lines of original verse to add to it. He is framed by one of the Communists and arrested as a collabo. He has great difficulty extricating himself from this and the inevitable village firing squad. Everyone in the village is ratting on everyone else except for the character played by Philippe Noiret who sublimely attempts to ride above all the political passions and insists that there is some good in everybody. Many villagers have been billeted in their neighbours' home temporarily because their houses have been destroyed by bombing raids and they have nowhere else to go. The main square of the village is littered with rubble and there are ruins of bombed houses everywhere. So high do the passions run that when a train arrives bringing home many young soldiers from prisoner of war camps who have been absent from home for five years one of the young men is savagely attacked and beaten in the middle of the welcoming ceremony because he was reputed to have been a collabo inside the POW camp. So everyone is going for everyone else and it is not a pretty sight as we discover scandal after scandal about the villagers. Eventually we realize that the police have been 'bought' by a collabo profiteer so that they will jail or kill anyone he wishes. Aym's story is deeply cynical as an expos of the corruption hypocrisy and viciousness of French villages and we are shown just how horrible it is trying to get back to normal after years of occupation by a ruthless foreign power when half the population have been collaborating with the oppressive invaders. As for the human stories in this film they are as full of tragedy irony and hypocrisy as one could possibly imagine. The film is so well made that it is compulsive viewing but it reveals much about human nature that most of us wish we did not have to know. And it is a sad sad history lesson indeed. As for the involvement of Uranus in all this it is as follows. Philippe Noiret was reading one night in his home when the bombers came and destroyed his house killing his wife. He was saved by resting freakishly on a single beam which did not collapse with the rest of the house. At the time of the raid he had been reading an astronomy book and was just at the point where he was reading about the dark and gloomy outer planet Uranus. Subsequently he has had repeated nightmares about the bombing raid mixed with visions of Uranus so that he became haunted by the gloomy planet and it became to him the symbol of all that was wrong and horrible in life. This film is trying to tell the French people that Uranus can still haunt them if they do not come to terms properly with all the horrors of the War the Occupation the collabos and the subsequent illegal and rough justice meted out by what were nothing less than politicised vigilante gangs who were often bribed by corrupt criminals. And lest anyone think these subjects are exaggerated let me remind everyone of the most famous Vichy official to successfully pose as a Resistance supporter after the War and who thus fraudulently gained the adulation of the French public and became elected President of the Republic. His name was Francois Mitterand and when the truth about him finally came out we all learned that he had been the greatest hypocrite of them all.".

This film is based upon a novel by the wellknown French author Marcel Aym 19021967 59 films having been made between 1934 and 2016 either based upon his works or incorporating his written contributions to dialogue or scripts. The film contains spectacular bravura performances from both Philippe Noiret and Gerard Depardieu. Anyone interesting in seeing superlative acting by two of France's finest actors need look no further than here. They both have scenes of such shattering force and power that the screen shakes. Noiret's rant is a philosophical one and is a real tour de force of writing as well as of delivery. This film deals with the tensions of a French village in central France subsequent to the end of World War II. 'Collabos' i.e. collaborators who aided and worked with the occupying Nazis or who were officials of the ousted Vichy regime are being rounded up and summarily executed by local committees some official and some not. For the moment the Communists are in control of the village and they are the most bloodthirsty. Many cynical comments are made by the characters about how huge numbers of people not only now claim to have been members of the Resistance but have actually faked papers and evidence to try to prove it and thus escape being executed as collabos. In the midst of all this is the naive idealist Leopold who runs a tavern played by Depardieu. He is a man of no education who has become obsessed with a love of classic poetry and drama. He keeps quoting from Racine's 17th century drama ANDROMACHE and attempting to write properly scanned lines of original verse to add to it. He is framed by one of the Communists and arrested as a collabo. He has great difficulty extricating himself from this and the inevitable village firing squad. Everyone in the village is ratting on everyone else except for the character played by Philippe Noiret who sublimely attempts to ride above all the political passions and insists that there is some good in everybody. Many villagers have been billeted in their neighbours' home temporarily because their houses have been destroyed by bombing raids and they have nowhere else to go. The main square of the village is littered with rubble and there are ruins of bombed houses everywhere. So high do the passions run that when a train arrives bringing home many young soldiers from prisoner of war camps who have been absent from home for five years one of the young men is savagely attacked and beaten in the middle of the welcoming ceremony because he was reputed to have been a collabo inside the POW camp. So everyone is going for everyone else and it is not a pretty sight as we discover scandal after scandal about the villagers. Eventually we realize that the police have been 'bought' by a collabo profiteer so that they will jail or kill anyone he wishes. Aym's story is deeply cynical as an expos of the corruption hypocrisy and viciousness of French villages and we are shown just how horrible it is trying to get back to normal after years of occupation by a ruthless foreign power when half the population have been collaborating with the oppressive invaders. As for the human stories in this film they are as full of tragedy irony and hypocrisy as one could possibly imagine. The film is so well made that it is compulsive viewing but it reveals much about human nature that most of us wish we did not have to know. And it is a sad sad history lesson indeed. As for the involvement of Uranus in all this it is as follows. Philippe Noiret was reading one night in his home when the bombers came and destroyed his house killing his wife. He was saved by resting freakishly on a single beam which did not collapse with the rest of the house. At the time of the raid he had been reading an astronomy book and was just at the point where he was reading about the dark and gloomy outer planet Uranus. Subsequently he has had repeated nightmares about the bombing raid mixed with visions of Uranus so that he became haunted by the gloomy planet and it became to him the symbol of all that was wrong and horrible in life. This film is trying to tell the French people that Uranus can still haunt them if they do not come to terms properly with all the horrors of the War the Occupation the collabos and the subsequent illegal and rough justice meted out by what were nothing less than politicised vigilante gangs who were often bribed by corrupt criminals. And lest anyone think these subjects are exaggerated let me remind everyone of the most famous Vichy official to successfully pose as a Resistance supporter after the War and who thus fraudulently gained the adulation of the French public and became elected President of the Republic. His name was Francois Mitterand and when the truth about him finally came out we all learned that he had been the greatest hypocrite of them all.";

I appreciate that this is in part a stylistic choice for the story is one of trouble beneath a superficially perfect surface but real life is rarely that perfect even when viewed superficially. Secondly the tale of a young businessman worn down by executive responsibility and a dominant mother is fairly predicable. The latter fault is a special shame because it threatens to mask what is a superbly directed movie whose cast all give perfectly judged understated performances. The opening sequences are utterly though quietly gripping but once the basic scenario has been laid out the story ceases to surprise and one can almost overlook the quality of the filmmaking it takes the power of an unexpected scene the attempted rape to remind one just how skilfully Fly has managed to convince us of the reality of his world excessive beauty notwithstanding. In some ways and in spite of the more affluent setting the story feels like something that would have been at home in Kiesolowski's 'Dekalog' but in that work each story took only an hour at the same length this could have been a knockout. As it is 'Inheritance' can't quite reach those heights but it's still a compelling portrait of the way that people change.".

The script is perfect the directing is perfect the casting is perfect and the story has profound meaning for the viewer.The film shows how family and business obligations can change people's character and desires. For example Hollywood is filled with couples whose desires change because of life experiences. It is also true of the business world. Unfortunately that is why divorce is so common in those areas. A couple may start out completely compatible and then one of them has new vistas opened to them.".

The starting premise is strikingly similar to another Scandinavian drama the Icelandic The Storm Hafi as in both we start off with a prodigal son happily and romantically involved abroad but forced back to deal with the patriarch's dramatic decision that has ever widening ramifications.But whereas the first went off in psychosexual directions from a fishery this Danish film stays realistically in the board room of a steel plant as much as the bed room.  Here his wife is a Shakespearean actress and the Shakespearean references I caught are played up beyond King Learas the matriarch a scarily formidable Ghita Nrby whose role could be taken by Judi Dench or Glenn Close in an American remake is a Lady MacBeth and he's baited by a CFO with a pronounced Iago modus operandi while the wife the very moving Lisa Werlinder is left to plead like Portia in Julius Caeser. UnHamletlike Ulrich Thomsen's manipulatable Christoffer plunges into decisions that succeed at high psychological prices for him and those around him reminding me of the classic closing line of the adaptation of Henry James The Heiress I've learned from masters.".

It was fine that he helped out with his family upon his father's death. On the other hand he should not have left his marriage and restaurant business go down the drain. He allowed his mother to turn him against his wife a fine woman who loved and cared for him. The mother was just an overly dominant woman who wanted her way and who did not care who she hurt to get it. The main character lacked the fortitude and strength to repel this advance by the mother. As I've stated this produced grave consequences. The main character could and should have helped for a while and then went back to his restaurant and family. The movie revealed that the state of the business wasn't good. The ruthless of the business world was shown.

On the surface he is self assured and in control yet underneath he is a man experiencing a desperate emotional and spiritual crisis that threatens to take control of his life. Similar in theme to Laurent Cantet's Time Out Danish director Per Fly's The Inheritance is a penetrating look at the humane cost of serving a soulless corporation out of duty and obligation. The second in a trilogy that deals with Danish life from different social levels it is an absorbing drama of old wealth and modern capitalism that takes us into the soul of Christoffer Ulrich Thomsen the wealthy son of a prominent steel magnate. Reserved almost reticent Christoffer hides his feelings like a surprise birthday present but when they are unwrapped they also unravel.In a flashback to five years ago we learn that he is a successful restaurateur in Sweden happily married to Maria Lisa Werlinder a Shakespearean actress who is offered a contract for one year at the Royal Dramatic Theater. Christoffer's life is turned upside down however when he learns that his father Aksel Ulf Pilgaard the owner of the BorchMuller steel mill has committed suicide after concealing the company's substantial debt. Like Michael Corleone in The Godfather he is then forced to choose between his sense of loyalty to his family and his personal freedom when his imperious mother Annelise Ghita Norby showing no confidence in his brotherinlaw Ulrik Lars Brygmann insists that he take over the leadership of the steelworks.Maria unwilling to give up her career pleads with him to refuse to lead the company now almost bankrupt. Christoffer is hesitant and first agrees with his wife but when he comes face to face with the company's employees many of whom would have to be laid off he capitulates and agrees to assume his father's position. It is a turning point in his life. Though it never becomes clear where the truth lies Christoffer hears from his associate Niels Peter Steen that Ulrik is spreading rumors to undermine the company's position with the bank. He is forced to fire Ulrik precipitating a crisis with his sister Benedikte Karina Skands who remains steadfast in his support and refuses to have anything further to do with her brother.When Christoffer has to dismiss 200 workers until the company can get back on its feet it begins to affect his personality. He refuses to talk about his work with Maria and becomes totally preoccupied with completing a merger with a prominent European steelworks company. Taken aback by the callousness apparently necessary to run the business Maria is angered by her husband's reluctance to share his problems at work and by his mother Annelise who tells Christoffer not to talk about his emotions. If this sounds like an episode from Dynasty it would only be partially true. For the most part the characters and their motivations are too nuanced and complex for it to be considered as soap opera though unfortunately the film lapses into melodrama near the end.The Inheritance can be viewed on several levels as a testament to what the modern day corporation has become a machine that inevitably gobbles up one's humanity as the story of a selfless individual willing to sacrifice his own happiness for his family's business or as the sad tale of a man who is more comfortable being in a dependent relationship with his mother than in fully assuming the adult responsibilities of marriage and emotional independence. Regardless of your interpretation The Inheritance succeeds as a compelling character study of a man who in the process of making hard choices in the business world loses the things in his life that are the most precious including his self respect.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Inheritance is the dramatic tale of Christoffer Ulrich Thomsen a successful restauranteur whose father dies leaving him the family's steelworks in his will. Christoffer and his young wife Maria Lisa Werlinder are torn away from the city as Christoffer begins the difficult task of pulling the steelworks out of a financial slump. It is a burden that will ultimately lead to years of pent up frustration exploding in a dizzy and spellbinding fury that will decide what path Christoffer chooses to take.The Inheritance is filmed in the rough gritty digital style seen before in Open Water the grainy print complimenting the industrial symbolism that has melted comfortably into the story line. Christoffer is seen through windows in moments of reflection the glass acting almost as a barrier between Christoffer's repression of feeling and his desire to explode which he eventually does  shattering a glass coffee table and screaming. The glass mirrors Christoffer's personality two characters at different times during the film label him as cold as ice. His deadened character is set well against the muted colours that make up the metallic miseenscene.The film is straining for realism throughout. The characters exchange dialogue that suffers for its honesty especially in the scene in which Christoffer confronts his wife over her cheating on him the words are boringly familiar clich beyond being bearable and the film suffers for it. This does not remove any credit from the actors Ulrich Thomsen and Ghita Nrby as Christoffer's iron willed mother in particular who give realistic and where appropriate emotionally driven performances. The quality of the acting is allowed to ferment by the director's decision to shoot using two cameras during the scenes both of which were filming through a long focal lens meaning that the cameras did not need to be up close to the actors. This freedom allows improvisation to reign unrestricted and the film both succeeds and suffers for the numbingly boring realism that this creates.Numbing dull and bland The Inheritance certainly is but it meanders towards an explosive climax that leaves you stunned and unable to look away. The pace then returns to its normal slow drag and the film fades away leaving you feeling tired and empty but certainly impacted upon. It is a film that could not have been improved yet its story setting pace and realism all contribute to make this a very difficult film to watch. Rating 35".

	onyx:emotionText "The Inheritance is the dramatic tale of Christoffer Ulrich Thomsen a successful restauranteur whose father dies leaving him the family's steelworks in his will. Christoffer and his young wife Maria Lisa Werlinder are torn away from the city as Christoffer begins the difficult task of pulling the steelworks out of a financial slump. It is a burden that will ultimately lead to years of pent up frustration exploding in a dizzy and spellbinding fury that will decide what path Christoffer chooses to take.The Inheritance is filmed in the rough gritty digital style seen before in Open Water the grainy print complimenting the industrial symbolism that has melted comfortably into the story line. Christoffer is seen through windows in moments of reflection the glass acting almost as a barrier between Christoffer's repression of feeling and his desire to explode which he eventually does  shattering a glass coffee table and screaming. The glass mirrors Christoffer's personality two characters at different times during the film label him as cold as ice. His deadened character is set well against the muted colours that make up the metallic miseenscene.The film is straining for realism throughout.

She is exceptional good in this role. Lisa Werlinder plays the silent girl who a few times gets very upset. When she does it really lifts the movie to an even higher level. Ulrich Thomsen does not say how he feels so it is very important that you can see what he feels. Very well done. Not easy to get away with as good as this.Beautiful pictures also makes this movie a pleasure to watch. Especially when they are shooting in France you have some very amazing pictures. It is also nice that the camera does not shake as much as most Dogma movies.But if it had not been for the original plot it would not have been a good movie. Today in Danish movies it is mostly ordinary people you see so that everybody can relate. It was fun for a while but the ordinary story about ordinary people can get really boring if you make it over and over again. The most important scene in the movie as I see it is where Christoffer announces to the employees that the company will merge and that even more people will get hired. The crowd cheers and you can see how Christoffer's eyes just shine. That is one of the reasons that he sacrifice so much. Because of the employees.Arven is original. Interesting.

Conversely the negative aspect of capitalism is represented by the cold scheming dowager who thinks nothing of setting 200 employees on the dole firing her soninlaw from his decisionmaking post disrupting her son's family all for the benefit of The Firm.The second level is Freudian. A power struggle is under way between the domineering mother not unlike Meryl Streep's character in The Manchurian Candidate and the rest of the family. She claims to be the strong one as opposed to all the others whom she describes as weak with the exception of her son. In reality he is just a puppet in her hands incapable of cutting the umbilical cord and going against his mother's wishes. Her own strength is in fact also a delusion  she would not manage to run the company on her own so she depends on Christoffer as much as he depends on her. She reaches out as far as Stockholm where her son mistakenly thinks he has found bliss with his beautiful and caring Swedish actress wife while eschewing the tentacles of family business. But with the excuse of his father's suicide  and here one doubts how big a part she has had in his tragic decision  she drags him back to Copenhagen and installs him at the head of what he had tried to escape. The fact that she insists that he not his brotherinlaw become the leader is a clear imposition of her will. Another one is the coaxing of Christoffer into forming a relationship with the family friend whom he doesn't care about. But she is omnipotent in his eyes so in the end he'll have to give in and do what he is told. Breaking away from the wife and baby he loves shatters him but he will learn in time  his mother teaches him  if not to despise them at least to grow indifferent. A great chilling interpretation by Ghita MrbyAnnelise Lisa Werlinder is delightfully voluptuous and Ulrich Thomsen is confirming himself a highly talented actor. Per Fly directs an elegant bitter movie reminiscent of Ingmar Bergman's cosmic pessimism.".

The major thing that I dislike about this film is the story itself. The presentation is great but the content is left to be desired. It follows the usual plot that you see in most familysaga afternoon soap operas. The whole time I was watching it I was kind of guessing what will happen next. The movies didn't explain much where most of the major characters are coming from and why they are behaving the way they do. I particularly don't understand one unsympathetic character  The mother. You can't relate to her because you don't have a clue why she is the way she is. The attempted rape scene near the end of the movie seems to just come out of nowhere and was totally unnecessary and out of character. At least it didn't have a happy ending. I give it  out of .".

The movies didn't explain much where most of the major characters are coming from and why they are behaving the way they do. I particularly don't understand one unsympathetic character  The mother. You can't relate to her because you don't have a clue why she is the way she is. The attempted rape scene near the end of the movie seems to just come out of nowhere and was totally unnecessary and out of character. At least it didn't have a happy ending. I give it  out of .";

Sure it came out around the same time lots of other Anime's came out on scifi channel back in the day. Hard to say it is the same kind of film as i don't see any indication of similarity in it. It was a very popular movie for its time as well not in the US but in Japan Following many comics rewritten to English by dark horse comics and soon following the Venus wars strategy game on the Regular Nintendo system. The fans of this series movie and comic could not get enough as I'm sure you will feel the same after seeing this Masterpiece. I still find it to be the greatest 80's anime of all time perfection.".

This movie is darker in color more tones instead of bright colors grittier in plotting whereas Akira used shock value instead and has a stronger moving plot than does Akira with a definite goal in mind.  A telling difference is that the soundtrack of Venus Wars is much more listenable with strong catchy vocals and epic background music for the sequences that need it.  What's similar?

Joe Hisaishi wrote the stirring score and he had worked musical magic for Studio Ghibli on My Neighbor Totoro 1988 the previous year. The rest of the senior staff brought solid reputations and worked in top form to make Venus Wars a glossily produced welldesigned exciting piece of sciencefiction. The mecha designs are excellent and the moody deeptoned backdrop paintings set the tone for a bleak war story where youthful passion runs into reality with devastating consequences.".

Joe Hisaishi wrote the stirring score and he had worked musical magic for Studio Ghibli on My Neighbor Totoro 1988 the previous year. The rest of the senior staff brought solid reputations and worked in top form to make Venus Wars a glossily produced welldesigned exciting piece of sciencefiction. The mecha designs are excellent and the moody deeptoned backdrop paintings set the tone for a bleak war story where youthful passion runs into reality with devastating consequences.";

	schema:reviewBody "I remember seeing this title in the Anime section at Tower Records years ago and loosely recall reading about it and maybe seeing a preview or two.So I bought a copy and was very pleased with a very solid story about a colonized Venus that proved to be an allegory for turmoil in the middle east complete with massive fire fights daring heroics and fanatical religious overtones. Venus as some of you may know is world embroiled by a massive greenhouse effect by sulfuric acid clouds creating molten like heat on the surface. This film shows us a terraformed Venus suitable for human habitation. But humans being humans they bring their ways good and bad with them to the worlds they form to call home. There's the dashing loner teenager who races bikes for a living his caring love interest who helps harbor him during times of crisis the spunky and energetic reporter who is also a onewoman video crew and the older and wiser veteran bikers and pit crew chief. Then there's the malevolent and monomaniacal Saddam Hussein type who has initiated the entire political conflagration on colonized Venus. Race scenes battle scenes massive tanks and air ships tracers shooting through the air espionageit's all here. The voice acting in the original Japanese language is typical Japanese marginally over the top but all the while complimenting the film at the same time. The music is okay though I can't remember much of it the translated and dubbed English dialogue is okay but the restraints and compactness of the Japanese language as usual give the English translation a rushed feel nothing new to anime fans or anyone who's seen a dubbed Japanese film.The animation is above normal for a Japanese feature but isn't quite up to Disney specs. Still it's very watchable and entertaining.Nothing deep here. This is a good simple action film with some comments on the situation in the middle east. Good action and battle sequences as well as romance and heroics. If you're an anime fan then give it a shot.Enjoy.".

To me the CGI flicks just lack the artistic soul of good old fashioned anime where talented cell artists drew EVERYTHING. There really is no comparison in my book. If I wanted something that looked like Metal Gear Solid I would just stick with video games. But back to the Venus Wars This is scifi done right after years of terraforming and a comet strike Venus has a breathable atmosphere and can be colonized by man. Unfortunately he brought with him his constant bickering which leads to the inevitable war. A group of motorcycle racers becomes caught up in a fight for freedom from a neighbor turned oppressor. The story is complete it has the small human drama and the highlevel political intrigue. The battle scenes are fantastic and the futurewar machines look incredible. As with most anime this one is geared for the adult audience with violence and swearing but nothing beyond PG13 territory. I have the English language dub version I just don't like subtitles. The actors are great and music is superior. The story is smart and will appeal to the older audience. One outstanding idea is the monobikes they ride onewheeled motorcycles with gyrostabilization. All motorcycles they have follow that basic design. They are used for basic transportation racing and for combat. Far out! All in all you would be hard pressed to find a better scifi anime and I have dozens in my collection. Also check out Bounty Dog Appleseed Vampire Wars and Angel Cop.".

Seems like some sort of group wants to take control of the planet. Well oblivious to this are a group of bikers who are racing and not really worried about the dire situation that the planet is going through. That is until the power struggle turns into a war that engulfs the planet and shuts down their track. They are in lock down and unable to leave their homes thanks to a curfew. Well they decide to fight back and go after a tank stationed at their track. They take it out and end up fighting for a group of rebels that are out to stop this take over. The film is at its best before the group joins the rebel force as the story seems better developed during this stage of the film while the part with them being in the rebel group seems rushed. Before you get the coolness of seeing them do their daily lives the take over and a nice chase scene involving one of the group. There is also a touching scene involving the main boy and a girl. There is also a reporter who is more important during the first stretch. Not that the second half is all bad most of the action takes place during this time and the final fight is rather good too. Just needs a bit more development during the second half and this film would have been super success.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of Tennessee Williams' best plays becomes a good but not great film despite a stellar cast. It's hard to pin exactly why this film doesn't soar but it's a solid screen version. Maybe it's just that the subject matter works better in a stage environment and that the camera is just too intimate.Familiar story of restless son his crippled sister and their manic mother who seems to live in the golden past is great material for the stage. And this sad story of the mother's attempts to goad the son into bringing home a young man to meet the sister seems rather cruel. But even the forgotten and lost can lead lives of desperation as they cling to dreams and make wishes on silver moons.Arthur Kennedy stars as Tom the son who tries to please his mother but longs to escape his dull job in St. Louis and see the world. Jane Wyman is the crippled sister who has shrunk from the world and collects tiny glass animals. Gertrude Lawrence is the mother who was abandoned by her husband and has been reduced to living in a dumpy apartment and selling magazine subscriptions. And Kirk Douglas is the gentleman caller. All 4 actors are quite good although none received Oscar nominations despite the hype. Many great actresses have been associated with the role of Amanda Wingfield since this play made its Broadway debut in the 1940s Laurette Taylor Katharine Hepburn Joanne Woodward Maureen Stapletobm Jessica Tandy Julie Harris and Jessica Lange have all played the role on stage film or TV. And I swear I remember Shirley Booth doing this on TV also.Ultimetaely the story is as fragile as the glass figures. If any one character dominates the story the whole play collapses. This film version works very well in balancing the roles. And while Wyman seems a tad old for the part Lawrence was an even odder choice. I've also read that Bette Davis and Tallulah Bankhead were considered. But how they decided on Lawrencea great musical comedy star in London and New Yorkis anyone's guess. She really is quite good but the film might have need the extra star power of Bette Davis.Anyway this classic American play is worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "The screen output of Gertrude Lawrence was sadly brief and in fact this was her last film role and first since Rembrandt which was 14 years earlier. She never quite registered on screen as she did on stage. Lawrence was terribly disappointed that she did not get to the film version of Lady In The Dark. And a bigger loss was the fact that she did not live to be considered to play Anna in The King And I on screen.According to Sheridan Morley's biography of Gertrude Lawrence the reviews for her performance were not the best. Sadly she suffered under the same handicap that Joan Crawford did when she did the film version of Rain. People remembered what Jeanne Eagels did on Broadway and Joan just suffered with the comparison.Critics and theatergoers remembered Laurette Taylor as Amanda Wingfield on the stage and Lawrence just came off second best. Tennessee Williams was totally enthralled by what she did in The Glass Menagerie maybe his most autobiographical work. I couldn't find what Williams thought of Lawrence but I did find references to her reviews in Morley's biography of Lawrence.I found nothing wrong with her. I along with many others had a lot of problems with the forced happy ending that was given the play. Briefly Lawrence lives with her two adult children and she's a stifling and controlling influence. Son Arthur Kennedy rebels he wants to get out and see and do things and he's succeeded because the play is done in flashback where you see Kennedy working as a seaman. The sea for this Williams's character is a symbol of freedom the way it is with any number of Eugene O'Neill characters.We know already what has happened to Kennedy. His sister is beautifully played by Jane Wyman it's a strong echo of her performance in Johnny Belinda where she plays another fragile character. Wyman is totally dominated by Lawrence who has good reason to be worried that Kennedy is going to leave she gets Wyman to take some typing class where she can gain secretarial skills and support her in her old age. Wyman can't leave the nest though. Her whole world revolves about a series of glass figurines that she treats as living pets her Glass Menagerie. Part of her problem is that she is slightly lame not mentioned but more than likely from childhood infantile paralysis for which there was no cure yet.Lawrence is forever taking about all the beaus she had as a young southern belle not unlike Blanche Dubois from that other Tennessee Williams classic A Streetcar Name Desire. If Wyman won't be a career woman than we have to get her married off.After a lot of pressure Kennedy brings home one of his coworkers Kirk Douglas. Douglas who has great screen charm and sometimes it is used with some of the biggest heels he's played on screen is a genuinely nice person here who even remembers the shy and diffident Wyman from high school. Sad to say he has to let her down even in a gentle way.It's what happens after that is the difference. In the play both Lawrence and Wyman's character are doomed as Kennedy just reaches for his freedom. There is some indication that Wyman may wind up in some asylum. In this film the indications are that Wyman will now have developed some self assurance something Williams never meant for his character.I think Gertrude Lawrence's performance can stand up to others in her character. But the play itself was unforgivably compromised.".

Son Arthur Kennedy rebels he wants to get out and see and do things and he's succeeded because the play is done in flashback where you see Kennedy working as a seaman. The sea for this Williams's character is a symbol of freedom the way it is with any number of Eugene O'Neill characters.We know already what has happened to Kennedy. His sister is beautifully played by Jane Wyman it's a strong echo of her performance in Johnny Belinda where she plays another fragile character. Wyman is totally dominated by Lawrence who has good reason to be worried that Kennedy is going to leave she gets Wyman to take some typing class where she can gain secretarial skills and support her in her old age. Wyman can't leave the nest though. Her whole world revolves about a series of glass figurines that she treats as living pets her Glass Menagerie. Part of her problem is that she is slightly lame not mentioned but more than likely from childhood infantile paralysis for which there was no cure yet.Lawrence is forever taking about all the beaus she had as a young southern belle not unlike Blanche Dubois from that other Tennessee Williams classic A Streetcar Name Desire. If Wyman won't be a career woman than we have to get her married off.After a lot of pressure Kennedy brings home one of his coworkers Kirk Douglas. Douglas who has great screen charm and sometimes it is used with some of the biggest heels he's played on screen is a genuinely nice person here who even remembers the shy and diffident Wyman from high school. Sad to say he has to let her down even in a gentle way.It's what happens after that is the difference. In the play both Lawrence and Wyman's character are doomed as Kennedy just reaches for his freedom. There is some indication that Wyman may wind up in some asylum. In this film the indications are that Wyman will now have developed some self assurance something Williams never meant for his character.I think Gertrude Lawrence's performance can stand up to others in her character. But the play itself was unforgivably compromised.";

	schema:reviewBody "I am a high school English teacher and I have shown clips of all three movies to my classes. By far this is one I like the best. Gertrude Lawrence as Amanda to me is a believable woman. Yes she is garrulous and nags but she loves her children. She kisses Tom and hugs him in the movie. She wants the best for both of her children but they confuse and perplex her. I think her performance is wonderful. She wasn't shrill or over the top like Katharine Hepburn's Amanda in 1976. My students couldn't stand Hepburn nor could I. I am surprised at all the negative comments about Gertrude Lawrence's performance but I still feel she deserved more praise. I think she was really quite wonderful.I also liked Jane Wyman very much as well. Looking very much like Judy Garland in the 1944 MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS I think she turned in a subtle and believable portrayal of a shy and lonely girl. She too seemed real.Arthur Kennedy was really way too old looking to play the part but I did like what he did with the role. Again I believed him as a real character. Whether Tennessee Williams was gay or not and we know he was it doesn't matter for the play to focus on Tom's sexuality. Sure Tom goes to bars and wants to join the Merchant Marines. That doesn't make him gay. Tom seeks adventure and a career as a writer not working in a warehouse. Therefore Arthur Kennedy's version of Tom works for me. I saw the terrific Off Broadway revival starring Judith Ivey a few years ago and Tom was presented in a subtle way as gay looking longingly as a sailor passed by on stage which is not in the script. It worked that way too. A few students have picked up on this possibility and I then tell them that Williams was gay and that yes Tom might be gay too. As for Kirk Douglas I also liked him. He was grinning a bit too much for my taste but I liked his portrayal of Jim. Opening up the play with scenes of Laura attending Rubicams Business College Amanda's enjoying her time on Blue Mountain with her seventeen gentlemen callers Tom working at the warehouse Amanda and Laura shopping in a department store Tom drinking in a bar Jim and Laura going dancing across the street at the Paradise Dance Hall and Laura buying her glass unicorn all added to the film. Remember a film does not have to include only things from the play. It is allowed to open it up and expand on certain things. As for the film's upbeat ending showing that Jim's visit and advice changes Laura it is what it is. It was added to the film despite Williams' objections. It did change his play in a big way and maybe this was wrong. However it was the director's vision to pursue this. I make certain to remind my students over and over that even though Laura has found the courage to change that it happens only in this movie version. In the play and the other two movies made Laura's future is left uncertain. Will Jim's visit set her back more or will it enable her to become a happier and more self sufficient woman? We have to think about it and decide on our own. I have to re watch the 1987 Paul Newman directed version again but I remember thinking it was a good version but not in the same league as this one to me. One thing I did learn from the Judith Ivey Off Broadway revival was how humorous Amanda Wingfield could be played. Yes humorous. We didn't laugh at her but we laughed at the humor she exhibited. Ivey blew me away in the role.Watch all three versions and search some clips of the various stage versions on youtube. Decide for yourself but give Gertrude Lawrence a chance to impress you.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm sorry. My summary isn't really a summary but a strong feeling that kept coming to mind as I watched this film. As Mrs. Wingfield talked and talked and talked and fussed and controlled the daylights out of her grown children I kept having a fantasy of Arthur Kennedy Tom Wingfield punching the garrulous old bat in the mouth! This is NOT a complaint about the play or the filmafter all Tennessee Williams was deliberately crafting a portrait of a terminally controlling and annoying lady. I assume it was a form of exorcisma way for him to let go of people in his past who annoyed him practically to death! As I already mentioned the single parent Mrs. Wingfield is a terribly annoying person. Despite this her two grown children still live with her! You can understand perhaps the daughter living with her. Laura Jane Wyman has a severe limp and has trouble getting aroundperhaps this explains why she never left. As for Tom he's the real puzzler. Unlike Laura he is more open in his disdain for his mother and her annoying ways...yet he eventually does what she wants AND is still at home though he looks to be in his 30s.Throughout most of the film Mrs. Wingfield mostly talks AT her children. In particular she always is pushing Laura to meet a nice man and marry and is badgering Tom to bring home a man for Laura. Although it never was explicitly stated in the film or play when Tom talked about going to the movies some took this to be his excuse to get out of the house and away from mom but I took it to be that he was possibly out cruising for men. Considering this is a Tennessee Williams play being dramatized it's not hard to make this assumptionespecially since homosexuality is a theme in several of his other plays AND since Williams was gay. Either interpretation is valid I think but lead you in very different directions in your thinking.There is a heck of a lot more I could say about the film and the Wingfields though frankly you'd probably do a lot better reading a critical analysis or more indepth summary. Instead let's get to the movie itself. Like the Tennessee Williams films of the 50s and 60s the plays were butchered to get by censors. While this one wasn't as badly butchered as some such as SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH where the castration scene was changed to a nosebreaking scene! the film is pretty tame and they changed the endingmaking it more upbeat! Based on what they were allowed to say and do in 1950 it's pretty good and the performances were excellentthough it is odd that Amanda Wingfield's children DON'T have the accent that she has. I love Arthur Kennedy and Jane Wymanbut were they really the best choices for the roles? As far as the indifference to his mother's blathering goes I guess Kennedy WAS a good choiceas this fits his screen persona pretty well.Overall a well worth watching film but not among my favorite Williams plays. Interesting yes but lacking the spark and vicious interactions that Williams fans have come to love! Plus I deducted a point for the happy endingit wasn't true to the story at all. Tennessee Williams is NOT supposed to make you happy or optimistic!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Glass Menagerie The 1950  out of 4 Excellent performances make up for a slow pace in this adaptation of the Tennessee Williams play. An aging Southern Belle Gertrude Lawrence makes life horrible for her ambitious son Arthur Kennedy and crippled daughter Jane Wyman because of her dreams of what life should be. She hopes to get her daughter married off unable to see her faults and she thinks she has a shot when her son bring home a man Kirk Douglas he works with. I really wasn't sure what to expect from this film after reading a few negative reviews but I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was worth watching due in large part to the terrific performances by the entire cast. I was really shocked to see how well the entire cast handled the dialogue and how easy it came off for everyone. Lawrence really stands out as the overbearing mother who you just want to hate yet she's so annoying that she becomes charming after a while. I thought Lawrence did a terrific job at playing both sides of the coin because you do hate her for the way she treats her children but when the stranger shows up she changes to someone completely different. Just check her performance when this stranger tells her something she didn't know. Wyman is also excellent as the shy and cripple daughter. She too got into the role quite well and made us believe everything about the character. Both Kennedy and Douglas also turn in fine performance and most importantly is how well all four act together. I think director Rapper could have pushed the film a little faster as the pace gets very slow after a while but this is just a small complaint. As with many of Williams' stories this one here had quite a bit cut out to get pass the censors but in the end this is still worth viewing thanks to the cast.".

Instead we have an awareness that Jane Wyman is acting the role of Laura and Gertrude Lawrence is doing her best to tone down her stage mannerisms and give a natural performance as Amanda.Summing up Not the best of Tennessee's work on screen.";

	schema:headline " Lawrence nails her southern accent in this Tennessee Williams film";
	schema:reviewBody "Gertrude Lawrence only made 13 films in her career but she was beloved for her stage performances in England and on Broadway. The Englishborn actress does a fantastic job with her southern accent as Amanda Wingfield. She plays the perfect nagging yet doting mother in The Glass Menagerie. Jane Wyman plays her daughter Laura and Arthur Kennedy is her son Tom. The cast of this first film of the play is rounded out with Kirk Douglas as Jim O'Connor and Ralph Sanford as Mendoza. With this superb cast this may be the best film rendition of the Tennessee Williams story on which the film is based. One drawback is its revised ending that leaves a question in the viewers mind. So what eventually happened to Amanda and Laura? And I agree with observations by some that the effort to make Lawrence appear younger is a negative. Especially when she gets dolled up for the dinner evening with their guest Jim O'Connor.Lawrence was well liked by audiences as a dramatic and comedy performer. Besides the stage and films she played nightclubs and sang. She won a Tony for her starring role in the original Broadway production of The King and I opposite Yul Brynner. But Lawrence made so few films that there aren't many examples of her acting talent available otherwise. This version of The Glass Menagerie may be the best example for movie buffs to see a performance by this fine British star of stage and screen. Lawrence died at age 52 of cancer. She lived a high life well beyond her substantial means and was deeply in debt most of her life.Here's a favorite line from the film. Jim O'Connor Ah when you first meet Mendoza you don't like him. But when you get to know him you hate him.".

	schema:headline " Kirk Douglas's most underrated performance";
	schema:reviewBody "I got spoiled when I watched 1973's The Glass Menagerie the 1950 version didn't stand a chance when I finally rented it. Katharine Hepburn's class Sam Waterston's passion and Joanna Miles's shyness are incomparable. Halfway through the 1950 version with Gertrude Lawrence Arthur Kennedy and Jane Wyman I stopped my curses and comparisons to the taped Broadway performance. I suddenly realized that the earlier version was the original and since it came first it deserved fresh eyes and an open mind. With that in mind I made sure to be less critical during the second half of the movie.The Glass Menagerie is a Tennessee Williams play so it's a depressing family drama about a struggling family in the South in particular a frustrated young man and his overbearing mother. The patriarch has deserted the family decades ago and the young man has given up his dreams to work in a factory and take care of his mother and crippled sister. While in the '70s Sam Waterston played the character as a young man who sacrificed his youth for his family and doesn't want that pattern to continue for the rest of his life Arthur Kennedy comes across as an older character one whose youth has long since passed by. He isn't passionate and desperate to break free he's resigned to his fate but still unhappy about it. It's a very different interpretation from the way Sam played the part but it's equally good. I'm not one to use the phrase apples and oranges but in his own way Arthur does just as good a job as Sam. The way Katharine Hepburn played her character audiences can see how charming she used to be in her youthful Southern belle days. She still retains her class and poise in her old age. Gertrude Lawrence is more beaten down and shabby fitting in with her poor surroundings. Katharine Hepburn is in a league of her own but Gertrude Lawrence does give a good performance.I couldn't really come up with a reason for Jane Wyman's interpretation of the sister character. She hardly seemed shy and she seemed more mentally slow than anything from her wideeyed blank stare at her mother to her sudden fits with no subtle buildup and the variance of her limp. The one person who was handsdown nocontest infinitely better than the Broadway revival was Kirk Douglas who played the gentleman caller. While he has the smallest part in the show and he's given so many wonderful performances over the years I hesitate to say this is one of his best performances but it's certainly one of his most underrated ones. Usually Kirk Douglas is either remembered as a bad boy or in a loincloth. In The Glass Menagerie he plays the absolute antithesis of his usual bad boy roles and he's fantastic. He aces every facet of his written character. He's supposed to be perfect and wondrous and kind the image that comes to mind when one thinks of the bygone name gentleman caller. A gentleman caller is polite amiable clean cut confident entertaining and says nothing that couldn't be overheard by your parents. There isn't a hint of rebellion or seduction in Kirk Douglas's performance and he sets the bar so high no one else can ever hope to play the gentleman caller half as well.All in all this version of The Glass Menagerie is pretty good unless you've seen the 1973 version and believe that's the one and only interpretation. You might want to watch this one first or just keep an open mind after the remake. Kirk Douglas fans will definitely want to rent this and if you really like the story as I do you might enjoy watching every version you can get your hands on.".

The play of course starred the great Laurette Taylor America's number one actress here making the most triumphant comeback ever recorded in the entire history of the Broadway stage. It was her last role. She died soon after the play closed in 1946.The Glass Menagerie was the first Broadway play written by Tennessee Williams who was actually under contract to MGM at the time. As a dutiful employee he submitted the play to the MGM brass only to be told in no uncertain terms what he could do with it. Williams was astute enough to obtain a release  which the studio was only too willing to grant. Following that colossal Broadway season MGM tried to buy back  for 425000  the play they had originally let go for nothing. Williams spurned the mighty MGM's bid.The play was produced by Eddie Dowling and Louis J. Singer. It was directed by Eddie Dowling Margo Jones and Laurette Taylor. Other players were Eddie Dowling as Tom Wingfield and Julie Haydon as Laura. The play had a brief revival at City Centre in 1956 for only 15 performances. A more successful revival at the Atkinson in 1965 chalked up 175 performances thanks to Maureen Stapleton George Grizzard Piper Laurie and Pat Hingle.The movie was not well thought of by the majority of contemporary reviewers many of whom heavily criticized Lawrence's performance as being too overtly theatrical.Montage director David C. Gardner is Michael Curtiz's brother.COMMENT Adapted by Williams himself in collaboration this is a very satisfying screen treatment. True a lot of the action still takes place in the original play set but the expansions are deft and the use of Kennedy as a narrator seems more natural than they were in the play. Not only is he liberated from the stage set but his dialogue has been toned down made less melodramatic  dated 1945 references have been deleted while retaining and to my mind indeed improving the flavor and poignancy of his comments. The rest of the players including Jane Wyman and Kirk Douglas rank as nothing short of superlative. Perhaps Gertrude Lawrence is a trifle too theatrical in expression and gesture at times. Arthur Kennedy of course has by far his best role ever. The theatrical origins of the piece are effectively disguised by Rapper's deft camerawork. Beautiful lighting and photography plus a haunting but unobtrusive music score also help.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm sad to be giving Wes' new film a meagre 610. I mean 6 out of 10 isn't even that bad for a horror film but for a Wes Craven horror film it is a terrible grade. I like Wes' films because of the fact that he can make a simple story psychopath killing people voodoos and zombies terrorists on planes into something complex and interesting. With Nightmare on Elm Street he managed to prey on the fears of adults and children as well as offering ideas into dreams and reality. In Scream he gave his victims and killers modern sensibilities and repeatedly asked are movies responsible for our actions? He shot some beautiful scenes in Haiti for Serpent and the Rainbow and looked at the effects of religion governing politics.So here he is with a movie about souls and fate. The plot sees a psychopath Abel with split personalities loose his grip on normality and go on a killing spree ending with him dying or did he?. On the night that he died 7 children were born including his own son Adam do you notice the religious connotations there? who had to be cut out of his dead mother's womb. Adam Bug and the 6 others enjoy a ritual every year to ward of the evil spirit that they think may still want to murder them for they might just be the souls of the victims of Abel's bad seed. Now at 16 Bug is suffering black outs nausea and migraines and people are beginning to worry that he might have inherited his father's illness. It sure doesn't help that his older sister Leah spreads lies about him to the school out of spite for she feels her life was ruined the night that Bug was born. On the anniversary of the Ripper's death one of the 7 is murdered and the 6 begin to worry that their souls may be tainted.At 96 minutes it is a longer than usual horror movie. Craven fills the daylight with musings of souls and inheritance and the night with murder and bloodshed. Craven sidesteps the horror clichs to an extent allowing his characters to fall prey to inevitability rather than silly choices. It's an interesting idea  imagine you had the soul of a murderer locked inside you and you weren't at all aware. As for the victims knowing that you were meant to die in a repeat incident wouldn't be a comforting thought now would it? Bug is different though. He seems to be a fractured soul the good soul of his father who is gathering the pieces of souls from the victims keeping them from truly dying. As I've said interesting.However in amongst all the philosophy and social pariah fun there are a heap of bad points. Firstly there doesn't seem to be that much at stake. Bug's transformation from meek and innocent to strong and in charge isn't powerful enough to really get you behind him like you would Nancy or Sidney. The deaths of the students although it's meant to be unfair that they were singled out from birth to die aren't shocking and you never really feel that they're fighting to live. Secondly the set pieces aren't at all remarkable and apart from the discovery of one body beside a temple which results in the only real cat and mouse scene there's nothing to really remember or go wow at. Horror needs location it's integral to the feel. Fred Krueger's boiler room in dreamland the town in Haiti Stu's farmhouse with Hallowe'en playing on the telly all were integral to the films. Finally the movie is a bit confusing. The ideas are never fully explored leaving audiences entirely at a loss to understand if it's a by the numbers slasher or something deeper. Bug's unique skill is barely hinted ateven if there are a lot of scenes involving him mimicking his friends and it makes it hard to understand just what he's on about during his confrontation with the ripper. Oh and the Asian dude gets it first.But thankfully Craven injects his film with his own unique ways. On scene involving a bird costume in a classroom is creepier than you'd expect thanks to Craven's expert directing skills. He's assembled a talented cast of young YOUNG actors. Brittany Fang Alex and Bug are well crafted characters who are played believably. The supporting cast of teens do well with their very limited dialogue and characters. He also delivers us a horrific bad guy who grunts more than Leatherface and murders just as violently. Some crackling dialogue between brother and sister and foster mother gives it the feeling of being more than just a horror movie which is what you expect from Craven and a lot of irreverent high school jinx give us some laughs before the carnage ensues.Overall not a bad movie but certainly a mediocre Craven one.".

Well the answer is extremely horribly atrociously bad. MSTT made Shocker look like Citizen Kane. I've seen better efforts at the After Dark Horrorfests and coming from The Asylum on SyFy.MSTT had a script and dialog of the level of some freshoutofsometwobitdramaschool reject not of a nearly 40year veteran of filmmaking. Half the dialog made no sense whatsoever and the emotions of the actors was usually misplaced.While the story had promise the execution failed completely. At first the action seemed forced to get to the central elements Craven was looking for then the resolution bogged down in complete incoherence.Craven can't blame some one else's script or studio insistence on cuts 'cause this atrocity was all his. If this is the best he can do he should retire. He's proved he has nothing left to add to horror.And if my negative comments still don't dissuade you from seeing this atrocity make sure you at least seek out 2D instead of the extra money for 3D because...THERE WAS NO Discernible 3D IN THE FILM WHATSOEVER!!!! Scenes which should have popped out of the screen such as the ambulance crash DIDN'T! It's quite obvious the studio realized what a piece of crap MSTT was and how it would plummet in ticket sales once work of mouth got out so they did postfilming 3D conversion to bilk the poor suckers who went to see it opening weekend out of a few dollars more.The only reason I didn't rate this a 1 is because sadly I have seen worse.

	schema:headline " Poorly written illconceived  lacking in Craven's expert touch";
	schema:reviewBody "The story of 'My Soul to Take' focuses on the sleepy little town of Riverton a place made famous for a serial killer dubbed the Riverton Ripper who sixteenyears prior to the film's events roamed the town eluding the police and viciously hunting down townspeople. Eventually he was caught but never brought to justice. The same night of the Ripper's capture  supposed death seven children later to be called 'The Riverton Seven' are born prematurely  simultaneously in the town. Now in present day Riverton still feels uneasy about the possibility of the Ripper's return even those who believe he's dead. These worries are brought to life when one of the Riverton Seven is found dead sending the town into a panic. Could it be possible that the Ripper is back? Or is there another madman on the loose taking his place on the sixteenyear anniversary of the Ripper's downfall?It must be difficult to release new horror films as Wes Craven or virtually any legendary filmmaker. He started his career with a bang releasing two of the most famous horror films of the 1970s 'Last House on the Left' and 'The Hills Have Eyes.' After that he had success in the slasher subgenre with 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'  the 'Scream' series. Therefore to release yet another slasher it's obvious that there will be comparisons to those important entries in the subgenre. The problem comes about when the film being compared to the classics is let's face it just really not good at all.To start out with the positives on 'My Soul to Take' because there aren't a whole lot the concept is pretty interesting. It has kind of a 'Fallen' 1998 feel to it with the possibility that a killer's soul may have traveled and no one knows whom to trust. There are also some creative elements to the film that had nothing to do with the plot the Condor scene for one that added a nice touch to the entertainment value though none of them are really important enough to have a lasting impact on the film's quality. Finally the acting from the teens is surprisingly pretty darn good. Typically in a film focusing on younger kids you'll get solid or at least superior acting from the adults  subpar performances from the children. Here the kids were actually the impressive ones especially Emily Meade as Fang and Max Thieriot as Bug while the adults were pretty much unbearable to watch.To be fair to the abovementioned inadequate actors they didn't have a lot to work with so that is one excuse they can use to save face. In fact this film had some of the most poorly written stilted contrived dialogue you'll find in a widerelease horror film. Not only were the characters always saying something stupidly embarrassing especially the dumb jock Brandon but the entire third act of the film basically had the killer  victims fully explaining all the secrets of the film like a James Bond villain revealing his plan pretty much assuming that the entire audience is too stupid to understand the film. Add the embarrassing dialogue to the completely convoluted story and this becomes one of the worst scripts Wes Craven has ever worked with. And that includes 'Shocker.' And that's the real issue here. If you don't have a solid script it's almost impossible to have a solid film. This was far from solid. While the story wasn't difficult to understand it did try too hard to be overly complex. It also had a lot of influence from Craven's own previous work some of which seemed like straight repeated elements of his other films. The awful writing also extended to the Ripper himself. Similar to Freddy in the later sequels of the 'Elm Street' saga the Ripper always had some silly oneliner that he grunted out each of which being more unintentionally? hilarious than the last. If you're trying to put forth a serious horror film like this was attempting to be don't make the killer silly. He's the one character the audience should NOT be laughing at.The final gripe to have with this film is the highway robbery that is the postconverted 3D. It was downright pathetic theft. The effects were barely noticeable and completely useless. There was literally almost no difference whatsoever between the 3D  2D nothing flying from the screen no depth to the images nothing. Just another way for the studio to grab another 23 from the theatregoers' pockets.Overall it must be said that this film is entertaining. It's never really boring at all but a lot of this entertainment came from waiting for the next ridiculous thing to happen. It's sad to say but it must be said. . . if 'Scream 4' isn't a bounceback after this film the way 'Red Eye' was after 'Cursed' the future for Wes after his illustrious decadeslong career does not look too promising.Final Verdict 3.510.AP3".

Typically in a film focusing on younger kids you'll get solid or at least superior acting from the adults  subpar performances from the children. Here the kids were actually the impressive ones especially Emily Meade as Fang and Max Thieriot as Bug while the adults were pretty much unbearable to watch.To be fair to the abovementioned inadequate actors they didn't have a lot to work with so that is one excuse they can use to save face. In fact this film had some of the most poorly written stilted contrived dialogue you'll find in a widerelease horror film. Not only were the characters always saying something stupidly embarrassing especially the dumb jock Brandon but the entire third act of the film basically had the killer  victims fully explaining all the secrets of the film like a James Bond villain revealing his plan pretty much assuming that the entire audience is too stupid to understand the film. Add the embarrassing dialogue to the completely convoluted story and this becomes one of the worst scripts Wes Craven has ever worked with. And that includes 'Shocker.' And that's the real issue here. If you don't have a solid script it's almost impossible to have a solid film. This was far from solid. While the story wasn't difficult to understand it did try too hard to be overly complex. It also had a lot of influence from Craven's own previous work some of which seemed like straight repeated elements of his other films. The awful writing also extended to the Ripper himself. Similar to Freddy in the later sequels of the 'Elm Street' saga the Ripper always had some silly oneliner that he grunted out each of which being more unintentionally? hilarious than the last. If you're trying to put forth a serious horror film like this was attempting to be don't make the killer silly. He's the one character the audience should NOT be laughing at.The final gripe to have with this film is the highway robbery that is the postconverted 3D. It was downright pathetic theft. The effects were barely noticeable and completely useless. There was literally almost no difference whatsoever between the 3D  2D nothing flying from the screen no depth to the images nothing. Just another way for the studio to grab another 23 from the theatregoers' pockets.Overall it must be said that this film is entertaining. It's never really boring at all but a lot of this entertainment came from waiting for the next ridiculous thing to happen. It's sad to say but it must be said. . . if 'Scream 4' isn't a bounceback after this film the way 'Red Eye' was after 'Cursed' the future for Wes after his illustrious decadeslong career does not look too promising.Final Verdict 3.510.AP3";

	schema:headline " Wes Craven hits a career low with this lame rehash of his earlier classics but none of their scares nor ingenuity";
	schema:reviewBody "To fans of Western horror the name Wes Craven is something of a legend. This is the guy who created one of the most iconic characters in horror Freddy Krueger in the Nightmare in Elm Street series. This is the guy who had the smarts to turn the genre on its head and give it a new breath of fresh air in the Scream trilogy and come next year quadrology. This is the guy whose horror movies The Hills Have Eyes The Last House on the Left and of course the Nightmare series are being remade by a new breed of filmmakers eager to be the next him. Naturally then the fact that My Soul to Take is Wes Craven's first film in five years since 2005's Red Eye and first that the horror meister has written and directed in fifteen years comes with certain expectations. Indeed all the usual elements of a classic Wes Craven horror are present a small town with hidden secrets from the past a legend that is the stuff of campfire stories and hipperthanthou teen speak but unfortunately this is far from any classic. In fact it probably qualifies as one of Wes Craven's career worst if not the worst. The opening in itself is baffling. A tightly condensed prologue is meant to set up the legend of the Riverton Ripper a family man with multiple personality disorder including a particularly murderous one that has turned him into the town serial killer. He tries to kill his pregnant wife the police rush in and shoot him a couple of times he wakes rather miraculously to return the favour the police fire some more then the ambulance crashes on the way to the hospital and he disappears. Meanwhile on that very night seven babies are born at the hospital. The catch here is this each one of his seven souls has taken over one of the babies so one of them will eventually turn into a murderer. It's best you remember this since the frenzied and convoluted manner Wes Craven tells the story makes it unnecessarily confusing. Fastforward sixteen years later when the Ripper has become the stuff of local legend and a traditional prank played on one of them Bug Max Thierot goes awry and apparently brings back the Ripper. Unfolding entirely over the course of one day Craven spends the first half of the film setting up his seven characters the hot jock Nick Lashaway the sweet hottie Paulina Olszynski the religious chick Zena Grey the token Asian Jeremy Chu the African American blind boy Denzel Whitaker and Max's best friend Alex John Magaro before the start of the blodletting. Sadly none of the characters are any more than cinematic stereotypes so whichever order they eventually meet their death doesn't really matter to the audience. The same goes for Craven's clumsy writing his attempts at witty exchanges falling awfully flat. By the time the Ripper comes calling it's pretty much a case of 'too little too late'. Aside from not shying away from the gore Craven botches any buildup to the climax by piling on the deaths too swiftly. Before any of the characters understand what is going on they have already been offed or are in the process of getting offed. Even the extended climax done the Craven way i.e. several characters trapped in the house with a killer in their midst a la Scream feels derivative and unconvincing. The only consolation therefore is that by the end of the movie you won't get a headache from watching the movie in 3D as folks in the US would have the movie is only available in 2D here. But the real horror is that Wes Craven may have finally after an illustrious career stretching almost 40 years lost his horror mojo. My Soul to Take is a major disappointment from Craven let's just hope he still remembers how to make an audience Scream next year.".

	schema:headline " A weak entry from a master of horror";
	schema:reviewBody "I can't say I've ever been a huge fan of horror movies. There are some  horror films like The Shining that I do enjoy. However I've never  really been a fan of your basic teen slasher film that follows the  formula so expertly skewered in the Scream franchise. The less I say  about the whole torture porn subgenre the better. But then there's Wes  Craven.  I've always thought Craven was a unique vision in horror films. On the  surface his films play like your basic formulaic slasher film. But  especially in his earlier films there is something going on beyond the  surface. The first Nightmare on Elm Street played with notions of  reality and dreamworld. The Scream movies as I've mentioned turned  genre conventions on their ear. I've even given some praise to Vampire  in Brooklyn. I always thought it was an interesting twist on the  vampire tale. One film that both scared the crap out of me and amazed  me was New Nightmare. Craven goes all meta with original Elm Street  scream queen Heather Langenkamp playing herself being terrorized by a  realworld incarnation of Freddy Krueger.  His more recent films have been a little lackluster but I was still  looking forward to well warily looking forward to My Soul To Take  his latest effort. It's also the first film he's made that he also  wrote since New Nightmare. Unfortunately My Soul to Take is fairly  runofthemill in terms of its story and surprisingly tame as a horror  film.  Like his other films My Soul to Take seems like a bythenumbers  slasher film with some supernatural elements thrown in. Seven children  are born on the day a local serial killer is killed. The Ripper as he  is called by media had killed seven people. We find out the Ripper is a  mildmannered family man who happens to suffer from schizophrenia. He  doesn't remember his murderous rampages. When he tries to kill himself  the murderous Ripper takes over. Carnage ensues. Skip forward 16 years.  The Ripper returns and begins killing the nowteenaged children one by  one. The idea is that the seven original victim's souls found refuge in  the seven babies. The Ripper's soul is believe to have taken refuge in  one of the babies as well.  The seven teenagers are straight out of the stock high school character  yearbook. There's the oversexed jock Brandon Nick Lashaway the  pretty girl Brittany Paulina Olszyinski the strange religious girl  Penelope Zena Grey the geeky Alex John Magaro token black and  blind! kid Jerome Denzel Whitaker and the token Asian Jay Jeremy  Chu. Then there's the meek Bug Max Thieriot who has suffered from  horrible nightmare and migraine headaches since he was a child. He's  the weirdo of the group and wow does Craven ever pound on that  particular nail.  The story does make some attempts to connect the events going on with  Native American and Haitian spiritualism but does it in a totally  conflicting way. The true identity of the killer is telegraphed very  early on taking a lot of the thrill out of the film. Also if people  were offended by my labeling the two minority characters as token keep  in mind that Mr. Chu is in the film for just a little over five minutes  before he is shuffled off the mortal coil. Mr. Whitaker fare a little  better. He makes it to the final reel. Here's the thing he is not at  all the part of the story. He shows up from time to time to scare the  bullies away from Bug but other than that HE'S NOT IN THE MOVIE AT  ALL.  Max Thieriot is adequate as Bug the character the movie centres  around. Bug is troubled and as the other teens die he begins to absorb  their souls. At least I think that is what we're supposed to believe.  Bug starts acting all twitchy and repeats things the others said to him  before he died usually with some sort of affectation to his voice. In  any case it's very unclear.  The movie has been the 3D conversion treatment. I don't know why.  Nothing comes off the screen and everything looks dark. Aside from a  means for the studio to jack up the weekend gross due to the premium  for 3D films I can't imagine why they did it with this movie.  One thing about the movie that I did think effective was the knife used  by The Ripper. When I first saw it I immediately thought of Freddy  Krueger's razor glove. It looked mean and nasty and very painful. That  at least gave me a little shudder.".

Mr. Whitaker fare a little  better. He makes it to the final reel. Here's the thing he is not at  all the part of the story. He shows up from time to time to scare the  bullies away from Bug but other than that HE'S NOT IN THE MOVIE AT  ALL.  Max Thieriot is adequate as Bug the character the movie centres  around. Bug is troubled and as the other teens die he begins to absorb  their souls. At least I think that is what we're supposed to believe.  Bug starts acting all twitchy and repeats things the others said to him  before he died usually with some sort of affectation to his voice. In  any case it's very unclear.  The movie has been the 3D conversion treatment. I don't know why.  Nothing comes off the screen and everything looks dark. Aside from a  means for the studio to jack up the weekend gross due to the premium  for 3D films I can't imagine why they did it with this movie.  One thing about the movie that I did think effective was the knife used  by The Ripper. When I first saw it I immediately thought of Freddy  Krueger's razor glove. It looked mean and nasty and very painful. That  at least gave me a little shudder.";

Initially I was excited upon hearing that Craven was releasing another horror film being a fan of the genre I find myself often annoyed with the fact that there haven't been a large amount of extraordinary horror films in recent years. However as I progressed further into the film it became quickly apparent that this would not be an exception by any stretch of the imagination.There are so many bad things about this movie that I can't even begin to describe them. The plot is horrible and transparent the dialogue is egregiously pathetic and none of the characters in the film are likable in any manner. My first reaction upon exiting the theater was that of disgust and not just because of the terrible quality of the film itself but more because of the fact that there is no way for me to go back in time to warn myself not to even consider viewing it. And coming from me this is really saying something because in most situations I can find at least one redeeming quality for a film in retrospect or at least convince myself to not think it was a complete waste of my time. I couldn't think of anything here though.When I first visited the IMDb page for this film the review that was displayed gave the film an 8 out of 10 as well as various snippets of praise. I'm not really sure how any person could feel this is a film that in any way warrants any amount of praise the only logical conclusion I could reach is that they either 1. Have simply never seen any other films before or 2. Work for the studio who created this film and are simply trying to encourage others into spending their time and money on something which is an utter disaster and in no way reflects any of the creativity which has augmented Craven's previous films. My advice is that you save your money or spend it on another selection.".

He's responsible for the revival of the genre back in the 90's with Scream and his movies are genuine classics... but this movie isn't even in the sobadit'sgood territory it's just plain bad.Just a side bar here for a second Wes Craven is the man that made me fell in love with horror the Scream series was the first set of horror films I ever watched and he has been a constant in my love of the genre. Last House on the Left was so scary that I still can't watch it again Hills Have Eyes was hard to follow but scary and kept me going. Hell I even liked Red Eye and Cursed they weren't great movies but they at least had a few good scares and were clearly made with love.My Soul To Take has none of that in it. There's none of the originality that Nightmare On Elm Street had the tension that Wes perfected in Last House On The Left is completely missing the desire to understand the movie I felt when watching Hills Have Eyes is long gone here and the creativity and intellect that was in scream is nonexistent.This movie had nothing good to offer at all.The characters were so forgettable that I can't even describe them even if I wanted too The plot was overly complex and not in a cool Inception kind of way. I can handle complex plots but make it worthwhile... 7 kids being born on the same day as the main villain was killed sounds cool till you realize that it's not that they were born at the same TIME he was killed but the same day... there are thousands upon thousands of people born every day and these specific 7 are the ones he goes after.The dialog sucks plain and simple. When you have lines like No it's not okay what I did. It's not okay for everybody to be killing each other all the time and  Did she tell you not to worry if somebody you thought was dead just might come back alive? If he was evil enough? then there is no way I can take you seriously. No one in the history of the world has ever talked like this in reality these lines sound like they belong in a 14 year olds screenplay that he wrote the night before he handed it in for a school assignment.The scares are non existent I didn't even jump once. Now this could just be that I'm desensitized because I watch a lot of horror movies but on the other hand that is usually the intended audience for a horror flick... people who love the genre. If I'm not jumping in my seat a little when I'm watching a horror movie then there is something wrong there.All in all this movie is not worth your time just hope that Wes does better next time because this is easily his lowest low".

Title regards a plunge into evil without care or any willingness of prevention. We are introduced to a bunch of faceless teenage idiots whose prime importance in this film is to die in horrible graphic methods. Apparently these brats all turn sixteen but it is also the anniversary of the Ripper slayings. According to these nitwits the soul of the Ripper inhabits many victims and they commit grisly acts such as murder or watching a movie this bad. They are killed off one by one but all faithfully believe that the Ripper dwells under a bridge. Wes Craven is a veteran in horror films. He created the original A Nightmare on Elm Street which is perhaps still his best and most creative work. Here he does his best with laughable writing. Max Thieriot plays the obvious young hero who will experience visions that don't include a way off the set. John Magaro plays his much bullied and extremely wayward best friend. Denzel Whitaker is a joke as a blind kid who just happens to appear at a crime scene at just the right time and he too dies. Zena Grey plays the stereotypical religious freak who warns everyone of their evil behavior before she is found with her throat slashed. Everyone here serves one purpose and that is make dumb ass decisions that result in their ultimate doom. The special effects are about the only element that seems ambitious otherwise this film is free to take to any roadside dumpster. Score 3  10".

I was applauded. Avoid this atrocity.";

Unfortunately you soon begin to understand who is guilty despite a feeble attempt to move the viewer's suspicions and their hope that it is not. The film begins to lose consistency gradually approaching the final awful and predictable which finally ruined what could have been a great film of its kind.

	schema:reviewBody "Like most people last year Wes Craven's My Soul to Take was one Halloween feature I ignored. A chance viewing several months ago on TV Cinemax I believe got my interest aroused. Then two days ago I bought My Soul to Take on DVD and having watched the film in its entirety finally this is actually not a bad film.In fact while it's not a GREAT film it is at least interesting entertaining and does have a few good scares and a nice story. It could be argued that Craven is one of the few major horror directors of the 1970s and 1980s who is still actively involved in the filmmaking business and seeing his films get mainstream theatrical releases just take a look at his work on the Scream movies. He's spent the last decadeandahalf on Scream 1996 and its sequels but My Soul to Take is the first film of his in which he's been both writer and director since 1994's New Nightmare.It's also worth noting that this is one horror film that is completely original and not a remake reboot or an adaptation of a previous work.The story even seems to rehash a bit of Craven's earlier A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984 Shocker 1989 and maybe a dash or two of Scream In the quaint little town of Riverton a serial killer called the Riverton Ripper is on the loose. One faithful night he's finally cornered and presumbably killed by the police but not before swearing vengeance upon the town. 16 years later Riverton is celebrating not only the 16th anniversary of the Riverton Ripper's death but also the births of seven youths who were born the same night that the Ripper was killed  the shy and insecure Bug Max Thieriot his best friend Alex John Magaro Jerome Denzel Whitaker Biblethumping Penelope Zena Grey jock Brandon Nick Lashaway Brittany Paulina Olszynski and Jay Jeremy Chu.As can probably be predicted the teens start getting offed in some particularly gruesome and brutal ways. And it does seem eerily possible that the Riverton Ripper has returned from the grave to claim his vengeance upon the small quiet town of Riverton.My Soul to Take the film's name coming from the timeless children's prayer is not a bad film. Is it flawed? Yes? But is it competently acted by the cast and directed by Craven? Absolutely. Craven has always had a way of giving depth to the characters in his movies that are usually lacking in other horror films where characters are just lambs lined up for the slaughter. For example Bug is not some stalwart slashermovie archetype he's ignored by the girls in his school namely his main crush Brittany he and Alex are both the victims of torment not just from fellow Riverton Seven member Brandon but also his sadistic older sister Fang Emily Meade who early on savors her queen bee status at their school is possibly psychotic and yet is a bit of a wimp. The fact that the characters in his films even have depth raises his bar just a little bit higher than the others hence this is the reason why I consider his A Nightmare on Elm Street to be my personal favorite slasher movie ever.A lot of horror movies these days really only seem to concern themselves with savage gore and special effects and seeing how horribly people can be eviscerated on the screen. While Craven does employ some particularly gruesome and bloody deaths here he is more concerned with his story and atmosphere. The movie is effectively creepy from the getgo and true to his style in most of his films My Soul to Take also has an air of mystery surrounding it concerning the boundaries between the real and the imaginary. Is it possible that Bug is the reincarnation of the Riverton Ripper? Does he suffer from multiple personality disorder and is just imagining the horrible things going on around him? Or is something far more sinister at work here?Whatever the answers to these questions are My Soul to Take is a welcome change from most typical horror movie fanfare these days where everything is a remake reboot a savage gorefest or is just plain bad filmmaking. My Soul to Take is another daring entry from horror master Wes Craven.810".

	schema:reviewBody "My Soul to Take 2010  out of 4Wes Craven's return to the horror genre hits with a major thud and turns out to be his most disappointing film since VAMPIRE IN BROOKLYN. The story is a pretty interesting one as a serial killer murders his pregnant wife as well as six other people but after being shot and stabbed he's involved in an ambulance crash. His body is never discovered but it's pretty clear he's probably dead so the community moves on. Sixteen years later the seven kids who were born on the day he died are know dropping like flies so is it a copycat killer the dead man's son the killer himself or perhaps just his ghost? There are many many good ideas floating around this film but in the end it's just way too uneven confusing and at times laughable to really work. I'll start with the screenplay that has a few interesting ideas including the fact that souls can jump from one body to the next. This is an interesting idea and they do a few nice things with it but it really seems like this psychological idea was nixed at some level and some executive cut in saying this was a horror film and needed more murders. The movie for the most part deals with the fears of these seven kids and then we have more psychological stuff about them being haunted and cursed. Then out of no where the film seems to switch on a dime to turn into some crazy slasher where the victims are being torn apart. The psychological stuff begins to wear thin as the story grows more and more out of whack and while the screenplay gets a lot of the blame you can also point the finger at Craven. The first sequence on the bridge actually contains some of that Craven magic where your pulse goes from zero to sixty in a matter of seconds and this expands to an earlier scene where you just know the killer is going to come back to life and although you're expecting it when it does finally happen it makes for a good jump. The problem is that Craven really doesn't handle the psychological stuff too well and this is where the movie really loses its way and in the end crashes and burns. I'd be willing to bet that we're going to get a couple alternate endings when we finally get a DVD release because the ending has so much going on you can't help but feel things could have ended in a dozen different ways. One of the worst sequences in the film is perhaps the most bizarre and it's a big chase sequence in the woods. We start off with a possible sexual assault before things changing up and we're seeing the killer chase two different victims. This scene really doesn't make too much sense and in many ways what starts it seems out of place but not a single frame of this long sequence has any suspense to it which is shocking since we're talking about a Wes Craven film. The performances are about on par for this type of movie so no complaints there. MY SOUL TO TAKE seems to have a lot of interesting ideas floating around but the ideas never really come together and in the end you can't help but feel disappointed. This isn't a horrible movie but at the same time you expect a lot more when Wes Craven is involved.You pretty much have to give this a second review in terms of the 3D. I must admit that I didn't want to watch a Craven film in 3D but that's all that was playing around me. Those expecting stuff to jump off the screen are going to be disappointed and those who put down 12 or more dollars like I did for the 3D are going to be extremely mad because there isn't any 3D. Well there are two small things that jump out at you in the entire movie and the rest of the thing is simply flat. In fact during the movie you can take your glasses off and it's a 2D print being shown. There was one other person in the theater with me and he actually watched the movie without the glasses on. I'm not sure how the studio is promoting this thing but there's no question this wasn't shot for 3D but instead converted to it. This isn't a bad thing but to charge extra money for just a couple quick scenes is a major rip off so for this reason alone I'd recommend people to save their money and wait for DVD or try and catch a 2D screening.".

	schema:reviewBody "Grotesque dull pretentious and derivative horror flick about a schizophrenic serial killer that may or not has reincarnated as one of the seven children who were born on the day he vanished after a violent struggle with the police. The basic idea of My Soul To Take still holds some potential but the elaboration is weak routine and full of rookie mistakes. In fact if the film didn't have Wes Craven's name attached to it it surely would have disappeared immediately to the lowest shelves of obscure video stores and into oblivion. But it is written and directed by Wes Craven and he will forever be considered as a master of horror even though he made four times as many stupid movies than good ones. Especially because Wes Craven has more than 30 years of experience in the horror movie business he ought to know better than to stuff his screenplay like a Thanksgiving turkey with dreadful clichs and stereotypes! He himself parodied all these overused trademarks in the Scream films but now he makes the same damn rookie mistakes like offscreen killings dialogs that appear to be written by failed film students and a stupidly masked psychopath that fires off lame one liners. After the intro which is undeniably the most exciting part of the film My Soul To Take jumps forward to the night when the Riverton Seven the seven babies born the night when the ripper vanished celebrate their sixteenth birthday. In good old Hollywood horror movie tradition the 16yearold protagonists are all depicted by 22yearold actors except for the supposedly older sister who's depicted by a younger actress. Makes sense right? In spite of sharing their birthdays they are a textbook bunch of high school teenagers that hate each other. We have the bully the beauty queen the disposable guys with other ethnics the religious nut and the offbeat loners. Their birthdays has only just started when they are killed off one by one. The murders are uninspired and Wes Craven too obviously tries to make the violence resemble to his megasuccessful franchise Scream. The killer's outfit and knife for example are apparent Scream imitations. There's no suspense or uncanny atmosphere whatsoever not even during the stalk 'n slash sequences in the woods or during the massively overlong climax. Personally I didn't watch the film in 3D but I truly don't see how it could have benefited from this effect. My Soul To Take is a shockingly mundane and forgettable film from a director who has always been slightly overrated.".

Fang Emily Meade is mean girls queen bee and turns out to be something more for Bug.The story telling is too scattered especially in the first half. Bug is the lead and he needs to be in 90 of the movie. All the kids are annoying in some way. The horror story is lifeless. The villain isn't fearsome. The kills aren't gruesome enough. Nothing really stands out. The Fang reveal is pretty good but I never got invested in the characters. Their survival and even their deaths aren't compelling to me.".

Local legend dictates that the Ripper could rise on the anniversary and one of the seven kids born on that day have to drive Ripper back into the river. The seven are blind Jerome Denzel Whitaker smartmouthed Alex Dunkelman John Magaro Jay Jeremy Chu timid Bug Max Thieriot religious Penelope Zena Grey who predicts the coming evil Brittany Paulina Olszynski whom Bug has a crush on and brute jock Brandon Nick Lashaway. Some believe that the Ripper is still alive and then the killings start. Fang Emily Meade is mean girls queen bee and turns out to be something more for Bug.The story telling is too scattered especially in the first half. Bug is the lead and he needs to be in 90 of the movie. All the kids are annoying in some way. The horror story is lifeless. The villain isn't fearsome. The kills aren't gruesome enough. Nothing really stands out. The Fang reveal is pretty good but I never got invested in the characters. Their survival and even their deaths aren't compelling to me.";

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen a lot of horror films in my time. And to be honest? This film doesn't stray far most others in this particular genre. It has very generic characters There is the jock the beautiful girl and the loser. It also keeps up the slasher tradition of a bunch of teenagers getting picked off one by one. Was this film any different from other slashers? Not really. The acting was okay Max Thieriot as Bug was quite good. The other seven were adequate. However Emily Meade as Fang put in a rather poor performance. She showed next to no emotion in scenes that were meant to be quite deep. A big issue for me was the murderer himself The Riverton Ripper. We never properly see his mask up close so we never get a true sense of terror that comes purely from what the killer looked like  Ghostface in Wes Cravens scream series was a great example of a murderer that delivers scares purely based on appearance .The one thing that saves this film from being a mere 34 out of 10 is the idea behind the plot. Okay sure it could have been edited a little better but the idea of the souls of a serial killers victims travelling into the children born on the night he died was good. Then there was the murders if you enjoy gore then you probably won't find much of it here. Out of all the murders the second murder of Penelope was the only gory one as we can see the blood pouring out of her throat.You may as well go rent this movie it's definitely not going to be the best film you've ever seen but I guarantee that it won't be a film to throw away after 10 minutes of watching .Overall rating  610".

I don't like most American comedy though because it's a little too dependent on violence and switching one's brain off. But this movie was so different and so funny! It was silly sure but it was smart and really amusing. I love Steve Buscemi in everything he's in and he was just TOO funny here. I was rolling in the floor.And Campbell Scott was just great I loved how he kept popping up at the most inopportune times. But my favorite part I think was that little bit with the Hamlet play. I've seen productions like this and known actors like that and it was just PERFECT! The archetypical actor who can't fit his inflated head through the backstage door. It was truly hilarious all the way through and I don't know anything about what it could be based on. I just liked it a lot.

I've seen productions like this and known actors like that and it was just PERFECT! The archetypical actor who can't fit his inflated head through the backstage door. It was truly hilarious all the way through and I don't know anything about what it could be based on. I just liked it a lot. But it's not your average American comedy and it might inspire a lovehate response in many viewers. I think it's probably an acquired taste.";

Stanley Tucci directs the new comedy who is one of the creators of the 1995 dramacomedy Big Night. The film is certainly not for everyone. It will satisfy fans of screwball comedies and perhaps fans of someone in the castthey may enjoy it. However I only liked The Impostors because of the laughs it brought along with its wellwritten script. It is not your typical comedy. Now I'm not saying that this movie is great. I am saying however that this movie satisfied me to the point of a recommendation.  The Impostors opens with a hilarious sequence in which the two main stars Tucci and Platt play two out of work actors Maurice  Arthur who play on a silent stage who have serious and comical problems with women coffee and each other. Maurice  Arthur get in to trouble and escape from the police in a boarding box. However while they were sleeping the box was loaded onto a ship carrying an assortment of bizarre passengers that provoke even more laughs. They include a Nazi steward with tight lips Lily the social director who helps Maurice  Arthur a First Mate who is a mad bomber a tennis pro who is aggressively gay an exqueen  in despair entertainer who wants to commit suicide and many more. The films casting was more to my liking than any other movie I have seen this year. The characters fit the actors so perfectly and realistically that I could have been fooled that these people were actually victims of a secret tapping of  Candid Camera. Each of them bring a story to themselves outside the plot. No one character is at the mercy of the script.As for the script itself it kept its cool even as it organized its own extremely complicated chaos. There are many laughs that evolve from hyperactive activity from the assortment of characters because there is such a variety everything feels so fresh in this movie. The Impostors is an opinion based movie. Certain film's don't carry massive plot holes obvious flaws or any other structural or character problem but they don't necessarily bring anything overwhelmingly powerful to the big screen either. The Impostors is this kind of comedy. Whether you find it to your liking or not will totally depend on your taste in comic material in film. I was amused by the picture. Many filmgoers will differ on my opinion though. The individual I screened the film longed for its conclusion and declared this was the worst movie she had seen in her life. I recommend the film but take into account your personal feelings on my review before you make a judgment call. The Impostors might make you laugh uncontrollably but it also may cause you  to turn your head in pitiful despise. Brought to you by Fox Searchlight Pictures.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can see why a lot of people have been irritated by this tribute to 'Some Like It Hot'.  Its theatrical hammery can be absurdly precious its attempts at slapstick bungled its comic situations tortuously contrived.  The film proclaims itself as a farce and yet the mechanics aren't tight enough a hint of studio interference? too many characters and situations are introduced at convenient moments to sustain farce's exquisite suspense surprise and inevitability.  An air of complacent superiority breezes through the whole thing.I loved it.  The film it most reminded me of despite its echoes of Beckett silent comedy and 'Bullets over Broadway' was 'TopsyTurvy'.  There is the same fruity dialogue and opportunity for ostentatious thesping.  The theatrical milieu allows for a suspension of realism  like Leigh's film there is no attempt to faithfully recreate the period rather 'The Impostors' is like a play of the period filmed against a flat background with appropriate signifiers clothes music etc..  This idea that the narrative is not 'real' ie as a narrative is suggested by the closing revelation of the movie set removing a plot full of people playing other people to another level.Of course this kind of closing selfreflexivity this shattering of illusions is pure Fellini and the ship setting reminds us surely of 'Ship Of Fools' that ironically melancholy portrait of a doomed society. 'Impostors' despite the final burst of the carnivalesque is too controlled to be a Felliniesque extravaganza too in thrall to the idea of plot and the way plot reflects the metaphysics of action but there is a variety of character an impulse towards mocking melodrama and the picaresque a feel for the grotesque and chaotic a sheer love of roleplaying and transformation that Il Maestro would possibly have enjoyed.It would be reading too much into 'Impostors' to see the ship and its passengers travelling from Prohibition America to Paris as in any way allegorical  the characters and situations are pure stage types  the impoverished golddigging mother the suicidal divorcee the deposed Ruritanian queen the Teutonic manager the kamikaze revolutionary the lovesick captain.  I don't think they are used to explore a particular political viewpoint or historical interpretation  rather they allow for a wideranging analysis of the conflict between acting and role.The film's impulse is to mock even it's own plot so that resolution is hardly a morally satisfactory dividing of the spoils.  The impostors are shown to reveal the wider imposture going on in all levels of society  acting can both expose the fraudulence and help the miserable and betrayed. They move from being outsiders desperate for recognition from society to critics and exposers of society  typically they save it and are absorbed by it.  The film begins with them disrupting reality with their false cafe melodramatics it ends with them saving marriages foiling revolution. Acting once it's recognised as acting is neutered.There are three great pleasures in 'Impostors'.  First is the acting. Stanley Tucci and Oliver Platt are an adorable couple part Vladimir and Estragon part Laurel and Hardy and Beckett was profoundly influenced by silent comedy  their attempts at acting only further revealing their characters.  The posttheory sexualising of the likes of Laurel and Hardy is intimated here  the impostors share a bedroom they are constantly confronted with aggressive male sexuality they are never considered as a heterosexual threat  but appropriately to the period this is never brought to the surface.They have some great setpieces particularly in the first half the cakeshop the denunciation of Jeremy in the pub their wordy dialogue is deliciously appropriate their mixture of deadpan and ham a treat.  Not all of the cameos come off but Campbell Scott's absurd manager and Alfred Molina's blustery bad actor are a hoot is the Hamlet he plays a defining spirit of the film the anguish over whether to act and be appropriated or interpret and remain free and hungry?.Secondly the filming.  Although most of 'Impostors' is pure farce and there is far too little of THAT in the cinema nowadays there is nothing stagy about it.  The prologue is shot as delightful silent slapstick and the smooth shooting is often broken by moments of disruptive handheld immediacy which provide some lovely epiphanies.  The repetition of key scenes and moments eg all the characters staring into the round porthole like mirrors are expertly done.Best of all is the insanely inventive score beautifully appropriate to the period a pastiche of salon jazz and tango that is witty but also emotionally revealing creating a real sense of romance and nostalgia while silly postmodern things are going on on screen.".

They fall asleep finding the next morning that they have been loaded aboard a luxury liner making them inadvertent stowaways. As luck and admittedly hamhanded writing would have it Bertrom has booked passage on the same ship where he hopes that The salt air will heal my wounds and the motion of the cool green sea will soothe my tortured soul.Arthur and Maurice's presence on the ship is soon found out and with the help of sympathetic cruise director Lily played by Lili Taylor disguise themselves as stewards and manage through luck and mayhem to stay just ahead of Bertrom Meistrich the severely Prussian head steward hysterically played by Campbell Scott and the gentle mild mannered Marco who is charged by Meistrich to apprehend the stowaways. In the process the duo learn that the first mate played by Tony Shalhoub is in fact a terrorist cum freedom fighter of an obscure and unnamed country who plans to blow up the ship and that an American couple Johnny and Maxine thieves masquerading as Parisians are planning to seduce and murder a wealthy widow and an Arab Sheik respectively.Set sometime in the 1930's the tone feels decidedly European with European sensibilities. There is elegance here within the confines of a limited budget. There are tuxes and flower arrangements galore but this ain't Titanic. That said the production design pokes fun at itself in that the bulk of the movie is shot on a static shipboard set that does not resort to the use of fancy lighting gimbals or even water and in place of a green screen uses a cheap to hell with 'em if they can't take a joke painted backdrop. The pace is quick and frenetic energized by the extensive use of handheld camera work. The acting for its part is poured not into characters per se but joyfully and unabashedly into cartoonlike characterizations. And this is not the hallmark of bad acting as some would suggest for the writing allows the actors free rein to deliver in places great monologues in the way jazz artists are given each in turn an opportunity to display their virtuosity in their solo performances. I would suggest that it takes great skill to flesh out such vivid and flamboyant personages.This movie would best be described as a gag movie in that it has the appearance of a string of setpiece gags that are carefully set up and sprung on the viewer. And if the art of humor lies with the delivery than the delivery here is topnotch with great lines joyfully delivered by overthetop characters. It should be noted that in the hands of lesser talent lines such as Meistrich The danger of the chase has made you perspire. It has made me alsomoist. Maxine What are we gonna do with all that cash Johnny? Johnny What do you think baby? Maxine Take it on the lam and scram to some faroff land and lead a life of bliss Johnny? Would fall flat and strike the ear as crushingly hokey. It takes real chops to make material like this work.And the delivery isn't made up just in the acting. The camera has an active part in selling the lines also. To illustrate Marco and Lili are romantically involved but Meistrich who is infatuated with Lili repeatedly tries to insinuate himself in every private moment the couple manages together the camera drawing away abruptly and without warning at such times from an intimate two shot to a three shot revealing the intruder Meistrich. The music helps establish the mindset in the viewer also alternating between delightfully continental Tango music to breezy and raucous Dixieland.And though this is most assuredly a gag movie the bits are not just strewn helterskelter against a vapid storyline. All the jokes become glittering sequins on a lovingly woven and coherent fabric of plot. It hangs together very nicely thank you. However it should be noted that not all the gags work however. The sheer volume of them and the variability of taste in moviegoers would decree that at least some fall flat and for this reviewer that is the case but many more are delightful and more than make up for the klunkers. So why didn't this do better at the box office? And why does it have a ranking of 6.0 on IMDb? It isn't for the craftsmanship technically the directing is firstrate the writing also the acting topnotch and the soundtrack is superb. So the problem is that of taste. For any one individual that person's taste will decree that they are either going to like this movie or they won't. I know folks who to their credit have tried to watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail several times and still can't see the funny in it that tickles others. For myself this one is a gentle joyful froth that does not concern itself with heady examinations of the human condition or the subconscious. Rather it is cinematic playfulness perfect for distracting me at least temporarily from the burden of seriousness that life imposes.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's a scene in this movie where the beloved but downonhisluck singer Happy Franks takes the stage and tells his band leader to play a tender weepy ballad for his opening number. Isn't that a little slow? the band leader asks.That scene pretty much sums up this movie Great performers get on screen and you expect a fastpaced fun time but instead get a slow slow movie.Who to blame? I'm going to have to go with Stanley Tucci. I like Stanley Tucci but I don't think he's very funny. He plays half of the the film's title duo and he's teamed with the hilarious Oliver Platt. Platt is great likable and funny. Tucci is not. His character has no sense of comic timing and apparently neither does Tucci as he wrote and directed this movie. It doesn't have the right pace for a comedy it takes about half an hour to get them to the boat and have the plot start and the things that happen before that aren't very interesting save for a hilarious cameo by the great Woody Allen. Once they get to the boat and the story begins the movie picks up considerably. The cast in this movie is fantastic Steve Buscemi Billy Connoly Tony Shalhoub Lili Taylor Alfred Molina Dana Ivey Hope Davis Allison Janey Isabella Rosselini even the usually stodgy Campbell Scott is great in this. They are all fun to watch even if they're not doing anything terribly exciting.I want to like this movie I do but it's like watching an improvisational comedy class that goes nowhere. All the scenes that would be great in a Deleted scenes section on a DVD were never deleted. It's best when it's madcap and crazy like a Marx Brothers movie but it's just not funny enough to be recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Impostors is a film made purely for comedy's sake. The characters and plot both exist for one reason to make the audience laugh. Films like The Naked Gun and Austin Powers were of this genre and worked for one reason they delivered the laughs. Plot development and sophisticated dialogue play no part in this type of comedy so if the film isn't funny there is nothing to fall back on. In this way a movie like The Impostors must be funny throughout in order to distract the viewer from the silliness of the plot and characters.The Impostors both fails and succeeds in this way some parts are as hilarious as they are meant to be while other parts leave the audience shifting in their seats. The unfunny scenes seem to carry on and on giving the viewer time notice just how silly the film really is. This turns out to be one of the movies biggest problems.Other films of this nature combat this problem by firing the jokes off one after another so that if one joke bombs there is another to take its place. The Impostors needed to utilize this technique more. This is not to say that the film was a dud.  Many scenes and characters are very funny but the bad ones tended to be very noticeable.The Impostors revolves around Maurice and Arthur two veteran actors in Depressionera New York trying to earn a living through acting. Parts are scarce though and the two spend their days honing their skills by acting out 'scenes' with made up characters on the unsuspecting public. After a wild chain of events Maurice and Arthur end up as hunted stowaways on an ocean liner headed to Paris where they become entangled in the lives of the other quirky passengers.The Impostors has the feel of a silent movie every gesture facial expression and action seems to be exaggerated for comedic effect.  Many of the scenes would be funny even without the dialogue. Slapstick humour runs throughout the movie creating that silent movie feel. The Impostors plays out like Saturday Night Live sketches pieced together to form a plot. This method has funny results but when one 'sketch' fails the whole movie suffers.Maurice and Arthur are played wonderfully by Oliver Platt and Stanley Tucci respectively. The two characters weasel their way into the hearts of the viewers from the very beginning just as characters in a good buddy movie should. Platt and Tucci's relationship is based on a Laurel and Hardy model or for a modern reference David Spade and Chris Farley. There are other great performances from characters on the ship. The Impostors has a good cast with Woody Allen Steve Buscemi Lili Taylor and Isabella Rossellini in small one dimensional roles. The funniest performance by far is Campbell Scott in his role as Meistrich the German ship director. Meistrich comes complete with a monocle a scar a thick German accent and the attitude of World War Two General. When he is not hunting down the stowaways Maurice and Arthur his is trying to win over Lili Taylor's character Lilly with hilarious results.The Impostors concludes with the cast suddenly dancing joyously off the set and around the studio where the filming took place. Obviously the actors enjoyed making the movie the performances during the film and the dancing afterward attest to this. In fact it seems they had more fun making the movie than audiences will have watching it. The Impostors makes a good effort but in the end it isn't quite funny enough to pull the whole thing off.".

	schema:reviewBody "As others have pointed out The Imposters is a comedy but it's not a comedy in the A Fish Called Wanda or Dumb and Dumber vein. It's a sophisticated frothy comedy that hearkens back to the days of Bringing Up Baby or Merrily We Live. So if you enjoyed that type of comedy this is for you.Oliver Platt and Stanley Tucci who wrote directed and produced play two out of work actors in the 1930s.

As many of you know it has been unavailable on video or DVD in fact the Gershwin family sought to destroy all existing prints.Yet for some reasonhopefully signaling an end to its opposition the Gershwin family recently approved the showing of a collector's print at the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria Queens. .Well the widescreen Technicolor print was excellent! Not perfect but excellent. The sound was outstanding in roadshow quality stereo. The folks who saw this in its original release wouldn't have seen a much better copy. The program notes include the original Variety review which cautions that people might balk at the steep limitedrelease ticket price of 3.50!And as much as I loved it originally PORGY AND BESS was better than I remembered it. It's just wonderful. Sidney Poitier as Porgy was at the point where his career was just beginning to catch fire and his charisma shines through. Dorothy Dandridge as Bess is spectacularly beautiful. Brock Peters as Crown is aggressively masculine. Pearl Bailey as Maria provides a few comic moments although her role is small. And Sammy Davis Jr. as Sporting Life steals every scene he's in he's especially riveting in his two big numbers It Ain't Necessarily So and There's a Boat that's Leavin' Soon for New York. That last one won applause in the screening I saw.PORGY AND BESS is setbound but it really doesn't matter when the set is as gorgeous as this one. The costumes are also outstanding.Sidney and Dorothy's singing voices are dubbed in but they are dubbed in extremely well. The exquisite Summertime is sung by Clara played by a young Diahann Carroll her singing also is dubbed. Actually only Pearl and Sammy do their own vocalizing.The music is sublime of course but what really struck me this time was how much emotion Preminger got out of the story. People were actually sniffling in the audience a number of timesonce when Bess sings that beautiful I Loves You Porgy. And I got a kick out of the audience actually laughing out loud at the lines in It Ain't Necessarily So. Could it be they had never heard this song before or never really listened to it? I believe that much of the emotional impact of this film is due to Poiter and Dandridge's performancesyou root for their love to win out.A minor quibble with the 136 minute running timeone or two slow spot and a stereotypical AmosnAndy kind of scene about Bess seeing a shyster lawyer to get a divorce from Crown even though she's not even married to him. I would have cut that. And the beginning is a little confusingboth title characters are introduced awkwardlythey're part of the movie before you realize who they are.And I don't think Preminger used a single closeup in the entire movie. It all seems to be shot in 34 which I'm guessing was his way of working with the wide screen.PORGY AND BESS has always been a cult film for those of us who saw it for those of us who loved the soundtrack and for some of us who have only heard about it. Let's hope they find a way to rerelease this and put it out on DVD. It deserves the widest audience possible.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw the opening of Otto Preminger's Porgy and Bess on TV probably some time in the early 80s and my younger self found it a bit slow despite the timeless music. I turned it offLast night an extremely rare cobbled together print screened at the L.A. Cinematheque and it was a bit of a revelation. The performances are strong and memorable. Dorothy Dandridge brings a great deal of vulnerability strength and subtle at least by today's standards eroticism to her part. Sidney Poitier is said to be uncomfortable with the movie but his performance is terrific as is Pearl Bailey. Even better are Sammy Davis as the amoral catlike Sportin' Life and Brock Peters as the villanious bully Crown.Still I'm no fan of Preminger's earlier leaden  and far easier to see  Carmen Jones. Porgy and Bess is far superior to that less controversial film  though that may have to do with the fact that the source material is also far superior.As seen last night this is a sturdy but far from perfect work. Not all of the moments quite come alive and there is some awkwardness in the way the film mixes the overtly stylized Catfish Row set beautifully done by Oliver Smith with actual locations. Also even to my rather untrained ear some brief portions of the score seem unduly popularized.Moreover while this doesn't detract from the achievement of the filmmakers  Preminger's decision to film almost entirely in wide shots with no closeups and occasional medium shots no doubt rendered it unwatchable on TV panned and scanned and may doom it even on widescreen DVDs if it gets the restoration it deserves. On smaller screens we won't be able to make out the many details that are crucial to the way Preminger staged the film.Also the mix heard last night was odd. Many of the vocals particularly on the opening Summertime seemed unduly soft and were overwhelmed by the instrumental music. Perhaps this can be fixed in a restoration.There is the issue of the film's racial politics. Personally I see nothing wrong with it at least in a contemporary context. At the time when so few films depicted strong AfricanAmerican characters this may have seemed an unfortunate choice for a bigbudget Hollywood film. And while there may not be much empowering here these are recognizable human beings that are not racial stereotypes. These are operatic characters who make poor choices because that's what tragic characters do. That alone made it a giant stride forward at the time.In a modern context where strong and heroic AfricanAmerican characters are less rare though still not common enough these characters seem nothing more nor less than human. They truly could be poor and undereducated people of any ethnic background.Thorny politics aside the original work is undoubtedly one of the truly great achievements of American music and secondarily theater. Poitier Davis Dandridge Peters and yes Pearl Bailey were all amazing performers who we'll never see the likes of again. This less than perfect but still solid film clearly deserves to be seen and treasured.".

	onyx:emotionText "I first saw the opening of Otto Preminger's Porgy and Bess on TV probably some time in the early 80s and my younger self found it a bit slow despite the timeless music. I turned it offLast night an extremely rare cobbled together print screened at the L.A. Cinematheque and it was a bit of a revelation. The performances are strong and memorable. Dorothy Dandridge brings a great deal of vulnerability strength and subtle at least by today's standards eroticism to her part. Sidney Poitier is said to be uncomfortable with the movie but his performance is terrific as is Pearl Bailey. Even better are Sammy Davis as the amoral catlike Sportin' Life and Brock Peters as the villanious bully Crown.Still I'm no fan of Preminger's earlier leaden  and far easier to see  Carmen Jones.

It was a bit faded the sound could stand to be remastered scores of frames are missing and it has German subtitles but all in all it was a special treat to see a film unlikely ever to be made publicly available again.But I'm rather mystified as to why the rights are still in dispute. There's nothing overly offensive here neither politically nor artistically. Unfortunately neglect and apathy are probably to blame...  it must be said that while notable the film itself fails to fully communicate the passion of this most American of operas.  It's more of a historical artifact now.The audience was most delighted by Sammy Davis Jr. in a role that seems to have been conceived specifically for him.  Rarely has an actor been so perfectly suited for a part.  Unfortunately Mr. Davis' persona eventually overwhelms the character but one can't be certain if this is due more to his actual performance or to the peculiar place our image of him now occupies in popular culture.Sidney Poitier was 1015 years too young for Porgy but acquits himself nicely though he is dubbed less than precisely.  Dorothy Dandridge is just right but is denied Bess' climatic scene which takes place offscreen. Best of all is Pearl Bailey who gets only a few chances to make an impression but takes full advantage of them.  The scene in which she is interrogated by the policemen is so funny it practically derails the movie.The songs have been pared down some making only a cursory appearance and the staging is static.  These choices commercial in nature rob the film of the power it should have.  Perhaps another movie will one day do justice to the opera.In this Porgy and Bess the portrait of Catfish Row is what is most moving.  This community mourns celebrates together and protects itself from outsiders.  When the detective grumbles nobody lives here it's quite apparent why the inhabitants of Catfish Row would want him to believe that.".

Also closer to the original material  basically all screenwriter N. Richard Nash did was trim change much recitative to spoken dialog and insert a transitional scene or two including a very amusing one for Pearl Bailey. Oliver Smith's production design is stagy in the Li'l AbnerGuys and Dolls '50s adaptation mode but it works well for this work's folkloric unrealistic quality. Stereotyping and racism are present but not to a winceinducing degree. Further for a movie of its time it's pretty frank  the adultery violent behavior drug use and selfdestructive habits of the denizens of Catfish Row are not at all minimized in the telling. But there are debits beginning with all that variation from the stage text. The loss of so much compromises Gershwin's brilliance  no wonder the family doesn't like it. The reorchestration especially of Sammy Davis Jr.'s material is disconcertingly trendy and vulgar. George knew what he was doing folks you didn't have to mess with it so much. And while Poitier and Dandridge act well and their singing doubles sing well there's a huge chasm between the characters' singing and speaking voices  you're constantly aware of the artifice. What really counts here of course is the music among the greatest ever written for the theater anywhere. Despite all the tinkering it survivesand you'd have to be made of stone not to be moved by it. If the treatment isn't entirely to the estate's liking and it shouldn't be there's still no reason not to spend some bucks to restore this ambitious filming of Gershwin's masterpiece and make new generations more aware of his genius.".

Because of social progress since then it is nearly impossible to fathom that my college had only begun admitting carefully screened black students in 1953.  A mainstream highbudget extravaganze with an almost entirely black cast was a distinct novelty in 1959.The movie was given a deluxe roadshow reserved seat presentation in only the best theatres complete with a souvenir program detailing the lavish care that had been taken with lighting and color multitrack stereo sound etc.  Almost every black entertainer that we white people had any knowledge of was in the movie.  Gershwin's music superbly performed and the sheer universal humanity of the story was tremendously moving.I was recently able to obtain a faded copy of a twohour cutting of the film and repeated viewings have confirmed my opinion.  Time has made what seemed steamy sex scenes in 1959 seem quite tame but the musical quality has not diminished.  Sammy Davis and Pearl Bailey are masterful in their portrayals.  What a crime that the young black artists of today are unable to see these performers at the peak of their careers!".

When he told her only use her voice would be used on the soundtrack she reportedly stood up told him where he could go and stormed out.Then Sidney Poitier declined the role of Porgy feeling it too offensive and stereotypical for the late 50s. Story goes that Goldwyn threatened personally to ruin his film career if he refused.Next the film's director was fired over artistic differences and another director brought in. Nothing like keeping up the team's spirits.The new director then turned out to have a professional and personal grudge against the leading lady reportedly bullying and degrading her on the set and leaving her in tears.Then the operatic scoreone that the composer spent two of the most dedicated years of his career working on even down to meticulously orchestratingwas drastically modified. Out went the opera genre and in came musical theaterwith spoken dialog. Two musicians were brought on staff to reorchestrate the composer's masterful work. Was it any wonder the Gershwin Estate was horrified and reportedly tried to get the master 70 mm. print burned? So much for purists' standards. What about the general public? What most people sawand lovedwas the Goldwyn production as an entity itself. Most had no knowledge or appreciation for the above artisticpoliticalbusiness factors. Bosley Crowther wrote in his NY Times review that Goldwyn's PB is truly magnificent . . . should be seen at least a couple of times . . .Well here we are in early 2006 and so far PB is pretty much the sole holdout for video DVD or even theater showings. Only an international film festival and museum aided by a private collector and source from Germany has come to the film's aid.So we have a very troubled state of affairs with the Gershwin Estate apparently holding firm in their loathing of this commercial representation of its American operatic masterwork with which the Estate's entrusted. As for the future stay tuned . . . with the Estate's future comingofage heirs as the potential bright light. Hopefully the print won't be too faded and worn by then for effective restoration.".

	schema:reviewBody "The George Gershwin and DuBose Heyward beloved opera was finally preserved on film in 1959 with Sidney Poitier Dorothy Dandridge Daihann Carroll and Sammy Davis Jr. Or I should say starring Sidney Poitier via Robert McFerrin Dorothy Dandrige via Adele Addison Diahann Carroll via Loulie Jean Norman and Sammy Davis Jr. Of the main leads Sammy was the only one who did his own singing. Dorothy had previously been dubbed in Carmen Jones and if you've ever seen Our Virgin Island you know Sidney can't carry a tune. But given the era making a film with an allblack cast was a financial risk so it made sense that Hollywood would gather their brightest stars regardless of whether or not they could sing.That being said Porgy and Bess is a beautiful film even though half the cast is dubbed. Set in a poor town in1912 South Carolina the sets and art direction manage to both transport the audience to the proper setting and give them the feeling that they're watching a show that used to be on the stage. Otto Preminger chose to capture the film mostly in long shots and long takes adding to the authenticity and continuity for the audience. It's easy to get sucked in from the first scene and the ending will come much too soon. I already knew a few of the songs but even if you don't the overture will get you hooked and you'll hum your favorites after the credits roll.Even though he normally has a beautiful voice and could have easily kept up with the opera singers around him Sammy Davis Jr. chose to downplay his singing in the film. His big song There's a Boat Dat's Leavin' Soon for New York could have been a showstopper but his interpretation was more of a slimy seedy weasel. It doesn't ruin the movie though since everyone else does such a good job.I highly recommend watching Porgy and Bess if you like musicals and operas. I went into it not knowing one spec of the plot I'd seen two fivesecond clips from AFI's 100 Years 100 Passions television special when I was twelve and had wanted to watch the captivating romance in its entirety. I searched far and wide for a copy for fifteen years and when I finally saw it available I watched it without delay not even to read a plot synopsis. I loved it.".

I've read how purists hate it how collectors hoard it and how the Gershwin estate wouldn't mind seeing this disappear off the face of the earth. I've seen videotapings of opera company productions and have found them impossible to interest me. I saw the recent Broadway production and in spite of what a legendary Broadway composer said found it a perfect re tooling. Now the movie one of the last treasures I've been seeking out for decades it seems.I was introduced to the show through the movie soundtrack so to see it and get the visuals is an automatic plus. Then add in most of the cast as well as the director of Carmen Jones and it's another look at the tragic lives of black characters shown every disadvantage outside of being made slaves again. If at all possible Dorothy Dandridge's Bess is even more messed up than her soul destroying Carmen. Bess is a drug addict and alcoholic abused by the murderous Crown Brock Peters and protected by the crippled Porgy Sidney Poitier at the darkest hours of her life. Looking in on this tragedy are the opportunistic Sportin' Life Sammy Davis Jr. the big hearted Maria Pearl Bailey and the hopeful new mother Clara Diahann Carroll with the two women becoming friendly with the now sober Bess seemingly happy and reformed with Crown on the run and finding momentary happiness with Porgy. A lack of closeups on the major players doesn't do the movie any favors but the singers chosen to dub Poitier and Dandridge give a proper operatic feel. Only Davis and Bailey have the Broadway sound.Set direction is incredible costumes appropriate for how even a poor black community would dress for a community picnic. Like Porgy sings you make the best out of what little you have as the best things like the stars in the sky are all free. I don't find thus perfect but available prints are nearly half an hour short. Fortunately what remains is a good majority of the music. It's difficult to judge the direction of Otto Preminger as the print is choppy. What's documented in Inside Dorothy Dandridge indicates that this was not a happy experience for her as the romantic past with director Preminger left her like Hayworth with Gilda as she was thought of as Carmen but was far more fragile than her or Bess. The lack of closeups indicate that time had been tough which adds a bit of needed pathetic vulnerability to her role here. It's a worthy try not deserving of destruction but oh so needing that missing footage.".

And I was lucky to watch it because YouTube deleted it DAMMIT! The film was based on an opera by George Gershwin about the relationship between a crippled beggarman named Porgy and a woman with a disreputable past named Bess in a South Carolina black fishing village.All I could say about the film is that I thought the musical performances were top notch and the story was perfectly dramatic worthy to be on my Favorite Musicals list. So I say it again I really love this movie I still wish the movie was on DVD.".

Even if this does not play in the current time I'm sure the governments have something to say about the events portrayed in the movie so I'm looking forward to any reaction. Meanwhile I can tell you that the movie is really tense and it has everything a good drama needs. You won't be disappointed in that department in case you thought it might drift into a boring depiction of things.Unfortunately there are some filmmaking mistakes in the movie like a film crew that can be spotted during one very emotional scene in the windows that might make you wonder about the professionalism at work here. I hope it does not spoil the movie for you. And maybe with the help of CG this will be fixed though I doubt there is money for that in the budget. Powerful drama with slight mistakes then".

I was thinking this would be a movie providing great insight in the KoreaJapan relationship and Japanese society in general at the time 1997.What followed was a fairly grating 100 minutes. The first half hour was a great introduction to the cast with good acting and camera work especially considering the budget. I kept wondering how everything would work out what the interaction between the characters would result in.Nothing much is what resulted. Besides the family and the childhood girlfriend the rest of the cast barely shows up again. It's a story illustrating how different ideologies and strict national policies are very capable of breaking apart entire families.But it could have been.. more. A lot more is what I think at least. I ended up disappointed no applause was heard at the end of the film and it felt like the people in the audience that genuinely enjoyed the movie could be counted on two hands.I think unless you have a vast interest in the subject or have a personal connection to the movie's contents this might not end up being the movie you were hoping for. That's my honest opinion. I did like picking up on the Korean and Japanese intermingling during conversations but if besides that and the awesome queer Japanese guy being the main things I'll remember of this movie that doesn't say a lot.".

	schema:reviewBody "Viewed at CineMatsuri 2015. Korean Japanese Director Yonghi Yang's semiautobiographical film is a wrenching experience. Perhaps it is the most dramatic Japanese film of this Century so far. It depicts the incurable anguish of Korean Japanese families torn apart by forced exile repaternization to either one of the Koreas at the end of WWII. Koreans brought to Japan during and before the war as well as those born in Japan lost their resident immigration or citizenship status and had to return to their homeland. Events in this movie clearly channel the current status of immigration in the USA. Direction and screenplay are excellent. Pauses which usually turn out to be plain boring in the hands of other directors are poignant and exploited to add immensely to the overall dramatic impact of the photo play. Leading actress Sakura Ando delivers some of the best dramatic acting seen on the Japanese screen today! Cinematography 1.78 aspect ratio color is overly jittery for handheld cameras used exclusively and often distracting. Bolton music occurs during the opening and closing credits. Subtitles do not distort line reading but are a bit on the long side. Only abovetheline names are translated in the credits which seems to be an insultperhaps not intendedto the many others who contributed to the making of this fine film. The audience applauded at the end. Highly recommended. WILLIAM FLANIGAN PhD.".

She is absolutely gorgeous and sexy in this movie and I agree she's the main reason to see this film.James Coburn has a Hard Contract in this 1969 film about a top hit man John Cunningham who's sent to Europe by his boss Ramsey Burgess Meredith to kill three people one of whom Michael Carlson Sterling Hayden was his predecessor in the job. Cummingham is a man completely detached from human emotion he only pays for sex won't kiss and won't let a woman spend the night. While in Europe he meets a beautiful woman Sheila Metcalfe the afore  and oftmentioned  Remick and her group of friends including Adrianne Lilli Palmer and an exNazi. Sheila falls for Cummingham the rest of the group adopts him and before Cunningham knows it he's become for the first time part of the human race. Carlson knows what he's there for immediately and the two have a confrontation. Cunningham has started to realize there's something in the world besides killing.This movie makes a great effort to be deep. It doesn't really know what it is it lacks a point of view but it does convey a message. Some of it is kind of cryptic. I actually thought there were lines of dialogue missing from the version I saw.Coburn is very good as a man who finally realizes he can't avoid living Remick as an outrageous adventurous socialite gives a wonderful performance Palmer as her dizzy friend is delightful. Hayden never a favorite of mine was an unusual man in real life and I think what made him special as a person comes through here. The retired hit man is one who thought a good deal about the meaning of life as did Hayden and found peace within himself. Hayden after his forays into Communism his guilt over cooperating with the committee and his basically going out to sea and writing did the same thing. Karen Black has a small role as a prostitute in the beginning of the film.A really wonderful cast an uneven film a kind of blah ending  still worth seeing for Remick and Coburn in their primes.".

Its biggest fear is that terror and violence have become so commonplace they are no longer the exclusive property of evil. Good may use them too in steadily increasing proportions and soon the two are indistinguishable. But there is also a sense of some small hope here a chance for redemption rebirth.

	schema:reviewBody "Nice opening shot of anonymous people eating hot dogs and hamburgers in a Los Angeles cafe. The camera pans down the faces of the customers each concentrating on his indulgence until it gets to James Coburn who is as absorbed as the others. He leaves walks down the city streets followed at some distance by another anonymous figure. Coburn settles himself down in a seat in a movie theater showing a public service short of starving African children rank with pathos. The other man sits nearby. And when Coburn stands up and walks away the shadower is dead murdered somehow by Coburn. Coburn it develops is a businesslike hit man for the CIA. He doesn't kiss he doesn't talk about himself and he only sleeps with paid women. His affable manager Burgess Meredith has a new contract for him. Two men in Spain and Belgium one of them not yet identified.By this time ten or so minutes into the film it's become clear that this isn't likely to be a stupid decerebrate preparation for adolescents who enjoy seeing action heroes make wisecracks as they wrench off the head of an enemy. Coburn doesn't play the paid killer as mean or abrasive. He's efficient but he can be amused and grin  that Coburn grin full of blinding white choppers. And Burgess Meredith has a conversation with him that's intelligent and perceptive. The conversation is about the history of murder how it's evolved from brute rage to a carefully planned event so precise that you can hardly notice it. This is 196869 and it helps to remember what was going on at the time.In Torremolinos a resort town in Spain's Costa del Sol where his victims are the first thing Coburn does is ask the hotel's manager for a woman for whom he will pay 50. Informed of this three people at the bar laugh and one observes that you don't pay for a woman here because it's all free. The three people at the bar are all rich white Protestants  Lee Remick an American jet setter Patrick Magee as a taciturn German and Lilli Palmer still lovely under that impasto of gook and the beguiling contours of her Germanaccented speech a delight. Remick reveals herself to be a bit reckless and as a lark posing as a whore arranges to be hired for an hour or two by Coburn. He must be some dynamo in the kip because afterward she seems dazed and falls in love with him. I'll never spend that 6000 pesetas she vows to Palmer. Then it gets complicated as all stories about hit men and their victims must.Next stop  Tangiers where Palmer spills the beans about Remick's not being a working girl. The quietly unflappable Coburn absorbs it all and his relationship with Remick becomes warmer. He allows her to spend the night and even kiss him at will. Okay so he's broken his rules but who wouldn't? She's even lowered her price from 6000 pesetas to 3000.I think he offs another victim in Tangiers but I'm not sure. The script is suggestive rather than declarative and the dialog can get elliptical. This is Spain. Anything can happen or not happen or half happen. There's no such thing as a miracle that's what so miraculous. Next stop  Coburn is seated in a cafe in rainy Belgium where he witnesses a tribal altercation between the French speakers and the Flemish speakers later a fullblown riot language as a fomenter of rage. I think he offs another victim. The problem is that Coburn himself is growing disturbed by what his calling has made of him. He's unsure of himself. He seeks out a hooker  and what a event it is set in a gloomy bordello a French dwarf with a mean face as the Madame. And Coburn  the dynamic lover who turns women's organs into pinwheels of delight  finds himself impotent. All men have zat pwoblem sometimes his bedmate assures him.Then  Madrid. For the final victim who happens to be an ex CIA hit man Sterling Hayden once as ruthless as Coburn is now. The white wealthy Protestants also show up in Madrid and it becomes clear to Magee the German Remick the American and Hayden the next victim in line that Coburn is what he is. Burgess Meredith the CIA manager shows up too having been worried about Coburn's commitment to his work. He's a polite and cheerful moral nihilist and as he shepherds Lilli Palmer around the Prado he explains that because of the mass media we've become desensitized to killing others. It no longer means anything. The ending is ambiguous but ominous.I should add that all of this is photographed in classical style. The camera doesn't jump around as if it were being manipulated by some sort of spazz. The foreign locations the gypsy wedding and so forth are all from a comfortable tourist's point of view the sort of perspective Hithcock was fond of. Considering that 1968 marked the florescence of the psychedelic approach to life this is all remarkably soothing. If you glance through the writerdirector's other work this one stands out because of its thoughtfulness and its trust in the audience.".

Supercool CIA assassin John Cunningham James Coburn gets to see the light but it takes John to go almost halfway through the movie for him to finally see it. Being the 1 killer for his country John has nerves of steel and icewater in his veins for blood with absolutely no feelings at all for those that he does in. Just give him a name and location plus a hefty fee and that's all he needs to be motivated to kill someone. On election day John ices a victim in a movie house votes in the local election and spends the rest of the afternoon with a hooker Ellen Karen Black to work off his excess energy that John has a lot of. The next day John goes to see his controller or boss a CIA man who uses his job a physics college professor as a cover James Ramsey Burgess Meredith.This is the big one or hard contract as Ramesy calls it. The hit that can put John in the money and have him retire from the business of contract killing for good. Three hits in three cities in Spain and Belgium with the last victim being revealed to John after the first two hits and he's home free. Going to Spain to get the job or jobs done John runs into a number of people and incidents that changes his life forever. And after those experiences he'll never as much hit kill or murder anyone again! Not even Adolf Hitler if he were still alive and John was given a contract on him by the CIA!Running into American tourist and jet setter Sheila Mecalfe Lee Remick who's also a parttime hooker on the side and her goofy and naive but good hearted friend socialite Adrianne Lilli Palmer John learns that killing isn't right. John also learns that being at peace with the world and himself as well is what it's really all about. By the time the movie ends John throws away his weapons of death and destruction his job as a CIA hitman and his unemotional detachment to the human race and becomes a true pacifist and lover of man and womankind alike!Without going into all the details of what happened to John to open up his eyes to what's good in the world you have to see the film for yourself to really appreciate it. John has a revelation that's truly a miracle. The type that you find in the Holy Bible. John or later Saint John isn't that quickly converted to a good or nonviolent life. He does knock off the first two persons that he was told to do in by his boss Ramsey. Later as the truth about the saying Love thy Neighbor as Theyself slowly takes hold over him John just can't bring himself to knock off the third person former top CIA hitman Michael Carson Sterling Hayden or anyone else for that matter.Carson like his soulmate Sheila let's John in to what's good and what's bad and good as Carson tells him is far far better in fact there's no comparison what's so ever! Carson a more vicious and effective hitman in his heyday then even John is now has become so passive he looks like he converted to become a ultra nonviolent Quaker of Amish! A person who wouldn't even defend himself or his family even if his or their lives were in danger! There's one thing about being a peaceful and nonviolent person but that's going a little bit too far! At the end of the movie even the blood thirsty and murderous Ramsey who's obsessed with killing saw the light. Ramsey flew to Spain to first save John for the insanity that overtook him. A paid government assassin who doesn't want to kill anyone what kind of CIA hitman is John anyway!

In the end we see both John and Sheila and Ramsey and Adrianne romping in the grass as the movie Hard Conract ends.Everyone in the film only wants the best things living in peace with their fellow man out of life instead of the worsttaking one's life which is all that John and Ramsey knew about and practiced. That was until they saw and experienced the truth Which is that it's better to live in peace then to kill each other.

Pogostin enjoys 'deep' prattling conversations about the meaning of life but his metaphorheavy narrative with political and fascist undertones and fingerpointing at the media for making us all immune to the horrors of violence just isn't gripping. The scene transitions often overlap in a lazy dreamlike fashion and the dazed performers are equally as narcotizing.

Lee Pogostin who also directed has plush production beautiful cinematography by Jack Hildyard and lovely scoring by Alex North but it cannot manage an even balance between drama romance intrigue and travelogue. Pogostin enjoys 'deep' prattling conversations about the meaning of life but his metaphorheavy narrative with political and fascist undertones and fingerpointing at the media for making us all immune to the horrors of violence just isn't gripping. The scene transitions often overlap in a lazy dreamlike fashion and the dazed performers are equally as narcotizing. Not a good vehicle for star James Coburn who weighs in once in a while with a villainous mischievous smile but otherwise seems at halfmast. Lee Remick plays his loveinterest Sterling Hayden is a bearded mystery man Burgess Meredith is Coburn's boss and a young Karen Black turns up as a hooker who loves to say I love you. Curious but memorable only because it is so blatantly odd. 12 from ";

First time director   S. Lee Pogostin has a few good ideas but he makes too many beginner's mistakes for the material to succeed. Coburn plays a hitman working for Meredith hired for a job he's not sure he can do. His target is Sterling Hayden who had once been a contract killer himself and they share a wonderful scene in which he tries to convince Coburn to quit. It's a good scene well written and well acted but it has the mark of an unexperienced film maker. There is another good scene in which Meredith moves in on one of the target's relatives and discusses modern violence in front of a Goya painting. A big part of the problem is the film's conclusion SPOILER in which they say that murder is obsolete. This is supposed to be good enough for the audience and Coburn and Remick run off romanticaly into the bushes. What a disappointment! This movie didn't do half the things it could have done. Lee Remick is underused as the love interest and Magee doesn't even have any lines. Should have been better.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember 1969. I graduated from high school moved on to college and was introduced to love both emotional and physical by an extremely charming and voracious blonde in my homeroom. I don't remember this movie being around at all! If I had taken that blonde to a regular theater rather than a drivein and paid to see it back then I would have felt cheated. But today I was introduced to it on AMC and being all these years older now found much to enjoy even if it left me wanting something more at the end.This is the story of a lone hitman considered the best in his field who travels to Europe for a multiple hit job that includes his predecessor and meets an American woman who makes him question his life his job his very existence. Watching this group of fine actors and actresses most of whom are now dead reminded me of a time that seemed somehow cleaner and more innocent and more promising than today. James Coburn as the hit man was at his zenith in looks and charm and it was as if he were playing a serious version of Derek Flint. Lee Remick one of Hollywood's three most beautiful women which includes Grace Kelly and Rhonda Fleming was as lovely as ever and a joy to watch here especially in her peach bra and flowered panties as she masquerades as a hooker! Burgess Meredith was as mischievously entertaining as ever and Lilli Palmer was as flawlessly charming in this role as any of her others. Karen Black a year before Easy Rider and a couple of years or so before Five Easy Pieces appears as a hooker early on and steals the camera's attention in spite of taking off her clothes. And finally Sterling Hayden an actor I've seen often but with whom I've never been impressed gives perhaps the most endearingly natural performance of his career as the retired assassin. The actors are simply marvelous the overlapping dialog as scenes change quite interesting and the scenery is almost as beautiful as Lee Remick. However somewhere along the way this movie loses its direction.As Leonard Maltin says in his review of this film it's more about making a statement than telling an exciting or moving story and though on an intellectual level I can appreciate a movie like that this one seems to blow it at the end. Perhaps it's the casting of James Coburn. After watching two Derek Flint movies time and time again over the years I kept waiting for him to flash his teeth and deliver oneliners. He dispatches one of his victims during a riot and while most of it is off screen you can't help picturing in your mind how Derek Flint might have done it and laughing just a little when the deed is done. When you finally get around to taking the film seriously it starts to have an updated tragic feel reminiscent of Alan Ladd's This Gun For Hire. It seems to have only one way to go. Burgess Meredith tells Coburn that if he doesn't complete his assignment heMeredith will have to assign someone to kill the other targets and Coburn. In the serious world of killers kill or be killed there really is no room for choice. Coburn fails the test reality is ignored and the movie fizzles out like a bad firecracker.I felt cheated at the end the actors and the audience deserved better but I will go back and watch this film again at least one more time if for no other reason than to watch these marvelous actors and actresses work at their craft and remember a brighter and more promising time in my youth. Besides where else can you go to see a young Karen Black take off her clothes and a radiantly beautiful Lee Remick cavort around in her underwear!".

	schema:reviewBody "A professional hitman is sent on a mission to Europe but gets involved with a bubbly sexpot despite his strict code of selfdiscipline.Disappointing melodrama that doesn't come off despite a sterling cast. There's a delightfully sexy Remick a charmingly continental Palmer a mysteriously wacky Meredith and an imposingly sinister Hayden. Plus starring in the central role a wordlessly stonefaced Coburn. But despite this lineup the screenplay is both overlong and needlessly elusive. The key to the murky story I'm guessing is that the movie was made in the late 60's during the 'Make love not war' period. What writerdirector Pogostin appears aiming at is a movie that applies the motto to a professional killer of all things. At least this is the narrative's trajectory even though the details are too often elusive. Much of the obscure philosophical palaver appears to concern just how wrong professional hits are in an era of mass political killing. It also serves I think to soften Cunningham's going unpunished despite his bloody record. Note too how little attention is given to Cunningham's two professional hits as if they're merely incidental to the overall story.Whatever the narrative shortcomings we get a pretty good travelogue of Western Europe as background. In fact it appears Pogostin never shot in the same spot twice which means the camera jumps around a lot adding to the feeling of a disjointed narrative. One way or the other the movie's amounts to a disappointment given the talent involved. My advice is to catch up with a tight little bw gem from 1958 Murder by Contract which shows how the material should be done.".

It's a hitman film without any violence or weapons or blood and a great many pages of dialogue about the nature of violence. How many Hollywood films do this? People watch hitman films to see murder and car chases not to see people talk unless they're Quentin Tarantino fans which is why QT adds those explosions of insane violence after his talk sessions. James Coburn and Robert Culp were two of the most ultracool actors of that time not rebels but showing the streak of countercultural and antiheroantiestablishment behavior that Steve McQueen had. The detached seemingly relaxed selfconfident Coburn fit his Cunningham charactera killer and emotionless sexmachine only banging hookers like a wellfitted suit. Lee Remick brings her own brand of cool sex appealnot brittle or icy but somewhere hovering near that. This might be her most physically sexual role. As the jaded maneating divorce traveling with her friend the attractive middleaged Lili Palmer as a forerunner of what's called a cougar today Remick is able to just use facial expressions to make clear that Coburn has given her the first orgasm of her life. In return her beauty and her spirit make him fall in love with her and unable to function again with prostitutes the only women in his life before meeting her. Both of these hot yet cool women travel with two male companions exNazi and now pacifist Patrick Magee not wellutilized here and elderly Claude Dauphin presumably a former gigolo now playing Palmer's nonsexual escort.Coburn leaves a man inexplicably dead in a movie theater showing a documentary about African orphans he pushes a suitcase out of an airplane presumably with victim 1 or his body parts inside and there's a long shot of victim 2 falling out a window. Coburn glowers at his victims as he watches them and it appears that he kills weaponless with his hands.If this film were made today by the usual suspects as either bigbudget or cablejunk Coburn would kill Meredith Remick would turn out to be a surprise hitwoman and kill Coburn or Hayden and Coburn would try to kill each other in a final standoff. Sorry no dice. There's one moment that makes you think he'll kill the entire cast by driving a stretch limo with all the characters off a cliff. The film bizarrely ends with Palmer and Meredith falling in love and riding off in a donkey cart and Remick and Coburn making passionate love on the outskirts of a gypsy camp turning the genre completely on its head. Pacifism wins as Coburn renounces murder for dollars in favor of love and ultimate sex with a gorgeous millionairess. Happily ever after? The closing iris shot a common editing effect in silent films like a telescopic rifle sight on the couples' heads is yet another ambiguous touch. Will another hit man come for him now that he has quit?It's never clear who Coburn is killing for. His boss Meredith seems to be working for a US spy agency not organized crime. This is never made clear like most of the main points in the story or what the victims did to be targeted. In the late 60s and early 70s Mafia types were often depicted as AngloSaxons Point Blank for example not the usual accented Costa Nostra types. From some of the ambiguous dialog they seem to be connected to the CIA or some other agency.I loved the Flint films and liked The President's Analyst rumored to be based on a third Derek Flint script but when it came to many of Coburn's other films Duffy The Carey Treatment Dead Heat On A Merry GoRound The Internecine Project Waterhole 3 Last of the Mobile Hot Shots Harry In Your Pocket and other not so compelling titles I've always had a difficult time sitting still for them.

Lovecraft to the screen. The acting is magnificent! Carol Lynley and Gig Young are in top form as the bewildered young couple whose arrival in the small tranquil village seems to trigger off a series of bizarre and ultimately deadly occurences. Veteran character actress Flora Robson is genuinely affecting as the strange old lady who seems to know a great deal more than she's telling about the secret that's hidden away in THE SHUTTERED ROOM. Oliver Reed is appropriately menacing as a young roughneck. This one is a little tough to find these days. It's not readily available in video stores and though once popular on late night television they rarely run it on TV. But should you be so fortunate to come across it don't pass it up!".

Within that house at the very top hidden from normal view is a heavily lockedboltednailedchained mysterious room that within contains a dreadful appalling secret!!!Back to the village which appears to contain a lot of backward old yokelshicks putting on dodgy American regional accents  as Lynley and Young appear to be the only actual American actors in it! Also there lurks a gang of country bumpkinish uneducated thugs led by a young and smouldering Oliver Reed. Reed and his cronies take an immediate and intense sexual interest in Lynley and dislike to the monied welldressed big car driving city boy Young.Without spoiling the main plot as one day hopefully the movie may be shown again events progress with Lynley meeting up with her old Aunt Aunt I think Dame Flora Robson who lives at the top of big tower and who makes Norman Bates's mother appears sociable and outgoing! Robson is overseer and controller of what is in the shuttered room that all too soon the overly inquisitive Carol will discover to her and everybody else's cost!The climax to the film is genuinely terrifying well it was when I was 12! and involves the nasty Reed and his cronies pursuing Gig Young in a thrilling driveyouofftheroad car chase through Cornish country lanes as he races back to try to get to Carol.The actual end of the film centres on........on..... well I can't tell you that now can I???Suffice to say many may mock the quality of director David Greene's Sixites flick as typical of the sort of lower budget horror shocker movies that were made in great number then. But I think 'The Shuttered Room' hadhas a lot more going for it than that and if somebody would release it to the world again would even today be seen by many as a wellmade wellacted apart from the accents! and genuinely scary piece of work.".

You'd think that Gig would catch on earlier and keep his wife on a short leash for her own safety. But no...she's always putting herself at risk and even Gig's silly karate skills can't always save her.HP Lovecraft fans will look in vain for the touch of the master since this film is based loosely on a story clapped together by August Derleth best known for picking the literary bones of the Lovecraft estate.This film could have fallen in the same category as WICKER MAN even the look of the film shares some similarities.

Their tenure there isn't made any less comfortable or safe by the somewhat obnoxious antics of the menfolk led by the hottempered and virile Reed though he's eventually put into place in a surprising  and amusing  karate fight with Young.

Many perhaps jaded by Lovecraft's trademark supernatural allusions were disappointed by the ultimate earthly revelation however I hardly think this type of film demanded a monster in the strictest sense of the word  because in any case the script seems to be making parallels between the menace it provided and that inherent in the behavior of aimless modern youth! Another definite asset to the film is Basil Kirchin's score who supplies atypical but highly effective jazzoriented accompaniment to the ongoing suspenseful and melodramatic events.Though the film has been recently released on DVD through Warners as a doublebill with the maligned Golemrelated effort IT! 1966 I had actually acquired this only a little time before its announcement. Consequently the edition I ended up with was not only sourced from VHS with resultant intermittent artifacts but in the fullframe format to boot! for what it's worth the same practically goes for three scifi titles which have also just debuted on the digital format  namely MOON ZERO TWO 1969 PHASE IV 1974 and THE ULTIMATE WARRIOR 1975!".

The explanation for what's really going on in the mill house is not only expectedly startling but also surprisingly poignant. A fun and engrossing fright feature.";

The story is atmospheric and unsettling though the solution at the end resorts to an overused monsterinthecloset explanation which actually slightly damages the whole movie.Young plays a middleaged smoothie who has recently wed a much younger blonde bombshell Lynley. She is amiable enough but has frequent panic attacks related to something or someone that scared the hell out of her when she was still a baby. Young persuades her to return to the small isolated community of her birthplace and to reunite with the old family hoping that by confronting her past she will be able to find out what caused her trauma and get over it. However it turns out to be something rather threatening....The film is nicely paced with few tedious moments. It is well photographed too.  The film has a dated look with fashion music and dialogue very much of its time though of course that would be hard to avoid. However for those who prefer their horror movies with subtle chills and a spooky buildup none of that modern Hollywood gore and special effectswizardry this is a worthwhile experience.".

Director David Greene creates a truly menacing atmosphere that also reminded me of Who Could Kill A Child? for its dreadladen tone.

Lovecraft it stars Gig Young Carol Lynley Oliver Reed Flora Robson and Judith Arthy. Music is by Basil Kirchin and cinematography by Kenneth Hodges.Returning to her childhood home an old mill house on the island of Dunwich Susannah Lynley and her older husband Mike Young are plagued by local rowdies led by Susana's cousin Ethan Reed. Not only that but the local elders constantly keep telling them it would be unwise to take up residency in the old mill...It's funny that some film fans have expressed disappointment with the final revelation of The Shuttered Room because the secret is revealed from the get go! Something which takes the mystery away and goes someway to explaining why director Greene then fills his film with 90 of narrative based around Oliver's Army being uncouth and seriously detrimental to the sexual well being of poor confused traumatised Susannah.Here's the problem even forgiving that it's about as Lovecraftian as a Rob Zombie remake the film just doesn't have the requisite horror substance to make it viable as frightening. Don't get me wrong had I watched this as a boy I'm sure I would have been spooked out by the spooky old mill that houses a secret resplendent with holes in the woodwork where prying eyes watch goings on and most likely be more terrified by Reed's bonkers over acting and Young's transformation into Bruce Lee than the iffy accents I wouldn't have recognised back then. But really the shuttered room axis of the story is very much a secondary item and not even the classy Flora Robson can wring out terror from such clumsy story construction.Still on the plus side there's a unique unsettling musical score by Kirchin a wonderful fusion of progjazz and medieval distortional beats even if it's in the wrong movie! There's laughs to be had though unintentional especially with some of the dialogue being served on a dirty cheese board and Lynley is good value as a troubled cipher. You have to wonder if Sam Peckinpah watched The Shuttered Room and thought he could do better and promptly sought out The Siege of Trencher's Farm novel to turn it into Straw Dogs sensing that he knew he could make a similar themed film more frightening and controversial. But of course The Shuttered Room wasn't meant to be a backwoods Gothic movie involving home invasion and the constant threat of rape. Was it? 510".

He has that captivating aura like Brando but with a more sinister bent.Carol Lynley from 1972's The Poseidon Adventure was in her mid20's at the time and she's breathtaking. It's strange that she's married to Gig Young in the story since he was in his early 50s but it happens.The film features a cool jazzy score.The story takes place on an island off the Coast of New England but it was shot at Hardingham Norfolk England. Although this is a fine location you can tell it's not a New England isle. Why didn't they simply have the story take place in England? Some complain about the revelation of the unseen presence at the end but it worked for me. In fact I found it surprising. I also found it realistic. Real life is creepier than fantasy. That's all I can say without spoiling it.BOTTOM LINE Although it may be kind of boring to younger modern viewers The Shuttered Room works well because it effectively creates an eerie mood has striking characters played by great actors and has a handful of memorable scenes that burn into the viewer's psyche. It's a horror film not in the sense that it's uberscary but rather creepy weird and disturbing.RUNTIME 99 minutes GRADE Borderline B or A".

I must say I was very very impressed with the first ten minutes of THE SHUTTERED ROOM as it insinuates that many blonde bimbos will happily marry a man old enough to be her father  man you dont know how happy for the future that made this 36 year old film critic whos got thinning hair  but alas the films flaws cancelled out my initial optimism .First criticism is the films score .

In fact the cast put so much effort into their crap American accents that none of them manage a half way decent performance . Thirdly the dialogue is laughably bad . When told his neice is outside one character asks  Is she beautiful  ! What ?  youre telling me male residents of this town are only interested in meeting long lost female relatives if theyre beautiful ! no wonder Suzanne was sent away as a child  a fact thats spelled out every five minutes with lines like  I can hardly remember this place before I was sent away as a child  and  I remember you before you were sent away as a child On top of all this THE SHUTTERED ROOM is just not scary . Its been said that HP Lovecraft adaptations never make for good films and this is true . Its also true blonde bimbos will only marry a man old enough to be their father if hes got a big car so Ill have to invest in some driving lessons".

Despite being unavailable for many years on video and never getting a proper release on DVD this movie has a cult following amongst horror movie fans and is a prime example of a good British made horror flick. Fine performances from the leads particularly Oliver Reed  Carol Lynley. As ever Dame Flora Robson puts in a good performance as the creepy auntie who sits atop her watch tower like some creepy old witch. The eerie Norfolk setting works extremely well and adds to the overall effect of the movie. Its worth checking out this film if you can get hold of it or watch out for a TV screening.".

Dame Flora Robson walking away from her lighthouse in her flowing cloak also reminds me of Christopher Lee in the Whicker Man another forgotten movie from the sixties that is now lauded as one of the great British Horror Classics. I wonder where David Green is now. Maybe they should release this on DVD with a director's commentary. after all it seems to have been a big part of a lot of our childhoods. I especially love the dappled sunlight on the windscreen throughout the title sequence which has a surreal quality. I've just viewed this one again on Channel 5 More crap reception for the first time in about 20 years....and am happy to say its still in its own small way a very effective movie".

	schema:reviewBody "This rather slowmoving thriller inconspicuously based on a Lovecraft story there's nothing fantastical about it is surprisingly a lot like the later Straw Dogs until it finally gets to the mild horror content in the last half hour. Carol Lynley and the notably overtwiceherage Gig Young are Americans who return to the remote English village where she's inherited a seemingly abandoned mill and where her parents died mysteriously of course when she was a child. Her vague childhood fears turn out to be grounded in the reality of a sinister presence still hiding in the shuttered room upstairs. But before that manifests itself she is mostly menaced by all the leering rapey local louts. Chief among them is Oliver Reed who as usual in these early roles seems much more vivid than anyone else onscreen and is so detestably sleazy one really enjoys the scene in which Young however improbably beats him senseless. Fitting loosely into the psycho chiller category that flourished after Psycho and Baby Jane this is uneventful for too long and David Greene's competent direction commencing the relatively short period where he made bigscreen features before and after long stretches in TV lacks distinguishing style and atmosphere. Flora Robson is a welcome presence as the aunt who tries to warn our protagonists off though it's hardly an interesting role for her. Lynley as usual is pretty but undistinguished and Young as usual is pleasant in a genericleadingman way. The Straw Dogstype sexual menace of the wife and humiliation of her husband actually continuea lot less graphically than Peckinpah allowed of courseright up until the rather tepid climax in which the secret about the ghoul is finally revealed. The film's only real eccentricity is a score that's much closer to jazz with occasional Indian raga flourishes than the usual suspense fodder this material would get. That and perhaps the fact that it takes a while to realize the movie is supposed to be set in New England when clearly it was shot in and most of the cast is from old England.Anyway I waited a long time to catch up with this and can't say it was really worth the wait. It's not badthere are certainly cheaper and cheesier psychothrillers from the erabut it's not particularly memorable or scary.".

She was never that much of an actress to begin with but she did have a certain charm and she had that slightly raspy voice which gave her a uniqueness of her own. In this movie however her emotional scale ranges from dazed to slightly annoyed.Gig Young is ridiculously miscast as her husband. Certainly he's too old for Ms. Lynley or she's to young for him whichever but they make an odd couple either way.I think I enjoyed Mr. Young's performance the most as he chose to play it practically as if he were in one of those martini living room light comedies. Too funny.Flora Robson turns in her usual good performances even if the words she has to say are ridiculous.And then there's Mr. Reed. Ah yes Oliver Reed. Playing a role he was probably born to play as a Neanderthal boorish thug in incredibly tight blue jeans! I love when he corners Ms. Lynley and licks her ear! Oh baby! The movie starts out promising and seems to strike the right New England Gothic chill note. But within about ten minutes or so the situations start to become ridiculous. The type of thing where you see something on the screen and you start yelling at it and saying things like Why are you following them if they just tried to drive you off the road?!....Things like that.The plot just gets sillier and sillier and looses any kind of scary hold it might have had.But I'll say it again Ms. Lynley was simply GORGEOUS! I kept thinking she'd be great to play Michelle Pfieffer's mother in a current movie! If I had to recommend this flick I'd say have some movie buffs over for drinks and have a great time making fun of this silly waste of time.".

All the violence there isn't much was gone and entire scenes were cut out leaving the story incomprehensible. Seeing it now uncut letter boxed and with no commercials I realized I wasn't missing much. This is based on the writings of H.P. Lovecraft. His stories are scary and beautifully writtenbut have never transferred well to the screen The Dunwich Horror came the closest to doing him justice. This is no exception. It's slowmoving and pretty dull. A few mildly bloody murders towards the end don't compensate for the rest of it. Also it has sequences that seem to be included just to make the film feature length. Do we really need the part where Lynley is sexually threatened by Reed and his gang? Adding to that is that the resolution of the story doesn't make a bit of sense. There's also a dreadful music score which doesn't even remotely match the tone of the film.I give this five stars mostly for the acting and beautiful setting. Reed tries faking a New England accent and failsbut it IS fun hearing him attempt it. His acting is very goodhe's matched by Robson and Lynley. Young is good too but he seems to be wisely kidding the material. There are some nice scenes too dealing with the inhabitant of the house. But all in all this is a failed attempt to bring Lovecraft to the screen. It's really too bad. If they had a decent script for this cast it might have been great. Dull and forgettable.

Mr David Greene has the production in his iron grip and creates a weird not too serious but sickly menacing world which persist from the first shot to the last. The way the actors treat their roles is obviously an achievement of the director  or else some kind of collective frenzy that allows them to create characters that keep you wondering if the actors are doing comedy tragedy or are simply walking through the parts probing them gently. It sounds weird but the result is very naturalistic and very enjoyable. No black and white characters here  there are no concrete outlines to any of them and that's what makes the imagery nicely disturbing and unclear. The main ensemble melts so nicely together that you wouldn't wonder if they all would at one point get together and engage in tons of free lovemaking. This of course doesn't happen. But that kind of tense lovehate balance is really tantalizing plus needless to say that LinleyReedYoung are all oozing a subdued sexuality of real star quality.A very fresh little horror flick with tension galore and a predictably stupid ending which you know from the beginning but luckily manage to forget during the film itself.".

	schema:headline " An interesting Flick";
	schema:reviewBody "Maniac is one of those hard to define flicks. Although it would seem easy to lump this into one category because of the subject matter this is actually a hard movie to categorize. It is not really a horror film and not really a slasher. Sure it has its typical slasher suspense scenes with the random girl running and hiding from the killer and the gory moments are all there but there is something about this movie that separates itself from most of the others of its genre. This in my opinion is typical of Tom Savini special effects flicks from the early 80's. The grittiness disturbing nature of most of those films will never be duplicated. And I am not talking about flicks like Creepshow or Day of the Dead although that one is disturbing I am talking about films like Friday the 13th The Prowler The Burning and Nightmare in a Damaged Brain even though Savini said he never worked on that flick it certainly looks like his style.Maniac is simply about a man named Frank played very well by actor Joe Spinell who was tormented by his mother when he was very young. As a result of this he grew up to be a sick person who murders woman scalps them and uses their hair to nail on to a collection of mannequins. He ends up falling in love with a woman named Anna Caroline Munro and when he sees her he seems to be a normal fellow. This all leads up to an interesting climax.Now the storyline is rather simple but the movie is suspenseful enough to hold your interest. I will admit the first 40 minutes were a bit slow but once when the story starts going more into Franks behavior when he is by himself and then when he acts towards Anna things start picking up.Of course Savini's gore scenes are excellent just like the rest of his stuff. We get to see Savini in the movie himself in a rather famous scene where he gets his brains splattered all over the inside of a car. Though as a gore fan myself this is definitely not the goriest flick I have seen. But after listening to the cast and director talk about the movie I don't think it was meant to be. Joe Spinell himself said that the flick wasn't as violent as a Hershell Gordan Lewis film but was meant to be more realistic and shocking. So when watching this movie it is important to know this instead of going into the movie expecting a real gorefest.I enjoyed this movie but that is just me. Many people don't like this movie but if you haven't seen it yet this is for you to decide. I just hope this review helps out. 710".

Here you get explicitly bloody murders and scalpings plus a showstopper headbeingblownoffwithshotgun murder and a man being ripped apart nightmare and it all looks pretty damn convincing to me.Aside from the effects director William Lustig does an OK job with color schemes especially considering the budget and the grimy sleazy underbelly of New York is brilliantly exploited to give this film a truly nihilistic and seedy feel. The film itself I thought was scary disturbing intense and even suspenseful in parts the subway sequence was especially well handled which is how it should be. Reliable character actor Joe Spinell from TAXI DRIVER THE GODFATHER etc. also offers an effective performance as the sweaty overweight emotionally scarred killer.On the down side a plot would have been nice and it's unforgivable to waste British actress Caroline Munro on such a poorly scripted nothing role. Her beauty charm and smile light up the screen and could have been better harnessed to counteract the ugliness on hand. Anyway the film at least provokes some kind of reaction from its audience.

	schema:headline " Grand Guignol revived for the eighties...";
	schema:reviewBody "Over one century ago 1897 to be exact in the dingy back streets of Montmartre Paris an eccentric exsecretary to a Police commissioner named Oscar Metenier opened the Theatre du Grand Guignol. For 65 years groups of performers staged oneact plays that depicted graphic scenes of murder mutilation and torture. Famous works by authors such as Charles Dickens and James Hadley Chase were adapted for Grand Guignol and made into some might say horrific goreladen masterpieces. People's morbid curiosities kept the shows ever popular all the way up until the Nazis invaded France during World War II. Perhaps because the French population was experiencing true horrors of their own the urge to see such events portrayed on stage quite obviously became a lot less alluring. The theatre never recovered and it finally closed its doors for the last time in 1962. William Lustig's Maniac is basically Grand Guignol for the cinematic audiences of the eighties. A movie that viewers of a quainter disposition will describe as depraved demoralising and redundantly mean spirited while others have touted its story telling as artistic ballsy and daring. Although its often labelled as a formulaic stalk and slash offering it is actually a member of the sub subgenre that differentiates itself from the Halloween and Friday the 13th created format. Along with Nightmares in a Damaged Brain Mardi Gras Massacre and Don't go in the House Maniac offers something refreshing by giving the killer characterisation and making him more than just a loony in a mask with a machete.The plot portrays the life of Frank Zito an insane and stammering psychological mess of a man with more than a few severe problems upstairs. His story unravels around his decent into madness which stems from his seclusion and isolation from the outside world. He is a lonely redoubtable character with no friends or companionship he's just alone with his fragmented mind to torment him. His desperation to feel accepted by civilisation results in him creating his own 'family' from female mannequins. To add realism to their beings and to make them as humanlike as could be possible he furnishes their heads with the scalps of women that he butchers remorselessly. In the first ten minutes an unfortunate prostitute is ruthlessly slaughtered for no apparent reason and the misogyny continues all the way through the movie as nurses models and innocent bystanders are gorily slain for nothing more than the misfortune of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The creepiest thing about these murders is the fact that Zito has no apparent understanding of the results of his actions. He reads headlines which describe the feelings of a city left in fear by his spate of madness and he watches news updates that inform us of the aftermath of his bloodthirsty rein. But his reaction is nonexistent he shows no knowledge of any wrongdoing almost like he is unaware that he commits such atrocities. His mental downfall takes a Uturn when he meets up with Anna D'Antoni Caroline Munro a photographer that attracts his attention for the first time when she snaps him wondering through a park. We finally get to see a thoroughly different side to his character  a romantic insecure personality that's been buried beneath years of selfinflicted misery and emotional torture. There is a constant battle between two separate personalities that rages inside Zito's mind however and Anna's fate depends upon whether the good or evil side emerges victoriously...The opening sequence stays true to its stalk and slash counterparts as the masked heavy breathing Zito kills a loving couple on a beach. Lustig describes the scene as a homage to Jaws only this time the monster is out of the sea and on land thus explaining the beach setting. It's a wellhandled commencement with Savini adding the magic that he is most reputed for and Robert Lindsay's competent photography creates energy that prevails throughout the whole movie. Although body count material is introduced without any characterisation or development it can be argued that the story resolves around Zito and to him victims are only objects or playthings anyway. I have always considered Bill Lustig to be a highly underrated filmmaker. Maniac Cop was yet another great movie although I would consider this to be one of his best  probably because he was relatively unknown when he worked it. The parts that were filmed inside the killer's flat are shot in complete silence which effectively adds to the feeling of seclusion and abandonment. It's like the viewer is inside the character's apartment but also inside his own remote world where his loneliness has degenerated into an unrelenting insanity. It's added moments like these that make Maniac all the more creepy. The subway scene adds some aweinspiring suspense as Frank stalks a nurse through the station. Lustig does well to keep the atmosphere tense and the viewer is always aware that something is about to happen meaning there is never any allowance for comfort in the fact that any of the characters will escape to safety. He also manages at least two effective jumpscares the final Carrieesque jolt being particularly memorable. Jay Chattaway provides a superb score to accompany the visuals and Lorenzo Marinelli's editing is equally impressive.Although you could never call Joe Spinnell a fantastic dramatic performer by any of his preManiac work Frank Zito named as a nod to Joseph Zito the director of The Prowler and friend to Lustig and Savini was undoubtedly the part he was put on this planet to play. It's a convincing performance that allowed the actor to immerse himself deep into something that he had researched thoroughly and accurately giving his character a vivid portrait of realism that was necessary to create the child's nightmarelike quality that the movie possesses. Spinnell is Maniac and Maniac is Spinnell there's no doubt about it it was his signature role. It's impossible to imagine another character actor fitting the bill so perfectly. Not only does he play the part he also looks and sounds it too. He wasn't the only one that hit a career high under Lustig's direction though the everadorable Caroline Munro gave her most realistic portrayal too. Her star had just reached its zenith in 1980 before she became a scream queen in less memorable flicks such as Slaughter High and Faceless which would supplement her income well into motherhood. This also offered a chance to break away from the bikiniclad bimbo roles that she had been given up until that point and it gave her the chance to try something a little different. I strongly respect her refusal to do any nudity which cost a further contract with Hammer in the early seventies. It takes a strong women to reject such offers for the sake of her modesty and Munro proved that she was just that and her career strengthened because of it. It's worth noting that the pair were reunited two years later for Fanatic aka The Last Horror Film which lacked the gritty edge and invitingly sleazy surroundings of its predecessor but attempted to cashin on the fame that Lustig's film had earned from its gruesome reputation.Maniac was filmed on super 16 mm and like the best slashers from this period it was shot for the most miniscule of budgets 'under a million dollars'. A lot of the onlocation work was staged illegally without any insurance or authorised permission. Lustig anecdotes about the exploding head scene no less than Tom Savini's by the way where they had to fire a shotgun through the windscreen of a car and then make a quick getaway before the Police arrived to investigate the gunshot! Munro was given only oneday to rehearse the script before starting work due to replacing Dario Argento's wife of the time Daria Nicolodi. Admittedly it does seem pretty strange that a woman with a name as Italian as Anna D' Antoni would be played by an English Rose but she does a good enough job and is truly a sight to behold. Many MANY countries rejected this movie on the grounds of its unnecessary violence towards women including the censors here in the UK who made sure to add it to the DPP list almost immediately. The Philippines' board of film review was so outraged by what they discovered that they told the producers to take it to Satan instead of their country and went on to describe it as 'unentertaining' and 'unfit for Human consumption'! Of course knowledge of those monstrosities only made it seem all the more curious to youngsters that had heard such tales of unruly degradation and were eager to check it out for themselves thus earning it a massive cult following. Upon release it became immensely popular although it was heavily criticised for its brutal violence. Spinnell said that the blood was never on screen long enough for his creation to be considered too gruesome. He lied  there are parts of the movie that are limitlessly gory and bloodsoaked. You'll find decapitations scalpings and dismemberment  if you can name a gory way to slaughter a female then you'll find it somewhere in here. Maniac is one of the only videonasties that have managed to retain its shock factor even after twentyfour years!I saw an edited copy of this in the midnineties and was unimpressed. Perhaps my attentions were elsewhere or I was expecting something more? I can't be sure but last night watching it once again for this review I found myself captivated. There are flaws yes for certain. It's unlikely that a beauty as striking as Anna would give the time of day to a misfit like Zito in the first place and the end sequence is a little bizarre to say the least. But all niggles are forgiven when you acknowledge the effort that has been put into making this production as realistically as they possibly could. Credit has to be given to Spinnell for believing in the project and his dedication and research into serial killers deserves recognition. I haven't yet seen Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer although I'm told that the two movies have a great deal in common so I'm after a copy right now. Maniac has earned itself another fan and I believe that it deserves to be seen. There has never been and probably never will be another movie so depraved and disturbing so grab a copy whilst you've got the chance. It's an innovative and daring take on the standard slasher genre which succeeds because it is just that.".

It was a lowbudget film with some disturbing violence which many people deemed misogynist TOTAL BULLST because he kills off women here. It's good to notice two of the best murders happen to the fellas too Tom Savini  gets it the worst obviously. But that aside MANIAC is neither the best horror film of all time or most enjoyable but damn is it intense.Joe Spinell is absolutely strong in his portrayal of Frank Zito a real man who has a nasty habit of slaughtering random individuals mostly female ones so he can dress up mannequins with their scalped hair and clothes. This guy isn't Michael or Jason when he bleeds he feels pain. And because he feels guilty a bit over the tragic death of his abusive mother he feels the urge to murder. Frank falls in love with Anna Caroline Munro a photographer who is unaware of Frank's dirty deeds until Frank sets his unrested demon upon her in the end. The ending is bizarre and the love story subplot feels a tad unsuitable although the restaurant scene sets up some exposition including the knowledge of Frank's mom being killed in an auto wreck. But when the gory carnage sets in its realistic and graphic. Most other gore flicks seem timid.The DVD version from ANCHOR BAY is a keeper with audio commentary a documentary on the late Spinell the obligatory trailersTV ads a radio interview pitting the Spinell Lustig and Munro against a DJ who roasts the film despite not seeing it and some more angry comments from the critics in a Gallery of Outrage. Tin box version contains the moody and effective Jay Chattaway film score on CD.".

Well get used to it cause if you're watching Maniac you'll be seeing plenty of sick sht. You might wanna even skip the Suds  Buds. This one will kill your buzz and if you watch it with friends they might expect an apology afterwards.So Frank Zito an absolutely nutty Joe Spinell has Mommy issues. A lot of guys do... they just don't handle them the way Frank does. He destroys women and a couple guy who were unfortunate to be involved with the women Frank had his eye on. He's a creepy dude alright. You see he has this thing for scalps. And as most girls are rather attached to theirs chortle he's gotta take them. So he stalks young ladies till he finds a window of opportunity and then gets down to business.This is pretty much what Frank does with his life till one day he meets a photographer named Anna. For some reason Frank tries to play it normal with her 2 guesses how this turns out. He wines and dines her all the while letting her keep possession of her scalp like a perfect gentleman. Things go swimmingly till Frank decides it would be nice to take Anna to pay his Mother's grave a visit. Frank kinda loses his grip and tries to get familiar with Anna's scalp. Anna thinks the date is over and flees accordingly leaving Frank to stumble home to his rathole apartment and have a total psychotic breakdown and a happy ending is enjoyed by none.... except Anna's scalp.OK so Maniac is not a date movie. This is that special kind of horror movie that exists to make you regret watching it in the sense the it leaves one feeling kinda depressed and dirty afterwards like the other 2 movies I mentioned at the start. Let me state right now that I don't think it's wicked cool that Frank has it in for women. I have nothing but love and respect for women my Mom is a woman. But this isn't a nice movie.Actually it's a very ugly and mean spirited movie. So why the good rating? Cause I can appreciate ugly mean spirited movies. I mean this IS a horror movie right? This isn't mainstream Hollywood horror like The Grudge or Final Destenation where the idea is to put pretty people in precarious positions. This is low budget '80s sleaze. This is from an era when horror movies wanted to make you uncomfortable. And it does just that.The Good Joe Spinell who also wrote the screenplay is uhhh very convincing. As are the effects handled by the one and only Tom Savini. Speaking of Tom he has a cameo in one scene as a disco dude taking a lady down to the docks for a little rub and tug... till Frank shows up and blows his head off one of my alltime fave gore effects really ya gotta see it. Some of the other effects are almost too much to bear.... which is a good thing? Seriously if you're looking for a fun horror movie to watch don't even bother with this. But if you know what you're in for and you're still down Maniac is nasty and truly horrifying.The Not So Good See ugly mean spirited nasty. Some people about 99.9 will wonder how and why this ever got made. As I mentioned above some of the effects are really harsh. The first time we see Frank scalp a girl it's really quite unsettling to the point where if you don't dig stuff like this you might feel sick. It could be labeled misogynistic and irresponsible but I'm of the mind that if you watch this and think it's OK to scalp women your screws were loosening already. Don't blame movies music or books for f'd up people.".

It made me feel uncomfortable while I watched what was happening on screen and very few movies have ever done that to me. The movie follows a psychotic murderer as he wanders the streets of New York City in cheap restaurants rundown apartment complexes and subway stations searching for his next victims each of them savagely murdered.The plot for this movie may not seem very scary but the way the movie is crafted is genuinely grisly and really made me feel uncomfortable. Rather than going from the victim's point of view as they are slashed to pieces like most horror movies tend to do this movie rather focuses on the actual killer himself. We learn about the abuse that he suffered as a small child at the hands of his domineering mother which is presumably the reason he's become a murderer taking out his own personal revenge on other people. The one thing about this movie that was so interesting was how the audience got to enter the mind of the killer so to speak. Joe Spinell gave an excellent performance as the maniac in this movie he portrayed a tormented human very well. There are some very grisly murders throughout the movie all of which are fairly gruesome. But the most disturbing aspect to the film was the sense of psychosis that the killer is experiencing.Maniac is surely similar to Psycho which makes me wonder whether or not the writers of this film were basing the plot on the real life serial killer Ed Gein who also grew up with an abusive mother and suffered psychological problems later on as an adult which ultimately drove him to graverobbing and murder. There are some striking similarities between the story of this film and Ed Gein's life.Overall Maniac is one grisly nasty movie. It displays the psychological torment that many reallife serial killers suffer from and does a good job at it leaving it's audience uncomfortable in their seats. And from what I have seen not many movies do that. 710.".

But it's not long before the real Frank emerges and has a go at adding Anna to his long line of victims.The direction by William Lustig whilst not exceptional does the job it was supposed to do the film never drags and there are one or two edgeofyourseat moments and a couple of nifty scares.'Maniac's gory death sequences by legendary horror makeup legend Tom Savini are real showstoppers and include ultrarealistic scalpings amazing exploding heads and vicious bloody stabbings. The majority of Savini's work on the film is stunning with only the final decapitation being less than perfect.'Maniac' is a great example of lowbudget 80s splatter and will appeal to all those who enjoy their horror down and dirty with buckets of gore.".

Then one day he sees a young photographer named Anna D'Antoni Caroline Munroe and the idea suddenly dawns on him that she may hold the key to his problems. Anyway rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that I was mildly disappointed by the fact that so much of it centered on the mental turmoil surrounding Frank Zito when there were several other characters which could have used more character development. For example in one particular scene there was a nurse played by Kelly Piper who appears and then after a moderately suspenseful chase scene is killed. Now while it was a decent scene it could have been better if some effort was made to allow the audience to identify a bit more with the victim. Same thing with all of the other characters. Likewise although the aforementioned scene contained some suspense the absence of it from the rest of the movie was quite noticeable.

	schema:reviewBody "Gave this one a watch after not having seen it in a few years  and it still remains probably my favorite psychoslasherstyle film. There's a good balance of atmosphere with the brutal violence that makes MANIAC a twisted classic...Frank is a messedup guy that has a big mommyfetish. He goes around stabbing and scalping local New York girls to provide wigs for the mannequins that he lays around his apartment and talks to. He handles himself pretty well socially when he's not stabbing people and even goes on a few dates with one broad that is...until he tries to choke her. Finally Frank's delusions get the better of him...MANIAC is a rare film amongst the typical 80's slasher trash as you actually get a look into his warped mind. Some of the scenes of him talking to his mannequins are straightup creepy and the way that he is shown to sometimes be a very pleasant guy is in strong conflict with his twisted tendencies which is a refreshing way to write his character. There's a good bit of the red stuff for the goreheads out there including several stabbings a couple of scalpings a gory dream sequence where Franks arm is chopped off and his head is pulled off and of course the infamous shotgunheadblast. The level of violence plus a little nudity including a bit of brief fullfrontal makes MANIAC an excellent choice for sleaze gore and exploit fans. Definitely Recommended  910".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't say that Maniac isn't an interesting movie.  It presents itself as an exploration of the mind of a madman in much the same way that the 1934 Maniac did and with about as much candor which is to say none at all. Maniac is undeniably a classic of its type an early80's slashersplatter movie stripped down to its absolute essence. It's probably the purest the cruellest and the most corrupt example of the genre ever to exist on film. In fact it exaggerates the cliches and easy criticisms of the genre to such an outrageous extent that it often seems more like a strawman set up to deconstruct the mechanics of slasher movies than an example of the real thing.  But don't be fooled.  Although Maniac pretends to assume a sort of artistic gravity and a seriousness of intent it's a Hershell Gordon Lewis movie at heart.The film itself consists of almost nothing more than a prolonged series of suspensebuilding setups each of which climaxes in a beautifully executed and lovingly presented piece of stateoftheart special makeup gore.  The special effects makeup by George Romero regular Tom Savini is truly spectacular.  A scalping presented early in the film and a shotgun blast to the head presented later are especially memorable.  Tom is even allowed a small part in the film which culminates in probably the finest explodinghead effect ever presented on film for the special makeup fan it is truly gratifying to see this master craftsman allowed to execute himself in such a fitting manner.  More than anything else it is the gore which has earned the film what little fame or infamy it can be said to possess.All that said Maniac remains an extremely troubling film.  Many of the comments posted here mention its cheapness a description based largely I suspect on the poor treatment the film has usually received in it's home video presentations.  But as made abundantly clear in its recent repackaging as a remastered widescreen director's cut fan item Maniac is anfairly wellcrafted film.  Its pacing is deliberately austere and it very effectively generates an atmosphere of grimy claustrophobic tension.  In its technical finesse and industrial chill Maniac resembles a George Romero movie made by Brian DePalma.  Each shot appears to have been carefully framed and the cinematography is generally fine occasionally even excellent.  In many respects it's an accomplished piece of filmmaking especially when measured against slashersplatter exploitation movies as a genre.  The harsh and grating soundtrack which borrows heavily from the John Carpenter school of minimal synth arpeggios is probably the film's weakest point technically but only if you ignore the acting.In the title role writerstar Joe Spinell turns in an amazingly overblown and dullwitted depiction of a man at war with his own demons.  Don't get your hopes up though.  It's not even good for camp laffs.  The character wobbles back and forth between raving drooling monsterhood and everydayjoeness without justifying the transitions or making either state really credible.  Many writers seem to argue for the validity of the central performance and measured against films like Friday the 13th Maniac may seem like a reasonable and nuanced portrait of mental instability.  In any broader context however the performance is absolutely atrocious. Furthermore the script insists that we accept the villain as a professional artist rather than the janitor or plumber he in every resembles.  The supporting parts are equally underdeveloped and wooden drawing clear attention to the fact that character development is not of much interest to the filmmakers.Joe's performance would be bad enough if the filmmakers didn't insist on placing him in the middle of almost every single shot.  Maniac never strays outside the killer's view.  There is no pursuit no detection no good guys at all.  We the audience know the victims only as the killer knows them.  They exist only as fodder for their own exquisitely rendered death scenes.  Which gives the movie a certain purity and simplicity but exacerbates a repulsive sort of audience dynamic.  The killer is the only real identification point in the movie.  We see much of the action in straight pointofview.  Which could be said to draw attention to the viewer's complicity with the spectacle but this is clearly not the filmmaker's intent.  Instead we are forced to INDENTIFY with the killer. We wait on the edge of our seats for the explosions of blood and agony just as he does.Fundamentally Maniac isn't really interested in much besides the depiction of violence and pain.  Violence and pain appear not as mechanisms by which the audience can be manipulated but as simple ends in themselves. Maniac is the purest expression of the dominant 80's violence as pornography horror film aesthetic.  It delivers extremely strong levels of brutal violence early to set up audience expectations and continues to bring the gore throughout its running time.  Its very capably handled suspense sequences are based not on the classic will the bad thing happen? tension but on a more modern how will the bad thing be presented? tension.  And that's all well and good.  Grand guignol is a big part of the function of the contemporary horror film.  As an audience we know what's gonna happen we just agonize over and at the same time anticipate the precise congruence of knife and girl that will finish the scene.  What makes Maniac so dispicable is the black haze of cruelty and lust that rises off the whole thing.  The film's basic misogyny and frustrated desire are so fundamental to its nature that it seems almost pointless to mention or criticize them.It's this pitiless leering quality that makes the movie so uncomfortable to watch or enjoy in any traditional sense.  With many Italian ZombieCannibal films of the same era most notably Ruggereo Deodato's The House at the Edge of the Park and Cannibal Holocaust it shares a quality of prurient moralism that is extremely queasy at heart.  The film seems to glower down on the atrocities it presents with a sort of cold puritanism but ultimately cannot conceal the glee and fetishized sexuality in it's gaze.  What's more it seems totally unaware that such issues might even be considered unlike Cannibal Holocaust which exploits issues of viewer culpability for cheap effect.  Maniac is an extremely selfconscious movie that remains somehow utterly unaware of its own psychodynamics.  An ugly witless and nearly inhuman piece of work. For reference see Man Bites Dog which exploits viewer culpability to great effect. caveat I admit that these criticisms will seem tediously familiar to anyone who has followed the progress of the horror film over the past thirty years. These are not new arguments and perhaps not interesting ones.  Please keep in mind though that this review was written by someone who LOVES horror movies and gore flicks but who fing loathes slasher movies and the depiction of suffering for entertainment's sake.  Most horror fans probably wouldn't find Maniac as distasteful as I did.   I'm not arguing that movies make people kill.  I don't hate horror movies.  I don't hate gore.  I just hate this movie.".

	schema:headline " Sick gore quickie";
	schema:reviewBody "This sick quickie earned its notoriety thanks to its high gore content taking bloody special effects to a new sickening level of realism thanks to the work of master craftsman Tom Savini. Other than the gore it's a grim onthestreet style film brought to gritty life by director William Lustig a major film fan himself. It often recalls other films like TAXI DRIVER a film in which Spinell had a bit part in its depiction of a New York filled with litter sleaze and lowlives and it has to be said that this is a depressing nonentertaining ride through some of the lowest quarters imaginable.The plot is routine a series of murders as in a slasher film interspersed with disturbing moments inside Frank Zito's flat where he talks to his dead mother and imagines that the mannequins around him are real people. It certainly is a sick film one for those with strong stomachs only Savini outdoes himself with the gore here from graphic impalings to throat slashings garrottings and stabbings. The film is also notorious for a head explosion by shotgun blast Savini contrived to pull the trigger and shoot himself in a small role as Disco Boy which is more graphic than the one in SCANNERS! Yet the worst bits are the scalpings played out in excruciating slow motion as we get to see every detail as Zito slices the hair off his victims with a straight razor. Spinell sweats and grimaces as the disturbed psychopath haunted by memories of childhood torture at the hands of his mother. Yet he also provokes pathos thanks to his plight and you end up feeling sorry for this monster despite the horrendous acts he commits. Although Spinell starred in many productions this will forever be remembered as his most defining moment. The only other star name is glamour queen Caroline Munro who reteams with Spinell after Italian scifi epic STARCRASH. Munro isn't much of an actress but she is pretty so her relationship with Spinell is the result of a bit of artistic license I think. The film is full of tension and suspense with the highlight being the lengthy stalking of a nurse which literally had me on the edge of my seat throughout fingernailbiting stuff. Things are definitely weird at the finale where there's a scare copied from CARRIE and a final mutilation which looks to have been copied in DAY OF THE DEAD.".

The story is pretty simple and the dramatic side of things especially plotwise is not all too strong but 'Maniac' is superior in gore and New York atmosphere and the crazy lead played by Joe Spinell is just about perfect.Straight away William Lustig presents us with a darkblueish opening on a beach where our killer begins his bloody rampage. There are no cops here trying to solve the case we are to simply make do with the actions and psychotic ramblings of a deeply troubled man mommy issues on the prowl for the perfect wig to fit on a new mannequin. Each kill scene is a classic Spinell seems to just 'become' the crazy man with a knack for fooling some of his victims perfectly and in the end we are presented with a fantastic apotheosis  and thn the cops come along.Very fine piece of exploitation cult  9 out of 10.".

The story is pretty simple and the dramatic side of things especially plotwise is not all too strong but 'Maniac' is superior in gore and New York atmosphere and the crazy lead played by Joe Spinell is just about perfect.Straight away William Lustig presents us with a darkblueish opening on a beach where our killer begins his bloody rampage. There are no cops here trying to solve the case we are to simply make do with the actions and psychotic ramblings of a deeply troubled man mommy issues on the prowl for the perfect wig to fit on a new mannequin. Each kill scene is a classic Spinell seems to just 'become' the crazy man with a knack for fooling some of his victims perfectly and in the end we are presented with a fantastic apotheosis  and thn the cops come along.Very fine piece of exploitation cult  9 out of 10.";

Or the almost unbearable tension during the stalking of Rita scene and how Jay Chattaway's drones reach into your guts and tug on your intestines. If Halloween was a masterpiece of framing Maniac was a tourdeforce of the use of sound. The setpieces remain the most brutally nihilistic ever captured in an American release. The excesses of Saw and Hostel pale in comparison to the marriage of aesthetic and subject matter in Lustig's film. The site of an obese sweaty pockmarked Spinell scalping the corpse of a victim is almost as disturbing as what we might guess he does to the mannequins he nails the scalps to when the camera is off.Almost 30 years later Maniac remains the gold standard for brutal exploitation cinema.".

Indeed for the first half hour the film creates a shockingly claustrophobic scenario in which Frank is the only real character in the film and the others are all introduced to serve merely as his victims.  This structure makes for some powerful viewing because Frank's worldview is so claustrophobic and stifling that we almost literally feel his isolation weighing down upon us.The film loses its power when it creates a semitraditonal love interest for Frank.  Inevitably this opens up the film by allowing us to assume a perspective other than Frank's at various times throughout the remainder of the film.  Though this does come as a sort of emotional relief for the viewer it also diminishes most of the tension that the stellar first half hour so completely creates.Were it not for this copout Maniac would be one of those rare films that while being nearly unwatchably upsetting is also a brilliantly moving film. Indeed many of the camera angles used as well as Spinell's terrific performance lend this film more credibility than it deserves. In summary the film starts out as emotionally raw and brutal as Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer or Peeping Tom but about half way through the film it relents and becomes more generic slasher fare.  All serious analysis aside however Savii's work on this film has to be seen to be believed.  Gorehounds can't afford to miss it.".

You see Frank has a big problem with women  resents them so he kills them simple. Besides killing them he scalps them  places the scalp on a store window mannequin inside his apartment  he has amassed quite a collection. He then falls for sexy photographer Anna D'Antoni Caroline Munro but the fact that he is a brutal serial killer of women is sure to cause problems in the relationship eventually...This notorious 80's sleazy gore flick was directed by William Lustig surely the man who has directed the most films with the word 'Maniac' in the title since he also directed all the Maniac Cop trilogy who has a small cameo at the start as he plays the hotel manager  if we are all totally honest Maniac would be virtually unknown  almost certainly have disappeared into obscurity if it were not for the aforementioned gory  sometimes disturbing special makeup effects courtesy of the main man Tom Savini who also plays the dude who gets his head blown off to save having to mould another fake head presumably since Savini had a fake head of himself lying around anyway. Maniac was a difficult film for me to rate  judge  I am still not sure whether I should give it a six or seven out of ten on the one hand you have one of the most threadbare films I have ever seen with virtually no plot whatsoever yet it's undeniably effective  those gore effects are just terrific if your into that sort of thing which I am. There are no character's beyond Frank  Anna who barely features anyway Frank has the whole Psycho 1960 thing going on as he has been left mentally scared by his late abusive Mother just like Norman Bates  as such has a misogynistic attitude towards women  likes to kill  scalp them in his spare time. That's the whole plot. Seriously beyond a shallow relationship between Frank  Anna  his killing if women nothing else happens in Maniac nothing. At just under 90 odd minutes the pace is alright there's enough gore  horror to satisfy the exploitation crowd  it is oddly watchable but when all said  done there's just not enough to it to justify 90 minutes of most people's time.The film definitely has a sleazy seedy feel  atmosphere to it those graffiti covered toilets in that New York subway are enough to give anyone nightmares. I wouldn't have liked to take a crap in one of those late at night that's for sure! The whole 80's New York feel is there too which adds a lot  it is generally well made although a bit basic. The one real standout feature of Maniac has to be the gore effects from scalping's to slit throats from sliced throats to stabbings from chopped off arms to heads being pulled off  the infamous scene in which a guy has his head blown off from point blank range by a shotgun. Good stuff  the effects by Savini are up to his usual high standards. There's a tight claustrophobic atmosphere to the film  it can be unsettling at times the surprisingly suspenseful chase through the subway as Frank stalks the nurse is particularly well shot  put together in this regard.Apparently shot on a low 350000 budget the real life New York locations really help sell the film the production values are alright if basic  the special makeup effects are better than perhaps the film deserves. Also to keep costs down several porn actresses were hired to play the female roles rather than proper actor's. The acting is pretty good actually again maybe better than the film deserves. I think Caroline Munro was cast after her husband put some money into the film  adds a touch of English glamour I suppose.Maniac is a film that doesn't sound too promising as it's merely a collection of women being killed by some fat guy but it has a certain compelling atmosphere  the memorable gore effects really are showstoppers at times. So shall I give it a six or a seven? I'll tell you what I will sit on the fence  give it a six  a half. A planned sequel Maniac 2 Mr. Robbie 1989 had a ten minute promo reel shot but the film was never made after Joe Spinell's death.".

	schema:reviewBody "Charles Boyer asks Rock Hudson for A Very Special Favor a 1965 film starring Leslie Caron Walter Slezak Dick Shawn Nita Talbot and Larry Storch. Boyer is Michel Boullard a man estranged from his cold rigid daughter a psychiatrist Lauren Boullard Caron engaged to a wimp Shawn. Impressed by his colleague Paul Chadwick's Hudson success with women he asks Paul to seduce his daughter. However Michel then reconnects with his daughter and becoming angry with Paul turns against him and works with Lauren to extract revenge on his mistreatment of her. This involves inventing a lover for Lauren a bullfighter named El Magnifico and convincing Paul he's lost it in the sack.Paul finally catches on and enlists a female friend who isn't getting any at the moment Nita Talbot and has her impersonate a man so that Lauren will think he's now gay.I notice people on the board have all kinds of theories why this film isn't on DVD except that now of course it is. It also isn't the only time this inside joke was used in a Rock Hudson film if anyone recalls his description to Doris Day about her boyfriend in Pillow Talk. Well there are some men...who live with their mothers... etc. I'm sure that in those days unlike today Hudson's private life was safe enough that no one thought twice about using something like this in a script. Everyone probably thought it was pretty funny.These sex comedies were all the rage in the '60s and this one has its moments with Hudson and Caron very good in their roles and surrounded by excellent people. In one of the first scenes Boyer and Slezak two suicides in real life embrace  it really didn't get the comedy off to a good start for me. But they're both delightful Boyer moving from romantic leads to the father roles still possessing that wonderful easy charm he had. Slezak was a very versatile actor who could go from playing an invincible Nazi in Lifeboat to a role like this. Nita Talbot is one of my favorite actresses of all time  seeing her made me nostalgic for the old days.If you like this type of comedy at which Hudson really excelled you'll enjoy this one. This is on a DVD set of some of the more obscure Hudson films such as Has Anybody Seen My Gal and the collection shows the trajectory of his career from young supporting player to lead. The fact that Hudson has since been outed shouldn't make his work any less enjoyable. He was after all doing what he was hired to do  act.".

All the other good films have been repeated on TV  but I have only ever seen this once. I remember laughing and laughing when watching the film. I didn't know anything about sex at that age. I just saw it as a father trying to get his daughter to 'lighten up' to 'live' and to have an interest in finding a male companion in life instead of an existence of continual work. I didn't see anything odd about Rock Hudson's character pretending to be a patient with his 'problem'. This subterfuge was a key part of romantic comedy films of the time. I certainly didn't see the 'setup' scene as anything to do with sex  I just remember it as a slightly naughty prank. In some ways the film does remind me of 'pillow talk' and this isn't surprising as one of the writers is the same. I am very pleased to hear that it is now on DVD and I will be very interested to see it again.".

This and the rest of the film is VERY contrivednever making any sense and at times being rather offensive. My ULTRAfeminist collegeage daughter kept having an apoplexy as she watched Rock's shenanigansand she felt he was more like a date rapist than a hero! I didn't feel quite that strongly but could understand how someone could be very turned off by himhe WAS a jerk and the film stopped making sense towards the end.

	schema:reviewBody "Let me tell you this is one special favor that Charles Boyer is asking of Rock Hudson. My guess is that Hudson's estate is keeping a lid on this one.Boyer has a daughter in Leslie Caron who is a psychiatrist by profession. He also has a colleague at work in Rock Hudson and he's concerned about his daughter. Concerned his daughter is not getting any sex.This is a new twist on the normal Rock Hudson comedies. In two of the ones he made with Doris Day Rock's your normal every day American wolf trying very hard to make the allAmerican virgin Doris Day. Here Caron is a French virgin well into her thirties.As Boyer tries ever so tactfully to put it what a father might be proud of in a daughter at age 18 doesn't hold true when she's 38. As he puts it Rock he expects him to to the deed with Caron and expose her to what she's been missing. What a favor to be asking.A Very Special Favor then follows the usual capers that these films for Rock Hudson normally do. But the end is really an unusual one. Deciding that maybe he ought to appeal to her professionally as well Hudson let it be known he's gay and he has switchboard operator Nita Talbot dress up in drag and pretend to be a most effeminate male. Psychiatrist Caron races to the hotel room where Hudson and Talbot are to do the deed and at that point Caron sacrifices all including bachelorhood to save Rock from the love that dares not speak its name.I think it's rather obvious why this film isn't shown at all. What puzzles me is why Hudson who was oh so careful about keeping his homosexuality a secret would do a role like this. Maybe it's the reason why a lot of closeted gay men troll the docks for dates hoping to have the question of exiting the closet forced on them. I leave that to the psychiatrists.A friend told me that he was at a party at someone's house and a video of one of Rock Hudson's films was being shown. This was a pretty straight crowd he was in and Rock in the macho role he was in was getting not a few hoots from the audience. This wasn't the film they were viewing but imagine if it was with what we know now.My guess is A Very Special Favor will not be shown any time soon or be out on DVD or VHS. But if it does come out or is shown on TCM or AMC catch it by all means. You try and figure out what was going on in the mind of Rock Hudson.".

Maybe it's the reason why a lot of closeted gay men troll the docks for dates hoping to have the question of exiting the closet forced on them. I leave that to the psychiatrists.A friend told me that he was at a party at someone's house and a video of one of Rock Hudson's films was being shown. This was a pretty straight crowd he was in and Rock in the macho role he was in was getting not a few hoots from the audience. This wasn't the film they were viewing but imagine if it was with what we know now.My guess is A Very Special Favor will not be shown any time soon or be out on DVD or VHS. But if it does come out or is shown on TCM or AMC catch it by all means. You try and figure out what was going on in the mind of Rock Hudson.";

It is 1952 and Rock Hudson is very handsome and so young and the whole movie story 1930s setting colors the ensemble cast of actors is a delight to watch. What an enchanting piece of moviemaking with dark existential realities behind the apparent lightness. The second film A Very Special Favor is a mixed bag. Because it was made in 1965 its first 30 minutes are a mustsee priceless candy bordering on parody except it is the real stuff ah ah! 60s decor 60s orchestral music Pink Pantherstyle opening credits rear view projections in Paris or New York sexual banter witty dialogue split screens Yves Saint Laurent dresses. After these first 30 minutes however the story line veers off into a war of the sexes theme that makes a modern viewer cringe even though the film still has some very funny scenes. Rock Hudson Charles Boyer and Walter Slezak are excellent. Leslie Caron is probably miscast.".

Whatever the reason Eastwood seems to be going on autopilot in front of and behind the camera. His performance here lacks conviction and he comes across as a cranky old man instead of a man with grit and determination. And as a director he slips up multiple times. The action sequences are dull when they should be spectacular  the freeway chase for example is flat despite all the vehicles that get destroyed. The night scenes and often the interior scenes are dark and murky making it hard to see all the details about what's going on.And what's the deal with the dream sequence at the opening of the movie? In fact there are a number of script booboos that make me surprised that Eastwood didn't demand a rewrite. Why doesn't Eastwood call for backup at the opening action sequence? Why is Raul Julia's past and motives never properly spelled out and why is Eastwood so determined to bust him? Why do Eastwood and Sheen hardly have any real conversations between them instead of clichd tough cop talk? Also the slowmoving story at times feels like the writers were writing it as the movie was being shot instead of using a finished screenplay. It might also explain why key actions and scenes seem to be missing from the finished product.What really annoyed me most about The Rookie was all the swearing. Don't get me wrong  I use the same words in my private life and I have seen movies I've enjoyed with plenty of swearing. But here every curse word comes across as forced as if a child was making this movie and gleefully adding naughty language in an effort to appear tough. It's simply not convincing.

	schema:reviewBody "I honestly expected The Rookie to be one of my favorite films it had everything that I like about an action film. Buddy Cops Clint Eastwood Charlie Sheen action bad cop good cop...how can it fail...but it does it falls flat on his face and there isn't even anything redeemable about it which is amazing to me!! The Rookie is about veteran tough guy cop Nick Pulovski. He has been on the case of big time car thief Strom with his partner and now they've finally caught up to him. Unfortunately Strom gets the drop on them and shoots Pulovski's partner dead. Now Pulovski is hell bent on destroying Strom but when he tries to pitch his plan to the Lieutenant he takes him off the case and gives him a rookie new partner David Ackerman. Uptight perfectly controlled by the book the complete opposite of Nick. Nick drags him around as they follow Strom and try to catch his trail against orders. When they think they finally have them during a Casino robbery Ackerman hesitates during their capture and gets shot in the back fortunately in the vest and Nick is kidnapped. Strom demands two million dollars from the city in order for Nick not to be killed and the city doesn't want to comply for fear of negotiating with kidnappers. David has had enough and he breaks. Everything Nick has shown him about being the tough cop who walks the line between good and bad comes to surface and he turns over every bar destroys everything in his path to find out where Pulovski is. He even gets the two million dollars from his wealthy father in order to pay the ransom. When he finally finds Nick the two of them will stop at nothing to chase down Strom and end it once and for all.The special effects in this film are utterly and horribly deplorable. Every time a gun goes off which is a lot it looks like mini firecrackers. Even the car chase scenes which could have been cool are not even remotely. The worst part Clint Eastwood who has always been a great action star is horrible!! But it's probably more the script that ruins it. Charlie Sheen who I always though should have been a bigger movie star than what he turned out to be...shows me why I am wrong in this empty and vapid performance as Ackerman. Eastwood and Sheen have some chemistry for the buddy cop routine but barely enough for a pulse. Everything that happens in the film makes no sense at all and is confusing crap!! I can't get over how disappointing it is when the idea has such great promise. The worst part is these two so called cops are just as bad if not worse than the bad guys but in the end they are back in their uniforms one of them with a huge promotion despite the fact that they caused innocent deaths and ran around blowing everything up. I would say for campy fans to check this one out but it's not even worth it. Even Raul Julia might as well have played Gomez Adams as the bad guy it was that campy. Maybe it can all be blamed on the writers. At almost two hours it's such a huge waste of time and I can't believe Eastwood directed let alone starred in this enormous disappointment. 410".

	onyx:emotionText "I honestly expected The Rookie to be one of my favorite films it had everything that I like about an action film. Buddy Cops Clint Eastwood Charlie Sheen action bad cop good cop...how can it fail...but it does it falls flat on his face and there isn't even anything redeemable about it which is amazing to me!! The Rookie is about veteran tough guy cop Nick Pulovski. He has been on the case of big time car thief Strom with his partner and now they've finally caught up to him. Unfortunately Strom gets the drop on them and shoots Pulovski's partner dead. Now Pulovski is hell bent on destroying Strom but when he tries to pitch his plan to the Lieutenant he takes him off the case and gives him a rookie new partner David Ackerman. Uptight perfectly controlled by the book the complete opposite of Nick. Nick drags him around as they follow Strom and try to catch his trail against orders. When they think they finally have them during a Casino robbery Ackerman hesitates during their capture and gets shot in the back fortunately in the vest and Nick is kidnapped. Strom demands two million dollars from the city in order for Nick not to be killed and the city doesn't want to comply for fear of negotiating with kidnappers. David has had enough and he breaks. Everything Nick has shown him about being the tough cop who walks the line between good and bad comes to surface and he turns over every bar destroys everything in his path to find out where Pulovski is. He even gets the two million dollars from his wealthy father in order to pay the ransom. When he finally finds Nick the two of them will stop at nothing to chase down Strom and end it once and for all.The special effects in this film are utterly and horribly deplorable. Every time a gun goes off which is a lot it looks like mini firecrackers. Even the car chase scenes which could have been cool are not even remotely. The worst part Clint Eastwood who has always been a great action star is horrible!! But it's probably more the script that ruins it. Charlie Sheen who I always though should have been a bigger movie star than what he turned out to be...shows me why I am wrong in this empty and vapid performance as Ackerman. Eastwood and Sheen have some chemistry for the buddy cop routine but barely enough for a pulse. Everything that happens in the film makes no sense at all and is confusing crap!!

All these things seem to go over the top and there is also a bad cast and not even the likes of Charlie Sheen or the late Raul Julia of Addams Family fame could lift the gloom of this being the worst film but thankfully the great Clint Eastwood only did few bad films and if I like violent action films I watch Arnie in Commando instead.".

He is one of our true American icons! People don't realize how talented he is because of his quiet personality. For example they don't realize that he directs most of his own films and The Rookie is one of them. I remember that I was so happy when he won the best director Oscar for Unforgiven in 1992 and it was also named as that year's best film. I felt that Clint had finally been given his just due! Eastwood said that he likes to make two films a year in one he plays a typical Eastwood character like Dirty Harry or No Name in the other he plays a different role like he did in The Bridges Of Madison County. The Rookie is typical Clint. He plays a hard boiled cop that has to break in an eager young rookie to solve a string of car thefts. It may not sound like a very interesting plot but Eastwood's masterful direction and the action sequences will keep you on the edge of your seat! In fact this film was in the Guiness Book of World Records for being the first Hollywood film in history to have more stunt people in the credits then actors! The most intense action scene in the film is where Clint and Charlie drive that car out of the warehouse window before the whole building explodes! It is wild beyond belief! Pairing these two actors in one film is a genius of casting in my book it is a perfect blend of veteran knowhow and youthful enthusiasm. Charlie is just like his father and brother in his acting ability. He more than does his part. He perfectly portrays Officer Ackerman's fear as a rookie and how he overcomes it in the end. There is a long stretch where Clint is taken hostage and he has to carry the film for a while and he does it in spades!".

	schema:headline " This movie really shouldn't work...";
	schema:reviewBody "There is simply no way to start this review without stating one simple fact. Cutie Honey absolutely positively should not work as a movie on any kind of level. It has all the ingredients of celluloid disaster stamped across its hot pink exterior. Let's run off the checklist shall we? Live action version of a popular cartoon? Check. A model turned actress cast in the lead role? Check. Heavy usage of cheap looking CG throughout? Check. Outrageous levels of camp? Check.Acting that belongs in a Loony Toons cartoon? Check.Yes Cutie Honey should not work but much to my surprise and resulting delight it does on almost every level. Based on ageing anime and manga property that dates back to the 1970's the movie tells the ludicrous tale of Honey Kisaragi an almost unbearably cute office worker who leads a double life as the titular spandex clad Cutie Honey self proclaimed 'warrior of love' and arch nemesis of the evil Panther Claw gang.Opening with a bizarre sequence that sees Honey sprinting through the streets clad only in her underwear a bin liner and scoffing Onigiri before leaping into battle against a strangely androgynous warrior in golden armour the movie starts as it means to go on namely in as silly a manner as possible. The movie is pure parody from start to finish and was clearly never intended as a straight piece in any way shape or form. Everything from the costume and set design through to the special effects and carefully studied but nevertheless broad performances work together surprisingly well. Indeed it is the performances that truly elevate the movie way beyond its early promise of being a big budget Power Rangers knockoff.The lead trio of Eriko Sato who I first saw in the TV version of Densha Otoko Mikako Ichikawa and Jun Murakami as Honey Detective Natsuko and shady photojournalist Seiji respectively deserve the biggest credit here which is fortunate as they have the lion's share of the screen time. Sato's performance in particular comes as a surprise considering her relatively short acting career at this point. While the somewhat two dimensional Honey was never going to be a stretch for most actresses the characters brainless manner and relentless optimism could easily have ruled her and turned our heroine into an excruciatingly annoying one note joke. Instead Sato turns Honey into a staunch and heroic fighter of evil one minute and adorably dimwitted office girl the next with a steady through line of heartwarming kindness and optimism that ties the two characters together.Visually Cutie Honey is something of a treat as well being one of the closest things you will ever see to a live action anime. It even manages to go so far as including several knowing tips of the hat to its animated forefathers including characters flying through the air millions of rockets hurtling toward their targets and backgrounds giving way to speed lines when the action shifts into high gear. Even the cheap looking CG effects fit well within the movie. Since the reality of this film is quite plainly not our own occasionally plastic looking CG characters or lapses in animation standards are more excusable and in their own way prove to be as charming as the performances.Of course not to mention the director of this inspired lunacy would be a crime unto itself. Hideaki Anno once again proves to be possessed of unique insight into the emotions of his characters. Some of the emotional beats the movie strums along to are curiously similar to his most famous or infamous depending on your point of view work in Neon Genesis Evangelion although the tone of Honey is infinitely lighter than that of Evangelion. Anno's direction is confident and his playful sometimes biting sense of humour is clear for all to see. The movie relentlessly mocks not only anime conventions and stereotypes but its own silliness at the same time coming to a head in a very entertaining drunken Karaoke session involving our three leads.Flaws are present though. The narrative while hardly the movie's driving purpose could still have been clearer and a little more focused. The Claws themselves make fun if shallow villains though they lack substantial motivation. The biggest drawback is the chief villain of Sister Jill who feels more like a plot point presented as a full stop than a truly fun character in keeping with the spirit of the rest of the film. While the narrative does justify this personality or lack thereof it still makes for a staid and lacklustre final confrontation.Overall though Cutie Honey is such a relentlessly cheerful movie it is hard not to get swept up by its boundless optimism. As an antidote to the countless dour Hollywood action flicks of the near decade since the release of the first Matrix movie it serves its purpose admirably and as a movie guaranteed to put a smile on your face there is none better.".

The way the characters are posed in particular the journalist and one scene where a character has a megaphone covering her mouth was a nod to the way animation is shotie exaggerated poses and objects over mouths to save on animation costs.It was supposed to be a large poke of fun at the silliness of magic girl anime series and anime standards like a live action version of excel saga! I enjoyed it greatly and laughed the whole way through i suppose if you have seen the original series its difficult not to get precious about it. But for someone who has watched a lot of anime it was enjoyable for all the references to other series and the way a master of the medium can poke fun at his own creations.The performances were good and in a way perfectly studied they all acted like anime characters which was the point Anno was having a dig at how simplistic a lot of characters in anime are and in particular female characters. I agree the end with Sister Jill was a bit sappy but again i thought he was trying to make a point about soppy endings to anime series as well as obviously trying to fill his need to have some comment on human nature in all his productions! All in all a highly enjoyable film!".

The film is 95 very very very silly with a couple of curveball moments where things get a bit more serious then right back into silliness and fluffiness again. The film is shot and edited in a very animeesque way with extensive use of CG to enhance the stylisation and cartooniness that's already quite abundant from the costumes and overacting. In fact so much effort has been spent making the live action film feel like an animated film that one sometimes wonders why they didn't just animate it  The answer is of course the supercuteness of Sato Eriko though I was actually more partial to Ichikawa Mikako's superrepressed detective character make of it what you will.Overall very very camp and silly fun with a fluffy message about the power of love n' stuff. Not the stuff classics are made of but worth seeing if the opportunity arises.".

I have a figurine on my window that I got with a box of fizzy candy  much to my girlfriend's ire.Next to ninja's cute chic's in revealing armour highly rate with me so I was instantly intrigued. I was familiar with the source material and the the director of Evangellion and Nadia fame and I knew that this film had a very unique visual style but I still wasn't prepared for what I witnessed when I finally put the disc in the slot and hit play.This film IS Live Action Anime to the Nth degree! It lives and breaths anime craziness and over the top silliness. Honey's facial expressions are something straight out of an SD anime. From the opening scene this film is an anime joy  yet live action.It's a nutty film and it had me chuckling constantly. I would love to show this to friends of mine but I know they'd look at me strangely and try and lock me away. Cutey Honey won't be appreciated by everyone but I think that anime fans with an open mind will really dig this film.In the back of my mind a voice told me that I was not supposed to like this film but try as it did it couldn't pull me away. I was hooked .. right until the end.It's strange that .. on first look and without proper perspective this film look bad. Everyone overacts and there are more butt and cleavage shots than you can shake a stick at  very much an exploitative fan service vehicle. Many viewers I assume would get so many bad Power Ranger flash backs that it'd hard for them to keep watching.Watch it in the right context however and you will see genius! Well maybe that is taking it too far but Hideaki Anno and the team that worked on this film should be praised for creating the closest liveaction rendition of anime I have ever seen. It has all the ingredients crazy over the top expressions a VERY cute scantily clad girl and ultrasurreal badguys including bondage'ish outfits and an androgynous male villain.It's all there. Until I find out later down the track that the film contained subliminal hypnotising messages I will say that I really liked this film but that I still can't really work out why I did so much. Cutey Honey is for anime fans and I think anyone else would struggle a little to accept this film's wild personality.Killion".

Quick flashes of artwork reconciled within the plot lines of the larger work have always felt more intrusive than they have integral to the total story but as could any reader there's always something in there worth appreciating. Whether it's the personal history of the lovable lead or the angry clutter of a villain bent on destroying life some element always gels fueling the vicarious excitement for as long as I'm willing to suspend disbelief.Then again  when the lead actress is an absolute knockout having the time of her life chewing scenery slaying bad guys and decked in spandex who am I really kidding? The liveaction the term should be used loosely as the film is full of heavy CGI sequences adaptation of Cutie Honey feels like an idea that originated from anime but desperately desired to rise above the conventions of the literature. In this story Honey  an ordinary office girl turned superpowerful android by magical ubergenius of her deceased scientistfather  is granted the chance of well her second lifetime she can avenge dear ole dad's death by bringing an end to the notorious Panther Claw gang  but is she willing to risk the lives of her newfound friend Detective Natsuko Aki Mikako Ichikawa in the process? Of course androids have never been lovelier than this one embodied by Eriko Sato. As Honey Eriko bears the weight of the film delivering a performance of a visual marvel her features strike an almost perfect balance between doeeyedanimeschoolgirlcuteness and dropdeadgorgeouscomicbookheroinebeauty. She's perfectly cast and it would appear that she knows it! She uses her feminine wiles and impish lunacy from start to finish with nothing short of total commitment. Such dedication should give even the most impotent Scrooge something to admire if not a resurrection of male blood flow. Yes  she's  just  that  stunning. In her capable hands what could have been a farce becomes a force to be reckoned with.Cutie Honey is not without its flaws. The highfashion sparkly camp design works well most of the time coupled with some terrific special effects work. Anime sequences  largely used for flashbacks and battlefield filler  are impressive but these scenes don't offer much to differentiate themselves from straight anime pictures. Despite or to the advantage of the goofy feelgood banter the actors all seem to enjoy themselves as it's clear that no one is taking this stuff too seriously.At some points I couldn't suppress the What am I watching? effect. Normally a film like Cutie Honey is not my cup of tea  but one scene later I was drawn up into this goofy world once more laughing at the campy villains or admiring what little fabric the costume designer refused to waste on Eriko's ordinarygirlalterego outfits.Did I mention that Cutie is a real cutie? In the end there's something wholesomely redeeming to watch a group of mismatched heroes take time out from saving the world to drink sake let loose and sing karaoke.".

Such dedication should give even the most impotent Scrooge something to admire if not a resurrection of male blood flow. Yes  she's  just  that  stunning. In her capable hands what could have been a farce becomes a force to be reckoned with.Cutie Honey is not without its flaws. The highfashion sparkly camp design works well most of the time coupled with some terrific special effects work. Anime sequences  largely used for flashbacks and battlefield filler  are impressive but these scenes don't offer much to differentiate themselves from straight anime pictures. Despite or to the advantage of the goofy feelgood banter the actors all seem to enjoy themselves as it's clear that no one is taking this stuff too seriously.At some points I couldn't suppress the What am I watching? effect. Normally a film like Cutie Honey is not my cup of tea  but one scene later I was drawn up into this goofy world once more laughing at the campy villains or admiring what little fabric the costume designer refused to waste on Eriko's ordinarygirlalterego outfits.Did I mention that Cutie is a real cutie? In the end there's something wholesomely redeeming to watch a group of mismatched heroes take time out from saving the world to drink sake let loose and sing karaoke.";

I was never a huge fan of the original animation but this move almost makes me want to go back and recheck it out. The movie is fastpaced and actionoriented. It has decent character development but don't look for anything too deep and best of all it was just silly. If it weren't for that last factor the movie would have completely sapped an hour an a half from my life. The cast was great considering the roles but the thing that stands out is the way they were able to combine the live action with a very cartoony style watch as Honey dodges all those missiles in the beginning it a whole new style on it's own. It was very entertaining and it was definitely an example of camp gone right.".

For instance it's 10X better than the Lethal Weapon series and Quentin Tarantino only wishes he had the talent to create a film like this rather than steal it.Then again since Hollywood denigrates films like this?

	schema:reviewBody "Taking its cue from similar movies like 'Charlie's Angels' and 'Austin Powers' Anno Hideaki's 'Cutie Honey' is a mixed bag of zany humor outlandish action campy acting and psychedelic animation. Based on the cult anime and manga series by iconic Japanese Manga writer Nagai Go the movie begins with a crowdpleasing opening sequence that really captures the essence and feel of the 1973 anime cartoon. However the rest of the movie fails to match up with the awesome first fifteen minutes of the feature. Sato Eriko is certainly pleasing to the eyes and is absolutely picture perfect as Kisaragi HoneyCutie Honey however her constant childlike innocence and carefree attitude becomes somewhat grating during the course of the film. Ichikawa Mikako is also good as Aki Natsuko but unfortunately she too is hampered by the limitations of her character's simplistic and cartoonish characterization.The action is surprisingly top notch and the socalled 'Honeymation' live action footage mixed in with cartoon animation sequences are really inventive and recalls the flawed movie 'Tank Girl' in some instances. The movie really bogs down towards the middle with a series of candid scenes of Sato Eriko in a variety of disguises. It was totally unnecessary and was probably done to fulfill the 'Cosplay' Costume Play fetishes and fantasies of its target audience.The movie really gets weird and offbeat when Oikawa Mitsuhiro as Black Claw breaks out in a song and dance number towards the end of the movie for no apparent reason. Perhaps this might have been appropriate in a spoof movie like 'Team America World Police' but seems totally outofplace here. In fact Koda Kumi's cameo earlier in film screamed out blatant 'product placement' as she also sings most of the songs for the film soundtrack.The ending was the biggest disappoint. As with Anno's 'Evangelion' finale the promise of an exciting slambang finale are quickly dashed and instead we are treated to metaphysical ramblings and pretentious lecturing about the 'meaning of love' and how 'Sister Jill' should embrace love and evolve to the next level.Being a fan of the 1973 anime series I really wanted to like 'Cutie Honey' more. It's not a bad film and is at times quite enjoyable. However I just wish that the movie followed through with the promising beginning opening few minutes and delivered something a bit more rousing and original.".

In particular pay close attention to the dichotomy of Sister Jill  Cutie Honey two immortal beings who are essentially the same but separated by one key philosophy. If you are in tune with this theme the ending will be a treat for you.One other thing I must mention the music is perfect. It illustrates exactly what I'm talking about Honey's themesong is at first a goofy romp sung in that highsoprano staccato jpop style.

Seeing such an anime played out for real automatically multiplies the inherent silliness making it difficult to bear for probably any adult without the proper fetishes this especially applies to the acting considering that those characters all have terrible mood swings. All things considered it's all achieved with the aid of relatively little CGI and animation which in a way makes it seem like it's ignoring the artificiality of its visuals while 'Speed Racer' is celebrating and actively using it.It would have been a dreadful experience if only...yes if only I wouldn't have been so fascinated by the uniqueness of having the visual language of anime and all those wellworn anime conventions transferred into a different medium basically. The sheer wrongness of the whole endeavor is enough of a reason to be amazed by it and to be fascinated by the experiment that it is. It's interesting to see in practice that what works for anime doesn't work for live action movies what's stylish in one often comes across as cheap in the other. And so it isn't a particularity successful or enjoyable movie but at least for me it was a fascinating one akin to the experiment of a certain shotforshot remake of 'Psycho'.".

All things considered it's all achieved with the aid of relatively little CGI and animation which in a way makes it seem like it's ignoring the artificiality of its visuals while 'Speed Racer' is celebrating and actively using it.It would have been a dreadful experience if only...yes if only I wouldn't have been so fascinated by the uniqueness of having the visual language of anime and all those wellworn anime conventions transferred into a different medium basically. The sheer wrongness of the whole endeavor is enough of a reason to be amazed by it and to be fascinated by the experiment that it is. It's interesting to see in practice that what works for anime doesn't work for live action movies what's stylish in one often comes across as cheap in the other. And so it isn't a particularity successful or enjoyable movie but at least for me it was a fascinating one akin to the experiment of a certain shotforshot remake of 'Psycho'.";

Keen to have this technology for herself Sister Jill leader of the evil Panther Claw organisation sends her minions to kidnap top scientists but eventually sets her sights on trapping Cutie Honey herself whom she hopes to assimilate.Opening with an insane actionpacked sequence in which our sexy heroine battles the nasty Golden Glaw and umpteen blackclad henchmen the film immediately establishes its cartoonish dayglo style the next hourandahalf is a mindboggling display of visual inventiveness and cheap titillationperfect entertainment for those who like their action demented and their women seriously tasty.Sato is excellent as Cutie Honey perfectly capturing the innocence of her character whilst simultaneously turning up the heat by wearing a variety of revealing getups which include her superhero outfit pink spandex with a strategically placed heart shaped hole to reveal her ample cleavage a halterneckmini skirt combo and once or twice just her underwear.The action which starts out crazy and gets sillier as the film progresses includes the initial encounter with Golden Claw who is equipped with prehensile hair an encounter with a scuttling vampiric creature Cobalt Claw and a battle atop the giant drillshaped Panther Claw HQ which emerges from beneath the Tokyo Tower against Scarlet Claw and Black Claw who inexplicably performs an impromptu songanddance number midfight.The ending is a bit of a damp squib some incomprehensible rubbish in which Cutie nearly turns into a plant and love once again saves the day but with so much fun preceding it this movie still gets a very reasonable 7.510 from me rounded up to 8 for IMDb.".

The karaoke part is funny nice to see people having fun. I'd get me a karaoke machine but I'm too hardcore I'd get too excited and start acting out scenes from action films. The machine would end up being damaged and I don't think the warranty would cover reenactment abuse. The part before the karaoke scene is kind of sexy because the cop chick is a little shy and mousy. She has a weird cute little face. She should have been Cutie Honey. But I think they chose the other girl because she has bigger breasts. Anyway check this film out if you get a chance its fun and not serious at all.".

Even the presence of a lingerie model Sato Eriko in the title role surprisingly didn't make much difference either. While pretty she was just too asexual. I guess this is a movie aimed primarily at a younger audience and perhaps that's why I just didn't get it. It reminded me of the Power Rangers. And this was not a good thing. This was a bad thing.I suppose it helps if you are wellversed in all things Anime to truly appreciate what they were trying to do with this film. It is very comiclike. And it certainly doesn't take itself seriously in fact it almost came across like it might be a parody of the genre. Although I really think that ultimately they would have been better making an animated version of this rather than a weak liveaction interpretation. It was probably done this way purely to showcase the cuteness of Sato Eriko. I suppose if she rocks your boat then this movie might offer something.But as I said earlier I derive no pleasure in slagging this movie off for some reason.

	schema:reviewBody "Concerning Spaces Ophuls' film is mainly focused upon camera movement. Some of the longer shots are especially remarkable. For example in the scene when the Baron comes home for the first time and the lieutenant has great luck that he had left and hides behind a column from the Baron who suspiciously and hesitatingly walks up the stairways a circular shot is used. This same circular shot is repeated again in a later scene when the Baron runs up the stairway when he wants to condemn his wife. Shots like this always have significance in Ophuls' films. The reason for the Baron's special movement on his way upstairs and the fact that his wife was deceiving him was the same in both scenes although he did not yet know the truth in the first scene. In the second scene he knows for certain and is therefore running with all of his might fueled with hate and anger.Ophuls films contain a myriad of details that one would not recognize when seeing the film just once. In the first scene the opera scene one might find the filmtechnique of 'enunciation.' Before the performance starts one can see an eyepair hiding behind a mask in the wall followed by long shots over the auditorium. This makes the spectator feel that this masked figure which is actually the opera director is the camera and the enunciator and therefore is identified with him. A remarkable long shot is also present in the gorgeous love scene of Christl and Fritz as they glide in a sleigh through the snowcovered wood in the winterlandscape. As they talk about eternity variation is created with some full shots of the couple. The same feeling is transmitted in the last scene after Christl's death where one can only see the marvelous picture of the snowcovered trees and only hear the off text saying 'I swear that I love you. for all eternity' on that place where happiness once seemed to be assured. It makes the spectator relive the first scene and be aware of the dramatic fact that all of these beautiful feelings are gone and in addition Christl passed away believing that Fritz had cheated her the entire time. On the surface Liebelei seems to be a really nice love story about two people meeting and fancying each other but due to circumstances outside of their relationship the love story ends in tragedy. But the main idea of the film is about something deeper. Arthur Schnitzler who wrote 'Liebelei' enjoyed great success with this theatreplay. Schnitzler's work was sometimes seen as another 'bourgeois sorry affair' ger. Brgerliches Trauerspiel which always has the main theme of a love affair between people of different social classes. Although Vienna had very rigid rules in 1900 and Fritz is obviously from a higher class than Christl this was not the main focus of the story. The actual theme is timeless and universal misplaced male honor. The duel in the end was just the tip of the iceberg. It was a common occurrence especially among officers to fight a duel whenever this 'honor' was damaged even though it has always been illegal of course. Theo the victim's best friend tries to change the course of destiny as he goes to his superior the colonel. This is the scene where you see the conflict between two worlds colliding. On the one hand you have the militarily strict world but on the other hand there exists a humane world. In the humane perspective humans can err can love and also forgive. The Baron's position is clear. Everyone expects him to act in a certain way in this situation. Despite this the Baron is the evilest in having misplaced honor. Theo is the one caught in the middle the only one who understands this madness and this position is the reason for his desperation.Gestures are often seen in Ophuls' film as well where he tries to replace words by body movement gestures faces camera movement lightning etc. For example there was never a cigarette smoked as by Gustav Grndgens the Baron concentrating all his hate and anger in his smoking.One of the obviously greatest sequences is the final one where Theo Eichberger Mizzi Ullrich and Christl's father Hrbiger sit opposite of Christl Schneider at the entrance of her chamber and try to tell her about her lover's Liebeneiner death. The Camera is mainly on Christl showing in a long extreme close up her realization about what has happened. She doubts that Fritz ever loved her since he lost his life on a duel over another woman. Her face shows pure desolation and desperation as she stammers out her thoughts. One must have a heart of stone to not shed some tears or at least have a lump in the throat when seeing this scene which wouldn't have had half of this effect if it were filmed from a medium long shot perspective.See synopsis above as well".

This makes the spectator feel that this masked figure which is actually the opera director is the camera and the enunciator and therefore is identified with him. A remarkable long shot is also present in the gorgeous love scene of Christl and Fritz as they glide in a sleigh through the snowcovered wood in the winterlandscape. As they talk about eternity variation is created with some full shots of the couple. The same feeling is transmitted in the last scene after Christl's death where one can only see the marvelous picture of the snowcovered trees and only hear the off text saying 'I swear that I love you. for all eternity' on that place where happiness once seemed to be assured. It makes the spectator relive the first scene and be aware of the dramatic fact that all of these beautiful feelings are gone and in addition Christl passed away believing that Fritz had cheated her the entire time. On the surface Liebelei seems to be a really nice love story about two people meeting and fancying each other but due to circumstances outside of their relationship the love story ends in tragedy. But the main idea of the film is about something deeper. Arthur Schnitzler who wrote 'Liebelei' enjoyed great success with this theatreplay. Schnitzler's work was sometimes seen as another 'bourgeois sorry affair' ger. Brgerliches Trauerspiel which always has the main theme of a love affair between people of different social classes. Although Vienna had very rigid rules in 1900 and Fritz is obviously from a higher class than Christl this was not the main focus of the story. The actual theme is timeless and universal misplaced male honor. The duel in the end was just the tip of the iceberg. It was a common occurrence especially among officers to fight a duel whenever this 'honor' was damaged even though it has always been illegal of course. Theo the victim's best friend tries to change the course of destiny as he goes to his superior the colonel. This is the scene where you see the conflict between two worlds colliding. On the one hand you have the militarily strict world but on the other hand there exists a humane world. In the humane perspective humans can err can love and also forgive. The Baron's position is clear. Everyone expects him to act in a certain way in this situation. Despite this the Baron is the evilest in having misplaced honor. Theo is the one caught in the middle the only one who understands this madness and this position is the reason for his desperation.Gestures are often seen in Ophuls' film as well where he tries to replace words by body movement gestures faces camera movement lightning etc. For example there was never a cigarette smoked as by Gustav Grndgens the Baron concentrating all his hate and anger in his smoking.One of the obviously greatest sequences is the final one where Theo Eichberger Mizzi Ullrich and Christl's father Hrbiger sit opposite of Christl Schneider at the entrance of her chamber and try to tell her about her lover's Liebeneiner death. The Camera is mainly on Christl showing in a long extreme close up her realization about what has happened. She doubts that Fritz ever loved her since he lost his life on a duel over another woman. Her face shows pure desolation and desperation as she stammers out her thoughts. One must have a heart of stone to not shed some tears or at least have a lump in the throat when seeing this scene which wouldn't have had half of this effect if it were filmed from a medium long shot perspective.See synopsis above as well";

	schema:headline " Classic and Romantic Milestone";
	schema:reviewBody "At the beginning let me refer to my school memories. I remember discussions with my teacher of literature about the core of romanticism its Utopian ideals and its Human perceptions. I had considered it as a purely literary abstraction until I saw this classical representative of romanticism in European cinema.The noteworthy story by Arthur Schnitzler could not see a better moment for its screen adaptation than the early 1930s the period which saw the emergence of sound. Moreover films could still avoid the propaganda mechanisms and requirements of censorship that were slowly approaching. No doubt this time saw some unforgettable movie productions of sensitively handled romance with exceptional artistry. Meanwhile truly great talents had a chance to emerge. All seemed to be new young inexperienced genuine and captivating...something that the storyline so nicely executes here. In fact isn't that 'freshness' what the romantic content is all about?However the content of LIEBELEI may occur to us quite predictable nowadays and surely does not in itself contribute to the top strengths of the movie. Duality of feelings short happiness and inevitable sorrow dramatic decisions harshness of duels 'misplaced honor' as many reviewers put it occur quite a prefabricated stuff that may as well fail to appeal to many viewers now. What requires particular attention in LIEBELEI is the manner everything is executed.Scenes of exceptional charm contribute to the movie's vital representation of 'artistic collaboration' between producers' creativity and viewers' perceptions. Although the entire movie is filled with beautiful visual imagery these few that need a special mention are ChristineFritz's idyllic sleigh ride when their love seems to be as white as snow opera sequence with no 'coincidence' of falling binoculars ChristineFritz's walk through the streets of Vienna the waltz Fritz dances FIRST with Christine and THEN ... with the Baroness. The use of mirrors nicely highlights the undertone of duality. However the film no longer resembles many 'silent' features and we can say proudly It has stood a test of time because it is PURELY a developed talkie. Why? Max Ophuels as a rather unknown director at that time LIEBELEI was his fifth feature does not imply any characteristic style pursued but occurs to be fresh in the medium experimenting with directorial possibilities and methods at hand in 1933. This 'rich simplicity' as well as 'emotional puzzle' and 'expressive use of the dialog' with reference to Jesus Cortes's review seem to take over at multiple levels and consequently appeal to us in a powerful manner. The cameraman Franz Planer proves his skills in some technically flawless camera movements just to note a significant shot of Fritz and the Baron while the former one leaves the mansion in secret and the latter one comes there with suspicion. Among other crew Theo Mackeben nicely contributes to the film's atmosphere. Thanks to music both the tunes of waltzes and the classical pieces by Mozart and Beethoven we may feel the charm of the early 20th century Vienna when the monarchy was still in its pinnacle. The use of classical music some doubts may arise with Beethoven's 5th symphony in the emotionally climactic moment as a bit disturbing. Depends on how you perceive it. But where the truly memorable impact of this movie lies is in the acting.Two couples in the lead seemingly but only one person who stands out and steals the attention. That is MAGDA SCHNEIDER Romy's mother in her youth mind you it is 1933 when she was still not married to Wolf AlbachRetty. Many viewers know her from her mature age on the screen in the color 'Heimatfilme.' Also for them her role in LIEBELEI will be extremely surprising. If someone sees the film entirely for the sake of Magda Schneider shehe will not be disappointed. The whole spectrum of her abilities lies in portraying the rather naive but very genuine and honest character whose ideal state of life is love a purely romantic character. In the beautiful scene she says to her beloved Fritz about being content with whatever happens  she found love and that makes for all happiness. In the extraordinary finale sequence with the overlong closeup Ms Schneider proves an extraordinary talent depicting all feelings from confusion shock disbelief fear to unimaginable grief. The camera is placed in such a way that we see her like the people who come with bad tidings. The moment is a masterpiece. But Miss Schneider does not only act in LIEBELEIshe also sings a folk song Schwesterlein which expresses enthusiasm with nostalgia hidden in the inner life? OTHER CAST Wolfgang Liebeneiner is adequate but not outstanding as Fritzhis duality is constantly highlighted he is not very believable in the scenes with Christine because there is another reality that exists in his life Mr Liebeneiner is most memorable when he visits Christine's house to say 'goodbye' and she is not there. What emerges from his acting is realizing a sad fact. He really opens his eyes to what situation he has found himself in he has placed himself in. Luise Ullrich and Carl Esmond depict the contrary couple with less romantic feelings perhaps but more stable future. This is particularly visible in Mizzi's character Ullrich contrasted to Christine's romantic versus rational. Among the supporting cast a mention must be made of Paul Hoerbiger Gustaf Gruendgens and Olga Tschechowa who supply the movie with the feeling of promising days in Austrian cinema. An outstanding production and unique in its medium is clearly more Magda Schneider's artistic victory than Max Ophuels's. Much later remade as CHRISTINE with Romy Schneider the story proved its popularity among audiences. The classical LIEBELEI as a supreme production accordingly is truly a milestone that stands on its own. Following Christine's thoughts in the movie viewers are deeply influenced by its romantic mood and its concept of 'eternity.' What is 'endless?' Longer than one lives...perhaps...but not longer than one loves.".

As melodrama indicates it's drama with music and from the start Ophuls sets in motion an operistic artificial mood. Every performance is selfconscious aware of being representing all sets are shown thoroughly characters leave the scene and the camera remains a few seconds in the empty decor even the way the snows falls from the sky appears to be fake. Still the film has an admirable freshness and engages the audience in an almost hypnotic trip to which Ophuls' floating camera and his modern dramatic use of the score contribute big time. Max Ophuls can be paralleled with Douglas Sirk as a director that purposely breaks up with any trace of reality in order to convey a truth that is purely cinematic.".

The director is Max Ophls even if uncredited and thanks to the festival named after him he is probably as famous today as he was back then maybe even more. However the fact that this film here is apparently one of his most famous and bestrated works makes me pretty wary as I did not think this was a particularly good watch. There was overacting in here on several occasions and the script and story did not impress me either. Not enough material for a film that barely makes it past the 80minute mark let alone really good material. The film had none of this. Neither the drama nor the romance did enough to keep me interested in the story and characters. It wasn't sweet it wasn't heartbreaking it was all very forgettable. Just like the film as a whole. I do not recommend it.".

The special effects were crude compared with today but nevertheless they were well done for the period and all in all the film holds up very well today. The animaldinosaur sequences are exciting woolly mammoths alligators with sailfins attached to resemble prehistoric Dimetrodons the Rock People fighting hand to hand with horned animals  all well done. Lon Chaney Jr. has his best role except perhaps for Lenny Small in Of Mice and Men as the bullying tyrannical leader of the Rock People that gets his comeuppance Victor Mature good as his son and the beautiful and athletic Carole Landis an ideal cavegirl. Incidentally I'd take Carole any day over Racquel Welch in her remake One Million Years B.C.The creatures are of course live and recognizable as today's animals despite attempts to disguise them. To me the fact that they are living creatures adds excitement whereas we know today's special effects good as they are are still only someone's artificial creation. The fight between the Dimetrodon alligator and the lizard is rousing and bloody and the finale leecha sequence the giant dinosaur besieging the Shell People provides excitement and is also well done.Last but definitely not least we should not forget the splendid musical background score for the film. While I give the 1940 One Million B.C. a 9 rating our of 10 the music deserves a 10 out of 10.".

We liked it then and I still think highly of it now. This is a fun and for its subject matter gentle film and find it more enjoyable then the technically superior Ray Harryhausen remake. It is very easy on the eyes in BW compared to the rather harsh color of ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. It also boasts a very enjoyable and sentimental musical score.The acting is credibly done to the level of the subject matter. Mr. Chaney Mature and Ms. Landis are not performing RICHARD III. We believe in their characterizations because they are sincere and not over the top. The Special Visual Effects of course could have used Willis O'Brien yes we knew they were lizards even back then in the 60s but there are several convincing scenes. The drift down the river with various creatures in the background the march through the jungle pursued by what appears to be a Armadillo duel of the dinosaurs in the desert and finally the Volcano and the saving of the Shell People. All are well mounted and succeeded in their intent which we don't believe was to scare the audience but to involve them in the story line. You wanted these characters to succeed against nature and each other.So take a chance on this one 1. In fact watch both versions and I bet you will come back with a better appreciation of what the Hal Roach Studio presented. Hopefully they will reissue restored on DVD. It needs it badly since like KING KONG it suffered much in rereleases and sale to television and bits and pieces that have been grafted into so many 1950's horrorscifi films. Like THINGS TO COME it would be nice to see it in its original premier release.".

The pictures are the story of two prehistoric peoples the tribal brute rock people and the pleasant peaceful shell people. Naturally the story is a romance between stars Victor Maturejust his second feature film and the lovely blonde Carole Landis. This film produced by Hal Roach has some things going for it. I liked the division between the two tribes and how each sustained life in a prehistoric world. The acting was surprisingly good with Mature and Landis doing credible jobs despite spouting occasional gibberish meant to be taken as caveman lingo. Landis in fact is quite affable and charmingbeing in a minicave dress always helps too. Lon Chaney Jr. gets his start in this type of film so to speak as the head of the rock people and as Mature's father. Chaney is good and is able to emote lots of emotion while using little dialog. The special effects are unfortunately not too special as we are basically given Irwin AllenBert I Gordon dinosaurs. You know the type. Iguanas and other common lizards as well as an alligator dressed up in fins and the like. For the technology used these effects are okay and predate my examples of movies using them. There are also some very nonscientific bits of information used throughout the film...like man has already got domesticated dogs for just one example. Overall this movie is a pleasant fantasy of what life might have been back then. It should not be taken too seriously as it is in truth a fairly simple tale with a simple message of how man might change through the influence of anotherLandis on Mature and his people.".

	schema:reviewBody "Considering how much worse this movie could have been I'm a bit surprised what with old Hollywood taking on prehistoric times with the wellscrubbed likes of hunky Victor Mature and nubile Carol Landis. Frankly both look like they just stepped off the pages of Photoplay even if their fashion attire is a bit dated to say the least. But whatever the expected Hollywood nonsense the underlying story is a good one with lessons even for today.Apparently the Rock people are early ancestors of our modern rugged individualists even if their table manners leave a lot to be desired. No sir no one here depends on anyone else. Catch dinnertime among these nononsense Rock people where the pecking order is strictly enforcedit's the roughest guy first then the hunting dogs then the rest of the guys and finally the women all grabbing what they can. Maybe that also accounts for why so few kids are seen among them. Anyway everyone jealously guards his own hunk of meat since somebody else will grab it if they can. And better not get injured because if you do you'll have to take care of yourself. No medical insurance here. But one thing about this tribe they're tough as nails. Then there're the Shell people probably forerunners of modern day European socialists. They all eat out of a communal vegetable pot even passing plates of food from one to another. Just as importantly each eats in peace knowing his neighbor can get more from the pot instead of grabbing someone else's. Then too there's leisure activities such as small group singing that's more like synchronized grunting along with etching on rock walls for later archaeologists to find. So since they all seem to get along with one another it's not surprising a ton of kids are running around. The trouble is the tribe's terrorized into group huddles by one of those big lizards Hollywood was so fond of. What the Shell folks need is a dose of the Rock people boldness. And what the Rock folks need is a dose of Shell people civilization.Good thing for both tribes that Hollywood's got a Neolithic version of Romeo and Juliet that eventually brings the two groups together. But then what can you expect when hunky Tumac Mature from the Rock people meets up with the winsome Loana Landis from the Shell folks. Just goes to show I guess that no matter what biology trumps all else especially when all you're wearing is a bear skin. Still I would like to know just how Tumac gets such a smooth shaveand I do mean smooth shave when the other Rock guys don't. But then how else could we recognize TCF's newest heart throb if he didn't. At the same time I'm wishing I was born a lot lot sooner so maybe I could meet up with a prehistoric babe like Loana. I mean Las Vegas showgirls in their skimpy costumes have nothing on our greatgreatgreat you get the idea grandmothers.But then if I were born a lot lot sooner I might meet up with one of those scary big lizards that seem always fighting with one another or I might get blasted by a volcano or swallowed up by an earthquake. Thanks to the screenplay it's just one prehistoric hazard after another and I'm thinking the special effects crew really deserved their Oscar nominations especially since there's no digitalized computer to fill in the blanks. All in all I guess it's just as well that I'm knocking around in the 21st century where my biggest worry is commuter traffic at rush hour.Anyhow skeptics have poked a lot of fun at this epic over the years and truth be told it's not too difficult. But despite the occasional silliness the importance of learning from others is still more than just a prehistoric challenge.".

And that's what the moviegoing public paid to see Victor Mature and Carole Landis scantily clad in front of the camera.Small studio producer Hal Roach busted the budget for this one released by United Artists. Conrad Nagel as an archaeologist interprets the cave drawings for a group of weary young people on a hike who take shelter where he's doing some research. The two protagonists Louanna of the shell people and Tumac of the rock people look a whole lot like Carole and Vic.Vic's from the savage rock clan who basically operate on a survival of the fittest basis. After a quarrel with the head of the clan Lon Chaney Jr. he's exiled and he's found in the primeval forest by Carole Landis who definitely likes what she sees.Her shell people are a bit far up the evolutionary scale and she and the rest strive mightily to break Vic of his individualistic and isolationist ways. And that's the key to One Million BC. Think of the time it came out and what the world was facing. There's a lot of aggressive wildlife in the forest primeval and the savage wildlife in 1940 had two legs instead of four. Time for the clan and rock people of the day to put aside their differences and face the common foe of nature.This was supposed to be D.W. Griffith's comeback film and it's open to speculation as to how much he did shoot on this. I think the protagonists have an innocence about them even the savage Mature before he gets housebroken so to speak the way Griffith protagonists do.For the next 30 years the footage of One Million BC was used over and over again in every kind of monster film going. Those lizards got to be old friends after a while. It also launched the careers of both Victor Mature and Carole Landis. Though both of them did have considerably more dialog in later films. After over 60 years One Million BC is still a great film to watch and be enthralled by the special effects as they were originally done. One Million BC got two Oscar nominations for Special Effects and Best Music Score. Will the rock and shell people find they have a common foe? Watch and find out.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was very surprised to see from the IMDb trivia that this was the highest grossing film released in 1940. I just wouldn't have imagined that a caveman film with dinosaurs consisting of lizards on tiny sets would have brought in that much money. I think it's because such a film would be pass today but back in 1940 it viewed quite differently.The film begins with some travelers coming into a cave to get out of the storm. Inside was an archaeologist Conrad Nagel and he tells them a story about what life would have been like during early human history. Interestingly the travelers played out the roles as cave people in the tale. You'll probably notice rather quickly that one of the cavemen Tumak is Victor Maturein only his second film role. Carole Landis a lovely contract actress with Hal Roach Studios and Lon Chaney Jr. also star in this tale.Having actually seen the 1966 remake of this film in the theater when it was rereleased in 1970 I noticed very quickly that this 1940 version actually had better sets and special effects. While this version was impressive in its day the 1966 version wasn't so cutting edge. I was particularly impressed by the matte paintings and sets in this 1940 versionit looked very professional even though the Roach studio was NOT a fancy or rich operation. They generally seemed to make the most of what they hadincluding putting hairy suits on modern mammals to make them look wild and woolly.Mature is a bit of a wimp in the filmat least at the beginning. Despite his age and size he's beaten up in a fight with an old man and is tossed from the caveand has to fend for himself. He eventually floats down stream to another social group where he meets an exceptionally wellcoiffed group of people for cave dudes most of them looked awfully nicewith nicely trimmed beards and clean skin. Landis in particular is quite a dish. Actually now that I think about it Mature looked amazingly good also. Despite his slightly unruly long hair he was cleanshavensomething you wouldn't expect from such a guy.At first Mature has some difficulty adjusting to life in the new tribe. However soon he becomes an important memberespecially after he saves a young girl's life by killing what appears to be a mini TRex. But because he is a pile of raging hormones he eventually is forced to leave this groupand Landis goes with him because he's such a hunk. Will the two ever be able to make it on their own? What will become of them? Tune in and see...or not.Generally it's the sort of movie I could care less about unless it were made really really poorly then it's good for a laugh. While some of the animal fighting scenes between alligators and monitor lizards are cheesy the rest of the film is not. Interestingly however the worst parts of the film these reptile fights were often reused in later filmscrappy ones such as ROBOT MONSTER and TEENAGE CAVE MAN. In addition to these scenes being poor they were also amazingly cruel as the reptiles actually were allowed to tear each other apart and fires were set in which they appeared to be killed or at least badly injured! I can see why censor officials in the UK insisted that these scenes be cut.Overall if you insist on seeing a caveman movie this or THE FLINTSTONES 1994 are your best bet. Still even a good caveman film is something I can't get that excited aboutafter all it's all a lot of grunting and modern animals pretending to be ancient. And I doubt if my not being that impressed by this film is unusual for audiences in 2010. It's the sort of film that once packed 'em in but now just seems a tad silly.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just watched this classic Hal Roach production on the TCM site. It's the story of a man and woman and how they get their previously enemy tribes together. Actually what I just said made the movie sound simplistic which despite the prehistoric setting it's not. In fact I was surprisingly enthralled by the story the acting of Victor Mature and Carole Landis though Ms. Landis is also good eye candy the fights of the dinosaurs actually lizards alligators and armadillos and the exciting special effects concerning the volcano eruption. Roy Seawright deserves megakudos for that last sequence and possibly for Mature's fight with what looked like a model dinosaur worthy of Willis O'Brien. Also loved the music score that was played throughout. That score might have broken whatever monotony the slower scenes may have had. So with all that said I'm recommending One Million B.C. for anyone interested in these oldfashioned effects movies.".

	onyx:emotionText "Just watched this classic Hal Roach production on the TCM site. It's the story of a man and woman and how they get their previously enemy tribes together. Actually what I just said made the movie sound simplistic which despite the prehistoric setting it's not. In fact I was surprisingly enthralled by the story the acting of Victor Mature and Carole Landis though Ms. Landis is also good eye candy the fights of the dinosaurs actually lizards alligators and armadillos and the exciting special effects concerning the volcano eruption. Roy Seawright deserves megakudos for that last sequence and possibly for Mature's fight with what looked like a model dinosaur worthy of Willis O'Brien. Also loved the music score that was played throughout. That score might have broken whatever monotony the slower scenes may have had. So with all that said I'm recommending One Million B.C. for anyone interested in these oldfashioned effects movies.";

Vic rescues many from both tribes and in the finale scene the two tribes live together singing around a campfire!      What helps make this film a little silly is that Ms. Landis always has pretty combed fluffy hair the dinosaurs are clearly guys in goofy TRex suits and the rest of the dino cast is pet store lizards with fins and whatnot glued to them  Where was PETA during this?

	schema:reviewBody "Imagine a world one million years ago. With people who inhabit a dark and dangerous unfriendly world where they tend to dwell in the shadows of prehistoric reptiles and other ancient monsters. Where men live in caves and use the most primitive of weapons for competition defense and hunting the great beasts of their age. And you have a picture of what you will see in this 1940 adventure film One Million B.C. This film while it may be ahistorical on many accounts is a rather unique entertaining little gem reminiscent from the dawn of the 1940s. If this were a documentary the professors would be offended. Yes cave men and dinosaurs did not inhabit the same world. And there are no records of iguanas and sailbacked crocodilians in excess of a hundred feet in length. But in my opinion that is what makes movies like One Million B.C. special. They are examples of what filmmakers thought about in the past. And the kind of movies that the naive audience found spectacular decades ago.One Million B.C. is pretty much your kind of ancient love story and it may even be trying to symbolize that the people from the ancient world were not all barbarians and like animals and that they had their own way of life with emotions and problems very much like ours today. This is explained after the first five minutes or so because the film is basically a flashback. Starting in the present day and then remembering what happened long ago. And while it may not be an incredibly powerful romantic film it is a great look at old filmmaking.The special effects used on the monsters that no longer exist are acceptable for the time the film was made. Obviously the constraints of the budget did not allow for the expensive stopmotion animation technique from the 1933 King Kong or the even earlier 1925 The Lost World. Dinosaurs here are portrayed in three different ways men in rubber suits puppets and props and most commonly used graphically enlarged lizards and other reptiles. Its a look into the time when visual effects were still under development. And maybe it was the filmmaker's way of trying to convince the audience that what they were seeing was real. And by adding sound effects as the reptiles opened their mouths could have frightened the audience back then. Some special effects weren't as keen though most primarily the tyrannosaurus and the triceratops. The triceratops was a small prop that was nearly immobile. And the tyrannosaurus was a man in a suit that provided very choppy revealing motions. Nonetheless the sequences with these two creatures was quite fun. Campy but fun. And as for the graphically enlarged lizards they worked out fine on the most part. But they had to be formatted with the actors to make them appear gigantic. There are many cases in the film where you can see the creatures were altered to make them look ancient. For example there is a crocodilian in the film with a sail upon its back. Obviously a small caiman or alligator with a rubber fin placed onto its armored hide. It just shows how the special effects artists at the time were being forced into using their ingenuity and imagination.One Million B.C. is a nice little gem and in my opinion it's an underrated film. Maybe it started out of a bit of a weak level and kind of rushed through to the main part of the story but the rest of the film was entertainment at a naturally fine level. Also featuring a very well Academy Awardnominated musical score that was dark and ominous perfect for enhancing the appearance of a world gone. In actuality a world that never really existed according to science. It's an imaginary world but one that you can look at and believe.".

This was released on video in Germany of which I have a copy which a mate ordered for me from Amazon.A group of explorers go into a cave and look at some cave paintings done by Stone Age Man. The movie then goes back in time and we learn how these people lived. One of these Tumak meets a girl from a rival tribe and falls in love with her. After getting up to different adventures including battles with dinosaurs and other prehistoric life more of which later a volcano erupts and there is also an earthquake towards the end.Now to those creatures starting with those dinosaurs. These are enlarged lizards and alligators with sails stuck on their backs to resemble Dimetrodons. We also see a TRex which is just a man in a monster suit and seems to be dancing. At the beginning the cavemen kill a rubber Tricertops for food. Other creatures we see are Woolly Mammoths which I think are just elephants covered with fur a giant armadillo aardvark and snakes. Some of these creatures look OK and some look rather shoddy.Stock footage from this movie was to appear in many others in years to come including Teenage Caveman Tarzan's Desert Mystery and King Dinosaur.The cast includes Victure Mature in his first movie Carole Landis horror star Lon Chaney Jr The Wolf Man and John Hubbard.Though not fantastic One Million BC is certainly worth a look and is a worthy addition to any collection especially for fans of dinosaur movies like myself.Rating 3 stars out of 5.".

Also the fact that he's now in love with Loana a stranger to his tribe was more reason for him to feel like that.The movie really gets moving in the last fifteen minutes or so after a number of family squabbles between Tumek and Lnana as well as fights that Tumek has with his former tribe the Rock people. Tumek's father Akhobo is unseated from his leadership position after he was badly injured trying to take down a prehistoric ox and is left a shell of his old self. Tumek in taking back his leadership of the Rock People in hand to hand combat with their new leader instills in them what he learned in shearing the pie or a form of prehistoric socialism from the shell People that makes things a bit more bearable for everyone in it.With both the former enemy Rock and Shell people now living in peace together all hell breaks loose with the nearby volcano blowing it's top leading to a massive earthquake with all the wild animals mostly giant lizards going bananas attacking each other and the people in the area. Top special effects for it's time back in 1940 make One Million B.C a real novelty item. With a very realistic volcanic eruption followed by a heartstopping lava flow that wipes out just about everything man and animal in it's path.It was really a shame that the animal scenes were not supervised by members of the Humane Society back then which lead to most of the lizards in them ending up dead and mangled in the fights they were encouraged to have in the movie. In fact the scenes of the lizards fighting with each other and attacking and killing the cavemen were unfortunately so good and realistic that they were incorporated into scores of movies and TV shows over the next thirty years.The movie ends not with Conrads Nagels narration to his captive band of sightseers about the story of Tumek and Loana but with both tribes Rock  Shell now living in peace and harmony. As we see them walking into the sunset with their adopted son who's mother was killed when he was overtaken by the deadly lava flow after the earth shaking volcanic explosion in the film.".

Roach was wise to do this  creating many great moments with liveaction and hardcore stuntwork. The blow up of the lizards looks cool  some others are hilarious.

For me the two best were ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. because well it had Raquel Welch in a skimpy outfit and I had just hit puberty. The other as CAVEMAN with Ringo Starr a hilarious movie that should be sought out. That being said I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie.The film opens with a group of lederhosen travelers seeking shelter in a cave while hiking only to find an archaeologist inside checking out some markings on the wall. To pass the time he begins to interpret them for the group. Naturally those in his story look like members of this group.The story is fairly simple yet fills the movie's time well. We're introduced to a tribe of rock dwelling cavemen who have little concern for one another. It's a rule by strength caste system. Our hero is Tumak Victor Mature the son of the tribe's leader. This tribe wanders in search of food with tree limbs as clubs. When Tumak kills an animal and they go to eat he offends his father and is banished from the tribe.Tumak wanders and fall unconscious into a river which takes him downstream. There he is discovered by Loana Carole Landis a member of the shell tribe. She calls for help and she and her tribe take him back to their cave. Once awake Tumak finds this tribe completely different from his own. They share food help one another and have fashioned spears from the branches and stones they've found.Eventually Tumak falls prey to his old way of doing things and steals a spear from a tribe member. This causes Loana's father the head of the tribe to cast him out. Tumak takes Loana with him and they are on their own. They come across two dinosaurs fighting one another and when Tumak sends Loana for cover she is found by his old tribe. Tumak comes to her rescue and begins to teach his old tribe the lessons he has learned from Loana's. An eventual unification of the two tribes is in the works and if you didn't see it coming right from the start you've not seen many movies.So is the movie any good? Is it entertaining? The easy answer is yes to both questions. One has to take into consideration that the movie was made back in 1940 long before CGI created creatures took over movie screens. A combination of animals and people in costumes as well as rear projection footage of larger lizards made to appear enormous made this film a spectacle for audiences of the day. So much so that the film was nominated for an Oscar for special effects.The dialogue once we get into the story could be posted on two pages if that. It is the visual story that is going on here not the words being spoken. This provides a chance for actors to perform with their body language and motions rather than their oratory skills. And it works quite well.The print being offered here is the best available and probably not seen this way since the film was originally released. Digitally restored by VCI you won't find a better presentation. This version also has a commentary track by film expert Toby Roan as one of the few extras. There is also a stills gallery with tons of ad artwork and stills from the film.This might not be the first item you pick up off a shelf to purchase when you go shopping but for film fans it will be something to treasure. It's a piece of film history more so than the story it tells.".

	schema:reviewBody "Usually it's not a good sign when your favorite part of a movie is the opening five minutes because that means the movie goes downhill from there. This might be the exception to that because despite the opening being my favorite part the rest of the movie is entertaining as well. This movie begins with some travelers seeking shelter from a storm inside a cave. But in the cave is an archaeologist Conrad Nagel who is studying paintings on the cave walls left by primitive man. The travelers are interested in the paintings so Nagel tells a story based on his interpretations of them.The story is about caveman Tumak Victor Mature of the rock tribe who is hurt and taken in by the shell tribe. The shell tribe are gentle peaceful people unlike the rock tribe which is violent. Tumak gradually becomes one of the shell tribe and falls in love with their ways and the beautiful Loana Carole Landis. As the story progresses the cavemen must contend with various monstrous creatures. An almost unrecognizable Lon Chaney Jr. also appears as a bearded member of the rock tribe.Mature makes for a funny caveman but Chaney seems right at home. Landis plays the sweet innocent Loana well and looks very attractive in the skimpy cavegirl outfit. The special effects are cheap by today's standards but don't seem out of place here. They range from a guy in a dinosaur suit to animals optically enlarged by photographic trickery to a big volcanic eruption. Quaint as these effects may seem today the film was nominated for a special effects Oscar. Stock footage from this movie would be reused over and over in the next few decades. The musical score is pretty good and was also nominated for an Oscar.It's an enjoyable movie but one that requires patience. The lack of dialogue makes the pace drag some and that's tough for what is essentially a simple adventure story. Still it's good fun if you see it when you're in the mood for such a movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "One Million B.C. did good business on its release in 1940 and despite the years parts of the film have aged remarkably well. One of these is not its entirely unnecessary opening sequence in which a bunch of hikers dressed in German lederhosen take refuge in a cave and happen upon a wizened pipesmoking palaeontologist who as the resident expert spins a yarn to his captive audience about cave people that with the help of a dissolve is dramatised for us on screen. This early sequence is so slow and contrived that contemporary audiences may not have the patience to get past it which is a shame as parts of the film thereafter are quite absorbing and contain a decent dose of the spectacle that made fantastical prehistoric films so appealing. Directors Hal Roach Sr. and Jr. seem to at times approach their prehistoric tale from an anthropological perspective which both helps and hinders the film. They seem so concerned with representing the lifestyles of the prehistoric folk with such authenticity ! that the action is at times painfully slow and at others simply laughable prehistoric humans and dinosaurs did not exist simultaneously a forgivable error in dinosaur films as facts have never stood in the way of Hollywood spectacle but more glaring is the final scene which imposes a bizarre message about the sacredness of the contemporary nuclear family structure. Equally baffling is the idea that although speech has not yet developed beyond grunts and two syllable sentences the more complex language of music is a given. The two tribes represented on screen are clearly at different levels of social advancement with Victor Mature as Tumak making an unsuccessful grab for power in his own tribe that ends with his shunning and adoption into a more civilised order with mixed results Efforts to show the tribes levels of socialisation are at times so laboured that they become redundant and drag out for far too long. But dull moments aside there are some remarkable sequences that will actually impress contemporary audiences if they can endure the slower moments. One such moment is the volcanic eruption and earthquake that causes rockslides and a lava flow that engulfs one of the characters in a scene that may have you wondering how on earth this was achieved without killing the actor. For lovers of practical effects if you can get past the slow moments that dog this film and drag it out unnecessarily you will find some impressive moments that still stand up no doubt inspired later dinosaur films such as the highly successful 1966 Hammer studios film One Million Years B.C. that follows the narrative as this Hal Roach creation.".

Because rats ran across the floor in the dark bats swooped down from the ceiling and poor old winos slept and snored in the back row. Decent people didn't go there.But on Saturday afternoons kids took over the place to watch four to five hours of movies cartoons and 1930's serials  which even by 1953 standards were corny  all for only 15 cents. I don't remember that any of us ever questioned whether we were decent people or not the popcorn was great. How the winos could sleep with all the noise I have no idea. Child audiences were highly proactive with what was going on up on the screen.It was safe then for kids to ride their bikes downtown. And every Saturday afternoon that place was packed. The winos never bothered us and we'd never heard of child molesters. All we knew was not to accept candy from strangers and since no one ever offered us any we all felt safe.This movie stuck in my mind because it was unlike anything I'd ever seen. At ten years old it fulfilled my every dream of adventure ... dinosaurs volcanoes ancient peoples jungles snakes and morals that we could all understand and appreciate It's better to be kind and unselfish than to be mean and brutal. I'd highly recommend this film but only if you think back to when you were 8  11 years old and watch it as you would have then. Even if you find it a tad corny the child in you will love it.".
