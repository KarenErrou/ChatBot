Reading some of those comments made me in turn annoyed enough to post here for the first time. The short version for those who haven't seen the movie is there is no 'twist' in the now common cinematic style there is only the version inside Danika's head and the revelation of the reality.For the hard of understanding I'll break this down into simple terms. DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T YET SEEN THE MOVIE.There are basically only 3 scenes in this movie.1 Danika's fantasy life where she rejects the terrible thing that happened to her and tries to substitute her own reality. It doesn't work for her she sees glimmers of reality through it herself as a baglady her brother dying from her Mothers neglect which is clearly her own guilt and many more. If you are looking for the reality of the movie imagine this is what is going through her head as she sits on the bench at the end of the movie. 2 The event that caused the break down killing her kids. It is as though she is remembering the truth sitting on that bench but it is too painful for her and she quickly retreats back to the fantasy her kids come back to life and join her and her husband 3 The real world present day where she is down and out listening to parts of scene one and scene two replay in her head constantly courtesy of her Schizophrenia httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSchizophreniaThe whole film up into the last scene is there to give you an impression of what being her and being schizophrenic is. She completely believes her version of reality and the only way to share that impression with the viewer is to lie that this is the reality of the film right up until the final scene.So yes this film has no plot it's a snapshot of an insane mind. Yes Danika's over protective soccer mom persona is fundamentally unlikable but that person never existed she is a reflection of her very real guilt over causing the death of her children.The hallucinations within the scene one fantasy are perhaps the weakest part of the film they are used as tool to keep a viewer interested long enough to see the film through and while the provide clues that nothing else that is happening is real or at least that there is some level of menatl issue. They do perhaps serve to confuse more than illuminate in some situations. They are however representative of the way a schizophrenic's beliefs may vary and may represent her additional fears and paranoia.In short you are not ever likely to see a film that will give a better impression of what its like to be insane in this fashion i.e. believing scene 1 is some kind of reality but if you can't handle a film that does not have a completely sequential plot or a writer changing the 'rules' of a film to make a point this will be wasted on you.".

DANIKA is a story that demands the viewer's careful attention and rewards that attention with a finely wrought surprise ending. This is a tough movie to review almost anything that is said about it diminishes the impact of a fresh look.Danika the superb and grossly underused actress Marisa Tomei is a beautiful welldressed successful professional woman loved by her husband Randy Craig Bierko and her children Kurt Kyle Gallner Lauren Nicki Prian and Brian Ridge Canipe. Yet even from the opening scenes we can tell something is amiss Danika 'sees' disturbing things terrifying events and people that alter her attention to her job and her family. She visits a young psychiatrist Evelyn Regina Hall who becomes her confidant  the only person who accepts that Danika is witnessing disturbing sights. A mixture of critical pieces of disastrous events flash before Danika's eyes as well as flashbacks to some years back when her children were young. Danika overcompensates for her fears by being an overprotective mother an unfortunate trait that begins to fracture her family.The pace of the film changes to rapid fire events as the reasons for Danika's visions become clear we finally see just what made this brilliant and strong woman the victim of a terrified and disturbed psyche and the manner in which each of the characters in the story impacts this discovery is wellilluminated. The surprise ending scene is a stunner and one that will haunt the viewer.Marisa Tomei makes this very difficult wellwritten role completely believable. She is an actress of enormous gifts. Likewise the remainder of the cast offers such fine ensemble work that credit must be given director Ariel Vromen for being a young talent on the rise. Yes there are some portions of the film that beg credibility but then that is what delusional thinking is about. This is a tight little film that deserves attention. Grady Harp".

The action in the movie intersperses tensionbuilding dialog and dramatically shocking visuals with tremendous effectiveness. The supporting cast is also exceptional in the roles and convince you of the impact that Danika's visions are having upon them. Regina Hall is especially impressive as Danika's psychologist.I would highly recommend seeking this movie out if it comes to a festival or theater near you!".

It's hard to comment on it without giving away details and spoilers so let me just say this movie takes your full attention don't cook dinner and try to keep up! Tomei is NEVER a disappointment. It's a wonder she isn't in more films these days. She is a little older than her freshfaced Only You days but time has settled kindly on her giving her more character instead of socalled 'flaws.' The ending will leave you in somewhat of a stunned silence and then you will sit there and watch all of the loose ends tie themselves neatly together. You will not walk away from this movie confused or wondering what it was all about  unless you weren't paying close attention all along. I admit there will be boohooers who dislike it because they haven't the patience or the depth to grasp the true meaning behind this film but this is why Danika is a work of art and it's star a true artist. If it were neat and pat like any good mainstream film it wouldn't be the hidden jewel that it is. Many will pass it by others will scoff and tear it apart. Let them. Those who grasp it will be those who tend to think a bit deeper than the first layer of the onion. Danika is a piece of abstract art  viewing it from different angles you will see details that aren't visible to the casual onlooker.Not for the squeamish pick it up sometime and give it the credit it deserves!".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's see I had great expectations towards this film since Danika pretty much has the potential to be a fairly enjoyable thriller but to my disappointment it turned out to be one of those films that deliberately try to be confusing just for kicks. I don't know about the others but I'd say I had my share of these kinds of psychological thrillers that usually lead to the same disappointing endings and nonsensical sequences. You know the typical softhorrorthrillerdrama flick in which the main character keeps having hallucinations and visions about horrible things happening around her and the rest of the characters are dead worried but they still don't do anything to help her out. Even though Ariel Vromen succeeds to create a puzzling atmosphere and there are two or three enjoyable moments I'd say that these 'twist in the end' fever has been pretty much overdone already. This film pretty much offers a nice variety of pointless hallucination sequences in which Marisa Tomei giving a flawless performance always repeats the same situations but in different scenarios. Obviously it ends up getting tedious after a a while. 'Danika' is the story of a genuinely desperate housewife whose main fear is to lose one of her children or the three of them for that matter. This obsession of overprotecting her kids turns out to be the result of a traumatic childhood experience in which poor little Danika loses her brother in a road accident. During the course of the film the mentally unstable woman appears basically smothering her children and overworrying about every little thing making the rest of her family lose their patience. However it is clear to Danika that something is definitely not okay with her as she realizes that she's experiencing weird hallucinations that turn her life into hell on earth.This film offers a few sequences that promise some sort of explanation whatsoever or at least a tiny little connection to the end. Nevertheless just like many other recent flicks out there with a twist in the end 'Danika' turned out to be ambiguous for no reason and it tries to deceive the audience and doubt about their own intelligence. My advice is to avoid this film unless you are bored and you have nothing else to see. I wouldn't label it as 'unwatchable' because that would be unfair considering that there are a few good things that deserve to be appreciated but it's mostly Marisa Tomei's performance actually. 'Danika' is not terribly bad but frankly I was utterly disappointed when the good atmosphere and the few achievements were suddenly overshadowed by the silly ending. I wouldn't recommend this... sorry.".

Tomei does a wonderful job and it is a wonder that she is not in more mainstream films. The rest of the cast does a nice job during the film. Technically a class A film with few continuity errors and a typical story told in a very atypical way.";

Look at the vote statistics very young people vote low for some weird reason Gave avg 5 pts for the implementation but the ending raises it to 7.

Danika is disturbed and near a breakdown having dark and terrifying nightmares and daydreams distracted in her work and consequently committing mistakes and under psychiatric treatment with Dr. Evelyn Regina Hall. Her problem was originated when her husband cheated her with the nanny of their children breaking her confidence on him. The lack of attention caused by her disturbed mind leads her family to a tragedy.Danika is an impressive and challenging American dark movie showing the complexity of the human mind. My interpretation of the story is very simple after finding her beloved husband cheating her with the nanny of their children Danika becomes an insecure stressed and overprotective mother affecting her professional life. While in her treatment with Dr. Evelyn she revives her innermost hidden fears about the lack of confidence in her husband. This situation is very clear when Randy tells that she cannot forget and forgive him after the incident with the police. Danika insists on not having a maid to help her and while having a daydream driving her car with her children she does not pay attention in the traffic light and is hit by a school bus killing her children but surviving. When the reporter asks the paramedic if she would survive the other man responds yes but asks how could she live?. She asks for her children and her imagination sees her happy family together again. In the last scene we see the reality i.e. how she survived deranged and homeless. I am a fan of Marisa Tomei and in Danika she is simply brilliant. The promising director Ariel Vromen and the writer Joshua Leibner have great beginning of career in the cinema industry. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Danika".

The teaser or blurb on the DVD made it out to seem like there was some kind of a psychic element in the plot and given that Medium on NBC has been such a success I thought that perhaps this film would be a surprise.What was surprising was precisely how bad this movie really is.Frankly Marisa Tomei is now and has been for a long time one of the truly luminous beauties in modern films. She's got a subtle way about herself and a lovely speaking voice. She is expressive but not in a 'femme fatale' kind of way. None of that was put to use in this film from someone's creative Dead Zone.Speaking of the Stephen King novel  which we weren't but hey we should be  and the film made from that story featuring Martin Sheen and Christopher Walken there is ample evidence that this theme of traumainduced precognition can be made believable intimate and effective. That is what made Dead Zone a fourstar success. That wasn't done here. There were plenty of psychic elements tossed into a mixer and poured out as a script but that script started SOMEWHERE interesting and ended up going NOWHERE at a glacial pace.There are three people to blame for this cinematic disaster the screenwriter who got the credit for this garbled mess of a movie the director who was apparently powerless to get script changes or so totally clueless that he could not see the powerful beginning of a precognitionbased plot simply disappearing halfway through it all and me for wasting my money on this DVD rental.Additionally the various and sundry persons who got credits for being this film's producers should be ashamed of wasting however much money this effort cost. Seldom in the history of modern film production have so many good and talented actors and actresses been paid to do a movie that turned out so very badly.Regina Hall was good and the film earned a 2 because of that and because Marisa Tomei made an obvious effort to interact with Hall in several critical scenes keeping her 'angst' lowkey while Hall's character got a chance to shine.If a meteorite or a comet comes by and burns every copy of Danika known into dust including the master and the daily rushes ... nobody will complain much not now and surely not in a hundred years from now. It's that bad. Honest.".

Yes obviously the entire movie is a fantasy in Danika's mind. She is probably schizophrenic or has multiple personality disorder or maybe she just went crazy and we don't know what is wrong with her that is why she is manifesting another reality. She has created a whole reality for herself that is obviously not real. At first I was a bit confused as to whether she gets in the crash while her children are younger or older like in the present I thought maybe that was another twist they wanted to throw at you. But yea it is definitely while they are young after she finds her husband cheating therefore the whole reality of her and her seminormal semihappy family is pure delusion. It is simply how her mind copes with her illness and the obvious post traumatic stress from killing her children in the crash. This one really threw me at first but once you understand it I think it is pretty clever and original. You really feel for her when you see Danika in the last scene sitting on the bench watching the world go by and all the while playing this drama in her head. It makes you think how many people out there probably experience this same exact thing every day. All in all a pretty decent movie but definitely not recommended for those who want it simple and laid out. This takes some concentration and after thought. Enjoy ".

Arrested together with other artists during the events following the Iranian presidential elections in 2009 he spent several months in prison. He was freed then on bail while the judicial procedure against him was going on. Mr. Panahi was eventually sentenced to 6 years of prison and 20 years ban to make movies.It was during the period spent at home in 2010 that Jafar Panahi made this movie with the title This is Not a Film In Film Nist. A friend documentary producer Mojtaba Mirtahmasb the author of Lady of the Roses 2008 came with a consumergrade camera and shot the footage for a 75 minutes video having Mr. Panahi as codirector screenwriter film editor and star. The video was eventually smuggled outside Iran on a flash drive and screened at the 2011 Cannes Festival.It's just that 75 minutes in a day spent by Jafar Panahi at home waiting for the result of the trial.

It's just mundane reality. Well it's not that simple this movie is a nonmovie while this nonmovie is a movie. Because it's his reality his universe which is sending us to the universe of his movies. All his movies talk actually about him about his universe and it becomes obvious here in this nonmovie which carries all the tension between image and reality  reality sublimated in cinematic image. Like Mozart this moviemaker thinks only in artistic constructions. For Mozart any fact of life was musical sound musical rhythm for Panahi every fact of life is cinematic image cinematic rhythm. Look even his concerns for the sentence to come become art! However the strongest association should be made to Beethoven! This moviemaker carries all the tension between reality and art all his creation is fully aware of the paradoxical relationship between reality and art reality mirrored in art art mirrored in reality art suffering that reality struggles to keep its autonomy reality suffering that it is taken for art.".

	onyx:emotionText "Iranian director Jafar Panahi is one of world's most important movie makers nowadays while also a victim of the oppressive regime in his country. Arrested together with other artists during the events following the Iranian presidential elections in 2009 he spent several months in prison. He was freed then on bail while the judicial procedure against him was going on. Mr. Panahi was eventually sentenced to 6 years of prison and 20 years ban to make movies.It was during the period spent at home in 2010 that Jafar Panahi made this movie with the title This is Not a Film In Film Nist. A friend documentary producer Mojtaba Mirtahmasb the author of Lady of the Roses 2008 came with a consumergrade camera and shot the footage for a 75 minutes video having Mr. Panahi as codirector screenwriter film editor and star. The video was eventually smuggled outside Iran on a flash drive and screened at the 2011 Cannes Festival.It's just that 75 minutes in a day spent by Jafar Panahi at home waiting for the result of the trial. He talks to the phone with his lawyer then feeds his pet who is a very nice iguana then talks with the cameraman shooting the footage about a project for a new film rejected by the censorship memories from some of his movies come and go suddenly a terrible noise of explosions is heard  it's nothing than fireworks and Mr. Panahi goes to the window to shoot them with his cell phone.A movie that is not a movie says Mr. Panahi.

At first it's a minor study of segregation and loneliness but This Is Not a Film is at it's most enthralling when Panahi expresses his natural directing flare acting out his latest screenplay from the discomfort of his family living room discussing camera angles to the most minute detail and reflecting on how he managed to reach such a raw level of intimacy in his previous works. Whether you are aware of his filmography or not it's clear that Panahi is an exuberant cinephile which makes his current and ongoing battles with the government even more distressing.If you were forced to judge this metacommentary diatribe one could suggest that Panahi and Mirtahmasb fail to present a bigger picture on the crisis of the state's dominance over artistic intent. Similarly to 2006s female equality drama Offside This is Not a Film is incredibly subtle with it's political allegories bordering on the coyly parabolic. Instead of presenting a bigger ultimately more controversial picture on the crisis of state dominance in the creative industries Panahi and Mirtahmasb reach a palpable level of verisimilitude in the very smallness of the situation. It all comes together in a final twenty minute sequence where Panahi falls behind the camera and back into storyteller mode it could cost him his life but he can't help it. He follows a young dustman around the apartment block and asking him what his plans for the future will be. The cordial apprentice is unsure but it's hopefully going to be a life less frightening than the one Panahi has been dealt.This Is Not A Film concludes with harrowing sentiment. With the sound of New Years' Eve fireworks and cheering in the background the screen fades to black with the credits and special thanks nods are left blank followed by a final frame that sets out a humble dedication to all Iranian filmmakers. It may be a nonfilm but whatever it is it's certainly a riveting watch and has rightly earned a place in the Oscars' documentary award shortlist.Here in the Western world our access to information democratic governments and human rights mean that cinema is taken for granted and filmmakers have it easy.

All reviews I have read have focused on the political circumstances and the fact that director Jafar Panahi has been blacklisted and sentenced by the Iranian government. I think many of these reviews focus too little on the beauty warmth and wonderfully subtle message of this film or the fresh and uplifting honesty and awareness of its cinematic language. To me the most important and moving aspects of this film is found in the beauty of its atmosphere. In Panahis search for truth and honesty. In its daring and courageous will to let circumstances and coincidence be the writer and director. In its warm original and surprisingly humorous form. The way the film evolves trough coincidence and the power of circumstance it itself becomes a beautiful image of Mr. Panahis situation and by doing that it becomes a reflection on any persons situation a reflection on existence itself. Dealing with society suppression creativity filmmaking human interaction kindness and honesty I would find it difficult to explain what the film is actually about. Most of all its much more a poetic journey than a political statement. If it is a statement its a statement of the humane. I understand why some will be bored watching this small slow quiet film. Any viewer will have to put himself in a state of slow enjoyment to really benefit from it. But it is absolutely worth it. To me one of the great achievements Mirtahmasb and Panahi makes here is the fact that they made me feel think and reflect more by watching two guys filming each other than any million budget Hollywood movie has ever done. The self aware style of this film worked like a wake up call for me making it so much stronger.If you can relate to topics like filmmaking art inspiration or problems connected to being a living being in the world I highly recommend this. My best wishes for Mr. Panahi and congratulations with the achievement.".

Panahi who has given the world such masterpieces as The White Balloon The Circle and Crimson Gold was arrested in March 2010 and faces a ban of twenty years from making films and a sixyear prison sentence for propaganda against the Islamic Republic. This refers to exercising free speech by speaking out against the rigged elected of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.As part of his sentence Panahi is barred from making films or writing screenplays is unable to speak in his behalf and forbidden to leave the country. While awaiting the results of his appeal Panahi is filmed in his home by fellow director Mojtaba Mirtahmasb using a digital video camera and a cell phone. What begins as an innocuous home movie with Panahi sitting at his table eating breakfast takes on an added dimension when he calls Mirtahmasb asking him to come by to discuss some ideas but cautions him not to tell anyone about his visit.While waiting for his friend to arrive he talks on the phone with his lawyer who tells him that the court may waive the 20year ban on filmmaking but are not likely to reduce his jail sentence. When Mirtahmasb arrives Panahi reads from his latest screenplay which was rejected by the censors. Acting out the story he puts tape around the area to suggest the apartment in which the story occurs. As he begins to read the screenplay about a young woman forbidden by her parents to attend university tears come to his eyes and he stops saying poignantly If we could tell a film then why make a film? and expresses his regret about the harshness of the penalty he faces. Soon he takes care of his pet Iguana Igi and cares for a neighbor's dog who doesn't know the value of silence. As fireworks explode on the streets to celebrate the Persian New Year a college student arrives to collect the trash as a substitute for the custodian and the two engage in a dialogue remembering the day when Panahi was arrested. To bring home the point even more forcefully Panahi watches as a TV newscaster proclaims that fireworks are illegal. What started out as a home movie at the end becomes an act of nonviolent protest.".

It had to be replaced in the last minute due to an export ban on the film itself plus the Iranian distributor loosing his license.Nearly all 75 minutes that the replacement film takes are shot within the apartment of the director in question. He is not allowed to make films but nowhere was forbidden to read a screenplay aloud. On the other hand as correctly noted by the camera man recording this reading might still be considered film making. Hence he named this film This Is Not A film which may or may not help to evade the issue.There were fireworks which we saw announced on TV as nonreligious a different word for Not Allowed. Yet we clearly saw and heard fireworks on several places spread over the neighborhood. Could this be construed as some notsosilent protest?? We felt a volatile atmosphere around these fireworks albeit in an indirect way because everyone seemed worried about their kids and relatives coming home in time. Moreover when he was talking on the phone with a colleague who was underway the latter had to discontinue abruptly when stopped by the police. This very apparently was cause for alarm. Later on he phoned back and reassured us that the police only wanted to check his camera lying unused on the passenger seat. All such signals combined clearly demonstrated an atmosphere of suppression and fear for the police.I was prejudiced by some reviews I've read describing this notafilm as a bit boring. Having seen it I found that too harsh. It may apply to the elevator scene but that was neatly broken up in small scenes providing for some diversion. Within the apartment a nice intermezzo was created by a pet lizard. It was being fed in the beginning and then disappeared out of sight for a while. Later on we saw it crawling over our main character complaining about its sharp nails and over the couch to eventually find a resting place in the bookshelves.Throughout the film I was surprised that someone convicted for 6 years in prison and a ban to make films for 20 years was not locked up but instead having some house arrest while awaiting an appeal. It clearly shows that I know nothing about the Iranian judicial system. Especially as we learned from a phone call with his attorney that his conviction was not on a legal basis but on political grounds only. The latter is a concept very alien to us.All in all this notafilm gave a limited inside view in a country we only know from newspapers. It was also a revealing inside view in an Iranian apartment larger and better equipped than I had assumed beforehand. We can only speculate how he pays for all this given the ban on his regular work. It shows again how little we know about Iran. My final conclusion is that I did not regret keeping my tickets for this notafilm though I was entitled for a substitute at choice out of the festival program.".

In the end you come to know Panahi and his culture more intimately and it's fascinating how his unintentional documentary style is similar to his fiction filmmaking style especially with an ending that makes your heart skip a beat.

The 75minute piece shot partially on an iPhone captures the daytoday life of Panahi during a stateimposed house arrest in his Tehran apartment as he appeals a six year prison sentence and 20 year filmmaking ban for his opposition to the 2011 Iranian elections.Here in the Western world our access to information democratic governments and human rights are taken for granted. Panahi and Mirtahmasb are putting their lives on the line to tell the stories they feel they must tell in the hope that one day their nation will be able to have the same sort of prodemocratic freedom as the rest of us. Gripping entertainment. Little by little This Is Not a Film leads to a final scene of overwhelming power.

	onyx:emotionText "A late addition to the Cannes 2011 programme after being smuggled into France inside a cake Iranian director Jafar Panahi's This is Not a Film 2011 is by no means your average political documentary. The 75minute piece shot partially on an iPhone captures the daytoday life of Panahi during a stateimposed house arrest in his Tehran apartment as he appeals a six year prison sentence and 20 year filmmaking ban for his opposition to the 2011 Iranian elections.Here in the Western world our access to information democratic governments and human rights are taken for granted. Panahi and Mirtahmasb are putting their lives on the line to tell the stories they feel they must tell in the hope that one day their nation will be able to have the same sort of prodemocratic freedom as the rest of us. Gripping entertainment. Little by little This Is Not a Film leads to a final scene of overwhelming power. Anyone interested in cinema andor Iran owes it to themselves to become familiar with this not film.";

I remember after the first film I saw I read about him on Wikipedia and read about his sentence and ban from film making. It is quite shocking and this gives more sense to this documentary which would have never been seen if it hadn't been smuggled out of Iran on a USB stick.In film nist starts with Jafar Panahi having breakfast over the course of breakfast he calls a friend Iranian documentary director Mojtaba Mirtahmasb asking him to come over. The only link we have with the outside world is through his phone. Before his friend comes Jafar has a phone call with his lawyer who confirms that he will definitely have to go to prison and that she may try to reduce the ban duration on appeal but it's probably all she can do. She tells him that it is not a judiciary sentence but a political one. When his friend arrives Jafar Panahi explains the last films he wanted to do and how they were both denied approval and had to let them go. He has the script of one and decides that he can explain it using his living room the carpet representing the room in which a girl is also imprisoned and a chair for the window.This is not a film is exactly what the title says it is. It is a day a documentary at most. Most of Jafar Panahi movies give a lot of freedom to amateur actors who creates the whole atmosphere. It seems clear that this was not planned either this has no script or no particular goal except to have a camera there to document whatever could be documented before it's too late.The setting is also particular as the whole town goes crazy over the celebrations of Fireworks Wednesday and the two friends stay inside wondering what to do and how to do it. It gets particularly strange when Jafar Panahi starts recording with his mobile phone filming the act of being filmed. I think the highest point of this film being not a film is when Jafar Panahi explains the story of this film he was going to make and in the middle of replaying it... He suddenly becomes silent and his face tells us that he has strong doubts and this is where the quote I picked is said he doubts the whole concept of a film of telling a story and if it is a story worth telling. It might be reduced to the film he was discussing in particular however I would think that it goes beyond that that it touches every film he's done including this one.A lot of the issues are not entirely discussed maybe as a way to retain dignity in the face of a sentence or simply because they are not thought out to be relevant. These very blunt almost political and philosophical moments contrast with the comical aspect of his iguana pet slowly climbing a bookshelf or the neighbor who tries to leave her dog with him before he simply starts barking. It is also strongly incidental as when a young arts student walk in to come and pick the trash a job he does to help out his sister and brotherinlaw suddenly the story focuses on him and as he goes on to pick up the trash we follow him. In a way isn't that what movies always tried to do follow the strange happenings of life?I liked It doesn't get much more explicitly banned film well this is not a film.I disliked Very random in a bumpy unscripted way.70100 If you are looking for a deep political look in the situation of Iran's cinema industry and its struggle then you won't find it.

	schema:reviewBody "This Iranian documentary directed by Jafar Panahi  Mojtaba Mirtahmasb has a very interesting  complex backstory behind it. After several years of conflict with the Iranian government over the content of his films the government arrested Jafar Panahi in March 2010 with charges of propaganda against the Iranian government when they find out that Jafar Panahi was trying to make a documentary about the Green Movement protesters. Despite support from filmmakers film organizations and human rights organizations from around the world in December of that year Panahi was sentenced to a sixyear jail sentence and a 20year ban on directing any movies writing screenplays giving any form of interview with Iranian or foreign media or from leaving the country except for medical treatment or making the Hajj pilgrimage. After a short jail time he was released from prison and order by the courts to stay in his house for the rest of his sentence. While awaiting the result of an appeal of his house arrest he secretly made this 2011 documentary 'This Is Not a Film' showing the troubles he been having since being sentence with house arrest in the form of a video diary. He did all this in spite of the legal ramifications of his arrest. It was smuggled out of Iran in a flash drive hidden inside a cake and shown at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. I'm deeply surprise that this movie even got shown in the Cannes Film Festival in 2011. I'm more astonish that Jafar Panahi got away with it and didn't get into much trouble for pulling that stunt. You would think that they would put him back into jail. I guess the Iranian government didn't want to drag this issue out any longer because it was making them look bad in the eyes of the Western World. By the early 2010's the harsh antics of thenPresident Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was dying down and Iran was looking for reform with civil rights charter Hassan Rouhani in hope to restore the economy of Iran and improve rocky relations with Western nations. They didn't want the Jafar Panahi issue to be overblown so instead of more punishment Jafar Panahi been allowed to move more freedom. While Panahi is still banned from making films he still somewhat able to get his films made. In 2013  2015 he got two films made with the help of his family members  friends. It's clear that the government isn't enforcing this unwritten law. For safety reasons in this film Mojtaba Mirtahmasb did much of the filming. Since it had to be made quickly the movie doesn't no linear narrative no talking heads and no interviews. It doesn't even much of anything of a story. For any viewer that isn't familiar to what Panahi is going trough. This documentary makes a hardwatch. After all it just shows Panahi doing mundane stuff with his pet Iguana. It might be too boring. For any viewers that know a little amount of Panahi. It looks like a masterpiece because it shows how bored and desperate Panahi has been since this verdict may mean his artistic death. For me it was alright for the most part. I was always curious about his previous films and how people can live under a harsh totalitarianism government. I think the best thing about the film is showcasing the ancient Iranian festival of Chaharshanbe Suri that precedes the Persian New Year and how young people are rebelling by shooting outlawed fireworks. I never heard of the holiday before seeing this film. My least favorite part is the chat with the trash collector. It was way too claustrophobic unclear and handon for me. The only thing I can nitpick is how the film could have service the people of Iran a lot more instead of himself. Don't get me wrong I love that this film is a good example of an open letter for free expression in Iran but it's a far cry from anything he done before it. His style of neorealism within the Iranian New Wave film movement is memorable. The way he mix real time events with storytelling is rich in poetry and painterly images. Sadly this movie doesn't show any of that. It's a noble venture but it felt like a selfish selfpromotion for Panahi. He talks more about his previous movies and his problems more than anything else in the film. While his action to film himself is brave it felt like it's not that strong of a statement. His punishment isn't that harsh compare to other people who did far little against the government. He doesn't rant in the film about the cruelty of the government or how other people got it worst. It felt like a 'look at what they are doing to me please solve it' vanity project than anything else. This is so unlike his previous works which gave a voice to the voiceless. Overall Portraying a normal typical day of his life isn't as strong as showing how other people freedoms are being trampled on. It's still a mustwatch but the movie could had better.".

His crime? Propaganda against the regime. Sounding positively Orwellian his sentence is 6 years in prison a 20 year ban on making films and a 20 year ban on leaving the country. Understandably he is frustrated worried and angry with and at the political system. Being forbidden to make the film he planned on making he uses the time in his apartment to lay out the bare bones of his latest screenplay.This documentary film it is important to note is not constructed under a conventional arc. It is openly improvised. You see a man unsure where to steer the piece as it moves along. He is uncertain if anyone will ever set their eyes on what he is filming and the lack of certainty hangs over the documentary like an ominous invisible cloud. However amongst all of this are some surreal moments. There is frequent footage of his pet iguana and his escapades within the confines of the apartment. This footage allows for some light to creep in amongst the varying shades of sombre. Generally speaking this is an exercise in seeing a film maker stripped of the fourth wall and in its place an ordinary person performing creatively within their own four walls. Ironically the most dramatic aspect of the film is one that does not form part of what we see and is not even added as a postscript the film had to be smuggled out of Iran on a memory card that was hidden inside a cake.Thanks to the surreptitious nature of the film's construction and export This Is Not A Film could not be any more accurate to its title. It is the epitome of a document that is oxymoronic the film has a very specific purpose and reason to exist yet it also plays out with no narrative sense of purpose in any conventional sense.Arguably the most compelling facet of the documentary is in the understanding of the context in which it was made.Criticism of this film is hard to level hence the nonrating that heads this review. Bizarrely despite containing no linear narrative no talking heads and no interviews it still stands as a fascinating window peek into a government that is terrifying petrifying anaesthetising and nullifying the proletariat. There is no fancy camera work and the lack of focus means that it would be hard to recommend this film as being one for repeat viewings.Yet still it is something that needs to be seen. In fact it commands to be seen. It is a brave feat and endeavour. It is engrossing because the viewer is left to marvel at how it made its way to our screens at all. It is a contemporaneous note on present day Iran and a call to the wider world. A cry for freedom and the purity of free expression. It highlights the extent to which civil liberties have been robbed and denied from the creative industries by the state. The real victim is freedom of speech. Freedom of expression.

	schema:reviewBody "In only seventysix minutes the documentary if we can call it that This is Not a Film manages to do much in the way of silent rebellion documentation personalfreedom and expressionism in a beautifully unconventional sense. It focuses on director Jafar Panahi who was criminally silenced by the Iranian government for making films deemed as propaganda. During this particular time and in current times Panahi is prohibited from making films and affiliating himself with any types of films. This fact alone makes This is Not a Film bolder and one of the most ostentatious documentaries ever made mainly because it's a project that never was supposed to even be a thought in Panahi's head.We see Panahi alone in his large highrise apartment go about his daily activities which include eating breakfast playing with his daughter's iguana named Igi analyzing his older films in a very deep sense acting out scenes from his movies and repeatedly calling his attorney to get a ruling on his case. Because of his propaganda films Panahi has the potential to face six years in prison and the possibility of never directing another film again. This is a scary thought for a man who is clearly not our of words to say.The naturalism and simplicity is what immediately sold me on this film. It's not hard to tell that much of this picture was comprised on Panahi's spontaneous thoughts. Nothing is very consistent not all of it is particularly compelling but all of it is truly a sight to behold. This is Not a Film in order to receive distribution was put on a flash drive and smuggled out of Iran in a cake making this a truly unique picture just in its story. How many films or films can you say you've seen that really shouldn't have been made? While my biggest compliment to the film is its naturalism and biographical nature it also is my most prominent complaint. Many things happen here some interesting some not making this experience fluctuate in quality moreso than any other picture I've seen this year. A strong part of me absolutely lauds Panahi for his bravery and commitment to get his film released yet because of its loose lax nature I question why he chose to make it more about his typical day instead of voicing an opinion on the cruelty of the Iranian government. Now I realize how deviant and asking that sounds seeing as it was incalculably daring for Panahi to make a film at all. But why not go for broke if you chose to go back on a law at all? Why not question or defend the propaganda accusation his films now bear? Why not take in account how you really feel about this whole thing? However one surprisingly elegant thing he does in This is Not a Film is question what exactly a film is? Moreover does this picture he's making now count as a film? Is it illegal that he's getting his pal Mojtaba Mirtahmasb to film much of it on a cellphone camera? Is it because it's spontaneous and follows a very nonlinear style that it doesn't qualify as a film? Does a film need to be a certain length to be constituted that? Does anything need to happen? I was reminded of those short films I always find myself watching on Youtube from the late 1800's to the early 1900's of little skits or documentaries that briefly regard lifehumorculture of a country at that specific time. Were they films? They never seemed to follow a strict plot line.This is Not a Film is something people from all countries especially America should watch in order to truly view how repressed censored and limited other countries can be. In America grotesque films like The Human Centipede can be made showcasing disgust and loathe at its height 2016 Obama's America can be made a film that deliberately regards almost everything the current US president says as lies and cites his motives as unworthy and The Hangover Part II can be made a raunchy comedic exercise capitalizing off lewdness and politically incorrect humor. The fact that This is Not a Film came to be may sit indifferently with people from America but the fact that it exists is an astonishing landmark for Iranian freedom of speech. While I can't recommend this work in an overbearing nature if you go to a video store and find it there it is probably the one you should pick up for its importance and bold roots. But since it isn't a film I technically should be reviewing it or saying any of this.Starring Jafar Panahi. Directed by Jafar Panahi and Mojtaba Mirtahmasb.".

While my biggest compliment to the film is its naturalism and biographical nature it also is my most prominent complaint. Many things happen here some interesting some not making this experience fluctuate in quality moreso than any other picture I've seen this year. A strong part of me absolutely lauds Panahi for his bravery and commitment to get his film released yet because of its loose lax nature I question why he chose to make it more about his typical day instead of voicing an opinion on the cruelty of the Iranian government. Now I realize how deviant and asking that sounds seeing as it was incalculably daring for Panahi to make a film at all. But why not go for broke if you chose to go back on a law at all? Why not question or defend the propaganda accusation his films now bear? Why not take in account how you really feel about this whole thing? However one surprisingly elegant thing he does in This is Not a Film is question what exactly a film is? Moreover does this picture he's making now count as a film? Is it illegal that he's getting his pal Mojtaba Mirtahmasb to film much of it on a cellphone camera? Is it because it's spontaneous and follows a very nonlinear style that it doesn't qualify as a film? Does a film need to be a certain length to be constituted that? Does anything need to happen? I was reminded of those short films I always find myself watching on Youtube from the late 1800's to the early 1900's of little skits or documentaries that briefly regard lifehumorculture of a country at that specific time. Were they films? They never seemed to follow a strict plot line.This is Not a Film is something people from all countries especially America should watch in order to truly view how repressed censored and limited other countries can be. In America grotesque films like The Human Centipede can be made showcasing disgust and loathe at its height 2016 Obama's America can be made a film that deliberately regards almost everything the current US president says as lies and cites his motives as unworthy and The Hangover Part II can be made a raunchy comedic exercise capitalizing off lewdness and politically incorrect humor. The fact that This is Not a Film came to be may sit indifferently with people from America but the fact that it exists is an astonishing landmark for Iranian freedom of speech. While I can't recommend this work in an overbearing nature if you go to a video store and find it there it is probably the one you should pick up for its importance and bold roots. But since it isn't a film I technically should be reviewing it or saying any of this.Starring Jafar Panahi. Directed by Jafar Panahi and Mojtaba Mirtahmasb.";

	schema:reviewBody "So your last movie went way over budget then tanked at the box office? Think you've got it bad? Jafar Panahi is an Iranian director of the wonderful The White Balloon and Offside who's currently serving six years in prison and a 20year ban on filmmaking for making a movie the nation's ministry of film didn't approve of. No joking. But the law doesn't say he can't READ a screenplay on film. So before his imprisonment Panahi invited his documentary filmmaker pal Mojtaba Mirtahmasb to his apartment in Tehran to film him reciting and acting out his latest creation. This is not a Film is a record of that event.It's a noble venture but as a filmmaker himself Panahi quickly realizes the futility of his stunt as he concludes If we can tell a film why make a film? then dissolves into tears. The rest of the movie therefore is taken up with Panahi screening parts of his older films while providing running commentary on his artistic choices discussing everyday concerns with Mirtahmasb and awaiting word of his fate. The movie is certainly an indictment of the repressive society in which he lives yet it also demonstrates that film comes in many forms and while Panahi may be unable to make the dramatic feature he would like to it is an equally valid and valuable form of artistic expression to simply document his own real life experience for others to observe  and just as powerful in its effect.And indeed the most compelling scene in the movie is a completely extemporaneous one as Panahi interviews a substitute custodian who stops by to pick up Panahi's trash when the camera just happens to be running and we get to know a little something about this utterly charming man's life in the few unguarded moments we get to spend with him. It's a subtle yet potent reminder that no regime however cowardly and repressive can completely dim the human spirit and our basic human need to connect with one another on a personal level.The movie which was spirited out of the country on a flash drive hidden inside a cake functions as a frank political statement for what life is like for film artists living in Iran but equally important it makes the rest of us appreciate the freedoms of expression we all too often take for granted in our own parts of the world  and the need to be ever vigilant in preserving them.".

Iranian film maker Jafar Panahi was punished for producing films that the government of his home land found objectionable with a sentence of six years in jail and a twenty year ban on the writing directing andor production of films. While at home on bail awaiting the ruling of the appeals court he began looking for ways around this. He already had one unproduced screenplay that he had written before the ban which technically did not him from acting or reading screenplays that were already completed. He invited a friend who was a camera man over to tape him reading from and to some extent acting out said screenplay. Technically he was not disobeying the court order and technically This Was Not a Film. Of course these technicalities did not deter the film maker from cautiously smuggling the picture out of the country in a birthday cake before its release on the film festival circuit.What starts out as a mere reading of the completed script ends up being a meditation on art filmmaking Iranian culture and many other things. For fans of the director it is an intriguing look into the mind of a master of his craft. For general audiences it may be a little dry. I found it to be not only an interesting look into Panahi's thought processes but into the plight of a film maker who loves his people but finds the constraints pf the oppressive government that rules them to be too constricting to allow the artistic process to flourish. Furthermore it is a look into how any artist MUST struggle to express themselves no matter how difficult their current circumstances have made that task. If any of these themes sound particularly intriguing by all means check the film out. If it doesn't sound like your particular cup of tea...as I said a little dry...4 out of 5 stars.Review brought to you by www.TheMovieFrog.com  Check us Out!!!".

As such the film was interesting in how it informed me about the situation and the bigger picture. However it did this by simply existing  before I'd even watched a second of it so what would the actual film bring to the table?Well the main thing is to illustrate the restraint of creativity by having Panahi storyboard some of his existing script and also talk about some moments from his previous films. These moments are pretty engaging because he has a passion and he has a vision that comes over in these scenes. Other scenes add to his story and add value in this way however too much of the film just illustrates his time in his house  and his time stuck in the house is dull dull for him and dull for us. In a way it is good to share this but it doesn't engage the audience and by shooting whatever is said or happens then it feels like there is no goal or structure to the film.I can understand the logic and as others have said this is nonviolent protest Panahi has the chance to violently lash out with either direct verbal attacks or with snipe commentary and presentation but he doesn't do this  instead he peacefully sits down in front of the camera and makes this nonfilm as a peaceful protest against the situation not hurting anyone. However this passive approach doesn't engage and it is increasingly dull as it has less and less to say. I know the film was beloved of festivals and lovers of cinema and I would love to claim beauty and emotion and be able to present myself a certain way but this was not the case for me.

	schema:reviewBody "In 2011 Jafar Panahi was arrested in his country of Iran. Apparently the film he was working on offended the wrong people and he was held without charges for some time before anyone was allowed to see him. All he knew is that it offended the regime and they decided to imprison him. Eventually a trial was held and Panahi was sentenced to 6 years in prison as well as a 20 year ban on making movies or leaving the country. Exactly why still wasn't certain and there was an outcry from the international community. It didn't seem to have any effect and his appeal was rejected. He remains in prison today.This is Not a Film was made just before Panahi went back to prison. What it consists of is a lot of raw and rambling footage. While Panahi talks a bit about his situation he really doesn't get into discussing the regime nor his punishment. Instead he does a lot of seemingly mundane things the film begins with him eating breakfast as well as blocking out and explaining what his film would have beenif he could have made it. Additionally friends drop by and spend time with him and talk to the camera man. All this footage was smuggled out of Iran in a hidden flash drive and appears to have been uneditedjust played out in its entirety.From a political standpoint This is Not a Film is intriguing. Your heart really has to go out to Panahi and the situation is just evil. However despite all this the project is a complete bore to watch and desperately needed direction and editing. I would agree that this really isn't a filmand because of this I am declining to give this one a vote. Interesting but also tedious and very very difficult to watch. I really think using some of this footage and then making a documentary about Pahani's legal battle would have been exciting and worth seeing. Perhaps they can do this some time in the future.".

When teenager Ren McCormack and his family move from bigcity Chicago to a small Midwestern town he's in for a real case of culture shock. Though he tries hard to fit in the streetwise Ren can't quite believe he's living in a place where rock music and dancing are illegal. However there is one small pleasure Ariel Moore a troubled but lovely blonde with a jealous boyfriend. And a Biblethumping minister who is responsible for keeping the town dancefree. Ren and his classmates want to do away with this ordinance especially since the senior prom is around the corner but only Ren has the courage to initiate a battle to abolish the outmoded ban and revitalize the spirit of the repressed townspeople. Fastpaced drama is filled with such nowfamous hit songs as the title track and Let's Hear It for the Boy.";

Streetsmart but gentle teenager Ren MacCormackKevin Bacon arrives from the big city with his mother in the backwater town of Bomont.  Enrolling at the local high school he is appalled to discover the town's adults have imposed a law on public dancing and rock music as enforced and practiced by the local preacherJohn Lithgow.  Ren quickly sets about changing things falling in love with the preacher's daughter Ariel Lori Singer in the process.The story is a little unlikely yet it is perfectly suitable for the teenaged audience at which it is pitched.  The script takes some time to explore its simple theme  dancing and rock music and what they symbolise for young people.  Three scenes help to lay this out.  The first sees Ren dancing by himself in a barn the town meeting where Ren presents his case to the townspeople and explains to them the meaning of the dance and the final prom sequence in which the teens of Bomont revel in their newfound liberation.As the leading man Kevin Bacon carries off his role very well.  Ren isn't really a macho hero revelling in coolness he's a downtoearth young man trying to the right thing by his peers.  His romance with Lori Singer's character Ariel is formulaic but perfectly inoffensive.The film could have perhaps done with a little more nastiness to fully contrast against Ren's earnest intentions.  Even Ariel's brutish boyfriendJim Young fails to inject much tension in this respect and the final fistfight between him and Ren comes across as being a bit lame.John Lithgow's characterisation is very good but it is a little too subtle. As the town Reverend and preacher of all things pure and holy his extreme views come across not so much as puritanical just merely uptight.  The change that eventually occurs in his attitudes is hinted at very early on. The result is that he is nowhere near is frightening or intimidating a character as he could have been.  At the same time his troubled relationships with his rebellious daughter and quiet wifeDianne Wiest are very well written and acted.  In these scenes he excels and his character's development seems very natural.On the technical side the film is wellshot and the gloriously Eighties soundtrack complements the proceedings very well bringing the necessary exhuberance and bounce to the whole movie.Whilst Footloose is certainly no masterpiece it succeeds in being a lighthearted knockabout caper and as such is a very enjoyable movie.".

It seems the Reverend Moore John Lithgow of the town's only church has totally banned rock and roll music from the entire town. He has a daughter named Ariel Lori Singer who is basically a hellraiseryet loves her father. Rem decides to stop the ban and bring the town back to life.OKwe're not dealing with reality here at ALL! A town banning rock music entirely is ridiculous and the town only has ONE church? And the game of chicken using tractors was just silly. And don't get me started on how Bacon Singer Chris Penn and Sarah Jessica Parker look WAY too old to be high school studentsSinger was THIRTY when she did this! And how the heck did all the kids from the town learn how to dance so quickly? But as a no brain musical this does work.The opening sequence alone is great it shows various feet dancing to the title tune. Also the acting helps a lot. Bacon is just greathe doesn't take the movie too seriously and gives out a very good performance. He also has a big dance number to a song called Never which is him and THREE different stuntman doing the more unrealistic moves. Singer is too old for her role but she tries. Penn is pretty good as Bacon's best friendhis learning how to dance sequence is a highlight. Parker did this before she was known and she's not bad. Lithgow and Wiest are just great as the Reverend and his wifeWiest has a great scene where she calmly tells him off and Lithgow wisely does not play the Reverend as a onenote character. You see him trying to understand his daughter and slowly realizing that music isn't bad.Sothis is no Singin in the Rain but for a 1980s teen musical it's lots of fun. Great songs too. Just turn off your brain and enjoy!".

A town banning rock music entirely is ridiculous and the town only has ONE church? And the game of chicken using tractors was just silly. And don't get me started on how Bacon Singer Chris Penn and Sarah Jessica Parker look WAY too old to be high school studentsSinger was THIRTY when she did this! And how the heck did all the kids from the town learn how to dance so quickly? But as a no brain musical this does work.The opening sequence alone is great it shows various feet dancing to the title tune. Also the acting helps a lot. Bacon is just greathe doesn't take the movie too seriously and gives out a very good performance. He also has a big dance number to a song called Never which is him and THREE different stuntman doing the more unrealistic moves. Singer is too old for her role but she tries. Penn is pretty good as Bacon's best friendhis learning how to dance sequence is a highlight. Parker did this before she was known and she's not bad. Lithgow and Wiest are just great as the Reverend and his wifeWiest has a great scene where she calmly tells him off and Lithgow wisely does not play the Reverend as a onenote character. You see him trying to understand his daughter and slowly realizing that music isn't bad.Sothis is no Singin in the Rain but for a 1980s teen musical it's lots of fun. Great songs too. Just turn off your brain and enjoy!";

Ren McCormack a.k.a. Kevin Bacon...all breakfast items? what a coincidence...lol was a junior at Elmore City High School. This was a minuscule town with a population of around 750 and there were about 50 or so Baptist churches...so naturally the town's rules and regulations were a bit extreme. There was an archaic town ordinance that banned dancing in public and it hadn't been abolished. Elmore had never had a juniorsenior prom! So my dad fought the system with the help of his best friend Rex Kennedy the junior class president and they were allowed to have a prom for the first time and Elmore has had prom every year since. I don't know who sold the story but unfortunately we got no money lol! There were a few things in the movie that didn't actually happen Ariel Moore Reverend Moore the book burning oh and playing chicken on the tractors! but it is mostly accurate. The kids did have to go to surrounding communities like Pauls Valley and Lindsay to dance and party and my dad drove the exact same car that Ren drives in the movie! So there you have it the REAL story of Footloose. If you haven't seen it...watch it!".

Here's my thoughts on this timeless masterpiece which I brought on DVD this weekMost good movies have a great opening and Footloose is no exception. A bunch of feet dancing showcasing the great footwear of the 80's to the soundtrack song Footloose. Immediately gets you in Kevin Bacon's character has one of the alltime great movie names Ren McCormack Funny how this is probably Kevin Bacon's greatest role maybe only challenged by Flatliners. It's amazing how so many actors never repeat their efforts of their first breakthrough movie See Lou Diamond Phillips Chris Rock and Madonna for starters Also starring in this movie is one of Hollywood's greatest lesser known brothers Sean Penn's brother Christopher. He's way better than Dan Swayze or Charlie Murphy. Kenny Loggins will go down as one of the greatest contributors to movie hit songs ever. Footloose's Footloose and Top Gun's Danger Zone. This is another one of those movies built around a town's overzealous pastor's. Reverand Shaw John Lithgow is even more intense than that guy in Chocolat Great action scene at the start with Lori Singer car surfing watch the slightly impossible way she gets back in the car Also look for the great David Hasselhoff 2 second cameo Great scene where the Rev turns off Lor Singer's ghettoblaster. Everyone stops talking eating and dancing. Possibly slightly dramatic Will Christopher Penn tells us several other towns have also banned dancing. How wasn't that fact used as the premise for heaps more sequels with Ren going from town to town and reviving dance? Each time he'd face a new obstacle. Ren mentions his love for Men at Work and The Police yet he only listens in his car to bad 80's electric rock. Strange. Weird town. Here a face off equals a tractor fight. One of the funniest moments is when Chuck gets onto his tractor and puts I need a hero on on his ghettoblaster. That would be awesome to do at a basketball game when you sub in. Another great Dianne Weist performance. That girl can just capture the whole audience when she wants. Underrated actress. Moment I regret now Christopher Penn's dance sequence to Let's Hear It For The Boy although it's a great sequence in the movie Kevin Bacon's speech to the council was possibly the greatest speech up until that time in cinema history. That is until Sly Stallone raised the bar with his If I Can Change.... in Rocky 4. Which was then overtaken by Matthew McConaghuey's Can you see her... speech in A Time To Kill".

	schema:reviewBody "Ah yes I did travel back to the 80's this morning watching the film Footloose starring then new comer Kevin Bacon. The funny thing is that I performed Footloose in my high school it's now like 5 years later and I realized when I bought this film yesterday that I had never seen the movie. I figured since it was so cheap for 5 bucks on DVD I'd buy it for fun and I watched it this morning. Footloose is an absolute blast of a movie that I'm sure that anyone could get into. Yes it's a bit of a time capsule but it's still all in good fun. I liked how this wasn't necessarily your typical musical it just had an awesome soundtrack with the movie. The story is just so much fun and original you just fall in love with Ren McCormick from the start.Ren is a new guy from the big city of Chicago coming into a small town and now this small town has banished dancing since a big accident that happened years ago that killed several teens after a dance there were drugs and alcohol involved so naturally these folks think that it's all apart of dancing. But Ren's getting a hard time from everyone because of his fun loving nature but he makes friends with a wanna be cow boy Willard. Soon he also becomes the preacher's rebellious daughter Ariel's love interest. He wants the kids to have fun though and wants a big dance thrown for the town and must convince them to cut their foot loose.Footloose is just a fun movie that I'm sure you'll have fun with. It's charming it's funny it's just a blast to watch and it's an 80's classic. The acting was actually pretty good we have a great cast that looked like they enjoyed themselves. Of course we'll always question how the kids just managed the skills of dancing you'll see what I mean when you watch it but it's all good. I would highly recommend this film it's a fun one to watch.

	onyx:emotionText "Ah yes I did travel back to the 80's this morning watching the film Footloose starring then new comer Kevin Bacon. The funny thing is that I performed Footloose in my high school it's now like 5 years later and I realized when I bought this film yesterday that I had never seen the movie. I figured since it was so cheap for 5 bucks on DVD I'd buy it for fun and I watched it this morning. Footloose is an absolute blast of a movie that I'm sure that anyone could get into. Yes it's a bit of a time capsule but it's still all in good fun. I liked how this wasn't necessarily your typical musical it just had an awesome soundtrack with the movie. The story is just so much fun and original you just fall in love with Ren McCormick from the start.Ren is a new guy from the big city of Chicago coming into a small town and now this small town has banished dancing since a big accident that happened years ago that killed several teens after a dance there were drugs and alcohol involved so naturally these folks think that it's all apart of dancing. But Ren's getting a hard time from everyone because of his fun loving nature but he makes friends with a wanna be cow boy Willard. Soon he also becomes the preacher's rebellious daughter Ariel's love interest. He wants the kids to have fun though and wants a big dance thrown for the town and must convince them to cut their foot loose.Footloose is just a fun movie that I'm sure you'll have fun with. It's charming it's funny it's just a blast to watch and it's an 80's classic. The acting was actually pretty good we have a great cast that looked like they enjoyed themselves. Of course we'll always question how the kids just managed the skills of dancing you'll see what I mean when you watch it but it's all good. I would highly recommend this film it's a fun one to watch. Kevin Bacon is totally cool and a must see for Footloose.610";

It really is a crummy movie but oddly engaging... mainly because it is so incredibly surreal and laughable in how it takes itself so seriously.Possible SpoilersI remember even as a kid I thought Holy cow for a town that didn't allow dancing and music for years these kids sure can dance well.  What are even funnier are the people who are in it  Lithgow did this film two years after Garp. Did he think that this was going to be a meaty role? But then again he did willingly star in Third Rock from the Sun. And Dianne Wiest  Woody Allen staple and Oscar winner who has about 4 lines in the movie. Her job is to pretty much look pensive and pious. I don't think I even need to bring up Mr. Kevin Bacon and his goofy dance through the grain mill.While this film is not as inherently horrible as say Xanadu it's also not nearly as hilarious because it takes itself waaaaaaay too seriously. Of course it has its moments especially the part where the dance is beginning and no one is dancing. Why? Let's pretend it's not because Kevin Bacon isn't there in his stupid outfit to scream Let's Daaaaaaaance!!!!!!!! rather is outside getting his ass beat down by the head redneck until he somehow manages to pull out of it and kick said redneck's ass. How the hell did THAT happen? But in reality because the song playing is the Loverboy guy and Ann Wilson's Almost Paradise. I think that as kids if we were sexually oppressed and sheltered and that song came on we wouldn't have danced to that crap song either.  Yes this was the 80's and mid80's to boot so the clothes dancing and dialogue are hilariously dated.  These kids must have somehow obtained pirate copies of Radio Free Solid Gold Dancers or something especially the skinny white kid doing The Robot.This movie is up there with 80's classics' like Flashdance' where we find that while most of us loved the movie as kids we see it through adult eyes twenty years later and realize what our parents probably thought  What a crap movie.'  The difference being our nostalgia sometimes compels us to avoid averting our eyes like a train wreck.Shelly".

	schema:reviewBody "RELEASED IN 1984 and directed by Herbert Ross Footloose chronicles events in the small Western town of Bomont where dancing and loud music have been outlawed because of an accident that killed some kids years earlier. Preacher's daughter Ariel Lori Singer rebels against the legalistic measures while taking liking to a new student from Chicago Ren Kevin Bacon whom her father John Lithgow disapproves of because he perceives Ren as a troublemaker who wants to change the town laws against dancing.Also on hand are Chris Penn as Ren's country boy pal Willard and Sarah Jessica Parker as Ariel's friend Rusty. Penn's character is real fun and Sarah was a real cutie back in '84.I stayed away from this film because of Roger Ebert's scathing review and the fact that I thought the story was about some big city fop moving to a small town and dancing on the tables of the local high school etc. I was wrong and so was Ebert. The protagonist Ren is no dandy in fact he can kick some arse if necessary. And you never see him dancing through the halls of the high school or whatever. He's a professionalclass gymnast and his dynamic solo workout at the factory is simply a matter of blowing off steam which is a form of healthy venting.Although I stayed away from Footloose the film acquired a respectable following and this inspired me to finally view it. I now understand why it's so popular. Footloose has that cinematic magic that pulls you in and gives you a good time. This is just a really entertaining movie with an exceptional soundtrack of songs made for the move with no less than six top 40 hits like the title track by Kenny Loggins and Holding Out for a Hero performed by Bonnie Tyler plus a couple of other significant ditties e.g. Bang Your Head by Quiet Riot.Surprisingly Footloose also has depth and is actually moving. We understand Rev. Shaw Moore's grief but his rigid lawism isn't doing his people or town any good. I like how Shaw isn't made out to be the clichd villain. This is a good man thinking he's doing the right thing for his town and in many ways he is but the legalistic spirit he cops is sapping the life out of him his family his congregants and his town. Does he have the wisdom to see his error and reroute?BOTTOM LINE Footloose is easily the best of the Big Three 80's dance movies and actually made significantly more at the domestic box office than Dirty Dancing 80 million compared to 65 million. It has heart a great cast a superb soundtrack allaround entertainment and reallife mindfood. It's also based on a true story that occurred in Elmore City Oklahoma. Actually there were similar towns with the same laws throughout America and maybe still are. THE FILM RUNS 1 hour 47 minutes and was shot in areas 30 minutes south of Salt Lake City on the eastern side of Utah Lake. WRITER Dean Pitchford.GRADE A".

It's entertaining foottapping and the nowveteran Bacon to keep you glued. Two Thumbs Up!";

'Saturday Night Fever' was a classic but it could be too realistic and dreary in it's approach and the storyline is kind of nonexistent and a little pointless. i loved 'Flashdance' and the original 'Fame' movie but those films as good as they are can be strangely cold and detached and make the viewer feel like a spectator rather than a involved participant. 'Xanadu' is peachy cute and adorable but it 's just that it's for babies. i mean what can you say about a movie where the big love scene is done with cutesy cartoon animals. i like 'Grease' a lot but let's face it that's a pretty silly and brain dead experience. fun though.'Footloose' was one of the only ones that hit some kind of note of perfection. it is sweet without being corny. musical without being too over done. and it makes a strong message without being horribly preachy and a heavyhanded bore. everything in 'Footloose' clicks and works successfully.this is a fun enjoyable film without driving anything into the ground or home too hard.that's rare. also despite underage drinking tobacco usage and mention of premarital sex it's a good coming of age film and not too intense for teens who are weary of too many racy values and notions often injected into teen entertainment.not to mention Kevin Bacon and Chris Penn are really good here. Chris Penn is actually very sexy and good looking here it's hard to believe he became the bloated monster thing he was in later years. Penn remained a good actor but compared with his youthful sexy image here he definitely became a trollish monster in comparison.fun film with a strong Christian base. a teen classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Modern Problems was one of those movies that got a lot of play on HBO when I was a kid in the early 80s and since I was a big Chevy Chase fan at the time I watched it over and over again. Nearly 30 years later the film had all but faded from my memory except for a few random bits so when it turned up on Fox Movie Channel over the weekend I decided to give it a shot.90 minutes later I'm sitting here thinking to myself Wow this was pretty bad wasn't it? and I'm not sure if the film hadn't aged well or if it simply wasn't a very good film to begin with. All I can say is that I remember enjoying it a heck of a lot more as an easiertoimpress 12 year old.Chase plays Max a stressed out Air Traffic Controller who's got serious relationship problems. He's recently broken up with his livein girlfriend and his exwife Mary Kay Place whom he apparently has kept a friendly relationship with is now schtupping that's an exact quote an old friend of his from high school Brian DoyleMurray aka Bill's brother. As if that weren't enough a chance meeting with a leaky Nuclear Waste truck on the highway one night splatters him with radioactive goo and he wakes up the next morning with telekinetic powers.You'd think that this would be a license to do a totally goforbroke slapstick comedy but oddly enough very little is made of Max's newfound abilities till the film is almost over. Chase isn't his usual wildandwacky self either preferring to mope around mooning over his girlfriend Patti D'Arbanville. Eventually the dysfunctional foursome Chase D'arbanville DoyleMurray and Place go off to Murray's beach house to spend the weekend joined by one of Murray's clients an insufferable selfhelp author played by Dabney Coleman. Coleman is the funniest thing in the film as his constant jabs and insults finally poke Chase's character into a full on telekinetic meltdown that can only be stopped by a voodoo ritual ? performed by Murray's Haitian housekeeper Nell Carter.Modern Problems tries to be quirky and wacky but spends most of the film falling flat on its face. It's got a decent cast and an interesting premise but its greatest sin is that it casts a gifted comic like Chase and then tells him to be morose and unfunny for much of the run time till he finally explodes towards the end.There are a few good bits Chase using his power to give a guy a massive nosebleed in the middle of a swanky restaurant is a highlight as is the entire voodoo scene but otherwise Modern Problems isn't very modern anymore. Easily skippable even for hardcore Chevy Chase fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all it is worth nothing that director Ken Shapiro seemingly hasn't been employed since this nearcatastrophe was released in 1981. It's pretty safe to say that's a bad sign. Secondly even a stellar cast cannot make a movie very good what I like to call Mars Attacks! syndrome. Now that I have gotten that out of the way a quick synopsis  Chevy Chase that in itself is a bad sign stars as an air traffic controller who after an encounter with nuclear waste acquires telekinetic powers which he uses against his romantic rivals. The premise in itself is engaging and open to the possibility of great comedy. So what happened?Well Ken Shapiro could be blamed. The direction is sloppy actually it is downright pathetic. The pacing is WAY too slow the action is ineptly handled and many of the actors seem bored. And worst of all the special effects are woeful...I haven't seen so much camera equipment onscreen since the glory days of Ed Wood. Case in point...the scene with the FlyingAirplaneAshtray don't ask where some strange large object is obviously present in the closeups holding up the Ashtray next to the camera. I've made home movies with better effects.What about the actors? Well Nell Carter is an absolute hoot she deserves better. And Dabney Coleman is entirely in his element here as a shady egotistical author. Brian Doyle Murray and Mary Kay Place are also entertaining. Patti D'Arbanville is a bit lacking in comedic talent she is given nothing more to do than pout and screech. But the real problem here is Chase. He is just going through the motions here playing the hapless bumbler bit to death and looking very bored doing it. There is no life to his performance and it grinds the movie to a halt.True there are some funny moments here...Nell Carter gets most of the laughs in a woefully small role the scenes involving Chase's romantic rival Barry Mitch Kreindel are pretty amusing and one reviewer here has already mentioned Chase's throwaway line Smells like feet which for some reason made me laugh hysterically...but the funny moments are few and far between. There is so much BAD to sort through to get to the GOOD stuff and it just isn't worth the time and trouble. Perhaps in better hands Modern Problems could have been a good movie. This certainly isn't it.".

One night while driving his car behind a truck the context in the tanker nuclear waste ends up on him giving the abilities of telekinesis and a nice green glow. He then begins use this power in ridding any sort of obstacles that get in the way of reuniting with his exgirlfriend which is beautifully played by Patti D'Arbanville.With a better script which includes plenty of sexual innuendo it could have been so much more but while the cast featuring Dabney Coleman Nell Carter Mary Kay Place and Brian DoyleMurray do the best. The onejoke script lets them down. The humour is mainly off the mark as it never rises above the superfluous material and characters are not particularly engaging especially Chase's loathsome character. It's a story were the humour contributes rather than just being there for the sake of it however it's a awkward mess of staged ideas and plastered visual gags. The special effects are modest pacing is flat style seems bland and the film looks quite murky. There's a real lack of passion but director Ken Shapiro is saved by a few amusing brisk but enjoyable comedic inclusions. But in the end these peculiar touches just weren't enough.Far from a laughriot with a little too much dead space but 'Modern Problems' remains barely a passable throwaway.".

The sound is plain old Mono and it's alright if nothing else though the dialogue has very heavy use of ADR. A trailer and TV spot are included.

	schema:reviewBody "Modern Problems 1981 Dir Ken Shapiro  Cast Chevy Chase Patti D'Arbanville Mary Kay Place Dabney Coleman Nell Carter Innovative high strung comedy that takes average daily issues and jacks them up on steroids. Chevy Chase plays airline controller Maxwell Fiedler whose girlfriend moves out because of his jealousy issues. Central plot regards the telekinesis power he develops after some sort of toxic spill from a truck. The film fails to have fun with this and instead is reduced in a dark tone that doesn't work. Chase has fun moments where he arrives at a restaurant and cause his exgirlfriend's date to have a massive nose bleed or the ballet that he totally wrecks. Patti D'Arbanville plays the girlfriend whom he is trying to win back. Mary Kay Place has a nifty supporting role as Chase's exwife who drags him to a nightclub where he unfortunately encounters D'Arbanville with a cocky date. Dabney Coleman plays an egotistic novelist who insults Chase and makes a play for D'Arbanville to the point of disrobing casually in her presence. They all get together at a beach house where the telekinesis hits a high sending Coleman through the ceiling. Nell Carter has an idiotic role as a maid doing voodoo on Chase but to no avail. While it is not as funny as it could be and certainly misses a grand opportunity the theme addresses stress and all other modern problems that lead to bizarre incidents. Score 7   10".

I had originally taped it on DVR and afterward I found myself keeping it and not deleting it like I had originally planned.Modern Problems has Chevy Chase as a guy who has an extremely bad day. However as the Hollywood rules go dump some toxic waste on him and give him some supernatural powers. Clich I know. But oh so fun. In movies like this you see the person becoming some sort of superhero. This movie breaks away from the clich and has the guy act out revenge towards the people who have harmed him not to mention giving his girlfriend one hell of an orgasm.The end is a little weird and definitely stupid but I couldn't help but laugh at the wackiness of it all. And the message at the end if you haven't been disgusted by it just yet just goes to show that there is always someone who will love you.Patti D'Arbanville also surprised me. She wasn't bad at all. She was pretty good. She's a great crier and shows great emotion when she acts.510. Simply because it had potential but someone completely missed it.".

He was your typical 80s preteen  teenager who watched Fridays and SNL and whatever else that altered the comic tastes of America with evening prime time television. Me I had a hard time understanding what he found funny and this movie falls into that category.Okay there's a couple of funny moments in this film but most of the humor is directed at the over the top crowd who like their irreverence taken to the nth degree with little regard for what people actually find funny.What those people don't understand is that this film it's core sub plot that acts as the blueprint for the script is about a man suffering from delusional disorder believing or convinced that he has special or magical powers and enacts his revenge to get the woman he lost.Much of Hollywood uses psychiatric andor psychological formulas to write scripts and here we have a borderline schizophrenic who was put in a delusional state to relax him and not make him a menace to society. Only here it's dressed up as Chevy Chase being a Reagan era air traffic controller who hasn't been fired who finds himself in a rut.Enter some quasiscience fiction and suddenly he finds himself having telekinetic abilities. In psychiatric terms this is usually done by shadowing the subject andor drugging him up and creating situations that are designed to make him believe that he or she has special abilities. It's usually reserved for those who can be seen as a benefit to society i.e. relations of wealthy or privileged classes or sponsored by companies who invest in such individuals expecting to gain on the investment.For Chevy Chase it's about going after Patti D'Arbanville's character the lovely Darcy. Does he succeed? You'll have to see the movie to find out.The film itself because of its very nature is irreverent in the highest degree but also a bit crass and marginally tasteless. For all that I did laugh a few times though not many. I think one of the issues is that mister Chase himself really isn't the equivalent of Don Knotts or any of the other classic era comedic actors. Still he seems to fit within this movie and performs his roll adequately.If nothing else this film gives a window to what the teenagers and 20something youth crowd were viewing in the 1980s as comedy. It's a kind of comedic indicator if you will of society. The film wasn't a huge hit or so I recall but gained a level of notoriety as being funny almost a cult classic.For all that the cast does quite a good job the over all production values are pretty high for this kind of film and all in all its an okay production but the story material and the comedy itself tread Bmovie territory.Maybe see it once and see what you think.The top user review for this film has got it partially right in terms of his opinion on the humor stylings".

	schema:headline " Not One of Chevy's Best But Not One of His Worst";
	schema:reviewBody "Chevy Chase plays a depressed air traffic controller who acquires telekinetic powers after glowing green nuclear waste liquid from a tanker truck on the highway splashes out onto him. Groove Tube director Ken Shapiro has assembled a quality cast and the premise generates some amusing moments in this average romantic comedy. The logic between our hero's affliction and the powers that he gets seems fractured. Nuclear waste usually precipitates debilitating diseases rather than spectacular telekinetic powers. The first scene at the air traffic control center is reminiscent of a Saturday Night Live skit with everybody preoccupied with other matters than the aircraft they are supervising in the skies above New York City. After Max Chevy Chase of Foul Play gets off duty and heads home our illfated protagonist has to contend with mechanical problems with his car. First he retracts his moon roof and the handle comes off in his fist. Second he then finds himself jammed between trucks and the truck in front of him is loaded down with caged chickens. Third chicken feathers swirl onto his windshield through his moon roof and onto his face. He tries to remove the feathers from his windshield with washer fluid but he showers himself with his own water. Clearly this scene anticipates Max's encounter with the nuclear waste truck. Afterward he has to deal with the departure of his girlfriend Darcy Patti D'Arbanville and this predicament pushes him over the edge into massive depression. One of the funnier moments has Max using his powers when he gets upset about a rival Barry has convinced Darcy to go out on a date. While Max and Darcy are arguing over her date with Barry Max's rage grows to the point that he makes a C47 ashtray fly around the room. Predictably Max manages to win Darcy back with his special telekinetic powers. First he induces a case of nosebleed on her stuckup boyfriend Barry Mitch Kreindel of Being There to force him to leave the restaurant. Later he sabotages Barry's opera making the lead dancer plunge off the stage at one point during his routine. Afterward once Barry has taken Darcy home Max steps in and takes Darcy to bed and gives her orgasm after orgasm before admitting that he isn't doing it. The major setpiece takes place as a Victorian beach house where Max and Darcy are invited by an old friend Brian Brian DoyleMurray who is a decorated Vietnam veteran confined to a wheelchair after an explosion crippled him following a sexual encounter with a Vietnamese woman. As it turns out the enemy woman left a bomb under his bed after they had sex. Brian meets Max's exwife Lorraine Mary Kay Place one afternoon while Max is discussing his loss of Darcy with him. Lorraine falls head over heels in love with Brian after they meet at a gay bar where Brian is holding a publicity party for his bestselling selfhelp author Mark Winslow Dabney Coleman of 9 to 5 who is so conceited that he thinks all women crave him. Coleman excels at being obnoxious and has a funny moment when he bares his butt to seduce Darcy. Darcy doesn't take the bait because she has refocused her sights on Max. At the beach house Max goes nuts turns luminous green and behaves as if he were possessed. He dangles a white mouse in the air and then sniffs all of the white powder that superstitious Dorita Nell Carter a Haitian maid from Port Au Prince has sprinkled around his bed to confine him to the mattress. This is probably the best scene after the opera scene. Darcy struggles to reassure Max on the roof of the beach house that she genuinely is concerned about him. Eventually Dorita is stricken with the same powers. Abruptly the film concludes as if Shapiro and coscenarists Tom Sherohman and Arthur Sellers exhausted their creativity. Dabney Coleman adopts a phony accent that makes him sound funny and Max subjects Mark's character to one humiliation after another during a dinner table scene. Chase delivers another lowkey laidback performance where he relies on his deadpan behavior for maximum impact. The cast is charismatic but the comedy is sporadic. Modern Problems boasts several goofy moments but it isn't the tourdeforce that The Groove Tube was. Altogether Modern Problems isn't Chase's best but neither is it is worst.".

Of course that deal was sealed long ago...its only a matter of time until they dig up and publish my history of my porn site visits in Google archives...so what the heck here goes.I could NOT stop laughing. Did the other reviews mention casting? It is brilliant...who better to cast as a moody feckless scorned lover who happens to be an air traffic controller than Chevy Chase...add to his performance that of Mitch Kreindel as the more feckless foil and you have a recipe for doubledover laughter that would make you glad you wore your depends that day if only they had them back in the 80's when this film was first screened. I loved the telekinesis device especially the moment when an airplane ashtray complete with roaring engines and laden with cigarette butts flies across the airport employee lounge and crashes in flames into a wall poster featuring some alpine peak. This is our first clue that Chevy has developed special powers the rest is charming and fun thanks to the great cast including Dabney Coleman Mitch Kreindel Patti D'Arbanville and Nell Carter. Detractors will say have said otherwise. All that critical nit picking is only detail. Years later when I think of this film I smile. How bad can that be?".

	schema:reviewBody "Flight of the Phoenix is at best a soso remake of the fine Robert Aldrich adventure classic from1965. The plot in both films is fairly simple and straightforward. After a plane crash lands in the Gobi Desert the survivors hit upon the notion of rebuilding the damaged vehicle in the hopes of flying it back to civilization. Dennis Quaid assumes the role originally filled by Jimmy Stewart of the pilot who against all odds endeavors to lead his passengers to safety.Although the new version follows the original fairly closely in terms of both character delineation and plot development the story doesn't seem quite as fresh today as it did when we first encountered it close to 40 years ago. Perhaps what's missing is the guiding hand of a master craftsman like Aldrich to really deliver the goods John Moore a far less distinguished director is manning the controls here. This Flight feels awfully predictable and rote as we plow our way through each of the various survival threats rescue attempts and internecine personal conflicts that are standard in all such tales of survivors stranded in a hostile environment. Each of the characters steps out of the shadows to have his or her own Moment in the Sun yes in this version there is actually a woman aboard before receding dutifully into the background to allow the next person to do the same. About the only intriguing element in the story is the fact that the main character the pilot of the plane has to actually be talked into participating in the Quixotic rescue plan. Thus he is a leader and a hero more by default than by design.Although the crash itself is fairly impressive from a technical standpoint  despite a rather phonylooking computergenerated sandstorm that brings the plane down  once we end up on the desert floor the movie doesn't do a particularly effective job conveying the truly grueling nature of the predicament these individuals are facing. We never really get the sense that they are just a few water droplets away from dying of thirst or heatstroke. Moreover the feat that they are able to accomplish seems barely credible  from a sheer mechanical engineering standpoint  given the lack of resources and expertise with which the group has to cope. The main weakness with a film like Flight of the Phoenix is that when the plane goes down we're stuck in the desert right along with the characters and if they don't have anything particularly interesting to say to one another we can feel just as stranded as they.Thus despite a few quality moments this Flight never manages to get off the runway. Check out the original instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you are planning to see this movie don't bother. It's a poor remake of a very good old movie. As a pilot and from a pilot's point of view the crash scene was completely unbelievable. If you aren't a pilot you may enjoy the crash scenes but I can tell you that the plane would have been in tiny pieces before it ever hit the ground. Once it hit the first sand dune it would have broken up into small chunks after the first ground strike.The interaction between the actors was forced and never really developed.The most unbelievable part came when yet another! freak sand storm comes up and the Phoenix is sitting on the sand and starts to lift up as if ready to fly. A few moments later you see the fuselage of the original plane rolled over by the wind. Yet the Phoenix doesn't get blown away even though it's got wings the fuselage doesn't and it's trying to fly as the wind picks up.Next we see our heroes sitting on the sand and the Phoenix is almost completely buried but the sand blown around by the sand storm.Quite dramatically the decision is made to dig the plane out of the sand. Give thought to trying to dig a 2 bedroom house out of a 10 foot drift of sand after spending a week or two in the desert with little or no water a few cans of peaches and you have an idea of the task facing our heroes. To get an idea just go out in your yard and dig a hole 2 feet deep and 2 feet square. It will take you a LONG time to do it. Imagine doing it under the conditions described above! Yeah right! The next scene shows the Phoenix dramatically out of the sand clean and undamaged and ready to fly! Once again yeah right.Finally our heroes get the plane started with a hoard of Mongolian Marauders chasing them into flight. Of course there is the perfunctory scene when a cable to the rudder is shot away by automatic rifle fire and the engineer has to climb back on the fuselage to dramatically fix it while keeping from falling off or getting shot by the hoard of horsemen. Ho hum.And of course we all fly off into the sunset.Get a copy of the Jimmy Stewart version. A much better film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here's just a few things that make no sense...1. They fly out of a mine site in Mongolia Gobi desert  frozen high altitude wastelands. But they crash in a hot sandy desert that looks pretty much like the Sahara where they are all running around in short sleeves. How did that happen? They flew from central Asia to Africa? The Gobi just got 40 degrees hotter with a whole lot of sand? 2. Aeronautical dude says the plane is overweight. If that's so how did it get out of a high altitude airfield in the fist place? And it didn't just creep off the ground if ripped into the air at a ridiculous rate of climb.3. Last night when the new plane is ready it gets completely buried in a sand storm except for the tail. Damn! What a sandstorm. A whole plane buried in one night. But even more amazing they dig it out in one day using only one shovel. So that's say .... a couple of thousand tons of sand? And that's not even counting the runway which presumably would have been buried too.4. They decide to earth the plane in an electrical storm. Well that would make it a brilliant path to ground for an electric strike ensuring that it gets completely destroyed. Passenger jets get struck by lighting quite often but they always survive because the lighting doesn't have a path to earth through the jet. Grounding of planes is to prevent static discharge during fuelling not to dissipate a lighting strike.5. The petrol cans explode when some sparks drift onto them. Don't they always on Hollywood? dangerous part of the world. Petrol does not explode unless it is in the exact ratio of 14.71 with air. That's why cars need a carburettor. Otherwise it just burns. Anyway setting fire to the spillage on the outside of a can won't make the contents inside it burn let alone explode.6. An exploration site gets shut down but the workers don't know until some some dickhead pilot turns and up says he's there to take them home? Yeh right that would happen.Tons of other unbelievable nonsense. Not worth spending any more time to write about it. I got ripped off with this DVD. Worst movie in years.".

Damn! What a sandstorm. A whole plane buried in one night. But even more amazing they dig it out in one day using only one shovel. So that's say .... a couple of thousand tons of sand? And that's not even counting the runway which presumably would have been buried too.4. They decide to earth the plane in an electrical storm. Well that would make it a brilliant path to ground for an electric strike ensuring that it gets completely destroyed. Passenger jets get struck by lighting quite often but they always survive because the lighting doesn't have a path to earth through the jet. Grounding of planes is to prevent static discharge during fuelling not to dissipate a lighting strike.5. The petrol cans explode when some sparks drift onto them. Don't they always on Hollywood? dangerous part of the world. Petrol does not explode unless it is in the exact ratio of 14.71 with air. That's why cars need a carburettor. Otherwise it just burns. Anyway setting fire to the spillage on the outside of a can won't make the contents inside it burn let alone explode.6. An exploration site gets shut down but the workers don't know until some some dickhead pilot turns and up says he's there to take them home? Yeh right that would happen.Tons of other unbelievable nonsense. Not worth spending any more time to write about it. I got ripped off with this DVD. Worst movie in years.";

	schema:reviewBody "I've not seen the original before you ask but I do know of it and quite frankly I'm sick fed up of remakes. Yet there was something that attracted me to this story the cast was one. A nice multinational crew featuring Dennis Quaid Hugh Laurie and Tony Curran and the fact that it's a very simple story with nothing other than desert and cast to deal with. It kind of gave me the feeling of a slightly larger Ice Cold in Alex.Unfortunately I was watching it on Sky and at my parents that means no surround sound and the picture was cropped damn Sky. However we didn't seem to lose much of the feel of the movie.The cinematography value here is high. The movie looks great it does seem as though they have high production values. The opening sequences with the plane flying over sand dunes are superb and then when it hits the storm the effects are excellent and it's at that point the action really kicks in before that we were introduced to the varied multinational characters and their initial roles. The crash sequence is well filmed and edited and builds the tension superbly all the shots here are believable and have you on the edge of your seat. After this the action really dies down for most of the movie only restarting at the end when the believability also flies out the window in favour of Hollywood action.Quaid is very good in this movie an actor who I wish we really did see more of. The rest of the cast is an interesting ensemble from Curran to Kevork Malikyan and it works well. I know that when I see a lone Scotsman in a movie it usually grates like hell with me partly because they are usually played by Americans but also because it just doesn't seem to fit here it does because the entire cast is a mishmash of people. It really does feel like a group of remote oil workers.The plane designer played by Giovanni Ribisi is a terrible character slimy loathsome and someone that you would expect to be a serial killer. Ribisi plays him really well and through the movie the tension is built in a series of near clashes between characters until the final clash which turns into a satisfying climax for the character and the movie.Disappointingly the ending is very formulaic and makes all the Hollywood bells and buzzers flash and bleep therefore making the Studios and their misinformed test screenings happy. Through the movie a band of vicious Nomads are mentioned and a small clash occurs between some characters and a Nomad scouting party but apart from this they are pretty much useless and are merely a very poor tension building device. This is surprising when the rest of the tension building moments are so much better formed.That said there are some idiotic moments where you just cannot believe the characters and the decisions they are making never mind some of the outcomes. My father was almost shouting at the screen in despair.All said it is an entertaining and effective movie just suspend your disbelief concerning the reality of the situation after the crash and grit your teeth through the Hollywood ending and you've got yourself a good movie.".

His role was combined in the characters of several of the cast in the remake.Now I am not saying this is a bad film. I view it as a companion piece to the original. The special effects were awesome. Being trapped in the Gobi or Sahara as in the original was more meaningful to me when I saw the vast desolation of the desert in this remake. See the original Phoenix for its wonderful character study and see the remake for it's special effects and you have one fabulous picture. The original Phoenix stands on its own. My recommendation is see the original and then view the remake.".

We were curious as to how the great screen play by Lukas Heller had been adapted by Scott Frank. The film directed by John Moore has taken the action from the Sahara to the Gobi desert. The result is a thriller that has some good moments but in the end doesn't improve in the better made earlier film.The scene for this new version takes us to a remote spot in Mongolia where a woman engineer Kelly and her crew are evacuated because the company she works for decides there is no oil to be found in that remote spot. Next we watch as an aircraft piloted by Frank Towns arrives to take everybody to Shanghai China. A mysterious man Elliott who doesn't have anything to do with the oil company comes along for the flight to China.On the way the plane suffers an accident caused by the terrible sand storm affecting the region. They land on the desert with only minor casualties. The aircraft seems to be out of commission but Elliott who tells the stranded passengers that the plane could be rebuilt gets to act as the leader of the whole operation. In fact he is an engineer who knows how to do it. Since they have the proper tools they begin to transform the wrecked cargo plane into something that resembles a toy model which Elliott promises will fly. Little prepares us for what really turns out to be Elliott's real job.The film has some moments but the direction doesn't take it anywhere. The cast does what it can with the material they have been given. Dennis Quaid Giovanni Ribisi are seen as Capt. Towns and Elliott. Miranda Otto a good actress plays Kelly who didn't exist in the early version.Seen as a curiosity it will entertain but for a better take on the same subject a look at the former version will be more satisfying.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have the greatest respect for producers and directors. Regardless of the quality of their work they must struggle to bring their personal vision to film and this requires intelligence technical proficiency artistic sense and the skill of a great storyteller. So why do so many directors do remakes of classic movies that deliberately do away with the qualities that made the earlier versions as great as they are? Why not fiddle with the less important aspects of the movie? In the original Flight of the Phoenix there are several aspects of the film that are essential to the movie the complete absence of women the contrast of the claustrophobic setting of the crash site against the vastness of the desert the lack of backstory for the characters the revealing of the hidden hopes and fears of the characters through pure dialogue and the total isolation of the men from outside influences with the exception of the encounter with the Bedouins. The 2004 version of the movie basically does away with all of these elements and the result is not positive.The original movie was basically a stage play with limited special effects and a setting that could easily be reproduced on a stage. I don't believe that John Moore improves the movie in any way other than the introduction of some brief but impressive special effects.I also have to point out that some of the reviewers have obviously never seen the original 1965 version or if they did they paid little attention to it. One reviewer for example observes that the pilot Frank Towns has to be talked into leading the effort to rescue themselves suggesting that this was somehow a new element in the story. Fans of the 1965 version will recall that this was a major plot element wherein Towns did not wish to be responsible and did not believe that the effort to rebuild the plane would be successful.As many others have said see the original first. Then if you really want the 21st century special effects see the 2004 version.Additional Comment I just watched this again because a friend had not seen it.

Although an outlandish idea it may be their only legitimate chance at survival.The plot is exactly the same as the original version with a few notable differences It takes place about 40 years later it includes a woman Miranda Otto it features a more racially mixed cast and it takes place in the Gobi Desert rather than the Libyan Desert although it was shot in Namibia while the original was filmed in the deserts of SE California.I'm not one of those people who hates the very idea of remakes. I'm open to filmmakers taking a heralded classic and modernizing it like the excellent remake of The Parent Trap. That's what we get with this remake of Flight of the Phoenix except that it's not excellent. But it's not bad either. Although there are some new touches that are as good or even superior to the original Like Liddle's powerful line to Towns in the debris field as well as the confrontation with the Mongols sequence this modernization ultimately pales in the shadow of the original. Why? There's less focus on character development and therefore the movie has less interesting characters. Instead the filmmakers opt for scenes that might maintain the attention of those with ADHD like an explosion scene a lightning storm sequence and a dubious attack by the Mongol smugglers at the very end shouldn't they have attacked while they were pulling the aircraft? Or earlier?. But the biggest negative is that the movie just lacks the brilliant dramatic flow of the original.The film runs 113 minutes.FINAL WORD This would be a better film for anyone who hasn't seen the original but if you've seen the '65 version it's just so mediocre by comparison. Still it's worth checking out if like me you love survival films. And it is interesting to see a different take on the same basic story.GRADE C".

The crash of an airplane in the Mongolian desert forces the captain Dennis Quaid and his passengersa crew of laidoff oil workersto band together behind a mysterious stranger Giovanni Ribisi to rebuild a new plane out of the parts from the wreck while fighting off sandstorms and desert smugglers. The plot sounds okay and with a decent cast this could have been a decent movie. Unfortunately they take a classic film and ruin it. The original had a lot of suspense and entertaining moments but the remake is very predictable and has little to no entertaining scenes. The dialog is lame and the action is okay but nothing special. If you have seen the trailer then you have seen the film as they spoil the ending for you and pretty much everything else. The acting isn't that good either as Dennis Quaids performance is pretty lifeless. The characters are all boring as they are no interesting people and I started not to care about them. The ending is ridiculous and it also leaves a few unanswered questions. The direction is okay but the film is still pretty bad. Rating 310 there's very little reason to see this film and I recommend you skip this and rent the original.".

	schema:reviewBody "The original Flight of the Phoenix is a classic film for many good reasons. The people who have remade it in 2004 have mostly failed to understand those reasons and have made a disappointing movie where a very good one should have been easily within their grasp.My first complaint is the general dumbing down of the plot elements. The story line is pretty much intact but the writers obviously are either stupid themselves or believe that the viewers are.Second even while the story is dumbed down the film makers have failed to present some basic points in ways that were clearly dealt with in the original. For example the initial mysterious and unexplained shot of the starter cartridge for the motor while an otherwise normal takeoff is performed this would be a good time for them to explain how these old engines often needed to be started using modified shotgun style explosives then later when the engine of the Phoenix is started their use is not really made clear. People were leaving the theater asking what happened to the shotgun shells. How dumb of the film makers to screw things like this up so badly.Third the disaster level is sensationalized to a point far beyond reason. A simple sand storm in the original was plenty effective and suitably scary to bring the plane down in the desert. Here they have to whip up such a stupendous storm that you'd think the world was coming to an end. Also the plane gets buried in sand twice this is stupid because the work involved dwarfs the work of making a new plane which should be the focus of the movie and because when they dig the plane out they also seem to have dug out all of the surrounding desert as well. This is just godawful stupid. And when the Phoenix is taking off a character gets to crawl out on the tail to splice a broken cable as if just getting it off the ground was not exciting enough which would be pretty much impossible just down wind from the prop wash on a plane that is at takeoff speed. Furthermore piloting such a contraption should take all of a pilot's attention but here everyone is highfiving goofing around and generally NOT PAYING ATTENTION the moment that the plane lifts off. Insanely stupid! What did they get right? Well they obviously made a study of key plot points and made sure they had them in the new movie as well even while they failed at everything else around. They got the interaction between the pilot and the designer right the bit about special water usage the alarming one blast to clear out the cylinders the point where the pilot has to concede that he is no longer in charge in order to keep the designer happy. The plane both before and after the crash look great.What else could they have done away with and simultaneously improved the movie? Well the local bandits were a distraction the original movie barely had the local Arabs and it was not a major plot point. They could really have left out the jerkily albeit currently trendy missingframe editing in the 'exciting' spots. And they could have certainly left out the distracting and irritating rock sound track movie soundtracks are supposed to heighten the emotions or otherwise add something NOT call attention to themselves. And having the plane fall into a canyon only to swoop out at highGs was another illconceived addition.My only hope is that people will go see this one and in the course of doing so will hear that there is a much better version out there from 1965 IN WHICH THEY FLEW THE PHOENIX WITHOUT SPECIAL EFFECTS OK so it crashed later then will rent or buy the excellent original and be reintroduced to a real classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Back in 1964 Robert Aldrich stranded James Stewart Richard Attenborough and Peter Finch in the desert after their plane crashed in the film Flight of the Phoenix. The movie was about a group of unluckies that band together to rebuild a new plane from the working parts of the wreckage. The film was fairly well done for its time and even grabbed two Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actor Ian Bannen and Best Film Editing.But were we really lobbying for a remake? Was there a demand or a group of picket sign wielding stampeders outside the studio office demanding that an update be greenlit? Who knows? What we do know is that some 40 years later fairly untested director John Moore was given a hefty budget to remake the film appropriately named Flight of the Phoenix. Surprisingly however is that the film was a remake in almost every sense. With the exception of the plane crash to which I give credit as being one of the best ever filmed the movie updates the language but everything else is relatively the same. Where in the original there was such laughable dialogue as 'Mr. Towns you behave as if stupidity were a virtue.' in the remake we get equally giggle generating script excerpts as 'I think a bee stung going in your big dumb ass.' Hmmmm. Updated indeed. If a remake is suppose to be bigger badder and louder I suppose Flight of the Phoenix 2004 fits the bill. But you can also add stupider to the mix since the writers decided not to spend any time in developing characters outside of the 40 year old script that is unless you consider the crew dancing in the face of death to Outkasts' Hey Ya in a ridiculous MTV moment. And that is very irritating.We had four decades to fix the kinks and iron out the wrinkles to make a superior film of what is an interesting concept. Instead we get clich after clich and improbable situations that are laughable to today's audiences. What do I mean as laughable you say? Well how about an electrical storm that ends as soon as it hits the only thing that is important to the survivors. Or how about a group of nomads that can attack at any time but wait until the exact second that the newly built plane decides to take off.. I can go on but what's the point.Flight of the Phoenix was a major disappointment to the holiday theatre going experience. Change that. Flight of the Phoenix was a major annoyance during the holiday theatre going experience. Where psychologists agree that hostages and their captors develop a bond over a period of time it is evident in this circumstance that people in need of each other for survival will begin to fight over petty trivialities if not dancing to the latest pop hit on the radio. All this did was leave me to care nothing about any of the characters and I couldn't give a rats ass whether they survived or not.Flight of the Phoenix therefore falls in the same category as Get Carter Sabrina The Jackal. as films that were just mediocre when released decades ago and are amazingly given more of a disservice in the remakes for the new MTV generation. We didn't ask for a Phoenix remake and frankly my life is worse off because of it. And for that. I give it one and half stars not even enough juice to get it off the tarmac.www.gregsrants.com".

Instead we get clich after clich and improbable situations that are laughable to today's audiences. What do I mean as laughable you say? Well how about an electrical storm that ends as soon as it hits the only thing that is important to the survivors. Or how about a group of nomads that can attack at any time but wait until the exact second that the newly built plane decides to take off.. I can go on but what's the point.Flight of the Phoenix was a major disappointment to the holiday theatre going experience. Change that. Flight of the Phoenix was a major annoyance during the holiday theatre going experience. Where psychologists agree that hostages and their captors develop a bond over a period of time it is evident in this circumstance that people in need of each other for survival will begin to fight over petty trivialities if not dancing to the latest pop hit on the radio. All this did was leave me to care nothing about any of the characters and I couldn't give a rats ass whether they survived or not.Flight of the Phoenix therefore falls in the same category as Get Carter Sabrina The Jackal. as films that were just mediocre when released decades ago and are amazingly given more of a disservice in the remakes for the new MTV generation. We didn't ask for a Phoenix remake and frankly my life is worse off because of it. And for that. I give it one and half stars not even enough juice to get it off the tarmac.www.gregsrants.com";

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Based solely on its own merits meaning that I am discounting the fact that it is a remake and viewing it on its own plot story characters and direction This movie was awful. The premise began well alongside interesting film work involving great shutter and simple fast flash effects the movie stood to be interesting. The characters were all introduced well and most showed promise for future plot. Sadly it all ended there. The characters remained vacant with plenty of time for actual development. Also a female lead was prodded into the realm of a Quaid love interest but just as most things did in this movie it died before the development phase began. While I am a fan of Giovanni Ribisi his character was overwritten and overplayed as a stereotypical ubergeek which would have been acceptable if more history had been plugged into the role. He just wandered onto the oil site on vacation? It makes little sense as the place is in the middle of a massive dessert. This point also leads to the so called Amazing Plot Twist. He doesn't design planes he designs SCALE PLANES!!! Oh good god all hope was lost. That was barely a twist it wasn't even a waltz. Then the final insult to injury this movie goes from a possible psychological thriller pitting minds against one another in a struggle for survival to a pitiful action film with the lack of character and conflict development and the addition of the conflict with the Mongolian Nomads. All this side of the story served was for added pressure to get the plane off the ground as if there wasn't enough with the looming dehydration that was heavily played through the entire story. All in all this movie fails to stand up to its potential. Weak acting for most of the cast. Poor character development. Unneeded villain additions. An unimpressive plot twist. I give this movie a 3 out of 10.".

It is after all a remake and remakes and sequels rarely do as good as the originalwith the exception of Spiderman 2 and Shrek 2 and some others. But i think this movie did a fine job balancing the new actors in the same storyline. The story is about a group of oil drillers who after their company is shut down has to be flown out. En route the plane encounters a storm and crashes in the desertmiles away from civilization. Giovanni Ribisi gives an awesome performance as Elliot the passenger who has a plan to rebuild a new plane out of the wreckage of the old one using only what they brought with them. Dennis Quiad also does a good job portraying Captain Towns the pilot. His character is the one everyone looks to after the plane crashes and although uneasy about everyone looking to him manages to get them out safely. The twist in the movie is 40 yrs old but when it is finally revealed in the film the actors do a great job reacting to it. Flight of the Phoenix did have some flaws like the layout of the Gobi desert and the damage to the plane but all in all i would give it a 7.5 out of 10. I would also recommend the originaljust so you could see the background of how the movie was made in the past.".

No one who has seen this movie could forget her scene as she climbs the cliff. Other memorable moments take place in New Zealand with the earthquake and tidal wave or the attack of the Maoris.

	schema:headline " Two sisters and their saga get the MGM treatment";
	schema:reviewBody "Lana Turner as Marianne marries her sister Marguerite's beau in Green Dolphin Street an MGM extravaganza but in black and white that probably was meant to equal Gone With the Wind. The story concerns a family the Patourels living on the Channel Islands. Their mother Gladys Cooper was forbidden to marry the love of her life Frank Morgan and instead married Octavius Edmund Gwenn and has two daughters. Morgan returns to the area with a son William Richard Hart and both of the girls go after him though he falls in love with Marguerite Donna Reed. Eventually he ends up in New Zealand and in a drunken stupor writes to Octavius for his daughter's hand in marriage  except he writes the name Marianne not Marguerite thereby changing his life and the lives of the sisters forever.The film is a bit long but holds the viewer once it gets going. Its main problem when it's seen today is the painted backdrops and fake scenery all extremely obvious. When one compares the backdrops and scenery of the earlier Gone with the Wind to this it's obvious that Selznick demanded a lot more care from his artists than did the powers that be on this film.There are several striking scenes but the best is Donna Reed climbing a tunnel inside of a cave to escape the rising tide. The earthquake scenes and the Maori attacks are also excellent and exciting.The role of Marianne is huge and well essayed by Lana Turner. Marianne is a smart controlling woman whose guidance turns William into a success. Apparently the character in the book was somewhat plain obviously Turner isn't so she brings a femininity and beauty to the part as well as a strong core. Of course when she's supposed to be pregnant she's wearing a dress tightly cinched at the waist. It was considered indecent to show pregnancy back then but it's ridiculous. As Marguerite Donna Reed manages to bring some color into what is a somewhat thankless role. Van Heflin as a friend and eventual partner of William gives a wonderful performance as a tough but kind and tender man who makes William do the right thing by Marianne. Gladys Cooper does her usual fine job as Mrs. Patourel and her final scene is beautiful. There were several very touching parts of the movie and that was one of them. Newcomer Richard Hart who died four years later is William and looks good once he grows his mustache. The role however could have used a more exciting performance. Hart was from the theater and actually performed many of the classics on television in its early days.On an interesting side note Linda Christian plays Turner's Maori maid. Turner at that time was seeing Tyrone Power. The story goes that Christian overheard Turner say that Power was going to be in Rome. Christian wangled the money for her and her sister went to Rome and stayed in the same hotel as Power. He never returned to Turner and the next year married Christian. Apropos of this Green Dolphin Street asks ageold questions  are there mistakes in life or a guiding hand? Did William really write the name of the wrong sister or was that as it was meant to be? We all have to decide for ourselves. I'm not sure Green Dolphin Street will help one do that but it's entertaining nonetheless.".

She graciously thanked me and admitted to watching the film too for the first time by the way and that she had also enjoyed it.  It really wasn't bad! she said as she started up her convertible and waved goodbye.  When weather permitted and it did rather frequently in that southern California town she usually looked like she'd come in to do her grocery shopping in tennis shorts and a sleeveless blouse after spending an afternoon gardening in what no doubt was as much of a showstopper as the many roles in which she had excelled. For a woman who was in her late sixties at the time she radiated a most charismatic energy.  A great lady whom I shall always remember most fondly.".

The story includes good visual and sound special effects which still hold up to today's hitech effects by providing some straight forward excitement!!! Remember this was a 1947 film. It is rich with well the developed characters and very good acting by Donna Reed Van Heflin and Gladys Cooper and Lana Turner who shows she can do a great job acting with out being a sex symbol.

	schema:headline " StillWatchable Costume Drama";
	schema:reviewBody "'Green Dolphin Street' is set in the early Victorian era and features two unusual backgrounds for Hollywood films New Zealand and the Channel Islands. Contrary to what some have thought 'St Pierre' is not in France but rather in the Britishruled Channel Islands although the model for the offshore nunnery was clearly MontStMichel in Normandy. The plot centers around two sisters Marianne and Marguerite who are both in love with the same man William. An added complication is that the girls' mother in her youth was in love with William's father but they were prevented from marrying by the opposition of her parents. William himself loves Marguerite indeed he seems to be unaware that Marianne is in love with him. He persuades the girls' wealthy and influential father to help him to obtain a commission in the Royal Navy. He is however a feckless young man and a heavy drinker and after getting drunk and missing his ship while in China deserts from the navy and flees to New Zealand. He meets Timothy another Channel Islander and fellowfugitive from justice who has killed a man in a brawl. Timothy is now running a logging business in a remote area of the North Island with the help of Maori workers and invites William to assist him in his business. The business prospers and William writes to Marguerite's father asking for the hand of his daughter in marriage. Unfortunately he is drunk at the time he writes the letter and inadvertently writes 'Marianne' rather than 'Marguerite'. Marianne delighted to think her love is returned sets off for New Zealand to marry him. In some respects 'Green Dolphin Street' is a standard costume drama of its period a combination of a Jane Austenstyle drawingroom romance and an epic of the British Empire. The acting is neither particularly distinguished nor particularly bad. Nevertheless it has a few interesting features. An earthquake hits the logging camp and this scene can still generate tension even today as the special effects are surprisingly well done for a film of this period. The characters are welldrawn and undergo genuine development the feckless William becomes a more responsible character and comes to appreciate the finer qualities of the wife he has married by mistake. Timothy a wild character in his youth also matures. He is himself secretly in love with Marianne but keeps this a secret as he believes she will be happier with William. Unlike many of the white settlers he admires the native Maori population and befriends them rather than treating them with contempt. Marianne headstrong and determined but capable of sincere love plays an important role in her husband's success. Back in St Pierre Marguerite originally a rather spoiled young woman develops a religious vocation and enters a nunnery. The film has a strong specifically Catholic religious atmosphere. This is a film that has stayed watchable. 610. There are a couple of errors that I spotted. The ship's captain talks of having seen a flightless bird larger than an ostrich in New Zealand. This is presumably a reference to the moa but this bird was already extinct before Europeans first landed in the country. It seems strange that William and Timothy both fugitives from British justice should think themselves safe in New Zealand where they live quite openly under their real names. The country was after all a British colony at the time and they could presumably have been arrested by the local authorities and extradited to Britain.".

Many people would probably not sit through the whole thing because it is old it's in black and white etc.  However if you actually take the time to watch it you will find that it is a wonderful story and it delivers powerful life lessons.  Lana Turner plays Marrianne beautifully she gives a convincing portrayal of a stubborn slightly pushy but kind and caring girl.  Donna Reed plays her younger sister Marguerite a sweeter gentler girl.  The reason I love the story so much is because of the girls' strength and determination throughout all the twists and turns that are thrown at them.  Neither of them ever gives up hope each of the characters works through every problem he or she comes across and  never forgets the importance of love and commitment.  The story is poignant and beautiful it makes me cry.".

As with most movies adapted from novels it fell somewhat short of my expectations but not as badly as most movies of its time period.The characters in the movie are well developed with the exception of Lana Turner's which is unfortunate since she is the central figure.  Hollywood did it again making the rather plain figure Elizabeth Goudge wrote of in her book into a sex symbol but in all other areas this movie was well put together and was a real treat.I was impressed with how well the special effects people created scenes of such magnitude as earthquakes and floods with the technology available in 1947. I believe that anyone who hasn't read the book would find this a riveting movie full of action drama love all he or she could ask for in a movie. The best part is the lack of smut and unnecessary violence. For those like me who read the book first it will still be a good movie even if we might long for a better remake one day!".

I was instantly intrigued by the two beautiful female stars and the impressive period setting as well as by the fact that I had never heard of the film. I was in for a big surprise. I expected a mildly entertaining but ultimately conventional Victorian melodrama but the film was wrought with twists and turns that I never would have expected based on the first few minutes. In addition it is filmed with lavish spectacle and breathtaking special effects that are no less than awe inspiring for 1947. I had been raised on classic movies but I had never seen anything like it and I haven't since. I was bewitched by the sheer magnitude of the production and by the bizarre fantasy element of its setting. It is not so realistic as to be mundane but has a sort of charming phoniness about it not sarcastic at all that makes watching it almost like going to Disneyland. I was inspired to research New Zealand and channel Island history and read the book. I have not found a movie yet with so profound a sense of exotic mystery as this one. My first viewing of this was a once in a lifetime experience. I hope it will be the same for you.".

Why MGM didn't bother with some color for this one is beyond me it might have elevated it a star or two higher in the ratings.Like Gone With the Wind it concerns the lives of four people two sisters the romantic Donna Reed and the more practical Lana Turner and the men that loved them Richard Hart and Van Heflin. Only in this one Scarlett actually marries her Ashley and Rhett Butler kind of fades away before the finale.Richard Hart is the Ashley Wilkes of the piece the somewhat spoiled son of Frank Morgan living on St. Pierre one of the Channel Islands. He's a weak character who goes between sisters Donna Reed and Lana Turner. A Freudian slip of a pen while writing a letter in a state of intoxication has him send for Lana instead of Donna. By now Hart has arrived in New Zealand which is in its colonial period. Another refugee is Van Heflin from the same island who's the strong and adventurous Rhett Butler.Green Dolphin Street is the only film I know made in Hollywood that ever dealt with New Zealand so it is of some curiosity. It won the special effects Oscar that year for its depiction of an earthquake and a tidal wave. Oddly enough the name of the ship that brought all these folks to New Zealand is the Green Dolphin and a sequence where it is swamped by a tidal wave was cut from the film. And it still won the special effects Oscar.But viewers this isn't Gone With the Wind though it has pretenses. It also depicts the wars with the Maori which were every bit as bloody as the American Indian wars. I wish some Kiwis could see this film and write their impressions of it.".

Donna ReedMarguerite PatourelThe Last Time I Saw Paris'54 played a woman who was deeply in love through out the entire picture and became very frustrated. Donna Reed gave an outstanding performance and could bring tears to your eyes. Edmund GwennOctavius Patourel Miracle on 34th St.'47 was the father to the two sisters and revealed great secrets as the film progressed. Frank MorganDr. Edmund OzanneThe Wizard of Oz'39 played a great supporting role as a heavy drinking doctor who greatly loved his son. I noticed Linda ChristianHin MoaThunderstorm'56 playing a brief role in this film Linda Christian was the former wife of Tyrone Power. This is a masterpiece of a Classic Film which even had great pictures of Old Clipper Ships with their majestic Sails. Don't miss this Picture.".

It starts out rather slow a bit boring and all of a sudden everything seems to happen. Lana TurnerMarianne Patourel The Bad  The Beautiful'52 gave one of her greatest performances with a very dramatic acting role along with Van Heflin Timothy Haslam  Tap Roots'46 who could not help but follow Marianne's business advice and also gave in to all her demands. Donna ReedMarguerite PatourelThe Last Time I Saw Paris'54 played a woman who was deeply in love through out the entire picture and became very frustrated. Donna Reed gave an outstanding performance and could bring tears to your eyes. Edmund GwennOctavius Patourel Miracle on 34th St.'47 was the father to the two sisters and revealed great secrets as the film progressed. Frank MorganDr. Edmund OzanneThe Wizard of Oz'39 played a great supporting role as a heavy drinking doctor who greatly loved his son. I noticed Linda ChristianHin MoaThunderstorm'56 playing a brief role in this film Linda Christian was the former wife of Tyrone Power. This is a masterpiece of a Classic Film which even had great pictures of Old Clipper Ships with their majestic Sails. Don't miss this Picture.";

The earthquake and tidal wave scenes were just great and usually under great duress there is that passionate kiss especially after the man carries the woman to safety.  There were lots of chances for Marianne to turn it around and get a man who truly loved her. She said she felt no real closeness or warmth from William and yet she was willing to spend the rest of her life trying to get it.

But he writes his love to come join him but as their names are similar he got confused and wrote the wrong name. His father Frank Morgan and their mother Gladys Cooper knew each other when and loved one another but as he was not good enough for her father she was betrothed to another man Edmund Gwenn Lana and Donna's father. The plot revolving around the older actors is very moving and of course they are great in their roles especially Gladys Cooper who sadly never won an Oscar. And Dame May Witty is memorable as a Sister at the abbey that sits away from the mainland in the English Channel where you can only get to it when the tide is low.

	schema:reviewBody "When I decided to watch GREEN DOLPHIN STREET on TCM recently I didn't expect much. A standard period drama starring Lana Turner Donna Reed and Frank Morgan the wizard in WIZARD OF OZ. It started nicely enough beautiful cinematography nice sets and location. But then things got more eh odd and then even more odd and yes it morphed into something that was fullstop wacky. I mean seriously jawonthefloor wacky. On one hand the film didn't work at all but then the whole thing is so incredibly and spectacularly overthetop that I was pleasantly surprised by this unexpected outcome. It wasn't the thoughtful period drama I expected but more an overthetop ultra camp thingamajig that confounded me nonstop.The story is nearly impossible to describe because it goes here and there with no rhyme or reason baffling the viewers with its overwrought drama that makes very little sense. If you saw TOP SECRET the comedy from the 1980s starring Val Kilmer with all the incongruous elements spy moviebeach movieelvis moviegreat escape etc in it well GDS is like that but treated with a straight face. It's a combo of a Jane Austin period pieceswashbucklerKING KONGdisaster epicPEYTON PLACE all rolled into one. 34s into the movie I thought nothing would top what had happened previously and the there's the scene when Donna Reed is caught in the rising tide and has to climb a welllike cave that scene sent me over the edge. The wellcave is not something like 30 feet high but more like Empire State Building high. What happens to Reed's character after this scene is so priceless certainly when you think of the storyline that I was wondering how come this film is not a camp classic? That scene is so striking that it alone deserves to be remembered as one of the most brilliantly overwrought symbolic scenes of all time. It actually outdoes BLACK NARCISSUS there's also a nunnery on top of a hillcliff waiting at the end of the well which was also released in 1947 several months before GDS! GREEN DOLPHIN STREET is like BLACK NARCISSUS' illegitimate child no one wants to talk about. In the film's many OTT scene there's also an earthquake AND a roaring river tsunami it won the Oscar for special effects over BLACK NARCISSUS which is something the other more famous film cannot claim all of this over two sisters fighting for the love of one clueless man.Not a great film by any means but I give it 10 stars because it's pure ultra camp. It's a must see if you like camp and the unexpected. It's a totally hidden gem what kind of gem it's hard to say.Who knew such a benign title which is totally pointless vis a vis the story could hide so much good stuff.".

And in the beginning I would have agreed as the movie seemed pretty slow and not especially engaging. However I am very glad I stuck with it as the film got better and better and ultimately had a lovely payoff for the viewer.The reason why I liked it so much was the excellent way that two parallel stories were nicely overlapped in order to illustrate that just because a marriage might start out badly by not marrying your true love doesn't mean you can't live happily ever after! The first of these relationships is that of Marianne and Marguerite's parents. The mother had loved another man but was forced to marry another by her parents. However on the mother's deathbed her and her husband's exchange and affirmation of their love was a beautiful screen moment. The exchange between Edmund Gwen and his dying wife was so powerful and terrifically done it nearly brought tears to my eyes. Later when a similar theme was played out in Marianne's life it too was dynamite and very very satisfying and warm. Both relationships remind me of Garth Brooks' great song Unanswered Prayers in that what we want may not actually be what is best for us in the long run by the way I hate country music but love that song.So my advice is stick with this movie. Sure it could have easily had 20 minutes edited out to make the film tighter but the acting and writing are so good and pay off so well it's worth the effort.".

They hostess or maybe they just are table dressing for as long as they can. They make enough to have a decent apartment and they hock the gift jewelry and furs and stick the money in a safe deposit box for the day they just can't do it any more. Can't smile and nod and be sweet and the goombas look to the younger girls for attention. They try to keep quiet and keep their nose clean and ignore the young punks that treat them a little worse every year.But life can mess up your plans as it does for Gloria when it dumps an orphaned kid in her lap and some of her ped gangster pals at her door. And the decision she makes to save the kid's life means she can never go back.Gloria isn't really about stuff like violence or mobsters or guns at all. It's about the hopes and wishes and loneliness of a life that represents the lives of many invisible woman. Gloria has always been a broad as she says. Never the Madonna to be worshipped and respected. Always the Whore to be stepped on. And it sucks to be at the mercy and whim of men. Especially cruel stupid thugs who don't have the brains or guts to do anything but lie cheat steal and kill women and children.Gloria reluctantly gives up her old life. She gave years of her life to these slobs and she doesn't want to lose the little she got for her troubles. She just wants peace and quiet and to be left alone. Why give it up to help some annoying kid?But when she makes the decision to do just that her rage and resentment explode.Gena Rowlands gives a flawless performance that burns bright and makes the viewer feel the rage of those who hide their intelligence and personality and try to get by in a world of lesser men. Gloria's got more balls and brains than any of the suits that run the racket. And now she's going to prove it.Gloria is what happens when adults make movies for adults. No childish chatter no idealized and airbrushed world no moralizing and preaching. This movie has blood in its veins.".

	schema:headline " Gena Rowlands would kick Sharon Stone's butt";
	schema:reviewBody "I have not seen the remake of GLORIA yet and needless to say I'm not looking forward to it. Not to say that Sharon Stone can't play a tough female who's selfimposed as a bodyguard for a kid running from mobsters. It is just that Gena Rowlands is so much more versatile and her range so much wider and I just KNOW that Stone won't be able to cut it. So I will stop speculating and get to the facts.GLORIA is a film that Cassavete's made as an antidote to brainless violent action films. All of the violence has dramatic purpose and nothing is pointless here. This may be offputting to fans of the action genre but Cassavetes' contempt for the genre is what makes GLORIA more interesting. There are several unexpected twists.When the film begins Gloria is a streetsmart woman who is kind of married to the mob. Gloria has a tomboyish quality that lends credibility to the fact that she has lived this long. She looks out for herself first and foremost.This changes when a weasel and friendof Gloria's Buck Henry is murdered by her mobster friends. Henry and his wife are killed leaving behind a scared child. The little boy is a witness to the murder and the mobsters make chase.Gloria feels her maternal instincts begin to take over and begrudgingly protects the boy. As the film progresses however she becomes more sincere in her protection and she draws the line further for the mobsters. She has survived in the harsh city for this long so it is easy to assume that she knows how to stay alive.GLORIA is by no means Cassavete best film. There are long stretches that test your patience that can sometimes seem static. But as much as I dislike this quality I am familiar with several Cassavetes' films and understand what he is trying to achieve. Cassavetes is a very emotional director. He doesn't focus on tragedy he is more interested in survival and the baggage that that brings. GLORIA is a thinkingperson's thriller and if you prefer big explosions and high bodycounts go and see DIE HARD 2 again. But if you want to see something different check this one out.".

Gena Rowlands is a powerhouse actor in this gutsy film about survival courage and compassion set in the fastpaced gritty New York City of the 70s.  The acting allaround is exceptional.  The film is riveting from beginning to end. You get swept up in Gloria's dilemma right away.  The scene where she has to decide whether to save herself and turn the kid over to his assassins is very believable as you can see and feel how desperate one would be in such a dire situation.  Another great scene is at a Penn Station coffee shop where she confronts the stalking mobsters at a nearby table.  You can hear a pin drop in that restaurant as she stands there saying I'm Gloria.  My hand is on my gun in my purse!  Yet another great scene is the crowded subway where she literally throws punches with one of the mobsters who has caught up with her.  Everyone in that graffitiladen subway car presses against the walls trying to get away when Gloria pulls her gun.  She says as she gets off Ya punk!  Ya Punk.  Ya let a sissy beat you huh?  You punk!  Go ahead punk!.  Then the subway car closes and she and the kid get away yet again. So get lots of popcorn turn off the phones and curl up in bed with the lights off for this one!".

	schema:headline " A Realist Perspective on a Conventional Formula";
	schema:reviewBody "You start with flinty streetsmart gangster types cross their paths with a little kid put them in urban peril and then you squeeze how things stack up for sentimentality suspense and humor. It's a charming idea and perhaps that's why this could be considered John Cassavetes's most conventional film. It tells the story of a gangster's girlfriend who goes on the run with a young boy who is being pursued by the mob for information he doesn't even know he might have. But he wants to tell the story his own way obstructing every convention we would normally expect instilling a realist perspective in how we follow the movie making the payoff that much more worthwhile. Cassavetes didn't intend to direct his script. He just wanted to sell the story to Columbia Pictures. But once his wife Gena Rowlands was asked to play Gloria she obliged Cassavetes to direct it.This underdog crime drama is particularly absorbing in its first hour and ignites with a great beginning. We follow one character it leads to another character perspectives are interknit the situation builds and Cassavetes has complete control over what we know and expect all in spite of the alltoofamiliar premise which is then set for the rest of the movie which is a catandmouse hunt per the seedier locales of New York and New Jersey. He makes the threat so real that when the two key characters evade tangible danger we still feel the tension whenever they round a corner get in and out of cabs and other such ordinary actions. He doesn't let on that unwanted company is present. It just happens. There is one scene that lasts for quite awhile before we realize after Rowlands's title character does that unwanted company has been there the entire time.In an Oscarnominated performance Rowlands is expectedly the beautiful lead actress but she sports a kind of masculine quality creating a much more dense dynamic when she afraid of her maternal instincts finds them overpowering her lifelong selfpreservation and begrudgingly protects the boy. As the film progresses however she becomes more sincere in her protection and integrates her love with her seasoned familiarity with how to stay alive in this town. In one creative take on the Fine I Don't Need You Anyway scene she asks a bartender There's reasons I can't turn and just look but is there a little kid headed in here or across the street or whatever? She drives her role with such honest irritable liveliness. Yet the kid is also well cast. He was a conspicuous little boy named John Adames with dark hair big eyes and a way of trucking his dialogue as if confronting you to adjust a single word. It all works because everything about his character the way he dresses talks revolts and moves serves the naive notion that he is older smarter and cooler than he is.Cassavetes has a natural keenness for guilelessly unadorned location shooting in that he never plans stages waits on the weather or time of day or hires extras or stunt drivers. Note how passersby in the distance will often look on at the characters whether Gloria has pulled a gun in a public place or not. Wherever the characters need to be that place is in real time as dirty scuzzy and purely of the film's era as it would've normally been. There's a shabby flophouse where the clerk tells Gloria Just pick a room. They're all open. There are bus stations back alleys dimly lit hallways and bars that open at dawn. And his occasional action scenes are so thrilling because of their surprise.For once Cassavetes doesn't stage indefinitely extensive scenes of dialogue wherein the actors indulge in their own view of their characters' unraveling. But I miss that. As I've already said I am very impressed with how tightly he mounts suspense from the very beginning how Gloria and the kid zip from cab to bus to cab to street to hotel to cab and so on. But regardless of how doggedly realistic he is in his portrayal of a recycled movie plot he still relies upon that plot rather than the impositions of his characters flexing their wings.".

Why the hell would Gloria come to the cemetery in a mob car in stead of just a regular cab? And why dressed up as the boy's grandmother? It must be the imagination of the boy. That's why the boy runs in slow motion and in black and white to Gloria. Running towards a certain death that is! Cassavetes said in a interview that he didn't want the boy shot in pieces at the end of the movie but that doesn't mean the boy will survive!

	schema:reviewBody "Gena Rowlands is Gloria a friend of the mob in New York City. She lives in a shabby Bronx apartment house and is entertaining the sixyearold son of a neighboring family John Adames when the rest of the family  a miscast Buck Henry as an FBI informant his succulent Puerto Rican wife their daughter and their wizened abuelita  are blown away by the goon squad. They need to kill Adames too. Those are the rules.The uncertain and somewhat guilty Rowlands who hates kids takes off with him. They are pursued from hotel to hotel from train station to subway by hit men. Gloria is a tough babe though and is always quickest on the draw though rarely more than one step ahead of her executioners.It's hardly an unfamiliar armature. An urban person who has no use for children is suddenly saddled with one and must take care of him or her. In the course of many tribulations they bond. The nowhumanized rogue rides into the sunset with his new companion. Charlie Chaplin's The Kid is one of the more entertaining examples.This film though was directed by John Cassavetes famous for his mostly improvised and impeccably dull slices of life. Please God  no more Zorbas.This is Cassavetes' most structured and conventional movie and like Orson Welles' The Stranger it mostly succeeds in its attempted mixture of poetry and commercialism.Let me get the weaknesses out of the way. First of all the Mafia not only want to blow away Buck Henry and his family they also want the black notebook he's been keeping the one labeled MacGuffin. And Henry gives the book to his little BOY and tells him to keep it? Why? Almost all of the dialog sounds written and rehearsed but some is clearly made up on the spot. The impromptu lines come from the kid which is a shame. It's bad enough that little Adames can't act but for Cassavetes to urge him to improvise dialog almost turns into child abuse especially when it comes out like Goodbye you sucker you little insect. And Buck Henry as the terrified family man about to squeal on the Mafia. How did he get the role? And the climactic scene has Adames running  in slow motion  towards an openarmed Rowland while the score tells us this is a happy ending just in case we missed it.So much for the bad stuff. The rest is quirky  and I don't mean that negatively. I'll just give examples from two scenes.1 The mob shows up at Buck Henry's apartment and the halls echo with shotgun blasts. Cassavetes doesn't show us the killings just the family sitting around waiting to be slaughtered. Now in an ordinary action movie the echoes would no sooner have died down than we would hear police sirens in the background. Not here. The hoods take their time poking around Henry's apartment while looking for the little black book. No hurry folks. The police response time here is geared to reality not to movie conventions.2 Gloria barely manages to sneak out of another apartment house with the kid and the MacGuffin and must make a quick escape before the hit men reach her. In most movies the pursued runs into the street yells Taxi! and a cab screeches to an immediate halt in front of him. Or maybe there's one already waiting at the curb. Here she calls out furiously and waves her hand and the taxis whiz by as they do in real life.Adames is no actor as I've said but at least he's not cute in any stereotypical way. And he never cries. The sentimentality is kept within reasonable bounds. Gena Rowlands is aging but still beautiful even when cheaply made up and wearing sleazy pleated skirts and jackets that look like some kind of polyester or fake silk. She's thoroughly deglamorized as she should be  not old but worn and a little frayed around the edges like a library book that has been checked out often. In the bad old days Barbara Stanwyck could have waltzed through this part.Rowlands is from Wisconsin though and it shows in her speech. Cooled instead of cold. It doesn't sound right when she attempts a New York accent but it doesn't exactly sound wrong either. It's kind of like a comfortable Midwestern pasture that's been littered with garbage and flaps of raggedy paper and planted with graffitiladen signs.Boy did Cassavetes have an eye for locations. Who else would have shot a scene of Newark's Penn Station IN Newark's Penn Station? The place isn't appallingly seedy nor is it as clean and rococo as Moscow. It has nothing like Grand Central's Oyster Bar. It's simply uninteresting.I wish  come to think of it  that Cassavetes' script had been a little more taut more thoughtout and convincing where the central relationship between Rowlands and Adames is concerned. The exchanges alternate between spiteful barbs and little understated caresses and are at no point believable.Still this is an original work and well worth catching.".

It's bad enough that little Adames can't act but for Cassavetes to urge him to improvise dialog almost turns into child abuse especially when it comes out like Goodbye you sucker you little insect. And Buck Henry as the terrified family man about to squeal on the Mafia. How did he get the role? And the climactic scene has Adames running  in slow motion  towards an openarmed Rowland while the score tells us this is a happy ending just in case we missed it.So much for the bad stuff. The rest is quirky  and I don't mean that negatively. I'll just give examples from two scenes.1 The mob shows up at Buck Henry's apartment and the halls echo with shotgun blasts. Cassavetes doesn't show us the killings just the family sitting around waiting to be slaughtered. Now in an ordinary action movie the echoes would no sooner have died down than we would hear police sirens in the background. Not here. The hoods take their time poking around Henry's apartment while looking for the little black book. No hurry folks. The police response time here is geared to reality not to movie conventions.2 Gloria barely manages to sneak out of another apartment house with the kid and the MacGuffin and must make a quick escape before the hit men reach her. In most movies the pursued runs into the street yells Taxi! and a cab screeches to an immediate halt in front of him. Or maybe there's one already waiting at the curb. Here she calls out furiously and waves her hand and the taxis whiz by as they do in real life.Adames is no actor as I've said but at least he's not cute in any stereotypical way. And he never cries. The sentimentality is kept within reasonable bounds. Gena Rowlands is aging but still beautiful even when cheaply made up and wearing sleazy pleated skirts and jackets that look like some kind of polyester or fake silk. She's thoroughly deglamorized as she should be  not old but worn and a little frayed around the edges like a library book that has been checked out often. In the bad old days Barbara Stanwyck could have waltzed through this part.Rowlands is from Wisconsin though and it shows in her speech. Cooled instead of cold. It doesn't sound right when she attempts a New York accent but it doesn't exactly sound wrong either. It's kind of like a comfortable Midwestern pasture that's been littered with garbage and flaps of raggedy paper and planted with graffitiladen signs.Boy did Cassavetes have an eye for locations. Who else would have shot a scene of Newark's Penn Station IN Newark's Penn Station? The place isn't appallingly seedy nor is it as clean and rococo as Moscow. It has nothing like Grand Central's Oyster Bar. It's simply uninteresting.I wish  come to think of it  that Cassavetes' script had been a little more taut more thoughtout and convincing where the central relationship between Rowlands and Adames is concerned. The exchanges alternate between spiteful barbs and little understated caresses and are at no point believable.Still this is an original work and well worth catching.";

Mob goes searching for kid because he is evidence for the police. Woman starts to really like the kid and goes to great lengths to protect him at the cost of her own safety. The only difference between Gloria and Leon is that Leon's protagonist was a man whilst in Gloria it was a woman and that in Leon the main protagonist dies in the end whereas in Gloria she lives.Gena Rowlands the main actress in Gloria has a face which reminds me of Jane Curtin who acts in Third Rock From The Sun! The boy whom she looks after comes across as a smart aleck who always has something to say about everything. He's not awfully natural in the way he talks though because his lines may be rather adultlike but he says them as if he had spent days memorising them and had to regurgitate all of it on the film set! The movie is rife with oneliners which sometimes really come across as cheesy but some people like watching movies with this type of dialogue and as I had nothing much to do one night I had all the time in the world to try and appreciate this latenight movie on TV! I have to say though that although I initially was quite put off by the cheesy dialogues Gena Rowland's character began to grow on me and I eventually started to like every single cheesy line that spouted from her gob. She doesn't appear to me to be a terribly toughlooking moll though and its telling because somewhere in the middle of the movie the boy had to say to her You're so tough...  is that an attempt by the director to try and project to us the audience that Gloria really is a toughie even though she fails to project to us by her own performance and appearance that she really is tough??? I don't know yet I can see how this movie is destined to belong on those video racks classified as Cult Classics. Its soundtrack for one is very very typical of the era in which the movie was shot. We never get movies which play music like that anymore. This is point one which makes it a possible cult classic. Another point that makes this show a cult classic is the cheesy oneliner Mafia scripts. Surely there's pleasure to be had in enjoying one of these movies every now and then! We can even learn a thing or two! Heh! Third point is the strong feminine gangster character which is the centre of the show. There are probably people out there who love watching movies which feature a strong streetwise heroine as a winner in the end. Other such movies that come to mind include Jackie Brown Crazy in Alabama... need I say more?I'd recommend this movie for anyone who likes Mafia movies or for those who just love to see a tough gunyielding woman win the day!".

Cherish it he had only one more left.It is his most straightforward and probably written in a haste crude in spots about an exmafia moll and a little kid running from gangsters around New York. It wouldn't be out of place in a double bill with Don Siegel really or not that much.It actually casts light on another side of Cassavetes less talked about. One was of course the visionary swimmer into streams of soul tossing and turning in search of a true face.. Another was the actor who took odd paying jobs wearing a variety of faces to finance that vision when he got back very much like Welles whom he admired. He had done all sorts many that were crime stuff on and off TV. Adored Cagney.We have deliberate reference of all those gangster films of old here gumshoes and broads stuff Rowlands as female Bogart she calls other women dames in turns snarling at bad guys and coolly walking away waving it all off as dream. But this isn't that cocksure type film this is about dreams hopes frayed nerves.The little boy salvaged from a gangster plot is the center that keeps pulling her back summoning more of her gangster past around her including finally the lover she never made it with. You can see how in longer Cassavetes form we would have uncertain life as this woman floats around bars and odd rooms and contrasts with being pulled back to a role she left behind pulled to get out of it. Chinese Bookie comes to mind. That would have been tremendous to see but we have something else. All of the cool stuff are anachronistic at this point not really draped with a sense of cool which is a fashion sense. Cassavetes wouldn't know cool from a bar of soap really lovable dunce that he was so it comes out on the other side of the familiar posturing in an unselfconscious way.It's all abit like Rowlands' clothing foisted on her by Cassavetes. That red kimono would have been fabulous in Rita Hayworth times but looks a bit out of place now odd. Ditto Rowlands' tough expressions as if propped up with some effort. This is all far from where the likes of Tarantino and Besson who grew up in movies would take these things to iron them out. You can watch this and see how that would play out.There's a weariness without sentimentality here that seeps in through an open window somewhere in this room that you've found yourself in for the night. A sense of not having much more time for masks and that whole posturing where you have to be someone. This is tied in that sweet exchange about beating the system between her and boy. People usually don't but maybe some do who knows? Who really cares about a system?Underneath it all there's a marvelous sense of wandering that I find myself giving into always in movies it seems we go everywhere in New York. Underneath the worn fabrics this is one about the existential body that must wear them about weight that doesn't manage to hold you down. The sublime point as ever with Cassavetes is not giving up.".

	schema:headline " The Second Greatest Romantic Film Ever Made!";
	schema:reviewBody "Bed And Board is the fourth installment in the great Antoine Doinel played by a maturing JeanPierre Leaud film series directed by Francois Truffaut. This film is really almost as perfect as it's predecessor Stolen Kisses and in ways almost a sort of remake using the same characters and similar situations. The story begins with a newly weded Antoine who works as a flower dyer while his wife teaches musical lessons. Again Antoine goes through his life trying to find his occupational and romantic nitch. His occupational endeavors consist of becomming the guy who electronically maneuvers model boats at an American corporation. His wife soon is pregnant with his baby boy and the idealistic domestication becomes shakey as Antoine begins an affair with a Japanese girl named Kyoko played by Hiroko Berghauser. What is somewhat interesting is the French purest attitude or small town mind set that seems to take place in the film. The owner of the American corporation is played by American actor Billy Kearns can be seen playing Freddie Miles in Purple Noon and he's the stereotypical baffoon American. Japanese girlfriend Kyoko is the quiet reserved Asian that thinks of romantic suicidal notions for Antoine and herself. Another outsider who everyone in the Parisian village is afraid of until he's found out to be a comedian impersonator and NOT a strangler is treated with contempt until it has been established through media television performance spoken in French.  But it seems that Antoine and Christine's happiness is being constantly pulled at by French outsiders. But I suppose this is what Antoine would like us to think. Still the character who accidently lies and cheats his way through life. This is a far more cynical version of love compared to Stolen Kisses yet all the more relevent in it's depiction of growing love pains.The Antoine we see here is more emotionally lonesome than he ever was yet he's married and has a kid.  It still contains some of the greatest romantic moments in cinema history though. The scene where Antoine asks Christine to put her glasses on one more time is beautiful. Also the reversal situation of fetching wine from the wine celler will put smiles on the faces of anyone who'd seen a similar scene as this in Stolen Kisses. Though Antoine may not be as innocent as he once was in the earlier films his Antoine is a far more realistic portrayel of men in general. This is truly another wonderful film by Truffaut that would be as great as Stolen Kisses if it had retained some of the innocence. Highly recommended one of my personal favourites!!! I give this a 13 out of 10!".

	schema:headline " Staircase infantilism fantasy";
	schema:reviewBody "Truffaut turns a banal story about a newly wed couple the birth of their first child young man's infidelity their separation and reunion into a fascinating study of conjugal universe. At first glance the central characters Antoine and Christine may appear to be happy yet as the story unfolds one can see their difficulty of relating to one another. As is usual with Truffaut's films Domicile Conjugal presents the viewer with a highly dense text that constitutes perhaps the director's greatest achievement in his lifelong exploration of relationship between men and women.Truffaut's central symbol in this film is staircase. The characters constantly go up and down stairs. The psychoanalytic meaning of it is clear enough and has in fact been used by Hitchcock whose films Truffaut found inspiring. Downstairs a lascivious neighbor tells Antoine that she is going to have him soon. Money another key psychoanalytic symbol is also exchanged below as Antoine reminds an oblivious mother to pay for the music lessons that Christine a violinist offers to her daughter. By contrast upstairs is the space of high art in addition to Christine there is an opera singer living next door. It is also a space of conjugal relations or rather an attempt at such relation. As the first strains between Antoine and Christine become apparent Antoine brings home a portable winding stairs and makes Christine mount it when she practices her violin. Unlike Freud and Hitchcock Truffaut never quite claims that the high and sunny floors of our personality are a mere coverup for the dark recesses of basic instincts. Nevertheless the constant ups and downs in Domicile conjugal suggest that marital life involves a lot of interaction between an individual's consciousness and the unconscious. Antoine an autobiographic central character of Truffaut's cinematic universe is known to director's fans as a boy who never grew up. In his late twenties as in his early teens Antoine is entirely in love with his fantasies. The film starts as he dyes a bunch of carnations red by adding a substance to the water in which the flowers stand. Eventually his pursuit of the absolute red color an absolute passion? leads him to overdose and burn the flowers down. As Antoine and Christine lie in bed he reveals his fantasy to her by reading an obscenity into a news paper column. Looking for a supposedly serious job with an American company Antoine ends up occupying himself with piloting toy ships in a miniature haven arranged on a pond Truffaut will use the same image later in his La femme a cote. A consummate egoist enchanted with his own inner world Antoine embarks upon a graphomanic enterprise of writing a novel which in Christine's words will be his childish revenge upon his parents a reference to Truffaut's 400 coups and its central theme of a parentless childhood.The infantile nature of Antoine's character is also apparent from his reaction to the news of the birth of his son. Significantly Antoine does not hear his colleague who tries to shout to him over a distance that he has a boy and learns the sex of the child by looking through a binocular at a magazine picture featuring a boy and a girl that the colleague shows. Being absolutely selfcentered he tells neighbors about the news phones someone but forgets to bring flowers to Christine on a first postnatal visit. And then he projects his own fantasies upon the baby envisions him as a Napoleon of the literary world and declares that he will be his son's sole educator which references Truffaut's fascination with the 18th century educational ideas in his L'Infant sauvage. Finally Antoine also does not forget to name the boy Alphonse despite the fact that Christine liked a different name.Yet Christine is not very much different. The whole episode in which they disagree on the names for the baby simply suggests that fathers and mothers have different fantasies about their children that men and women have different fantasies He calls Christine his sister daughter or mother while she imagines herself as his womanwife note the opening episode when grocer and newspaper vendor call the newly wed Christine mademoiselle and she insists on being called madame. Whereas Antoine's pillow book is about Japanese women Christine reads about Rudolf Nuriev a famous ballet dance who had recently defected from the Soviet Union. As she and Antoine break apart she takes his photo with their child out of the frame and one can see Nuriev's face below.Thus the conjugal scenes in this film are a wonderful illustration of the idea that men and women take their fantasies with them as they go to bed. And yet as Antoine's affair with the Japanese girl Kioyko demonstrates pure fantasies are pure hell. Kioyko's foreignness indicates the impossibility of communication. The language is not the issue as Kioyko speaks French. Yet as Antoine soon discovers it is impossible to converse with one's dream. As the screen of the French small talk disintegrates around him Antoine finds himself alone with his pure fantasy of a woman that is to say he finds himself alone pure and simple. For a garrulous Gaul like him the silence of Antoine's last evening in restaurant with Kioyko proves to be a veritable torture from which he repetitively flees upstairs! to a telephone booth in order to TELL Christine that he loves her and kisses her tenderly. Yet make no mistake an ironic last episode of the film demonstrates that love between a man and a woman is a purely ritual thing that does or does not exist only for an external observer. Truffaut's bottomline is that men and women are able to live together only when their fantasies do not clash with one another. Forever children men and women play out their dreams together or alone. As Jacques Lacan argues and Truffaut agrees there can be no SEXUAL relationship".

The picture begins showing Antoine trying to scrape a living selling dyed flowers in the busy Parisian courtyard while his wife teaches violin in the apartment above. If this film was a novel you could rip half the pages out to represent the amount of storyline in the picture. But this does not take away anything from this piece of cinematic magic.

The balance of characters incidents and minute side glance at daily living restores your faith that art and craftmanship is making a  tender comment on life can make a deep one too. The couple soon become parents and Antoine lands by pure chance an unprestigious job in a prestigious American construction company. But Domestic bliss soon tires our hero and he is tempted to the bed of a statuesque Japenese girl. The story is told with Truffauts usual wit and charm and filled with affectionate homages to filmmakers from Jean Renoir to Jaques Tati.".

There are also some tenderly idiosyncratic scenes between the newlyweds.But Bed and Board becomes much less interesting when it aims for a more serious tone and introduces infidelity into the plot Antoine cheats on Christine with a Japanese woman Kyoko. To add insult to injury Kyoko is a blatant stereotype of the exotic submissive Asian woman wearing kimono and writing calligraphy. Maybe Christine and Antoine were always a mismatched coupleChristine is very practical and bourgeois while Antoine is a fanciful dreamerbut if he has to cheat on her couldn't he do it with someone amusing?Obviously the Antoine Doinel series dealt with some very serious themes in its first installment The 400 Blows. But that movie was a unique distinctive look inside the head of a troubled 14yearold boy however the serious themes of Bed and Board are found in innumerable French movies about infidelity. It's too bad that Bed and Board falls so flat in its second half because its first half is whimsical comedy at its best.".

If you had a constant reminder on your forearm however you might simply go about your life in a desperate attempt to prolong it. Or not.Will Salas played by Justin Timberlake is a 28yearold factory worker whose one year clock started and aging stopped like everyone else in the film when he turned 25. He and his 50 yearold mother Rachel played by Olivia Wilde live in the ghettos of Dayton hoping to earn and save enough to at least see the next day. All while wages in the ghetto are constantly going down and the cost of living is constantly going up. Then while out drinking with his friend Borel played by Johnny Galecki he learns of a man with more than a century left on his clock who has unadvisedly advertised his good fortune while in the same bar as Will and Borel. A local timethief enters the picture and rather than retreat like his friend did and advised him to do Will comes to the aid of the fortunate stranger. While saving his life was all for naught the stranger gives Will all the time left on his clock before allowing the time on his own clock to run out while he's sitting on a bridge overlooking a dry river basin.Time is money was a phrase first coined by Benjamin Franklin. While the idea of reversing that concept to money is time is interesting I don't believe the cast was up to the challenge of exploring it. Whatever success Justin Timberlake might've had in supporting roles he doesn't have what it takes to be the leading man. Amanda Seyfried whose role has her playing off Timberlake for a lot of the film is another professional whose appeal tends to overshadow her abilities for some reason. Perhaps an independent production could provide actors with genuine talent who are young enough to look the part but this is closer some sort of CW melodrama.".

While the idea of reversing that concept to money is time is interesting I don't believe the cast was up to the challenge of exploring it. Whatever success Justin Timberlake might've had in supporting roles he doesn't have what it takes to be the leading man. Amanda Seyfried whose role has her playing off Timberlake for a lot of the film is another professional whose appeal tends to overshadow her abilities for some reason. Perhaps an independent production could provide actors with genuine talent who are young enough to look the part but this is closer some sort of CW melodrama.";

However it was disappointing to see In Time fall short of my expectations. It pains me to say this but Justin Timberlake should not have been chosen for the role of Will Salas. He just can't pull off the character of a tough guy from the ghetto. Amanda Seyfried is decent as Silvia but she and Timberlake don't have much chemistry.I also don't think the script was very well written which causes Timberlake and Seyfried to be even less believable as their characters. In addition the characters are not developed enough it's difficult to get a sense of whom these people from opposite worlds really are.I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the movie.

I mean it's you life for crying out loud!! Will and Sylvia robbing their first time bank. How did they get a hold of an armored truck in the first place? All you have to do to rob a bank and get all the time you want is crash into the front? If it was that easy everyone would be doing it! There are people dying in the streets everyday and no one has thought to do this? Olivia's death it was too clich. Literally missing it by like a second? Come on!Why would the lead Minute Man want to 'fight' Will? also they never made that concept clear until they sat at that table Why wouldn't he just take his time and be done with it? He had nothing to gain from it. It was just weak writing in my opinion.And what happened to that subplot of Will's father? They kept alluding to some great reveal or that Leon knew something Will didn't but then the film just forgot about it. Are they trying to tell us that Will's altruism was hereditary? When Will got to Greenich what was his plan? It seemed to me like he was just buying his way into high society and playing with the rich. I couldn't figure out what his endgame was going to be.This one is again not a flaw but can we all agree that car crash into the ditch looked just ridiculous? Terrible CGI and not believable at all.And how they got the jump on Weiss Sylvia's father. He's got more security around him than the President but all you need is a pair of sunglasses to get the jump on him? Does the security team consist of random people who do not know each other? Then once you got him to lead you upstairs all his bodyguards did what? Went out for lunch? Why didn't they go after him? Why weren't they waiting downstairs for him? Why weren't any alarms sounding? Stupid. So you have a million years in you hand and presumably only an hour on you wrist yet you don't take any for yourself? I guess handing a little girl 999999 years 11 months and 28 days just doesn't have the same resonance.You can pay one year to get into Greenwich zone ... or you just walk in there is no security or guards anyway.Wire me my per diem wait never mind ... that was stupid.

To me he's been a great SciFi writer so going into this I was hopeful of something of quality.Alas In Time is not for the true SciFi thinker. It paints a world in which time is money. That isn't that new an idea but Niccols does succeed in pushing the metaphor as a commodity. Those with time are rich those without time are poor. It's a simplistic analogy. As with Niccol's other films the cinematography is beautiful. The best actors in the film aren't the main characters rather Cillian Murphy Vincent Kartheiser and surprisingly Alex Pettyfer present more interesting characters. They all shine especially Murphy. The film seems like one long car chase when what you actually want to delve into are the complexities  the debates between the characters themselves over the issues of the world they live in. Not a single clever conversation happens between anyone. Murphy is a great actor and I would have been interested to see the debate about right and wrong become greyed through some thinking. Life is not black and white. The film ending is unrealistic and I wonder if this was the ending envisioned by Niccol or the ending the producers wanted to boost sales. Sadly this film could have been a great deal more. It had a good topic. It had some great actors yet it failed because the story lost the nuances and complexities to meet the lowest common denominator rather than raising questions or making the viewer think critically. See it but be prepared to be disappointed. It isn't subtle.".

The fact that it's about people living off time with the rich living forever and the poor living off borrowed time is a rather thoughtprovoking one. And 2 I like Justin Timberlake. What saddens me is that he just wasn't very good in this movie as he and the doweyeyed Amanda Siegfried both just seem so bored throughout the entire movie. They have zero chemistry and I'm even going to say that they are just as bad as Anakin and Padme in Star Wars. That's the lowest bar you can go in the chemistry lab. Not only did Justin Timberlake seem bored but he also has a hard time conveying certain emotions. Take the scene where his mother dies in his arms for instance. Wasn't convinced Justin. His crying felt forced and it was. After that he vows revenge against all the time people and risks being chased by the Timekeeper the always awesome Cillian Murphy and after he is given a decade worth of time from someone who is tired of living he meets up with some rich people and kidnaps a rather high Amanda Siegfried and then starts taking time and giving it to people you know like Robin Hood.... except with time. They work together bored the whole way through and they try to convey emotions like love.... because if you have a guy and a girl on screen together you have to make them full in love. That's Hollywood 101 right there!This is really disappointing to me because I expected better out of In Time. What I got is pretty much a boring movie with a premise that sounded interesting but then it turns the movie into a onenotewonder. If I could turn back time I would have seen Puss In Boots instead.".

	schema:headline " This movie was a waste of time for me. Great concept badly executed.";
	schema:reviewBody "It's time to review this dystopian scifi thriller film. Written  directed by Andrew Niccol the movie open up in 2169 where people are born genetically engineered with a digital clock on their forearm. To help avoid overpopulation when people turn 25 years old they stop aging and their clock begins counting down from one year when it reaches zero that person times out and dies instantly. Time has become the universal currency. The country has been divided into time zones based on the wealth of the population. The movie focuses on two specific zones Dayton a poor manufacturing area where people like Will Salas Justin Timberlake live daytoday and New Greenwich the wealthiest time zone where Sylvia Weis Amanda Seyfield can live nearly forever. This is an everyday struggle for Will until he ends up rescuing a rich guy named Henry Hamilton Matt Bomer. For this favor Henry gives his time to Will so that he take revenge for the death of Will's mother Olivia Wilde. Now with plenty of time he plans to give the people the freedom of their lives by making the upper class pay. Too bad Will Salas is a hypocrite. He delays all this so that he can spent time buying nice cars eating at fancy restaurants trying to hook up with Sylvia attending rich people parties and playing high stakes poker. It takes forever to get to the 'Robin Hood' plot that the movie trailer promise us. Lots of filling scenes that slow down the pace to a crawl. The movie plot is a thinlyveiled allegory for the Occupy Wall Street movement against the 1. It's supposed to be social commentary about the growing global divide between the haves and havenots. It's an intriguing premise but unfortunately the movie follows a really predictable formulaic plot ending with lousy satisfying conclusion. Robbing banks will solve the economy?!? What? This is a good example of Hollywood not understanding economics. Do they think robbing banks would solve the economy? It would make it worst. Is it stealing if it's already stolen? quotes the movie. Yes it is. This movie is just a mess trying to add a Bonnie and Clyde type heist story with political overtones doesn't work. There was no depth to the movie's resolution other than everyone deserves equality. The movie lacks good exposition. It's too heavyhanded explaining a lot of things that didn't need to. The movie takes a lot of Artistic License in science and economic causing a lot of things to make no sense. Obviously made for a teen demographic everybody in the film cast is beautiful as hell. It's implied they are genetically engineered but still I didn't know the really poor can still look amazing gorgeous despite only have hours or minutes to live. It's really jarring. I do hope that the film makers know that aging isn't a gene. Even if the rich can live forever the skin will still be thinner and wrinkled by time manly due to exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Aging can't be stop. Only postponed. Also why 25 year old is the cutoff date? Isn't that the age frame where most people do the most work? Why not use the ones that you selection to be born longer like until 50 or 60 year old until terminating them? They isn't no point to eliminate them in the first place. You kill a lot of young people who does the majority of the work? There is no reason why children should even being born if they're genetically engineered and nobody dies from old age. Another thing why waste resources waiting for the children to reach 25 in the first place? Just create a fully grown male and female. It doesn't make sense why people still need to eat and drink when they don't feed on energy. How can you get alcohol poisoning if disease are eradicate in this world? There are so many looseends that I can go on about like what happen to the time when people die due to mauling to their bodies. If they are genetically engineered couldn't they just get fix up? The movie even forget subplot like what happen to Will's late father. The movie is also very insulting. A lot of over the top rich people have Jewish last names pushing the Greedy Jew stereotypes. The acting is mediocre. Justin Timberlake is pretty lackluster. The best actor in the film had to be Cillain Murphy. Amanda Seyfield is just there to be the loveinterest despite Will kidnapping her at gunpoint and almost killing her in a car accident. How romantic Stockholm Syndrome Patty Hearst right there. How stupid! The good things about the film is the score the action and the set design. It really does look futuristic. I love the time fighting race against the clock tense moments. Still there were a lot of stupid suicidal disregard of time allowance by characters that makes you wonder. Are these people stupid? Will himself keeps coming into large quantities of time then giving it away and leaving himself only a few hours or even minutes instead of a few years. There is a strongly reminiscent of this film to other media works. Due to that reason the film got often dealt with copyright lawsuits. One is Harlan Ellison whom believe that the film's plot was based on his 1965 short story 'Repent Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman. Another is Lee Falk who believe it was taken from Mandrake and the Goldman Time is Money a comic issue. Many of the elements of In Time can be found in the 1987 short film 'The Price of Life'  the Hannu Rajaniemi's novel 'The Quantum Thief' as well. Overall There isn't enough time in the world to get me to re watch this bad movie. You're probably better off just watching 1997 Gattaca than wasting time and money on this movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's time to review this dystopian scifi thriller film. Written  directed by Andrew Niccol the movie open up in 2169 where people are born genetically engineered with a digital clock on their forearm. To help avoid overpopulation when people turn 25 years old they stop aging and their clock begins counting down from one year when it reaches zero that person times out and dies instantly. Time has become the universal currency. The country has been divided into time zones based on the wealth of the population. The movie focuses on two specific zones Dayton a poor manufacturing area where people like Will Salas Justin Timberlake live daytoday and New Greenwich the wealthiest time zone where Sylvia Weis Amanda Seyfield can live nearly forever. This is an everyday struggle for Will until he ends up rescuing a rich guy named Henry Hamilton Matt Bomer. For this favor Henry gives his time to Will so that he take revenge for the death of Will's mother Olivia Wilde. Now with plenty of time he plans to give the people the freedom of their lives by making the upper class pay. Too bad Will Salas is a hypocrite. He delays all this so that he can spent time buying nice cars eating at fancy restaurants trying to hook up with Sylvia attending rich people parties and playing high stakes poker.

After that you have one year to live or less. It all depends upon whether you use all your time credits or you earn more. Regardless if you live to age 100 or longer your body physically remains looking twenty five.On the plus side is Justin Timberlake coming back and showing that his misstep in Bad Teacher 2011 was just one of those embarrassing Hollywood screw ups. Timberlake has real drama and acting talent and is definitely here for the long haul. Too bad Elvis was never given such chances. Timberlake gave us a glimpse of his depth last year in The Social Newtwork 2010  but his talents were not fully developed for Friends with Benefits 2011. The script starts with the eerie sobering reminder and all too familiar words We don't have time...we don't have time... Think if today you had to buy everything with time instead of bank credit or cash. Coffee costs four minutes. A bus ride costs an hour. A car costs two years. People can give or take time from each other. Just don't run out of time or you will die on the spot. If this were real would you treasure and spend time more wisely? The real interesting question may be that time really is the currency we live by now we just fail to see it that way. The simple fact is that you can earn countless piles of cash and gold in this world but you really cannot buy time. Despite the wealthy in today's world sometimes being able to cheat a few years with better health care we all are going to die in the same average years.While the script is the superficial tale of Will Salas Timberlake and his Mom Wilde trying to pass time in a futuristic world the messages of the film go far deeper. It is really a tale of class warfare. People who have time like the mega eonaire Phillipe Weis Katheiser and his rich daughter Sylvia Seyfried and those who constantly struggle to keep time or run out of it like the Salas family. Will gets the chance to move up into a better time zone thanks to a man who has just decided that after a hundred years or so he prefers to time out. He leaves Will the prophetic warning Don't waste my time. How Will chooses to spend his time for himself or for the benefit of all is now the story.I really did not mind that the future depicted in this film was not futuristic looking and all the cars were vintage 1970's models with updated lighting and electric sounding motors. It saved a huge budget rather than try to make the world look like it probably will in 2013 or so. And I think the point was that the future is really now.As an entertaining film my 7.5 rating is spot on. As a thought provoking experience I might have given it a 10.0. After seeing this film you should go out and visit with friends. Your own clock is ticking down. Are you really using it wisely? Unlike the time down clock on the arm of the people in this film you never know when your time is about up.This film...it's worth your time.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went into this one with the lowest expectations and boy was I wrong. For one thing before I saw his name in the opening credits I had no idea this was an Andrew Niccol film and since he is the stylish stylized genius who gave us GATTACA suddenly things were looking up. Then wow this cast! Sure I knew about Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried but check out the rest of them Olivia Wilde Cillian Murphy THE BIG BANG THEORY's Johnny Galecki WHITE COLLAR's Matt Bomer and genreIt Kid Alex Pettyfer. I mean come on! How can a movie be directed by Andrew Niccol AND contain so much of the pretty AND also be science fiction and NOT be completely exactly entirely the kind of movie that I would love love love? Want to know why my expectations were low? I'd seen a snippet of the trailer  which just looked to me like a bunch of TRANSFORMERSstyle running around the place  and had read the basic film synopsis sent to me by Fox Studios' publicity department. So what I knew was this Welcome to a world where time has become the ultimate currency. You stop aging at 25 but there's a catch you're geneticallyengineered to live only one more year unless you can buy your way out of it. The rich earn decades at a time remaining at age 25 becoming essentially immortal while the rest beg borrow or steal enough hours to make it through the day. When a man from the wrong side of the tracks is falsely accused of murder he is forced to go on the run with a beautiful hostage. Living minute to minute the duo's love becomes a powerful tool in their war against the system. Why was I hesitant about this premise? Because come on! How many scifi tropes do you want to hit? Predetermined agelimit to combat overpopulation LOGAN'S RUN among many others. Being able to effectively purchase immortality Elizabeth Moon's Familias Regnant series among many others. Falsely accused and on the run in a future dystopian society hello MINORITY REPORT THE ISLAND and who knows what all else! But you know what? Much like he did in GATTACA where he took the already wellworn path of the geneticallysuperior being not necessarily being superior and made it his own writerdirector Niccol brings a freshness almost a whole new sensibility to these and the other trappings of classic scifi he offers up to us here. We also get action suspense romance humor social commentary gorgeous visuals and as I mentioned bucket loads of the pretty  I would pay good money to see Matt Bomer and Olivia Wilde in anything impossibly beautiful doesn't even begin to cover that blessed pair  and wow what a thoroughly unexpectedly fun truly thoughtprovoking and utterly engaging time this movie was. I am still flabbergasted at just how much I dug this. I actually broke into spontaneous applause as the credits rolled. And I can't wait to see it again.But the big question how was JT? He was I will have you know excellent. I have long felt that there was something effortlessly engaging about his whole persona whether in interviews or on SNL or in roles as diverse as beleaguered rookie cop in EDISON Napster hipster Sean Parker in THE SOCIAL NETWORK or squirrelly substitute Scott in BAD TEACHER. He doesn't really seem to act he just IS. Here he is an unlikely action hero but somehow he pulls it off in grand style looking simultaneously earnest dangerous and adorable and easily holding his own even alongside someone the likes of Murphy whose hypnotic eyes can convey more in one blink of an eyelash than many a lesser actor can get across in an entire soliloquy.All of the other performances are top notch particularly from Wilde and Galecki  who brings most of the funny in the film  and hey you know who else is in here! Vincent Kartheiser AKA Connor from ANGEL! And he's not bad at all either. In fact he and Pettyfer are our main bad guys and both pull of criminal cool pretty damn well.The long and the short of it? See this film. It's entertaining it has a message it is a feast for the eyes and we definitely need to be encouraging more of this kind of genre filmmaking. True it's not a truly original piece of work. In fact in addition to all of the other things it reminds me of it also brings to mind EQUILIBRIUM  not so much in its content but in the way that it is essentially a mashup of a whole bunch of established ideas out of speculative fiction but gives them new life Equilibrium went with BRAVE NEW WORLD FAHRENHEIT 451 1984  and also LOGAN'S RUN as its inspirations. But that's okay I really like EQUILIBRIUM too. In doing a little research for this review I discovered that the everlitigious SF luminary Harlan Ellison is suing Niccol and various studiotypes for plagiarism given this movie's similarity to his 1965 short story 'Repent Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman. Having not read the piece in question I can't comment but considering Ellison's unrelenting pursuit of copyright infringers one would think that if Niccol WAS to knowingly steal from anyone he'd have picked a safer target. After all most of the ideas in this movie can be found all over SciFi not to mention in Action and Drama and Crime as well.But sometimes it's not about the provenance of the ideas it's what you do with them. And here Niccol has done wonders. As long as you suspend your disbelief and go with the fact that Timberlake Seyfried and the rest are biologically only 25. Luckily Hollywood's been conditioning us to do just that for years.  Rachel Hyland Geek Speak Magazine".

I'd seen a snippet of the trailer  which just looked to me like a bunch of TRANSFORMERSstyle running around the place  and had read the basic film synopsis sent to me by Fox Studios' publicity department. So what I knew was this Welcome to a world where time has become the ultimate currency. You stop aging at 25 but there's a catch you're geneticallyengineered to live only one more year unless you can buy your way out of it. The rich earn decades at a time remaining at age 25 becoming essentially immortal while the rest beg borrow or steal enough hours to make it through the day. When a man from the wrong side of the tracks is falsely accused of murder he is forced to go on the run with a beautiful hostage. Living minute to minute the duo's love becomes a powerful tool in their war against the system. Why was I hesitant about this premise? Because come on! How many scifi tropes do you want to hit? Predetermined agelimit to combat overpopulation LOGAN'S RUN among many others. Being able to effectively purchase immortality Elizabeth Moon's Familias Regnant series among many others. Falsely accused and on the run in a future dystopian society hello MINORITY REPORT THE ISLAND and who knows what all else! But you know what? Much like he did in GATTACA where he took the already wellworn path of the geneticallysuperior being not necessarily being superior and made it his own writerdirector Niccol brings a freshness almost a whole new sensibility to these and the other trappings of classic scifi he offers up to us here. We also get action suspense romance humor social commentary gorgeous visuals and as I mentioned bucket loads of the pretty  I would pay good money to see Matt Bomer and Olivia Wilde in anything impossibly beautiful doesn't even begin to cover that blessed pair  and wow what a thoroughly unexpectedly fun truly thoughtprovoking and utterly engaging time this movie was. I am still flabbergasted at just how much I dug this. I actually broke into spontaneous applause as the credits rolled. And I can't wait to see it again.But the big question how was JT? He was I will have you know excellent. I have long felt that there was something effortlessly engaging about his whole persona whether in interviews or on SNL or in roles as diverse as beleaguered rookie cop in EDISON Napster hipster Sean Parker in THE SOCIAL NETWORK or squirrelly substitute Scott in BAD TEACHER. He doesn't really seem to act he just IS. Here he is an unlikely action hero but somehow he pulls it off in grand style looking simultaneously earnest dangerous and adorable and easily holding his own even alongside someone the likes of Murphy whose hypnotic eyes can convey more in one blink of an eyelash than many a lesser actor can get across in an entire soliloquy.All of the other performances are top notch particularly from Wilde and Galecki  who brings most of the funny in the film  and hey you know who else is in here! Vincent Kartheiser AKA Connor from ANGEL! And he's not bad at all either. In fact he and Pettyfer are our main bad guys and both pull of criminal cool pretty damn well.The long and the short of it? See this film. It's entertaining it has a message it is a feast for the eyes and we definitely need to be encouraging more of this kind of genre filmmaking. True it's not a truly original piece of work. In fact in addition to all of the other things it reminds me of it also brings to mind EQUILIBRIUM  not so much in its content but in the way that it is essentially a mashup of a whole bunch of established ideas out of speculative fiction but gives them new life Equilibrium went with BRAVE NEW WORLD FAHRENHEIT 451 1984  and also LOGAN'S RUN as its inspirations. But that's okay I really like EQUILIBRIUM too. In doing a little research for this review I discovered that the everlitigious SF luminary Harlan Ellison is suing Niccol and various studiotypes for plagiarism given this movie's similarity to his 1965 short story 'Repent Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman. Having not read the piece in question I can't comment but considering Ellison's unrelenting pursuit of copyright infringers one would think that if Niccol WAS to knowingly steal from anyone he'd have picked a safer target. After all most of the ideas in this movie can be found all over SciFi not to mention in Action and Drama and Crime as well.But sometimes it's not about the provenance of the ideas it's what you do with them. And here Niccol has done wonders. As long as you suspend your disbelief and go with the fact that Timberlake Seyfried and the rest are biologically only 25. Luckily Hollywood's been conditioning us to do just that for years.  Rachel Hyland Geek Speak Magazine";

	schema:reviewBody "So we went to see this movie with my girlfriend she was eager to see JT so i said oh well my friend said it's a onetimer so we can give it a shot... and a shot in my head too.I don't know where to begin. The good things only one. The whole concept of the film is a great idea that moneytime and that rich people are greedy and they steal all the moneytime and poor people have to live day by day or they just die not literally. Which is just like how the world is going and which way the world is going atm. So that i liked. There were some OK suspense moments also but seriously those are the only good things i can say about this film.What i didn't like everything else. So there is this 28 year old badass guy from ze ghetto  OBVIOUS SPOILER ALERT  they get together with this gal from uptown and after figuring out what to do they break into a bank in the middle of the ghetto. There are no cops or security to stop them they just drive through the glass open the vault hand out all the cash then drive away. Seriously why didn't any of the ghetto people EVER thought of this before? And after that they rob one of the richest people of the USA get away with so much moneytime that the whole economy could collapse... and they just drive away in their car. No police no nothing. Oh yea did i mention that cops don't have any radios or anytin? Super future where computer interfaces are all over the place that can read human DNA but not a single cell phone or any mobile device NOT EVEN FOR THE POLICE!!! ARE YOU FREAKIN KIDDIN ME? Is this for real? And all the time all the same 3 people chase our heroes around. The girls father walks around with like 15 security people and they have 3 cops to chase the big bad villains. Yep that's the future for you. And these 2 always get away just by running  driving around. JT beats every1 and any1 not even breaking a sweat. But hey what did i expect i guess it's my fault...Conversations are like if they were written by 5 year old and i'm not kidding. I can't even remember one but it's something like this stupid question stupid obvious answer rince  repeat.And i could go on and on but there's only 1 more thing i'll mention. The structure of the film. Holy Crp. It's like they just made cuts and scenes pasted them together and thats it. They just get from one situation to another and i was scratching my face what the hell are they doing here now? How did we get here? And seriously WHY? Why is that everything in this film is soooo obvious that i would've liked to scream out loud in the cinema while tearing my own hair out. The first few mistakes you smirk and get over it but they just keep coming and coming at you like if someone deliberately wrote this to test your nerves.So that's it. I've never written a movie review before but i just had to put it out there to warn everyone. I'm only giving this film a 2 out of 10 because the idea wasn't that bad to begin with. But everything else is screwed up almost as if someone would try to deliberately write a bad script out of a good idea.".

	schema:headline " Such an Intriguing Idea Gone for the most part to Waste";
	schema:reviewBody "What an intriguing idea. This is the type of SCFI that I usually tend to like over just another film with space battles. SCFi films that make you think and make parallels to real life. Once I saw the previews to this film I thought this film would be something special. Not only did the film have an intriguing idea but only draw from mythic arc types like Robin Hood and numinous of great themes but the film falls short on such a great idea with a failure to really understand what type of scope there really could have been with this story along with a less than stellar cast the film is entertaining but only a footnote of what it could have been.The film's concept is a future where humans have been genetically engineered to stop ageing after age 25 but after that you have only one more year to live. Time is the currency of the time no such thing as money. You work to get more time but it is a bleak future where the rich have all the power and all the time. Meanwhile the rest live in the ghettos where almost everyone has only has 24 hours to live and they live by the clock. While the story opens with a man in the ghetto named Will Salas is given the gift of time from a man who doesn't care to live anymore from the richinfected lifestyle. Will is then accused of murder and on the run from a police force known as timekeepers. With a rich man's daughter at his side he hopes to effect change in the system. The film's story should have been one of the best of the decade. I mean the idea is so good it feels awful that it was a bit wasted. The film story does a good job on laying out the ground rules of the universe they live in. This was great about it a short speech in the beginning and then you are trusted into the life of Will Salas. You get a pretty good picture on how he lives just from the first 10 min. You learn a lot about the world and the film starts to set up some story lines but that's where a lot of the film's really strong points end.The film starts up several story lines and just never delivers. Some just seems abandoned by the end and others that kept building and never got the final crescendo or pay off. It seems like not only that with these great ideas and scary parallels to real life class warfare the idea could have been bigger than it ended up being It hard to say exactly what it was missing. I feel like the film could have been even bigger with its ideas and themes. It fact with this idea the film could have been a great long SCFI epic. Maybe my expectations for the film was just too high but I feel I was let down by story because of the potential it had and that's just aside from the plot holes and incompletion of certain story lines. There were also some scenes I honestly thought could make for some classic scenes like when we finally get to see what a fighter is and how they fight. The scene was too short and was a number of others felt a little short in fact the film overall felt a bit short without a real good conclusion.The film seems to leave the possibility of having a strong story oriented film instead opting for an action fueled story. The film has no shortage of action sequences and that is properly the saving grace to the film. It does keep the viewer entertained and it does keep the story moving. Without this factor the film would unsalvageable. There are some good car crashes and also on foot chases. A good number of gun battles to be boot. Even with the PG13 rating it is able to have some real action and violence. However I think I could have done without a couple of these so we would have a stronger story. The acting is also questionable. I would have made different choices. Justin Timberlake stars a Will Salas and Justin is good here for the action sequences but he isn't the greatest with the dramatic scenes. This is a shame because I thought he would because I really liked his performance in The Social Network 2010. Amanda Seyfried's performance falls flat in my eyes even though she had some nice chemistry with Justin. Cillian Murphy is amazing as the timekeeper Raymond Leon. This is an outstanding performance from Murphy as he usually delivers. The rest are decent but nothing special. Shyloh Oostwald is okay I liked Johnny Galecki as Borel. I didn't love Olivia Wilde even if she didn't have a big part. Alex Pettyfer is finally getting better roles since his role in Alex Rider Operation Stormbreaker 2006. He is good here as Fortis the minutemen which a gangster of the future. Andrew Niccol is a great talent behind the camera and I don't doubt that either. His look to the film to perfect for this film. Also his of practical effects over CGI heavy effects is defiantly noticeable in a good way. The music by Craig Armstrong fits perfectly.Really with this type of idea it really could have been something special. The acting hurt the film a bit with the exception of Cillian Murphy. But with a talented director behind the camera and talent behind the scenes also with some really entertaining action sequences makes the film watchable but you can't help but feel it could be so much more. If there was a film that I would like to see remade this would be it.Final Score5.510".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to the movie with high expectation generated by really good trailers. But the good part ends there. The storyline is too simplistic and out of depth. The protagonist is modern day robinhood who takes it upon himself to rob time rich people and distribute the excess time to the poor. He robs the bank with such an ease and without any resistance that I wonder why anybody before him didn't try that! The movie is a series of goof ups. 1 The girls gets her hand on the gun first time and she shoots like a pro. 2 She and the hero have and argument runs down a long road negotiate and sells the ear rings and then hide from the police but the two minute that was left of the girl's life doesn't end. ROFL! 3 When the chase between the cop and the protagonist begins suddenly the road turns lively teeming with cars and trucks and as soon as it gets over the road suddenly gets deserted.4 The building into which the protagonist takes a man in course of saving his life is nondescript and empty except for two costly looking pieces of sofa kept right in the middle of the floor. As if somebody knew that they will be coming and arranged so that our hero doesn't face any discomfort.Leave along the hero even the villain does't lives up to the expectation and dies without a whimper. Clearly the movie lacks strong storyline. The direction was without the direction and acting average.Its a total waste!".

	schema:headline " A movie this bad should not remind its viewers that time is limited.";
	schema:reviewBody "OK so I had high hopes for this movie. I saw the trailer and as a closet socialist loved the clear underlying theme of the rich having to keep many people down in order to maintain their power. So as I sat down in the theatre I was hoping that even if the movie wasn't up to scratch at least the underlying message would make it all worth while. But from the very beginning there are so many flaws with this movie that I could not bring myself to enjoy it. The concept itself is so flawed that I could not bring myself to see past it. The idea is that in the society of the future which looks strangely like today but with slightly modified cars there has been a breakthrough in medical science that stops people aging at 25. This is somehow achieved with the price tag that everybody must have a time display on their arm that counts ever down to zero. When you get there you die. An interesting idea which brings up many good questions such as is time rationed or is it being hoarded by the authorities?. Sadly these questions are lightly glossed over rather than any in depth exploration. JT is a character in the ghetto and lives his life permanently broke. This means he rarely has more than a day or two of life left. And here we come to the first major flaw of the concept. Everybody around JT is the same. They all have almost no life in the bank all the time. And yet these people walk around casually drinking coffee costs 4 minutes and drinking in bars also costs time when they are just hours from death. Thinking about this for even a second it becomes clear that people this close to kicking it would be doing anything in their power to try and get more minutes. There would be no semblance of society as any body who was prepared to steal time off others would and very quickly they would be the only people left alive. JT casually gives time to a girl on the street a very nice gesture to be sure however completely unrealistic given that at the time he had less than a day to live. Its all very well to give away money when you are broke but to give away time when you are about to die that is a very different story. People this close to the edge all the time would act very differently from you and me something this film does nothing to explore. There are many many more flaws in this film but I won't go on about them. But the thing that finally tipped it for me was when they started trying to expand on the commentary of the capitalist system in the US by having outlets that lent time to the poor people in the ghetto for extortionate interest. These are the same people that seem to constantly have less than a day of life to their name. Once again this does not stand up to any real scrutiny. There is no way that a person who has allowed themselves to get down to less than a day of life is going to have any assets. If I was going to be dead in a day I am definitely selling my TV to try and get more time. I am certainly not likely to have anything that a loan shark considers capital enough to back a loan. But enough of my whinging. In the end because this movie could have been so good I couldn't enjoy the aspects that where well done. I have focused on the story flaws because they are what annoyed me the most. I am prepared to look past JT's bad acting I am prepared to look past the fact that the future looks just like the present but with cars that have slightly strange lights I am prepared to look past all the poorly thought out and completely unnecessary action scenes and I am prepared to look past whatever was going on in that hand of poker. But in the end this movie is flawed from the very beginning when the society they create could never exist due to basic human nature. Very few people would ever allow themselves to be just days from death when so many opportunities exist around them to gain by taking advantage of others. This movie had so many interesting areas it could have explored but in the end it is just disappointing. In the end if you are prepared to look past these things and you just want to see JT without his shirt drive round in a damn sexy old school E type jag and just generally be cool then you will probably enjoy this one. However if you are like me and have trouble ignoring the big holes in the basic concept and can't watch such an interesting idea be butchered then best to save the time this movie will take for something else.".

It couldn't be more opportune for a film like this which makes an obvious statement about the concentration of resources in the hands of a few and the pain and complexity the creates in the lives of the many.Justin Timberlake is impressive as Will Salas a 28 year old man who is chronically living day to day literally due to the fact that he was born in a slum in a world where your life span is the only currency out there. Of course we are left with no doubt that although he feels the pressure acutely he is still very generous to the people in his community.One night at a local bar Will happens to meet Henry Hamilton Matt Bomer a man who has lots of time but is weary after having living for more than a century already.

Fortis and his men capture Will and Sylvia and as he was holding a personal grudge Fortis decides to fight Will man to man as they do it in that futuristic day. Of course little does Fortis know that Will learned how to fight from his Father...and before he knows it his men are shot dead and Fortis himself is timed out or in other words killed by Will. It is an excellent scene in a very good film! The film itself however works because the commentary is so relevant Will sees the system for it's cruelty but as he works to change it he's unable to do it without the help of Sylvia. Timekeeper Leon was once in the ghetto like Will and he seems to be a fair man but he believes that the system is the best one available to THIS society at THIS time...so it's best to uphold it and accept it. Fortis is the scumbag criminal albeit gorgeous who plays dirty and cannibalizes his own community to get ahead...so he likes the system because it lets him do what he wants to do. Sylvia is the curious and insulated branch of affluence who knows the system is unfair but is unsure of how to change it.Check out this film...it's certainly worth it!".

	schema:reviewBody "At an unspecified time in the future humans are genetically engineered to stop aging at 25. Everyone has a bright green counter embedded on their forearms which show how much time they have left to live. As a byproduct of this new system time becomes currency the rich have decades even centuries to live while the poor are lucky to have more than 24 hours on their arms at any one time. Will Salas Justin Timberlake works at a factory and never has more time than hours in the day until a chance encounter with Henry Hamilton Matt Bomer a rich man whose life he saves from a vicious gangster Alex Pettyfer. Hamilton though doesn't want to go on any longer and while Will sleeps he transfers over his 116 years of time. Before he can celebrate with his mother Olivia Wilde she runs out of time and dies prompting Will to make it his mission in life to bring down the system. After being tracked to a mansion by Timekeeper Raymond Leon Cillian Murphy Will makes a hostage of his host's daughter Sylvia Weis Amanda Seyfried and sets out on the run. The pair soon becomes a futuristic version of Bonnie and Clyde as they attempt to stay one step ahead and right the wrongs their society has imposed on the poor. Concept films almost never pan out the reason being that ideas are easy to come up with putting those ideas into motion is a different story. Make no mistake writerdirector Andrew Niccol has a great concept to work with. But as is often the case with scifi films the concept at the heart of In Time is approximately one hundred billion times better than the film itself. This movie could succeed as a scifi book or short story but the way in which it is executed on screen makes for an excruciatingly bad experience.In Time misses the mark on virtually every front. To start it is rife with poor acting. No that's not enough. In truth most of the performances within this movie are downright terrible. Niccol assembled a cast of attractive individuals who unfortunately have yet to figure out their way as actors aside from Murphy who looks like a man who knows he's boarded a sinking ship. Timberlake Seyfried and Wilde may end up being worthwhile performers at some point but at this stage of their respective careers they need real guidance and good material neither of which is provided by Niccol. It should be noted that I did not include Pettyfer in that list because while the others show at least some promise Pettyfer does not. He is genuinely talentless. In the end though the numerous sleepwalking portrayals and elementarylevel dialogue don't come close to measuring up to the train wreck that is this movie's plot.To list the holes within the plot would be to craft a short novel. Absolutely nothing about In Time works the way it is supposed to. The film simply doesn't make a bit of sense on any level whatsoever. I'd love to know how it got green lit in the first place or how it made it past the test screening phase. It seems that no one anywhere in the chain of command ever asked some rudimentary questions about why this or that happens. Add to these cratersized holes a staggering number of side plots that serve no purpose and receive no payoff. The most interesting character within the entire mess of a film is Timekeeper Leon and yet his development never enters into the equation. Really what I'm saying in this review boils down to this In Time is stupid. I almost just wrote that sentence as my review but I felt that wouldn't be received too well. It is riddled with headscratching plot holes anemic dialogue and cringeinducing acting and worst of all it is a waste of an interesting and potentially dynamic concept which as a scifi nerd makes me furious. Stupid. It's just stupid. Please check out my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com".

After being tracked to a mansion by Timekeeper Raymond Leon Cillian Murphy Will makes a hostage of his host's daughter Sylvia Weis Amanda Seyfried and sets out on the run. The pair soon becomes a futuristic version of Bonnie and Clyde as they attempt to stay one step ahead and right the wrongs their society has imposed on the poor. Concept films almost never pan out the reason being that ideas are easy to come up with putting those ideas into motion is a different story. Make no mistake writerdirector Andrew Niccol has a great concept to work with. But as is often the case with scifi films the concept at the heart of In Time is approximately one hundred billion times better than the film itself. This movie could succeed as a scifi book or short story but the way in which it is executed on screen makes for an excruciatingly bad experience.In Time misses the mark on virtually every front. To start it is rife with poor acting. No that's not enough. In truth most of the performances within this movie are downright terrible. Niccol assembled a cast of attractive individuals who unfortunately have yet to figure out their way as actors aside from Murphy who looks like a man who knows he's boarded a sinking ship. Timberlake Seyfried and Wilde may end up being worthwhile performers at some point but at this stage of their respective careers they need real guidance and good material neither of which is provided by Niccol. It should be noted that I did not include Pettyfer in that list because while the others show at least some promise Pettyfer does not. He is genuinely talentless. In the end though the numerous sleepwalking portrayals and elementarylevel dialogue don't come close to measuring up to the train wreck that is this movie's plot.To list the holes within the plot would be to craft a short novel. Absolutely nothing about In Time works the way it is supposed to. The film simply doesn't make a bit of sense on any level whatsoever. I'd love to know how it got green lit in the first place or how it made it past the test screening phase. It seems that no one anywhere in the chain of command ever asked some rudimentary questions about why this or that happens. Add to these cratersized holes a staggering number of side plots that serve no purpose and receive no payoff. The most interesting character within the entire mess of a film is Timekeeper Leon and yet his development never enters into the equation. Really what I'm saying in this review boils down to this In Time is stupid. I almost just wrote that sentence as my review but I felt that wouldn't be received too well. It is riddled with headscratching plot holes anemic dialogue and cringeinducing acting and worst of all it is a waste of an interesting and potentially dynamic concept which as a scifi nerd makes me furious. Stupid. It's just stupid. Please check out my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com";

The accident happened during the worst February we had had since I could remember and I was born and raised there. They were actually stranded for the entire month not a few days or a couple weeks and the fact that they survived amazed me. I don't know of anyone in these dire circumstances that would NOT whine a bit.Granted this film took some poetic license as all films based on true stories do. I felt that Matt LeBlanc was a poor choice for the son. He looked nothing like the rest of the family. But in spite of that I was impressed with the performances and the way the family clung together. This is not a film for the weak hearted. The reality of it was all too real for me as I knew first hand the subzero temperatures and high gale winds that were present at the time of this accident. Only true Alaskans would ever have survived this experience and my heart goes out to the family to this day.All in all the film was excellent at portraying the harsh circumstances the family faced. That was not made up. The relationships that they shared were also well portrayed. I have often wondered how they all were today what if any lasting affects the experience had on them. As far as films based in Alaska this was perhaps the most true to life of any I have seen. Excellent film.".

So it's hard to even imagine what it would be like to be on a normal sailing vacation discussing trivial family issues with your kids only to end up shipwrecked on the icy shores of Alaska with no human life for miles and terrible weather little to eat and no supplies.Eddy Barton and his three children Wendy the melodramatic teenage daughter Dave jock boy with dreams of working on a boat and Krista geeky younger daughter who enjoys reading The Hobbit are sailing during a storm only to find themselves facing a situation they never thought possible. Stuck on a barren seashore of Alaska drenched in seawater and surrounded by ice wind and snow the family literally has to do ANYTHING to survive. Unlike most Lifetime movies this one gets extremely disturbing especially when Wendy and Krista are left on the shore while Dave and Eddy get help by rowing a raft away to safety. The two girls are left with only a soggy blanket for shelter and Wendy begins to go crazy hallucinating and eating rotten seaweed full of maggots that part really grossed me out ewwww. They have no idea if the family will ever meet up again or who is even alive anymore.Anything to Survive was very dramatic but not to the point where it wrecks the movie. Instead the movie leaves quite an impact and makes you wonder what you would do in a situation like this. William B. Davis the Cigarette Smoking Man on the XFiles has a very minor but effective and wellacted role as the dentist Dr. Reynolds. The Vancouver scenery and Canadian landscape was beautiful Alaska is a United States territory but is attached to Canada and the movie was filmed in Canada. The soundtrack was great and I'm really happy to have been able to find Anything to Survive on youtube.".

They get shipwrecked on an island in February where it becomes clear one or more of them will have to try to sail to the coast for help. Who will survive if any? The real family was stranded for almost a month during a very cold Winter in 1979. The fact that any survived is amazing. The cast is great and so are the authentic locations but the first half is weak due to some lousily written melodramatics and contrived sequences. For instance the writers obviously needed an excuse to get one of the characters to traverse a tree trunk over a deep chasm. Why sure! These are the only reason I rate the movie so low because the second half generates some suspense and makes you realize what a miserable situation it was. Imagine a lowbudget version of 1999's excellent The Edge but with a situation that's twice as bad and no bear. If they would've worked out the glaring flaws this could've been a quality movie but it's still worthwhile if you like survival stories and the cast just be patient and wait around for the second half.The movie runs 91 minutes and was shot in the Vancouver area.GRADE C".

In fact I was a little surprised that I hadn't written a review of it them but that is probably a good thing because it means that I can now return to this film with a fresh mind and a fresh opinion and also give it the rating that it deserves. The film starts off in North Korea where Evelyn Salt a CIA agent is being tortured. It appears that she is going to be left for dead which is to be expected until a surprising trade comes about and she is released. A little later a Russian diplomat comes into the CIA to offer some information and suggests that there are a number of Soviet era sleeper agents in the US and proceeds to finger her as one of them. This is where the fun starts. Throughout the film you are never quite sure what is what and who is who. In fact you are never really sure whether Salt is working for the Russians or not and I won't reveal whether she actually is. In fact you never know who is a sleeper agent and who isn't and there are some very interesting revelations that come out through the movie leading you right to an action packed ending. In a way we are seeing a post ColdWar Russia but the thing is that the old Soviet system has never really gone away. One of the targets in the film is the Russian President and there is a suggestion that he is actually Boris Yeltsin and a part of me suspects that there is a group within Russia that wants to return to the Cold War era. While there wasn't anything particularly said about what was going on there was this idea playing in the background. The really interesting thing was the suggestion that American diplomats in Russia during the cold war were killed and their children taken by the Russians and brain washed before being handed back to the United States or even switched. This was what was insinuated in the opening scene where Salt is speaking with the Diplomat. In reality it is unclear as to how many of these sleeper agents are present because it seems that the United States government is unaware of how many of these children were brainwashed. Not surprisingly they made their way into some very influential organisations. This is one of those movies that could easily be considered one long thrilling ride from beginning to end. In another way one wonders how it is that the United States is unaware of something odd going on if the parents of all these children are incidentally killed. I'm sure after a few there would suddenly be some questions being asked. The other thing is that some people turn out to be agents even though there was no real hint from the getgo  sometimes I feel that maybe there should be some hints so that it doesn't come out hugely unrealistic. Still this was a great film and other that kept me at the edge of my seat all the way through.".

In another way one wonders how it is that the United States is unaware of something odd going on if the parents of all these children are incidentally killed. I'm sure after a few there would suddenly be some questions being asked. The other thing is that some people turn out to be agents even though there was no real hint from the getgo  sometimes I feel that maybe there should be some hints so that it doesn't come out hugely unrealistic. Still this was a great film and other that kept me at the edge of my seat all the way through.";

	schema:reviewBody "While I can't say that I was awaiting Angelina Jolie's latest outing with bated breath I was intrigued by the fact that Salt was originally intended to be a Tom Cruise vehicle.Tom's waning box office pullingpower aside this sexswap was a smart move by writer Kurt Wimmer Equilibrium as it gives Jolie the chance to prove that she can lay the smackdown on just as many henchmen as the boys can. Having her rather than him as the duplicitous CIA agent Evelyn Salt Wimmer gives a fresh angle to a plot that could easily have been a boring instalment of the Bourne series. Salt also sees the welcome return of Russian villains to the cinema after a long period in which Middle Eastern terrorists were severely overworked.When a Soviet defector strolls into the CIA and announces that Salt is a sleeper agent who will kill the Russian president she goes on the run. Fearing for the safety of her husband Michael Salt sets out to find him before agents Winter Liev Schreiber and Peabody Chiwetel Ejiofor catch up with her. The question of where Salt's loyalties lie is the true source of tension and Jolie plays it cool gaining and dismissing the audience's trust several times over.Schreiber and Ejiofor draw the short straws in terms of dialogue and simply run after Jolie for the entire movie without doing anything of significance. Hopefully if the proposed sequel goes ahead Wimmer will be able to correct this glaring oversight.The action scenes are sharply directed and Jolie finally gets her hands dirty particularly in the opening exchanges where she's being tortured in a Korean prison. If that wasn't enough she also flies down an elevator shaft by leaping from wall to wall  it was a silly effect but added a cheesy fanciful element to what would have been an entirely too serious movie.Consequently the first 40 minutes are fast and furious as Salt evades her fellow agents by any means necessary but not to be outdone the rest of the film takes a left turn and continues to surprise with some serious fisticuffs gunplay and highspeed car chases. Admittedly for all its skill and enthusiasm Salt's finale is a little overthetop and it wanders into wellworn ground without knowing when to stop. Aside from this minor gripe Salt is a welldirected action movie that delivers us a potential new franchise an intriguing lead character and an exciting close to a lacklustre summer.".

If action movies were realistic they would be slow and boring. This movie does not cross the line anymore than any other action movie.Salt delivers exactly what is promised  a solid 100 minutes of action. It keeps you watching it keeps you guessing even when it turns out you were right in some cases and it entertains from start to finish. If you like the action movie genre chances are you will enjoy this movie.As for the reviewers who criticized the way Russians are portrayed the action genre plays to comic booklike caricatures.

It's pretty much a Bourne ripoff. It stars Angelina Jolie as a CIA agent who is exposed as a Russian sleeper agent by a Russian defector. Whether she is one or not her bosses Chiwetel Ejiofor and Liev Schreiber decide to keep her under wraps. She'll have none of that though as she fears for the safety of her spider expert husband. So basically like Bourne it's about a defecting agent running from her employers while simultaneously trying to foil the bad guys. The film does have a couple of semiclever twists but it also contains a metric ton of stupidity. There's no real setup for Jolie being some kind of Bournelike superwoman yet as soon as the action sequences start she's either MacGuiver or Jackie Chan. Weighing in at about 95 pounds seriously Angie eat a burger she's able to beat the everloving crap out of every trained CIA FBI or Secret Service agent who gets in her way. The filmmaking is reminiscent of Bourne but unlike Bourne the choreography is confusing and implausible. Very little of the plot makes any sense from the reason for the initial exposure to Jolie's motivations to the final sequence. Any moderate examination reveals the film to make no sense whatsoever.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Bruce Willis makes crash landings in the original Die Hard movie at least he winces in pain and it takes him a few moments to regain composure. In Salt when Angelina Jolie jumps consecutively onto six moving trucks on the freeway she's flying right up and instantly running at Olympic record pace sort of like the original Terminator except sporting lipstick. Throughout the movie she decks secret service agents faster than they can graduate out of combat training if she's not pushing out of moving vehicles going 70 mph while wearing handcuffs although the officers forgot to put the cuffs on behind her. They put them on in front of her leaving her with a slight chance to get away. I guess the point of this movie don't try this at home.The essential plot I think is quite compelling and I don't want to give too much away but only to say that nothing is at it seems until the very end. But I think I would have liked more of the mystery behind the story than all the long action sequences which I felt undermined a potentially complex idea. These days in filmmaking it seems that the longer action sequences displace story development. There are flashbacks to a greater story but a lot of it was more confusing than insightful.After a brief prelude in which Jolie is interrogated and tortured by North Korean military agents the movie begins presumably about a year later with a Russian requesting asylum with the United States via the CIA. Agent Evelyn Salt Jolie interrogates the defector who tells a strange story about how the Russians infiltrate the United States with moles programmed and brainwashed during childhood. Only seconds after the interview is over the defector is killing CIA agents and escaping the headquarters. And so is Salt. In fact the agency is more determined to get Salt than the defector which is one of the many little glaring plot problems that occur during this movie. The nonstop action begins here fueled by several plots and subplots.I think Salt is a decent film but not a great one. At least what it does successfully is keep you guessing. You're not sure what Salt is doing where she's going or even whose side she's on which keeps you at the edge of your seat. By movies end I still had a lot of unanswered questions that were not explained through the action sequences. I also realized at one point Jolie doesn't say much after the initial interview until the very end. It's hard not to like Jolie but I think she should have requested a bit of a better script with a little bit less chasing gunning and blowing things up. Jolie can also act not just chase.".

In particular that they were offended of the way Russians are shown in the movie. Well I hope the director reads the reviews on this website and I would like to make a tiny remark. He completely missed the point of why they were offended.It was not due to the fact that Russian government had or has spies in the US but due to the image he gave to the Russians in his film.1. Russians don't address each other as comrade. Never did. 2. Russians don't drink vodka on every other occasion. And certainly don't carry a bottle on their person just in case. In fact Russians drink more beer than vodka. 3. Russians don't kiss each other as a form of greeting. Only if they are very good friends or would like to seem so or relatives and either both girls or of opposite sex. Russian men never kiss each other even if they are best friends or relatives. Male relatives kissing is much more common in Europe and even US than in Russia. 4. The Russian spies that were caught in the US last year were not observing the life of US. Any simple person can do that without being a spy. For example I often talk to my relatives in Russia and tell them how I live in the US and how life in the US is in general. Of course I don't tell or know any secrets THAT is the spy's job.Also just a side note to others who might only know about Russia by films such as this one Russian people don't dream of attacking US or any other country for that matter. They have problems of their own. So please stop exploiting these beatentodeath stereotypes in the movies. Otherwise the cold war will never really end.Other than that  great movie.

So she runs and runs and runs and sports a black wig and expensive sunglasses like a character from the Matrix.

So she gets exposed and runs away but somehow doesn't look anything the action figure of Lara Croft but quite ungainly and pathetic and uses a black wig and sunglasses like a Matrix character which doesn't hide her at all. In fact at one point when trying to allude the CIA she disguises herself in a Russian fur hat and fur coat. Hilarious! In another scene she randomly picks some dry cleaning off a rail in a hotel and surprise surprise the suit fits like it's tailored. Her disguise to go into the White House is just so ridiculous that you actually feel shame for the director and make up artist. Interestingly throughout the film special agent Salt does not kill a single American however she kills every Russian she can. And we are supposed to be wondering if she's a Russian spy? This film is so bad and panders so shamefully to the uneducated ill informed American conception of an evil enemy that really the only thing missing is the idea of an Arab funding it all from a cave in Afghanistan.The film ends thankfully but unthankfully with Jolie running off into the woodsfade to black and you can just here the film studio setting up storyboards for a sequel. Oh please NO.Total rubbish. 110".

What also really helped this movie was the lack of plot holes. With a blockbuster hit like SALT the director normally has no problems leaving big plot holes in the script but this film doesn't do that. This movie was thought out immaculately. Last but not least lets also give a shout out to Angelina Jolie SALT for giving her best performance in years. Any movie critic can give her credit for her Oscar winning performance.CONS There are very little cons to this movie. The only thing that could have been more realized is the resolution.

	schema:reviewBody "Great action sequences. Questionable plot. Limited character development.I enjoy spy films and remember having liked the 1994 Clear and Present Danger starring Harrison Ford also directed by Phillip Noyce so I decided to see Salt and bought the Bluray. The disk has all three versions and lots of interesting extra features including a commentary by Phillip Noyce and interviews with reallife spies such as the famous former Counterintelligence KGB General Oleg Kalugin now an American citizen. Salt is an enjoyable film better I say than all Bourne films or Mission Impossible with the possible exception of the first one directed by Brian de Palma where Angelina Jolie's father plays and also better than many James Bond films with perhaps the exception of the 1963 From Russia with Love from which Salts borrows something  remember Colonel Rosa Klebb played by Lotte Lenya ? Moles in the CIA and FBI sleepers illegals in dormant state waiting to be activated for sinister purposes against the West SovietRussian KGB SVR FSB defectors after defectors ... all are true and not new  see Telefon 1977 with Charles Bronson The Fourth Protocol 1987 with Pierce Brosnan The Good Shepherd 2006 also with Angelina Jolie The Company 2007 TV with Michael Keaton. Angelina Jolie Liev Schrieber and Daniel Olbrychski do well as Evelyn Salt and like many others I liked watching them but I have two serious problems with the plot. Not so much the impossible acrobatics and escapes and infiltrations ... but the premise of the film itselfHow is it possible to depict and make us believe that The Secret Service is so ineffective ... Bystanders ... ?The defector.1. A Russian spy comes to the CIA and reveals top secrets about former Soviet now Russian operations against the United States. He even uncovers the identity of a mole inside CIA ranks. OK  Good deeds ! But if he is a genuine defector why after being interviewed does he kills his CIA guards and then escapes ... Doing this only discredits his testimony. That is not how a genuine defector behaves.2. If on the other hand he is not a genuine defector but an active enemy agent someone who came to activate sleepers why does he have to come in and reveal everything to the CIA including uncovering the identity of a top mole in the CIA thus gravely endangering the mission his agents the sleepers are to carry out ? If he only needed to provide instructions to his undercover agents he could have used other methods of communication. This is not how an offensive let us call him a nongenuine defector behaves.3. If further this was just a temporary defection with the sole purpose of uncovering to the CIA the identity of a mole the Theatrical and Director's Cut versions of th film but not the Extended version suggests this than it was not at all necessary to reveal the rest of the plan to the CIA that this mole a Russian agent will soon attempt to kill ... and definitely it was absolutely wrong for the defector to kill his guards and escape. So bad logic. Am I wrong ? We the viewers like thrillers action adventure spy stuff deception after deception doublecross multiple against and allegiances but we also like solid smart and plausible intelligence brain analytical work behind the action  e.g. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy 1979 TV and Smiley's People 1982 TV both with Alec Guiness Not too much intelligence work in Salt just a lot of great ! action sequences ... there is too much Phillip Noyce expects us to accept take for granted. On the positive side Salt may also be viewed the soulsearching journey of a doubleagent who struggles with the question On which side am I ? or On which side should I be ? In the end the agent decides where the allegiance should be placed and chooses the side who advocates morality and humanity. If you do not ask too many questions Salt is definitely enjoyable.".

Maybe they do have a point as the American audience seems to have addiction problems and they seek ever increasing doses of unbelievability when it comes to plot and action sequences. This year's movies gotta have louder explosions more car chases even more impossible stunts and bigger conspiracy theories than last year's.The first 1015 minutes were OK. Even the washed up actress AJ managed to portray a somewhat passable and vulnerable agent. I was even willing to buy the makeshift bazooka under the principle of suspension of disbelief. But with the tomb raider sequence of truck jumping the movie took a huge nosedive. AJ is superwoman after that and there is no ounce of suspense. She will of course save the world.Am I to believe these sleeper cells take the most convoluted most illogical most difficult path to achieving their goals? Nothing is tied together. The onus of thinking up a rhyme or reason is all left to the viewer since the scriptwriters could not make sense of the script they wrote.The twist was apparent within the first 15 minutes of the movie. Those who really believe Hollywood will cast AJ as an evil Russian spy should be deemed to stupid to own a driver's license to get to the theatre. So who does that leaves the villain to be?

	schema:headline " Strong script dynamically weak";
	schema:reviewBody "'Le Secret' is a frustrating film. You know it must be doing something right because you walk away emotionally exhausted and with the sense that you have seen something of the human condition expounded. At the same time it is wanting in enough ways to undermine its claim to greatness. It is wanting dynamically to such a large extent that whilst it is a good script and a good story it it is not a good film. And as a piece of narrative it is inconclusive and not in the sense that it terminates with a poignant and provocative question. Arguably this is a film which could be remade utilising the same script and the same cast but using different artistic and technical direction. The camerawork adds nothing to the film. It creates no tension no atmosphere does not enhance the mood or emulate the powerful experiences of the characters. It is flat weak and pedestrian. The film lacks any geography and fails to resound the timing of events essential in a film about this subject. In short its elements are powerful but its construction is poor. It lacks focus. The film treads a clumsy path between an intense emotional struggle that borders on the surreal and an ambivalent realism. It achieves neither. The direction needs to be more decisive it needs to choose one over the other  and it needs to employ the camera more effectively to realise it. There is no differentiation in the filming between the house of  the lover and the family home. Additionally we get no sense of atmosphere of either one. There is none of the seduction in the former or of tedium in the latter that the protagonist might be feeling. Are we supposed to believe that Marie is having fantastic sex with Bill? If so it is only through her inadequately exposed acting. What keeps Marie coming back? Only she knows. What is driving her to maintain this relationship? We can only speculate because the film gives us little insight into the personalisation of her experience. Additionally the conclusion is weak and vacillating. However this film will undoubtedly touch a nerve with anyone who has been in a similar situation. It powerfully depicts the insidious destructiveness of infidelity on both the individual the family and to some extent society. To conclude a wasted opportunity with much unrealised potential.".

	onyx:emotionText "'Le Secret' is a frustrating film. You know it must be doing something right because you walk away emotionally exhausted and with the sense that you have seen something of the human condition expounded. At the same time it is wanting in enough ways to undermine its claim to greatness. It is wanting dynamically to such a large extent that whilst it is a good script and a good story it it is not a good film. And as a piece of narrative it is inconclusive and not in the sense that it terminates with a poignant and provocative question. Arguably this is a film which could be remade utilising the same script and the same cast but using different artistic and technical direction. The camerawork adds nothing to the film.

This focus and move away from the traditional marriage narrative is what renders Le Secret different from other films of its genre. Coesens plays Marie a confused mother who turns to American Bill for what to the spectator seems to be mainly for adventurous sex. Le Secret's narrative holds back much of the emotional drive resulting in Marie's affair and without Coesen's subtle yet telling acting the viewer would be lost in her intense personal struggle. To an extent the ambiguous nature of Marie's emotions towards her husband and lover give the viewer a certain freedom to interpret her relationships for themselves. Even the end of the film in which Marie and Francois seem to reunite carries an ambiguity and uncertainty with it. The often reserved nature of the script and acting provides a welcome change and challenge in a genre which is often overly predictable and simplified. Much of the dialogue between Marie and her lovers is refreshingly realistic in its uncertainty and honesty.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mission Accomplished...Mission Impossible  Ghost Protocol is the forth film in the franchise though first not to acknowledge its place in the title and sees Tom Cruise reprising the leading role of the globetrotting super spy Ethan Hunt. Throughout the series Hunt has evolved from team player to lone wolf and now in Ghost Protocol he must become a true leader of a team that for the first time he didn't choose.The film blasts off into overdrive from the minute the gates open and rarely lets up it's one hell of a ride and there's enough action and gadgets here to please any fan of the spy film genre. The plot is fairly straightforward the bad guy obtains the key to the ultimate weapon and plans to destroy the world with it. Hunt and his team working without the support of the IMF must stop him at all costs. It has enough twists and turns to keep you engaged but it never gets so complicated that you risk getting lost while you're immersed in the mind blowing stunt sequences. One thing fans of the series will probably notice this time around is that Hunt is more 'human' when it comes to the action than he has been in most of the previous outings. Not everything goes to plan and if he gets hit or falls down it hurts. Sure he's still a super spy and can do things most mortal men would never try in a million years but the added vulnerability and consequences of those actions gone wrong lifts the film to a new level and is one of the reasons it kept me on board all the way to the end.If there is anything about this film that let me down a little it was the absence of a true 'super villain' like we had in MI3. Yes there's a villain and yes he's dangerous but there is something missing. I guess I could put it this way  there is no Joker to Hunt's Batman. In MI3 things get very personal between Hunt and Owen Davian Philip Seymour Hoffman and that jacked up the menace and intensity of the conflict to a level you'd expect to see in the ultimate villain but in MIGP that level of personal rivalry between protagonist and antagonist was a bit lacking. It's not that Michael Nyqvist The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo didn't deliver a good performance in the few scenes where he interacts with Cruise it's just that there are so few of these moments that he is in many ways almost like another one of his own henchmen and I mistook him for other characters on a few occasions.Personally I felt a greater presence and sense of danger from the female assassin Sabine Moreau Lea Seydoux  Robin Hood a beautiful yet malicious woman with a cold heartless gaze completely devoid of compassion. In my opinion she'd have made a much better leading villain especially as her actions do personally effect one of the team but despite this little hiccup there is certainly more than enough obstacles to keep Hunt and his team busy and the audience well and truly entertained so this is really just nitpicking on my part.After the relative disappointment of the second Mission Impossible film first time feature director J.J. Abrams of TV's ALIAS and Lost fame injected some much needed heart and soul into the third installment expertly balancing a romantic subplot with the highoctane action sequences all fans demand of such a film. Although Abrams was not going to direct the fourth film it was reassuring to see that he was still involved as a producer so I had relatively high hopes that Ghost Protocol would live up to MI3 and I wasn't disappointed.Like MI3 before it Ghost Protocol's director's chair is filled with another first timer of sorts and like the previous chapter that 'gamble' has paid off. Although Brad Bird is not a first time feature helmer this is his first foray into the world of live action so he might not seem to be the most obvious choice but there was never any doubt from either Abrams or Cruise about his talent and potential to deliver a great film. Bird's impressive previous credits include The Iron Giant The Incredibles and Ratatouille the last two having won Academy Awards for best Animated Feature Film. Like Abrams Bird has also had great success on the small screen as an executive consultant on the Simpsons and I've been a fan of his work since chancing upon Family Dog from Spielberg's 'Amazing Stories' series in the early 90's.Simon Pegg Paul reprises his role as Benji Dunn from MI3 the computer whiz behind all the action. Dunn has now graduated from a 'behind the desk cameo' to a fully qualified field officer and as a result gets a much beefier role in this mission becoming one of Hunt's rogue team. Pegg's natural comedic timing and likable charm adds a muchneeded element of lightheartedness to the franchise that could have easily backfired had this role been miscast.Rounding out the new team are IMF agents Jane Carter Paula Patton  Deja Vu and William Brandt Jeremy Renner The Hurt Locker and both actors deliver solid performances. Carter is as sexy as she is deadly and Patton slips between these two persona's with ease while Brandt hides a secret past allowing Renner to show a vulnerability we're not used to seeing in the roles he normally plays.Mission Impossible  Ghost Protocol delivers exactly the type of entertainment action fans crave and as a result it is perfect popcorn movie. If you don't enjoy this ride then entertaining you is a mission impossible.".

	schema:reviewBody "I attended a VIP screening of Mission Impossible  Ghost Protocol last night at the Darling Harbor IMAX Theater in Sydney Australia. Before the movie started there was an introduction by Director Brad Bird and by actor Simon Pegg where they shared how much they enjoyed making the film and shooting scenes in the IMAX format.I won't get into the story too much as I don't want to ruin it for anyone but the basic plot is that the Kremlin in Russia is bombed by a terrorist group and IMF is framed for it. Because of these actions the president decides to activate Operation Ghost Protocol which essentially means that the entire IMF organisation is disavowed meaning Ethan and his team are on their own and like the tagline says No Plan No Backup No Choice.The story I found to be quite solid. Nothing groundbreaking but enough to keep the interest of your average moviegoer.The performances were generally good all around. Simon Pegg was enjoyable as Benji and Tom Cruise is always great as Ethan Hunt. Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton also gave some great performances. The action sequences are where the film really shines. Not all scenes were great I thought the bombing of the Kremlin used some very fake looking CGI which made it more humorous then intense. Also some scenes seemed a little too farfetched and made me think that Tom Cruise must be made of steel or something. But if you try not to look into this too much then chances are you will enjoy the action. The fight scenes were done very well incredibly brutal and realistic looking. The sound for this film really helped as you could almost feel every punch and kick as well as the explosions. The greatest scene for me was Ethan climbing the hotel in Dubai the worlds most tallest building. Shot in IMAX as well I almost felt like I was right there next to Ethan looking down from above. Huge credit goes to Tom Cruise for performing this stunt himself!Overall I found the film very enjoyable. I enjoyed it a lot more than the 2nd and 3rd entries but the 1st has always been the best one for me. I would have given this a perfect 10 but it loses 2 points for the some of the action scenes being a bit silly and unrealistic.".

	schema:reviewBody "YES! Finally a good nononsense Cruise starrer action thriller. No loveydovey stuff like the last one no attempts to show how charismatic Ethan Hunt is neither are there any obvious attempts to portray how cool he is. A good old action movie with Tom Cruise doing what he is known for best Action! This one's got everything an action thriller could ask for guns flying fists explosions cool gadgets sexy cars the occasional unanticipated startles hot chicks sandstorms jumping off tall buildings I think jumping off tall things has always been an MI trademark also the very much needed occasional comic relief very occasional which is good. And this one actually has a decent enough story!Every single actor in the movie has acted brilliantly. Paula Patton was very natural in her acting Simon Pegg the Hot Fuzz guy was hilarious as usual with his well timed one liners and Jeremy Renner was surprisingly good! all 3 part of Ethan Hunts team. Not to mention Anil Kapoor!Oh and Anil Kapoor! Obviously he has been the talk of town for this movie. His character in the movie and his acting however little its duration has been spot on and he delivers on the character. His part in the movie will certainly be one of the highlights when you leave the theater. Oh and the portrayal of Mumbai has been quite unique indeed.I won't spill the beans on the story but I am sure you know the gist of it from the trailers a certain KABOOM'ing of the Kremlin puts Ethan Hunt in a tough spot and he is being chased down by Russians for something he hasn't done so he needs to set it right and the only way he can do that is by starring in this awesome movie.All in all Ghost Protocol is hands down the best one yet from the Mission Impossible series mainly because it is different from its predecessors thank GOD for that. It is jam packed with action from the very first scene till the last and is filled with insane stunts gadgets car chases sweet ones. It is fast paced and has a good enough story with a script that will keep you in the loop. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout and not give you a seconds stare away from the screen. The audience actually went what? Not NOW! when the interval screen came up! Yes it was THAT good.Well done Cruise.".

	schema:reviewBody "The long wait is finally over as Tom Cruise finally returns to the celluloid to reprise his epic role of the enigmatic IMF agent Ethan Hunt. The brilliance of Mission Impossible III was marred by the infamous sacking of Tom Cruise by Paramount's owner and movie mogul Sumner Redstone who blamed Cruise's bizarre sofahopping TV antics and intransigent support of Scientology for movie's relatively poor show at the box office that resulted in losses of up to 75million in revenue. The sordid incident ensured that the wait for the next installment of the franchise had to be a long one. The half a decade lull that ensued saw Cruise's career sunk to a new nadir with movies like Lions for Lambs 2007 Valkyrie 2008 and Knight and Day 2010 failing to impress at the box office while his contemporaries and coevals continued to tumble records at the box office attaining new heights of fame and stardom. It is indeed ironic that Cruise's most impressive show in this interim has been his welldisguised cameo in Ben Stiller's Tropic Thunder 2008 in which he plays a the foulmouthed hotheaded halfbald studio executive. But every coin has the other part that completes the picture. While the things have been going a bit rough on the professional front Cruise's personal life has finally been witnessing a much needed sense of calmness and stability. Such stability on the personal front can often lift a person's morale providing him with a sense of rejuvenation that can help him fare well in all the facets of life. Tom Cruise's rejuvenated self is pretty much apparent in the latest installment of the MI franchise Mission Impossible  Ghost Protocol.Ghost Protocol takes the viewer on a roller coaster of a ride from Moscow to Dubai all the way to Mumbai never allowing a breathing space keeping him on the edge of the seat throughout. MI  GP is indeed the quintessential action extravaganza that the ardent lovers of the genre perpetually anticipate to devour upon in order to satiate their ever growing hunger for unremitting action and adventure. Ethan Hunt is back in all his glory with some newly added dimensions to his old daredevilry that had established him as the greatest contemporary to Ian Fleming's larger than life human incarnate. As seen with Bond in Casino Royale the key men behind the MI franchise have made conscious efforts to make the caricature of Hunt more vulnerable to danger and crises and hence more human. MI  GP delivers everything that an actionmovie lover craves for suspense intrigue passion daredevilry razzmatazz and much more. The adrenaline filled action is well complemented by the dazzle of the geeky gadgets on display and it is this synergy that makes MI  GP an incredibly sublime experience. The tremendous reputation that the high octane franchise carries meant the newly appointed director Brad Birdmostly renowned for his animation flicks The Incredibles and Ratatouillehad his work cut out for him. Brad Bird has indeed been up to the task and has lived well to the expectations of Cruise and the entire production team led by J.J. Adams who directed the third movie of the series back in 2006. Mission Impossible  Ghost Protocol is packed with a plethora of action sequences that includes a shootout in Budapest an escape sequence from a Moscow Jail a sandstorm chase in Dubai and a classic brawl in an automated parking garage in Mumbai. However the sequence that stands out is the one in which Tom Cruise climbs the tallest building in the world Burj Khalifa by clinging to it from the outside using suction gloves giving the Spiderman a run for his money. After the splendidly executed siege of the Vatican in the third installment Ethan and his IMF team are on the lookout for some classified information pertaining to a Russian extremist Kurt Hendricks which takes their quest to Kremlin. The covert mission goes awry as their plan is sabotaged by the personal intervention of Hendricks which turns the tables on Cruise and his team rendering them sequestered and helpless. The questionable events that unfold at Kremlin forces the US President to invoke the Ghost Protocol leading to the disavowal of IMF. Ethan and his team which includes the computer geek Benji Dunn Simon Pegg agents Jane Carter Paula Patton and William Brandt Jeremy Renner despite their severe handicap are the only hope left at preventing the diabolical duo of Hendricks and his stalwart Wistrom from fulfilling their demonic mission of global destruction through a nuclear war. Simon Pegg as Benji is spot on with his persiflage and his nonchalance adds a much needed levity to the otherwise tense plot. Paula Patton as Jane Carter is a treat to the sore eyes her imperial gait upright posture predatory agility dusky complexion steamy mystique athletic built curvaceous figure and apparent haughtiness make her an object of envy for males and females alike. Her ethereal presence undoubtedly leaves a lasting impression on the viewer. The introduction of Jeremy Renner as William Brandt adds another layer of intrigue to the plot of MI  GP. Brandt's enigmatic part allows Renner to depict a wide array of emotions that his previous roles couldn't offer. The overhyped inclusion of veteran Indian actor Anil Kapoor in the MI  GP cast is undoubtedly movie's greatest disappointment especially from the perspective of Indian cineastes as the actor fails to make an impression during his ephemeral performance.Overall MI  GP has managed to raise the bar for the Action genre. Indian moviemakers who have recently started to delve into the genre can look to take a note or two out of MI  GP in order to iron out the usual glitches. Despite the occasional lack of coherence in the plot MI  GP works quite well at almost all the levels and promises to be a great entertainment. 810www.apotpourriofvestiges.com".

Ethan and his team which includes the computer geek Benji Dunn Simon Pegg agents Jane Carter Paula Patton and William Brandt Jeremy Renner despite their severe handicap are the only hope left at preventing the diabolical duo of Hendricks and his stalwart Wistrom from fulfilling their demonic mission of global destruction through a nuclear war. Simon Pegg as Benji is spot on with his persiflage and his nonchalance adds a much needed levity to the otherwise tense plot. Paula Patton as Jane Carter is a treat to the sore eyes her imperial gait upright posture predatory agility dusky complexion steamy mystique athletic built curvaceous figure and apparent haughtiness make her an object of envy for males and females alike. Her ethereal presence undoubtedly leaves a lasting impression on the viewer. The introduction of Jeremy Renner as William Brandt adds another layer of intrigue to the plot of MI  GP. Brandt's enigmatic part allows Renner to depict a wide array of emotions that his previous roles couldn't offer. The overhyped inclusion of veteran Indian actor Anil Kapoor in the MI  GP cast is undoubtedly movie's greatest disappointment especially from the perspective of Indian cineastes as the actor fails to make an impression during his ephemeral performance.Overall MI  GP has managed to raise the bar for the Action genre. Indian moviemakers who have recently started to delve into the genre can look to take a note or two out of MI  GP in order to iron out the usual glitches. Despite the occasional lack of coherence in the plot MI  GP works quite well at almost all the levels and promises to be a great entertainment. 810www.apotpourriofvestiges.com";

	schema:reviewBody "... and he's climbing the tallest building in the world the Burj Khalifa of Dubai. Not only he's ascending the supertall structure he's going to infiltrate the Kremlin in Moscow chase people in a huge sandstorm and of course ... save the world. The story the IMF is accused for bombing the Kremlin although they were not actually the perpetrators. Due to this the IMF is shut down and Operation Ghost Protocol is launched with Ethan Hunt Tom Cruise Jane Carter Paula Patton Benji Dunn Simon Pegg and William BrandtJeremy Renner a group of 4 people being what is left of the IMF. Together they find that there was another person behind the bombing codenamed Cobalt and he has a plan to ignite a nuclear war which he believes would begin the next stage of human evolution. From beginning to end I was hooked by all the action scenes. The action scenes and all the moves are spectacular. The handtohand combats the chase scenes the gunfights are very welldone and spectacular. The cinematography was excellent and one of the best in years. Of course the Burj Khalifa scene was the trademark of the whole film. Ethan Hunt climbing the Burj Khalifa was thrilling enough. But with a limited time having trouble going back down and running around and swinging around the structure just quickens the pace of the story and makes the scene very stylish. This scene is just outstanding and will be one of the highlights of the film. The acting was very welldone. After 5 years of absence in the series Tom Cruise still got his spy skills here. Paula Patton's bad girl character is very wellplayed. Simon Pegg as the clumsybutgenius Benji Dunn was amazing. Jeremy Renner as the socalledanalystbut actuallyIMFagent William Brandt was stunning and great. The performances of the actorsactresses are very strong and convincing.I love the technology used in this film. They are just unreal. A device that lets you float using magnetic attraction. A device that copies the scenery behind and displays it into a screen that allows you to deceive other people who are looking at the screen. A suit that turns into a casual jacket when you wear it insideout. All of these devices are creatively made and looking at them being operated is just so fun. And be sure to see the amazing BMW Vision a futuristic BMW concept car in a scene set in Dubai. Also this movie is keen about BMWs.The mission tactics are also ingenious. The tactics are very smart and are very entertaining. How they create diversions in the most unlikely situations and the scenes involving the composition of a plan keep the film in a constant quick pace and increases the suspense of the film. When they take their tactics into action that's where they get more interesting. The comedy here adds up the fun in this film. Sometimes prolonged scenes of action are just too noisy and make the movie feel plain. But not here. The comedy scenes here act as intervals between so we don't always see long noisy and bloated action scenes major trouble of Transformers and make sure that we have a perfect dose of both. All these elements are very welldone and balanced and together form a suspenseful fastpaced and thrilling yet funny action ride worth to experience. I think we should thank genius director Brad Bird for successfully revitalizing the movie series. This movie is just brilliant and I think it's because of Bird's genius directing. Final Verdict With fastpaced directing by Brad Bird and exciting action sequences yet with funny moments this movie is a thrilling ride worth to experience. Rating 1010Thanks for reading my review on Mission Impossible  Ghost Protocol. I hope this review is useful.".

Tom Cruise performed the sequence where Ethan Hunt scales the outside of the Burj Khalifa tower himself without the use of a stunt doubl  the Burj Khalifa tower is the tallest building in the world  it is the Armani Hotel Dubai  the first hotel designed and developed by Giorgio Armani . During the filming of production Tom Cruise did the majority of his own stunts including the skyscraper sequences to show the audience it was actually him  this would allow director Brad Bird to have more capabilities with camera angles  not having to hide the fact it is a stuntman doing the stunts .

	schema:reviewBody "Saw this at a London IMAX press preview screening. Clearly JJ Abram's mission impossible should he choose to accept it is to lead a talented team to resurrect a declining franchise and reignite it with renewed vigour and a very high dosage of fun and entertainment.I'm glad to say mission highly accomplished.Brad Bird's first time direction of real actors must have been a shock when they talked back at him exhibits the same zestful energy and fun that we got from his animated films such as The Incredibles. Though not with the subtlety of his Iron Giant but this is Mission Impossible so we cant expect that kind of subtlety here. Story is outrageously OTT and thats how it should be for a franchise that violently throws plausibility out of the window with much deliberation. Not much else to say about the story apart from the fact that it can easily be translated into a Bond movie. We're in that kind of villainous territory here and it is fun.The action sequences are inventive relentless fun and tense. Some scenes are filmed in IMAX format and when seen on an IMAX screen are breathtaking and immersing.As well as Brad Bird's energised and retro direction the cast really sparkles too. Cruise rocks as an action stunt hero. In fact more so now than he ever did. His traditional self stunt work in this series continues to impress particular in his skyscraper scenes. There is also more playfulness and assuredness in a role he has now worn into nicely. Simon Pegg gets a delightfully big promotion to join Hunt's team making us laugh throughout the movie. And Paula Patton adds an elegant sexiness to the MI team missions. Another new addition to the team Jeremy Renner also gels smoothly into the squad.This film has drastically rejuvenated the franchise that I now highly anticipate further adventures of Ethan Hunt and his new vibrant team equally or even more so than the next James Bond movie.".

He's a fantastic actor who doesn't even chose to have a stunt double in MI4. I couldn't even think of trying some of these. Now to the main film. You may think it's going to be just like all the other action movies and all the other Mission Impossible parts. But with every new part of the series it gets even more spectacular the equipment is beyond imagination the locations are mind blowing the secret plans are super clever the characters are cool and smart. Also the trailer was that good that I just wanted to see this at the movies and couldn't wait for it to be released. I haven't seen any MI film at the movies and this was definitely a great decision. The best action film in years.I'm giving it a 1010 because there was nothing I didn't like about this movie and it was worth every cent!".

	schema:reviewBody "This fourth entry breathes fresh life into the Mission Impossible film Franchise. The original 1996 Mission Impossible was a promising start and now 15 Years and four films later I'm happy to say that Tom Cruise has still got it. This franchise  unlike most these days  has still got its edge and isn't showing any signs of losing it or wearing down. I could definitely see another episode being produced in the future. And we have Tom Cruise to thank for all of that... because he is after all the man who has carried these films. Cruise has not only starred in them all but he has also been very involved on the development and production end receiving billing as coproducer on all installments. Overall MISSION IMPOSSIBLE  GHOST PROTOCOL offers lighter adventure  perhaps on a bigger scale than any of the previous films  and also features a stellar ensemble cast and some of the best popcorn entertainment in a while. Now pushing 50 years old Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt sporting his MI2 Haircut and looking as young and in shape as ever and I say that having a staunch record of unblemished heterosexuality. He is complimented by a very wellcast team of agents. This team is better than any of the others Hunt has everworked with. It includes Chief analyst William Brandt portrayed by rising star Jeremy Renner... nominated for an Oscar 2 consecutive years in a row for his performance in the films THE HURT LOCKER  THE TOWN IN 2010 AND 2011 a likable and easytorelateto character who also has a secret....Jane Carter portrayed by the lovely Paula Patton another new addition to the team who is tough and attractive. She's not only great as eye candy but she serves as an integral member of the team.... Returning from his small part in MI3 is Benji Dunn portrayed once again by Simon Pegg. His role has been expanded as he is now a field agent. He provides a lot of laughs and comic relief....This time around Ethan Hunt leads this team of IMF agents as they try to prevent nuclear war with Russia.... That's the basic premise If you want more plot details see the movie!I had the pleasure of seeing this film in IMAX during its limited IMAX run and I've gotta say  The IMAX does very effectively enhance this movie especially during one particular scene midway through the film which has got everyone talking...This film draws from each Mission blending the best ingredients from each one. Ghost Protocol while lighter in tone feels closer to MI3 than to any of the others...Not surprising considering its scored once again by Michael Giacchino Medal of Honor UP Lost Star Trek Super 8and produced by MI3's director JJ ABRAMS Alias Fringe Lost Star Trek Super 8. Its also like MI2 in that it features an unrelenting amount of actionstunt work......and Tom Cruise with long hair again...It even echoes the TV Series because it has some of the same musical cues and really makes the mission a TEAM EFFORT. Now Ghost Protocol is less story drivencharacter focused than MI3 even if only slightly so. It really isn't too heavy on story but does have a decent amount of character development especially once it really gets going. I felt like we really got to know Ethan Hunt as a human being in MI3. This is true in Ghost Protocol but not so much as in MI3. Some may say Ghost Protocol lacked a strong villain like Owen Davien in MI3. While that's not necessarily a fault I will say that it would have been nice to see another great villain coming off the heels of MI3. One thing I love about these movies is that each one is so different from the last one. Each one has a different director and therefore a different style feel and flavor. Brad Bird known for his work in animation helms Ghost Protocol. He was an surprising choice considering he'd only directed animated films The Iron Giant The Incredibles Ratatouille prior to accepting but definitely a great choice.Overall MI4 is great popcorn entertainment. It has going for it some really awesome action sequences  one in particular that's truly remarkable and an outstanding ensemble cast. Its definitely worth seeing in theaters and owning on DVDBluRay. One of my top favorites of 2011 and perhaps my favorite Mission Impossible when its all said and done!".

While that's not necessarily a fault I will say that it would have been nice to see another great villain coming off the heels of MI3. One thing I love about these movies is that each one is so different from the last one. Each one has a different director and therefore a different style feel and flavor. Brad Bird known for his work in animation helms Ghost Protocol. He was an surprising choice considering he'd only directed animated films The Iron Giant The Incredibles Ratatouille prior to accepting but definitely a great choice.Overall MI4 is great popcorn entertainment. It has going for it some really awesome action sequences  one in particular that's truly remarkable and an outstanding ensemble cast. Its definitely worth seeing in theaters and owning on DVDBluRay. One of my top favorites of 2011 and perhaps my favorite Mission Impossible when its all said and done!";

If you love Charlie and the Chocolate Factory you'll love the fan and the tube scene except Jeremy Renner doesn't know he has to burp! Oh those fizzy lifting drinks are trouble!This bythenumbers action flick gets tiresome very quickly as clichd character back story is spoon fed to us at regular intervals with plenty of explanation. A lost unrequited love? Check. Guilt over an innocent's death. Check. Said lost love resulting in a ten second girl fight? Check. Futuristic supercar that turns up out of nowhere? Check. Character that is pivotal to the first scene and then turns up later for no reason to no avail? Check. The list just goes on and on. It's all mix and match character tropes did the writers phone this in?Simon Pegg's character has no back story other than preexisting in the MI universe and being English.Even the nemesis of the entire operation has fairly little screen time or motivation other than being evil and mad.

Secondary bad guy turns out to be oooooOOOoooo...... the other bad guy.Spy movies need to have unseen before secret spy gadgetry right? Well hold on to your socks because MI4 brings you GPS navigation chain mail and magnets a USB memory stick and a reversible jacket casual on one side and Russian formal on the other.

	schema:headline " The best 'Mission Impossible' yet is also our pick for the best action film of the year";
	schema:reviewBody "Summer is usually the time for big loud actionpacked blockbusters like this but let us tell you right at the start that none of the bombast we've seen this summer compares to what lies in store for you in the fourth bigscreen adaptation of the 1970s television series. This is handsdown the best action film this year boasting some of the most exhilarating action ever captured in a long while. It also restores Tom Cruise's marquee value as an action star and we dare attest that any naysayer to Cruise's ability to resurrect the franchise he almost drowned will be silenced once they see what he does on screen.Indeed the last 'Mission Impossible from 'Alias' and 'Lost' creator J.J. Abrams was then easily the best of the series though all that positive word about it couldn't quite triumph the bad press surrounding its star and producer Cruise's erratic behaviour. So 'MI3' ended up hitting a nadir for the franchise at the boxoffice and Cruise's star wattage has never since fully rebounded. Trying to restore its lustre wasn't a mission impossible but it was going to be an uphill task as well if not only for the fact that it had to better J.J. Abrams' solid work. That gamble has however paid off with an unlikely bet choosing animation hero Brad Bird from 'The Iron Giant' and 'Ratatouille' to make his first liveaction film. Bird is also of course the director of Pixar's 'The Incredibles' and there is certainly the same pulsating energy running through every frame of 'MI4'. From the very beginning Bird places his definitive stamp on the series with a classy opening that sees IMF operative Ethan Hunt breaking out of a Russian prison. That sequence which combines Dean Martin's 'Ain't That A Kick in the Head' with Steve McQueen's 'The Great Escape' is carefully executed and fluidly filmed and both are signature attributes of Bird's style throughout the movie. No 'Mission Impossible' film would be complete without the exotic locales fancy gadgets and big explosions but there is a certain finesse by which Bird assembles all these elements together into one package. So even as the setting moves from Russia to Dubai to Mumbai even as the gadgets grow increasingly fanciful one especially nifty device is a nifty retinabased mirrorlike screen and even as the explosions get more colossal how about blowing up the Kremlin? Bird never lets the adventure get frenetic alternating confidently between quiet tension and fullblown action to keep you on the edge of your seat. Riveted is what you'll be as Hunt and his team infiltrates the Kremlin to steal some classified intel about the Russian extremist Kurt Hendricks Swedish actor Michael Nyqvist from 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' then hoodwinks two sets of bad guys just one floor apart atop the Burj Khalifa and then races against time literally in the crowded streets of Mumbai to stop Hendricks from precipitating an allout nuclear war between the United States and Russia. Each elaborate setpiece is in itself a spectacle and watching them unfold one after another quite simply takes your breath away. But the most aweinspiring and worthy of singular mention setpiece is Cruise's vertiginous climb up the glass exterior of the Burj Khalifa using suction gloves. It is Cruise himself way up on the 130th floor and the authenticity of it shows in every second of Robert Elswit's breathtaking cinematography that is enough reason alone to catch this in IMAX. It is even more heartstopping than you can imagine not least when Cruise is left dangling with just one glove after the other malfunctions. Nothing else quite comes close to the sheer dizzying excitement of this sequence not even the intensely gripping race againsttime climax with a goodold fistfight between Hunt and Hendricks in an automated parking garage.Yes Cruise isn't one to rest on his laurels and at the age of 49 the extent to which he commits to perform the stunts in this movie by himself is simply amazing. When he is not attempting some deathdefying move in the air or for that matter on the ground Cruise uses his immense charisma to deliver a slickly captivating performance as the leader of the disavowed IMF. He also enjoys great chemistry with his supporting players the tech whiz Benji Dunn Simon Pegg the tough sexy female player Jane Carter Paula Patton and last but not least the enigmatic analyst William Brandt Jeremy Renner. The banter between Cruise and Pegg is particularly enjoyable the source of most of the movie's comic relief.Their wisecracks may at first seem at odds with the gravity of the situation at stake but ultimately these lighter moments provide a light zesty touch that ensures the movie doesn't sink into its own self seriousness. Besides these instants of levity the script by Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec works hard to spin an intriguing espionage plot amidst the action setpieces that harks back to the Cold War though admittedly their most glaring failure is in creating a more compelling villain than simply another madman bent on world destruction. They fare much better drawing links between this instalment and J.J. Abrams' last especially in explaining Hunt's absence from duty as well as Brandt's mysterious past.Still story isn't its strong suite and Bird knows that well enough to keep most of his cards close and revealing just enough clues to keep his audience hooked. But the 'Mission Impossible' films were always going to be about delivering thrilling blockbuster entertainment and it is in this regard that Bird truly shines. To say that the action on display is exhilarating is merely an understatement and let us reassure you that the extra bucks you will shell for an IMAX ticket is worth every additional cent. It is quite simply the best 'Mission Impossible' entry yet and the best action film you'll ever see this year.".

Also there wasn't enough detailing given which left holes the size of craters in the plot.On the plus side however is the cinematography which is spectacular. From Kremlin to Dubai to Mumbai the cities have been captured beautifully which made it feel more like a Travel show. the acting is decent too.However I must say I did not watch it on an IMax screen and I guess that did take away some charm.So finally I'd say you can watch it if you're easily amazed.

	schema:headline " Film of the year. Believe it.";
	schema:reviewBody "Is there anything Brad Bird can't do? Interest was certainly high when it was announced that the animation director would be making his live action directing debut choosing to tackle the third sequel in the Mission Impossible film series. Brian De Palma's first while it hasn't aged well is a tense 70s style thriller John Woo's MI 2 increased the action but lowered the intelligence and in 2006 JJ Abrams reinvigorated the franchise with the exciting and highly enjoyable MI 3. But all of the previous films have been completely left in the dust by Bird's Mission Impossible  Ghost Protocol a strong contender for film of the year and perhaps one of the finest action films ever made. To have pulled off such a feat is somewhat remarkable for Bird. While certainly an immensely talented director best known for The Iron Giant and The Incredibles two films which would rank highly on any respectable list of greatest animated movies of all time the ability to transfer his skills to liveaction on the scale of MI  GP with such flair sets him apart as a filmmaker with immeasurable gifts and one of the most interesting directors working today.So what is it about MI  GP that works so well? Tom Cruise returning as IMF agent Ethan Hunt once again puts everything he's got into his role. This franchise is clearly Cruise's baby and the famously passionate star characteristically doesn't shy away from the more perilous stunt work. The level of commitment shown by Cruise is staggering whether he's clinging to the side of the worlds tallest skyscraper 130 floors up! or throwing himself down several levels of a parking garage. Say what you will about his eccentricities but the man takes a pounding at every turn of this film only to rise and face down the next challenge the very definition of a fearless performance. Also of note is Simon Pegg making a welcome return in a much larger role than the last film and his wisecracks and facial silliness provide much needed relief from the relentless suspense of the narrative. The story is somewhat familiar as Ethan and his team fight to stop a psychopathic genius Michael Nyqvist hell bent on starting world war three but what could be a fairly standard affair in less capable hands is turned into something wonderful by Bird.As you can probably gather the real star of MI  GP is Brad Bird. From a dialogue perspective the film is surprisingly minimalist as the director boldly lets his spectacular visuals speak for themselves rather than relying on too much exposition from his characters. Likely because of his background in animation where the visual style comes literally from the hands of the artist Bird's compositions and framing are so meticulously crafted particularly in some of the more pulse pounding set pieces. The aforementioned skyscraper climb is one of the most exciting sequences I have ever seen in a film but it's merely one of several fantastic scenes constructed by Bird and his team. Even in the quieter moments seemingly unimportant small gags Hunt shedding a disguise for example add so much to the film like the delicate icing on a huge manylayered cake. As welcome as a new animated film from Bird would be the astounding quality of MI  GP suggests that anything he chooses to do from this point will be hotly anticipated. Whether his Pixar compatriot Andrew Stanton can pull off the same transition with next year's John Carter remains to be seen but for now Brad Bird seems to be a director who can do no wrong.tinribs27.wordpress.com".

The film starts off well enough and after a high octane prison break our familiar hero Ethan Hunt is whisked into another impossible mission which results in his and his IMF team being disavowed already sounds like familiar territory . Along with Cruise Simon Pegg returns and is solid enough providing the comic relief they are joined by Jeremy Renner who feels vastly underused and lost in this material which is quite frankly beneath him. The gadgets become exceedingly ridiculous as the film goes they are used so much they fail to impress at all.The last third of the film is where it really falls away completely and the final scene with cruise and Renner where a ludicrous sub story involving Hunt's supposedly dead wife is resolved feels so contrived and clichd I was praying for the credits to roll.Personally Mission Impossible 4 is indicative of the blockbuster action film today barring a few eg Dark Knight lots of product placement and ipads but zero substance and originality .".

	schema:reviewBody "Easily the worst in the MI franchise. It's movies like this that make me wonder how movies ever get made. The story is a badly regurgitated Cold War plot that requires the ghosted IMF team to stop a Russian physicist trained in special forces martial arts from acquiring nuke launch codes and starting Armageddon.Apparently since the global economic downturn a spy organization as sophisticated as IMF doesn't have the budget for foolproof selfdestruct phones anymore. The newly assembled ghost IMF team is comprised of incompetent misfits Ethan Hunt  As every super hero since Superman and Batman can tell you personal relationships can be difficult particularly if you choose a civilian nonsuper hero to be your spouse resulting in every demented supper villain coming after them as a means of striking at the Achilles' Heal of the super hero  Duh. Ethan was well aware of this danger since MI1 when Kittridge used coded news footage of his auntuncle being arrested to uncover his location. Everything that Ethan hunt did was pointless he saved a fellow Russian prisoner as future collateral for contacting a Russian connected with black market weapons  unnecessary and he probably could have gotten the same information from a Google search. He infiltrated the Kremlin as an aged but youthfully well built Russian general and failed to prevent a national disaster resulting in an annoyingly reoccurring catandmouse chase with Russian intelligence. Lastly he has a wife that he can never talk to  huh?Benji the tech guy  is plagued by delusions of grandeur and suffers from AADD. Even when presented with the opportunity to go undercover in Russia Benji just can't manage to shut up even though his English mutterings might just give away the fact that he is not a Russian officer. Every gadget this guy touches malfunctions. Apparently the American version of James Bond's Q leaves much to be desired.Agent Carter  after leading a failed op that resulted in the death of not only her key agent but apparently a secret love interest she battles with a schizophrenic bout of manic depression. When ordered not to kill potentially important sources of information what does she do  she kills the important source of information instead of properly incapacitating them  what no knock out serum?. During her one important mission to seduce an Indian mogul she displays a neurosis that oddly proves sadistically seductive. The goal is to procure his coded access to his satellite in order to prevent the Russian physicist from transmitting his launch codes. Which they ultimately fail to do. But thankfully there is always a backup shutdown switch in a briefcase!Agent Bradt  another failed agent whose covert mission to protect Ethan and his wife while on vacation ended in a muddled coverup operation to disguise Ethan's wife' witness protection plan as a faked death. Otherwise he is utterly useless in preventing his boss from being killed or bad guys getting lose.Bottom line the story was underwhelming and lacked a clevercomplex layered story and was instead a sappy corny comedic parody of previous MI films. So if you are expecting hioctane drama nail biting suspense and memorable acting skip MI4 and see War Horse.".

Admittedly I haven't paid much attention to the series since the first one so I assume they've dropped the serious side and tried to go actioncomedy ala The Evil Dead series.So where does it go wrong? Firstly the mix of comedy and seriousness is like oil and water. A film like True Lies did it well. Even though the stakes were high the underlying comedy was well played. In MissionImpossible 4 there's a weird mix of slapsticky humour and serious action film violence. It doesn't work very well. Think Mission Impossible 1 crossed with Shaun of the Dead. To be fair there's a few funny moments but they're few and far between.The plot is awful. I have no idea why some random guy decided to start World War 3. There's some weak justification given but it doesn't make sense. Apparently the bad guy is insane and that's reason enough. I mean hey! Why waste time actually telling a coherent story? The dialogue is okay but the pacing and scenes are shambolic. There's no tension as befitting the brink of World War 3 in the film.The action is okay. There's some explosions the tallest building in the world and so on but it's all pretty rushed and weak. Due to the fact that the writer decided not to have a decent storyline everything the team does seems poorly planned and haphazard. There are no twists in the story and no suspense. Because the audience is never really sure what the stakes are it makes for a dull film. The characters are worthless and there's no audience connection to them.Cruise is in pretty uncharismatic mode Pegg is miscast well no Pegg is a great comedy actor but more correctly the role is miscast Renner is dawdling in the corner the other cast members are mostly just going through their paces. The bad guy is okay but he's largely just an afterthought.I knew that the film would suck I was just surprised at how much it sucks. The writer was very lazy on this one. The direction is competent without being great.4 out of 10. I wouldn't even bother til the DVD is off new release and in the weekly aisle at the video store.".

Tom is getting a little bit older so it was a good question if he still had it in him to be a great action star since his career is still a little shaky over the past few years he's proved once again that he's almost ageless. Despite the fact that it's the unrealistic action in my opinion that's the best kind! I love my Tom Cruise running without losing an ounce of breath I love throwing every element of surprise at the team and they manage to get around it I love the explosions not effecting anyone the car chases the dust storms it's just amazing! Mission Impossible 4 is a roller coaster ride of excitement and doesn't let you go.Jane Carter and newly promoted field agent Benji Dunn extract Ethan Hunt and Hunt's source Bogdan from a Moscow prison. Hunt is recruited to lead Carter and Dunn to infiltrate the secret Moscow Kremlin archives and locate files identifying Cobalt. During the mission someone broadcasts across the IMF frequency alerting the Russians to Hunt's team. Although Dunn and Carter escape a bomb destroys the Kremlin and Russian agent Sidorov arrests Hunt suspecting him as part of the attack. But as it turns out it's a terrorist who is looking to create a nuclear war and to start man kind over again in order to create world peace.I loved all the action scenes in here. The best by far is when Tom Cruise has to climb the side of this sky scrapper building with these gloves that are magnetic you know that one of the gloves is bound to slip and it does and he manages to grab the glass at last minute with one hand. He also then has to land back onto the floor but is a little short on slack so has to get a head start he runs and barely survives! You know they have to put a predictable outing of the plot where he will survive in there but it's still exciting to watch. I also loved the dust storm chase scene that was really intense and exciting to watch. Simon Pegg made for some great comic relief. Jeremy Renner made for a great action side kick that held his own next to Ethan. Paula Patton was a great tough sexy chick the group needed and added a great cat fight to the movie. My only complaint is that the villain didn't seem as developed so I didn't feel as big a threat with him as I should have. However Tom Cruise never disappoints with the tension and suspense of the situation. I think it's safe to say that I've fallen back in love with Tom Cruise and the rest of America can too he may be crazy as a nut but he never fails to entertain when giving us a great action movie. Very much the best of 2011 and I cannot wait to add it to my video collection. If this is what we have in store for the next Mission Impossible movie I'll be the first in line.810".

And Sign of the Pagan was one of his finests acting jobs. He played the part like he was born for it. All the other characters in the film were far less colorful. He stole the show! The story of the movie is definitely more Hollywood then history. And the real Attila the Hun was a dwarf. But that's okay it still is most enjoyable. I've watched it maybe about 100 times.

Incidentally I had some trouble with this one too at first but then got hold of a copy  of surprisingly passable quality despite an almostconstant reddish hue  culled from a local TV screening dating from the 1980s which print is owned by the former sexton filmbuff who occasionally invites me and a few other friends over to partake of his extensive private collection! The plot sees the Barbarian hordes joining forces under the leadership of Attila to attack the divided Roman Empire the film starts with Attila releasing a Roman centurion Jeff Chandler in order to alert his rival Emperors of their coming this proves an unwise decision because with the help of the sister Ludmilla Tcherina of one of them he manage to unite the Roman legions to face the impending onslaught. Other important figures in the intrigueladen narrative are a Roman General Jeff Morrow who assists Chandler in his task Attila's sturdy daughter Rita Gam who smitten with the Roman and drawn towards Christianity begins to find her father's savage ways deplorable and the Empress of a nation conquered by the Huns and taken for wife by Attila but who takes her ultimate revenge by murdering him during the climactic battle. Chandler doesn't look too bad in Roman garb while Palance predictably chews the scenery his Attila is something of a neurotic who organizes his campaigns on the basis of his astrologer's advice! on the other hand Tcherina is saddled with a rather underwritten part but Gam does well in her mix of tomboy and ingnue. While Sirk's handling cannot be called impersonal it was not exactly inspired either that said the film is not as pious  and consequently dull  as many of its ilk the scope reasonably sprawling and the action highlights more than just adequate. By the way for Palance this was a sort of precursor to Andre' De Toth's similarly interesting THE MONGOLS 1961 which was actually an Italian production from that same country and contemporaneously with SIGN OF THE PAGAN came another outing about the bloodthirsty Hun ATTILA 1954 with Anthony Quinn in the lead my father had rented the Englishlanguage version back in the day but having recently taped the original on latenight Italian TV I'll be reacquainting myself with it presently as a companion piece to Sirk's epic.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Sign of the Pagan is a pretended swords and sandals epic film about Attila the Hun's attack on the remains of a divided Roman empire. The screenplay tries somehow to follow historic facts and show us some events in the Hun King's life that we know about his merciful attacks on villages while marching against Rome his meeting with Pope Leo his contacts with the Romans he had been a hostage in Rome as a young boy and his death by the hand of slave girl Ildico.But in all the movie lacks a sense of greatness and the big spectacle other films of the same genre that were released about the same time achieved Quo Vadis and Helen of Troy are clear examples.The cast is not very accurate either. Jeff Chandler was always a standard actor but no more than that perhaps his best performance was that of Apache chief Cochise in 1950's western Broken Arrow and he looks wooden and unconvincing as the Roman Centurion that tries to defeat Attila. Ludmilla Tcherina was not much of an actress either and her Princess Pulcheria character is too simple. Rita Gam clearly overacts as Palance's daughter that starts to question his father's ideas about Rome. What makes this film worth a watch is Jack Palance's performance as the Hun chief he has the proper physiche du rol some make up helps him too but he manages to transmit the strength and conviction a warrior leader like Attila was supposed to have.Too many indoor shooting doesn't help the picture either. I think Douglas Sirk was a fine director but he felt more comfortable in contemporary dramas such as Written in the Wind.The Sign of the Pagan is just for fans of the genre or to watch a fine performance by Jack Palance as an historical figure. Not much more in my opinion but superior to the Italian try on Attila's whereabouts starring Anthomy Quinn and Sophia Loren released almost at the same time.".

Having already made his mark in Shane as the heartless evil gunman which the town feared he takes evil to a whole new level in Sign of the Pagan.The music is glorious and the color is so wonderful. All of the actors really gave their best in this effort. Palance makes you believe his character is evil. If you ever get the chance to see this film and the one made after 1996 together bear in mind that they deal with the story from different perspectives. Both are close to being historically correct...as much as they can be. Sign of the Pagan is a study in Power and Might where the newer Atilla story is a Love Story with some interesting action thrown in. If this movie is on your HOT LIST check out The Tatars with victor Mature c.1961 The Black Rose 1950 with Tyrone Power and Jack Hawkins and Swordsman of Sienna 1956? starring Stewart Granger.".

	schema:reviewBody "At 705 pm on Saturday 1 May 1976 BBC 1 showed the complete and uncut version of Sign of the Pagan. Puzzlingly this was probably the last time that anyone was allowed to see Ludmilla Tcherina's exotic dance number. For reasons known only to the Universal studios that whole sequence has been deleted from subsequent television showings both on American station AMC and Britain's Channel 4. Nor do DVD releases contain the dance even though the main title still credits Kenny Williams as choreographer leaving viewers wondering what he could have possibly choreographed. Most surprising of all is the 2011 German DVD special edition which presents both the original wide screen and 4 x 3 versions. Even here Universal have cleanly cut the dance number from both prints and both languages.For those who have never seen the sequence Attila has just won the palace show fight with Herculanas. After that the Emperor commands his sister the Princess Pulcheria to dance for the visiting barbarians. For the first 50 seconds she performs a graceful and dignified piece of ballet which the barbarians obviously find boring. Therefore the Emperor tells a servant Advise my sister this is not suited to barbarian taste. So ordered the Princess switches to a more raunchy routine that the visitors find much more enjoyable. This lasts about two minutes. Few genre fans would argue that in both the Hollywood and Italian epics the exotic dance interlude is something of a highlight. We get to see beautiful girls in eyecatching costumes always accompanied by some classy music. Indeed the ballet score we hear or used to hear from Salter and Skinner in Sign of the Pagan is arguably the best music they ever composed.Universal obviously hope noone's going to notice what they've done but why did they do it in the first place? One can only theorize. Perhaps the film was cut at some stage to fit into a fixed television slot. Or maybe the dance was excluded to make the film more suitable for children's matinees. Then nobody remembered to put the scene back? A somewhat wilder theory is that it's a rights issue. Remembering how the Gershwin estate not liking the Porgy and Bess movie have tried for years to prevent anyone seeing it could Ludmilla Tcherina and her estate have somehow bought out this dance scene and are now withholding it because it does not enhance her memory as a classical ballerina? But surely Universal with all their wealth would hardly spoil one of their classics just to grab a few dollars?Whatever the reason most fans will agree that missing scenes in movies are a continuing source of irritation. Come on Universal put it back!".

	schema:reviewBody "Overall production value is not very high on this film I seem to recall the film's inability to pass off studio sets as exterior locations. My recollection is of a very TVlike production on the level of a B movie with a large then usual budget. However Jack Palance is excellent as Attila the Hun. He really does come across as a barbarian giving a very intense performance that compares well with his earlier role as Toriano in Arrowhead with Charlton Heston. Some great supporting roles also with Jeff Morrow This Island Earth playing the grizzled Roman General and Alexander Scourby famous for his narrationvoiceover work playing Chrysaphius the Eunuch advisor to Theodosius II. Jeff Chandler's subdued performance is a good match for the stoic Christian Roman he plays. It's a good counterpoint to Palance's growling Attila. For years I thought Palance was short of stature based on his sword fighting here with Jeff Chandler but it was just that Chandler was several inches taller than Palance who was himself 6' 2...Interesting triviaThe uncredited narrator of the film is Rex Reason who costarred with Jeff Morrow in This Island Earth.".

	onyx:emotionText "Overall production value is not very high on this film I seem to recall the film's inability to pass off studio sets as exterior locations. My recollection is of a very TVlike production on the level of a B movie with a large then usual budget. However Jack Palance is excellent as Attila the Hun. He really does come across as a barbarian giving a very intense performance that compares well with his earlier role as Toriano in Arrowhead with Charlton Heston. Some great supporting roles also with Jeff Morrow This Island Earth playing the grizzled Roman General and Alexander Scourby famous for his narrationvoiceover work playing Chrysaphius the Eunuch advisor to Theodosius II. Jeff Chandler's subdued performance is a good match for the stoic Christian Roman he plays. It's a good counterpoint to Palance's growling Attila.

He's rather colorless as the centurion who becomes CaptainGeneral of the Roman forces. When Jack Palance is on screen as Attila the Hun there ain't a stick of furniture safe in his view. It's that kind of part so sit back and enjoy. In fact Anthony Quinn took the same approach when he did Attila in a film that came out around the same time. Nothing remotely historically accurate about Sign Of The Pagan other than Attila's meeting with Pope Leo I and his turning back from his conquest of Rome. Moroni Olsen in his farewell big screen performance is is the Pope. No one knows what was actually said so its is all open to speculation.

	schema:reviewBody "Not one among the top notch epics that come to mind while encountering the genre SIGN OF THE PAGAN by Douglas Sirk is an intriguing production and the one that occurs to offer a bit more than its typical concepts. Seemingly it appears that there are two persons who make this film still mentioned on lists its versatile director Douglas Sirk who became renowned in Hollywood and whose hallmarks are herein noticeable and the actor Jack Palance the face that hardly results in negligence who actually portrays the protagonist of the story. To analyze it in a more indepth manner one cannot consider the film from a merely spectacular standpoint. In that context we can name a dozen other better more colossal epics.The historical period its story is set is a very interesting material for a screen production. Unlike some colossal Roman epics SIGN OF THE PAGAN deals with an already 'Christianized' Roman empire something Tony Keen critically points out in his review or rather the divided empire into two of its 'wings' the west with the capital in Rome and emperor Valentinian Walter Coy and the east with the capital in Constantinople perhaps one of the most spectacular cities in the history of mankind and emperor Theodosius George Dolenz. Yes it is the 5th century the proud Roman eagles have already been replaced by the humble Cross reference to Walter Pidgeon's prologue to 1951 QUO VADIS but the enemy is approaching it is the king of the Huns Attila the barbaric leader who has been granted many portrayals in both opera and film just to name Anthony Quinn who portrayed the figure in another 1950s epic. Here it is JACK PALANCE. Although it is not one of the most famous portrayals this performance deserves credit.Hailed by Gregor Torinus as depicting 'Attila's humanity' and 'sweeping portrayal of a crazed warrior with modern ailments' Dennis Shwartz 2007 Jack Palance is the highlight of the movie. From the good rapport with the director he is indeed not an absolutely crazed savage driven by bloodthirst and slaughter there are exceptions to this rule but a man who is able to display certain godly fear from the depths of his nature. It is best resembled in the scene a historic moment of the meeting with a historically eminent figure Pope St Leo I the Great the first Successor of Peter who was actually the first to carry the title of both the Bishop of Rome and POPE here played by Moroni Olsen. Gleaming with mysterious light and quite accurate historically the scene does not only aim at portraying the superior power of will and faith within Leo but also Attila's readiness to cease the weapons and accept peace. The fact that he is a sophisticated character and has those 'modern ailments' Schwartz may also be observed in his fear of signs esp. when lightning kills his seer in a fictitious fantasized scene and many consultations with the Astrologer his sorcerer Eduard Franz. Credit to Mr Palance! And the director DOUGLAS SIRK?We do not recognize him in the 'cheap spectacle' Schwartz in 'complete rearrangement of chronology' nor 'oddity for a Hollywood Roman epic' Keen because honestly Mr Sirk proves to feel rather at odds with the genre. Douglas Sirk's style evokes at the role of women herein depicted. We actually encounter three women here Cubra Rita Gam Attila's daughter Ildico Allison Hayes her lady in waiting and Princess Pulcheria Ludmila Tcherina. Let me skip the historical inaccuracy in this particularly the princess they all supply us with clear overtones of let me call it in modern terms 'emancipation.' While still pagan women are ruled by the ever present desire of independence which is not a right word in the historical context Pulcheria's free spirit is inspired by Virgin Mary. In one scene we see her worship the Mother of God at one of the icons in Constantinople it is not as some would say a Catholic perspective but a very historical notion that Mary was an example for Christian women of the first centuries even 'Augustas of Rome' the most notable being Saint Helen the mother of emperor Constantin. Unfortunately this point is not well developed goes pale and remains the backdrop till the fatally banal finale when we actually mix the idea if it is the shadow of the cross or a woman who kills Attila. There is no mention of Honoria. The director's spirit can be found however in the love story of Marcian Jeff Chandler the centurion and future emperor of Rome and Pulcheria.The HISTORICAL INACCURACIES are indeed multiplied. Beginning with its source where the screenwriter Barre Lyndon does not even consider the historical writings of Priscus Procopius nor Jordanes but Oscar Brodney's story that leads to the mode of fantasy and fiction where important historical figures and the entire background gives way to all needs of cheap entertainment evoked in wrestling 'protoXena' fighting etc. There are some memorable scenes like the aforementioned meeting with Pope Leo at Mincio near Mantua that does not echo the famous painting by Raphael nor depict the famous Christian legend but carries a certain visual impact. Another moment is Attila's entrance to the church where the cross and monks's psalm drive him away from the town. However there is no single mention of officer Aetius Council of Chalcedon which played a decisive role in the story. The confrontation of civilization vs barbarianism is also reduced to sheer Christianity vs paganism. Esp. in the Roman context we know that this is not the case.Nevertheless in spite of all criticism about this movie that one may encounter I would still recommend to see SIGN OF THE PAGAN for purely cinematic motives. Obviously do not treat it as a history lesson where the shadow of the cross within the sign of sword occurs to be sheer mutilation and simplification. Something different than more famous epics.".

Sometimes he just shot the scenes twice such as the encounter between Attila and the savvy sister of the emperor. Often you can see more of the set top and bottom in the flat version. Oh big is that there is a sacredprofane dance of Ludmilla Tchirina the famous ballerina. She is the emperor's sister. She provides the afterdinner entertainment... anyway it's cut from the CinemaScope version we were watching. Also kind of big the CinemaScope lens couldn't record the three strip technicolor so the flat version is the version that is actually shot in Technicolor. The CinemaScope version is what Eastman color? Anyway the CinemaScope version was meant to be the premium version of the movie... perhaps it is. I liked the flat version.UPDATE ONE Hello. After all these years remembering a Castle Films condensed version I suddenly saw a fairly complete 16mm 3600' IB technicolor print of this movie. This move is directed by Douglas Sirk and stars Jack Palance as Attila the Hun who will listen to everyone. One might question whether the title of the movie another sign of is the Sign of the Cross... indicates some degree of humor however as Mr. Palance exhibits his unique range of facial expressions one can never question his sincerity. The best that Douglas Sirk can offer Mr. Palance is to surround him in the full spectrum of color. There is a chemical threestrip color process used herein that makes every shot breathtaking. There is some question about whether Universal could provide Mr. Sirk with the budget needed for a Roman Empire battle movie All Mr. Sirk needed was the technicolor film and a bonfire. ADDED NOTE the end looks like a bwestern shootout as the Huns have changed their mind about attacking the walled city of the Holy Roman Empire... so they get ambushed and slaughtered by the Romans while passing through a cardboard town. At least the studio provided a staircase for them to climb during the last scene.Other odd casting includes a ballerina dancing as part of the entertainment provided at the Byzantium dinner for the Huns. It's a pleasure to see her take over as Emperor Ludmilla Tcherina. It is interesting to note the overall power of women in this movie. They perform all the necessary actions. After appearing in this movie Attila's trophy wife former model Allison Hayes can also be seen larger than life in Attack of the 50' Woman. Here is my original review There were no credits on the 200 foot role of silent 8mm black and white film. The box said Attila the Barbarian and the man featured surely looked like a young Jack Palance. IMDb has just provided the identity of the film. The cutest of the scenes features a popelike figure arriving at the army camp the night before the attack. He is standing in a gondola floating across a still misty lake warning us He who lives by the sword shall perish by the sword.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sign of the Pagan tends to live in the shadow of the great 1950's Hollywood epics such as Quo Vadis The Robe and Helen of Troy among others.Based on Attila the Hun's invasion of the Roman Empire Sign of the Pagan stars Jack Palance as Attila. Although the script plays fast and loose with history most of the characters are based on real historical figures including Jeff Chandler's Marcian who became the ruler of the Eastern Roman Empire.There are some powerful scenes in the film although many of them are shot on foggy dimly lit sound stages that would suit Phantom of the Opera. Some nicely rendered glass shots give scope to a few scenes but the palace interiors are less than sumptuous and look as though they were filmed in a couple of spare rooms at Universal.The film plays up Attila's superstition regarding Christianity which seems based on fact one of the best scenes is when Pope Leo I psyches him out and stops the sacking of Rome.One disappointment is the way Attila's death is handled. There are a number of versions about how he actually died but the most popular is that he burst a blood vessel consummating his marriage to Ildico a hot Ostrogoth princess Allison Hayes. A tricky one for a 1950's movie but director Douglas Sirk and the team didn't even try  she still kills him but far less spectacularly.It probably doesn't pay to be too pedantic about costuming in a film such as this but the Roman Army seems equipped with armour and weapons from a far earlier time this was the early 5th Century AD and things had changed over fivehundred years  the costuming here is a little like making a movie about DDay with U.S. troops hitting Omaha Beach wearing the uniforms of George Washington's Continental Army.Although it is hard to see a modern audience getting too much out of Sign of the Pagan  a miniseries such as Rome has higher production values  I still enjoy this film. Maybe its partly nostalgia but I find it fascinating watching actors as unique as Jeff Chandler and Jack Palance. With chiselled features and prematurely grey hair Chandler had a great presence even if he was a little wooden but Jack Palance was a scenestealer in every film he did and he made a perfect Attila  all he needed was a bigger horde behind him.".

And there is some nice dialogue as well not Oscarworthy material perhaps but nice enough and the pacing wasn't too bad either. It is the performance of Jack Palance though that takes centre stage he portrays Atila the King of the Huns as a ruthless and ferocious barbarian and Palance seems to be having a whale of a time it was quite simply a hugely enjoyable performance.Overall not absolutely brilliant but very enjoyable even with its faults. 710 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "They don't make 'em like this any more! and one is tempted to say Thank Heavens! A typical 1950s Hollywood sword and sandals caper with one eye on the folks in the Bible Belt so references to the Cross and this strange new force coming from Gallilee while on the other hand lots of scenes of young ladies all of whom seem to have disconcertingly easy access to 1950s hair salons or lipstick stores either splashing about in Roman baths or being leered at by nasty barbarians led by the worst of them all Jack Palance in the guise of Attila the Hun. The more the 90 minutes dragged by the more you came to appreciate Palance's appearances as virtually the ONLY saving grace for this familysized slice of ham. For a start he seems the only person in the entire cast who can actually ACT the rest being so wooden that they could easily have auditioned for the lead role in 'Pinnochio' instead. Secondly the production values are a complete laugh. The 'numerous wild hordes of barbarians' in reality were probably 30 extras on horseback and I lost count of the number of times the SAME scene of these horsemen riding by was used throughout the film! while what seems to have been the producer's weekend country retreat outside Los Angeles was apparently used as another sacked city on a number of occasions. There is some good work in background projection to suggest Rome and other vistas but on the whole it is very amateurish stuff. Conclusion OKish if you have a wet afternoon to spend but beyond Palance's screen presence do not expect a lot and you will not be disappointed. Having seen it once the next time you come across it get out the video or DVD of Gladiator instead and thank your lucky stars we have moved on so much in fifty years!".

Just beyond the square!  If the emperor had sent me a legion instead of just one centurion I could stop this treason right now!. The movie was originally issued in both a CinemaScope version and a widescreen version but many cities including mine didn't play the 'scope version at all even though they had the capacity to do so. As a Universal executive said to me at the time We had two reasons One we didn't want to tie up a 'Scope screen when we had so much better 'Scope product on hand and two we didn't feel it would make a single cent of difference at the boxoffice. In fact if anything clumsy matte work painted backdrops a ludicrous script pseudoreligious pretensions  and then to be cheated of a promised climax namely the sack of Rome  would probably have hardened a more affluent audience's resistance to the point of no return. And in many areas the movie's religious pretensions could also have hurt the company's profile. And as for the acting Jeff Chandler handles his lines with his usual air of bewilderment Ludmilla Tcherina is embarrassingly inept whilst Rita Gam tries valiantly to make drama out of her ridiculous dialogue. I'll admit that George Dolenz lends a bit of character to his villainous emperor and Walter Coy is delightfully smallminded as Valentian. Jack Palance has a stab at making Attila a neurotic twit. But Jeff Chandler says his lines with his usual air of bewilderment All in all the only people to escape this farrago with any glory at all are the photographer Russell Metty and Havens the 2nd unit director.".

The director is Douglas Sirk more normally at home with lush melodramas such as MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION or WRITTEN ON THE WIND. This film was made for Twentieth CenturyFox rather than Universal and shot on a low budget. Nonetheless with the help of his regular cinematographer Russell Metty Sirk manages to create some memorable set pieces especially when he depicts the movement of Atilla the Hun's Jack Palance's army on its doomed trek to Rome.Perhaps more so than any other epic except perhaps for QUO VADIS? 1951 this film preaches an explicitly Christian message. Atilla's attempts to take over the Roman Empire are doomed not because of any lack of valor on his part but because he cannot challenge the will of God. His regular astrologer Eduard Franz counsels him not to pursue his campaign but he ignores the advice in the belief that to turn back would represent a betrayal of his masculinity. In the end however the struggle to carry on becomes too much and he does turn back only to meet a violent and bloody end. Palance transforms Atilla into a complex character one who likes to maintain an aggressive facade mistreating his women Rita Gam Allison Hayes and exchanging aggressive banter with his men. In truth however he is genuinely apprehensive of God's wrath despite his pretensions to the contrary. In his frustration  at not being able to fulfill his intended quest  he throws a dagger at his daughter and kills her stone dead.Jeff Chandler is predictably wooden as the good guy the Roman Marcian. He doesn't have to do much other than to show loyalty to his ruler and insist on the power of Christianity to save everyone he commands soldier and civilian alike. Despite being heavily outnumbered God is on their side.The settings are predictably orientalist medieval Constantinople is represented as a city full of eastern promise with muezzins in the background and oriental music playing on the pipes. The female slaves wear long baggy silk pants their male counterparts have bare torsos. The Roman colonizers lie down on expensive mattresses eating fresh fruit and ordering a variety of entertainments including gladiatorfighting. Such tropes were characteristic of the Hollywood representation of Turkey from the 1920s on.As a piece of midFifties propaganda celebrating the American way in opposition to alternative lifestyles here denounced as pagan including communism SIGN OF THE PAGAN is an intriguing historical document enlivened by Palance's colorful performance.".

The other British stalwart in this the equally excellent Vanessa Redgrave was another point of interest for me. There's a real brutal efficiency to this film that makes it unlikeable but also demands respect and our attention. Roth is the roving assassin who is forced to do his next job in his old neighbourhood and that means getting reacquainted with his family dying Mum Redgrave hateful and abusive Father Maximilian Spiel as well as impressionable younger brother Edward Furlong. 24 year old dbutant director James Gray comes up with  and scripts  a surprisingly mature piece of crime cinema that is both poignant moving and shocking.To my mind the violence should rate the film at 18 not 15 the cold blooded unfeeling of Roth's callous and unflinching jobs don't even give us time for any bad taste to form in our mouths. I can see that some would find this a barrier to their enjoyment in what is mostly a character driven drama of some depth. The winterset scenes of back street Brooklyn are chillingly authentic and bleak and these help remind us of the family's Russian roots. The father a devout Jew who's also having an affair often speaks Russian still hanging to his identity the best he can in an alienating changing and disintegrating world. There are also some tender moments between assassin son and braintumour suffering mother and of him lovemaking with his girlfriend who wants to try to understand him and his motives. His younger brother tries to keep his own feet on the ground whilst his sibling gradually but surely steals his innocence. Yes it is sad  and savage but strangely rewarding too.".

James Gray has directed with a sure hand exerting amazing control over a wide variety of performers and flawlessly maintaining a haunting and menacing mood in his tale of crime and punishment among Russian immigrants in Brooklyn. Vanessa Redgrave is superb as usual and Maxmillian Schell has been kept from the unrestrained emotionalism to which he is prone see JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG so that he gives one of his very best performances in years. As for Edward Furlong and Tim Roth both of whom can be very good or very bad lets just say they haven't been this good before or since. Gray's command over such aspects of the film as pacing and visual style is impressive. The whole thing builds to a stunning climax.".

	schema:headline " Another intense performance by Roth";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a review of Little Odessa The Yards and We Own the Night three crime dramas by director James Gray.Released in 1994 Little Odessa stars Tim Roth as Joshua Shapira a volatile criminal who has been exiled by his family. A prodigal son returns narrative the film watches as Roth returns to his family home. Though his relatives still distrust him Joshua is idolised by his younger brother little Reuben Shapira Edward Furlong. The film ends as most prodigal son tales do with Reuben dying paying for his brother's sins.Little Odessa was Gray's debut. It's a very good drama well acted by the always electric Tim Roth but the film's ethnic details are unconvincing and Gray falters in his final act with an obvious overblown sequence in which little Reuben is accidentally gunned down.Gray followed Odessa up with The Yards 2000 a crime drama set in the commuter rail yards of New York City. The film's structure is similar to Odessa and sees Mark Wahlberg playing an exconvict who returns home after a short stint in prison. Wahlberg attempts to stay clean to keep his nose out of crime but is drawn back into the criminal underworld by a friend played by Joaquin Phoenix. The film retains the brotherhood dynamics of Odessa Wahlberg playing the good son who eventually turns on his suffocating sibling. Once again the film ends with a ridiculously overthetop death sequence.While The Yards has a certain smothering pretentiousness about it convinced about its own importance it's lit like Rembrandt street fights are filmed like Visconti's Rocco and His Brothers and it's reaching for the tone of Coppola's The Godfather Gray nevertheless cooks up some wonderful strokes like a beautifully sensitive welcomehome party a wordless assassination attempt and a fine aching performance by Wahlberg. It's a great mixed bag.Gray then directed We Own The Night arguably his best crime flick. The good brotherbad brother motif returns this time with Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix playing a pair of brothers on either side of the law. Phoenix's a perpetually high playboy who owns a nightclub frequented by drugrunners and mafia types and Wahlberg's a straightarrow cop trying to keep the streets clean. When the mafia unleashes an assassination campaign on local cops Phoenix switches allegiances goes undercover and attempts to take down the mob. There are touches of Donnie Brasco Rush Point Break Serpico State of Grace Infernal Affairs and every other undercover cop movie you can think of but the film is beautifully lit is atypically straightfaced and features a superb rainsoaked car chase.Some have suggested that Gray's trilogy should be celebrated for working in a classical almost conventionally Greek mould. That his conventionality suggests that all his characters are at the mercy of already in place contours their fates forgone. Mostly though Gray's trilogy highlights the ways in which contemporary artists have struggled to conceive of a response to postmodernism. The crime movies of say Tarantino and Scorsese are unashamedly postmodern toying with and regurgitating clichs from 1930s Warner machine gun operas and MGM crime flicks. They aren't about crime so much as they're pastiche jobs jazzed up films about crime films. As a response to this aesthetic artists who deem themselves serious who rightfully ask what exactly comes next? tend to look backwards at what came before as though postwar modernism by virtue of being modernism is intrinsically the solution. This leads to classically shot and written but wholly regressive fare like Gray's trilogy which essentially unscrambles the world's Scorseses and Tarantinos and puts you right back in the 1940s minus the irony and flippancy.But you can't go backwards in this way your audience will always be ten steps ahead and there will always be a huge chasm between your solemnity and the tired insights your film delivers. This is why true progressive works in the genre for example fare like The Wire which actively attempts a cognitive mapping of both global capitalism and crime are neither modernist or postmodern whilst possessing the vital traits of both. Philosophers have alternatively coined this new movement neoprimitivism pseudomodernism participatism postpost modernism but the one that seems to be sticking is new modernism.Whatever you call it this hypothetical movement rejects postmodern nihilism nothing matters there is no truth it's just a film actively tries to convey the complexities of our world and covertly believes that it is possible and necessary for individuals to make value judgements take stands approach objectivity and back facts up. It is modernist in its desires to understand teach decipher and make better the world and in its emphasis on culture society technology and politics. The movement doesn't reject postmodernism but coopts its tropes and bends them to suit its aim questioning agency subjectivity and attempting to piece together the fragments and multiple perspectives that typify complex systems. In short truly relevant crime films simultaneously simulate our contemporary environment of junk noise commerce and static before proceeding to decode organise and target roots. As William Gibson said way back in the 1980s future great artist will function like search engines mapping and making sense of the detritus. Gray goes backwards to when there was less noise.7.910  Worth one viewing.".

A great watch for connoisseurs of films and mobster film in particular.The movie stands out for great acting directing and photography being James Gray directorial debut. Music is excellent as well. The actors are making this a great watch. The whole film is stuffed with fabulous acting. Tim Roth and Edward Furlong is both fabulous as the brothers as Vanessa Redgrave and Maximillian Schell is as the mother and the abusive father. I think this is some of the best I've seen from them all.The film starts up with the contract killer being the older brother Joshua Shapira coming back to his hometown of Brooklyn after being away for years to do a contract job. He fled town after committing a killing which obviously is not forgotten. He meets his younger brother Reuben which tells him that their mother is terminally ill with brain tumor. Joshua wants to see the mother but are not welcomed by the father being a danger to the whole family since wanted by the mobsters.It's bleak cold gritty effective and what I believe very realistic told. I was immediately sucked into the story which is following the younger brother more than the older hitman. it's no action movie but a mobster movie told in the way we've seen many times. This does not stand back from these. The film builds slowly up to great scenes.It's powerful on emotions far more than on the action. However the persons are quite cold and so is the violence. And there isn't much hope to see in the dreary days of this family.The quote We'll wait 10 seconds and see if God saves you is said by Tim Roth's character before he does a killing. I would regard this is a mustsee for mob film lovers and a classic in the genre.

If the character of the father is to be cited as a source of the sons' alienation it is altogether human to be frustrated and therefore quicktempered when your best efforts have so little to show for them.  The man has been worn down by life yet he cares for his elderly mother and terminally ill wife with as much tender love as he can muster.  An adulterer?  With his wife dying slowly of a brain tumor perhaps he deserves a kinder appellation.   The family is Jewish although that appears to be of no real significance in regard to the characters plot or atmosphere.  Likewise the story being set in Brooklyn.

In this film Tim Roth plays a hitman for the Russian Mob returning home to Little Odessa a primarily Russian Neighborhood in New York City but the main focus is on his younger brother Edward Furlong and the brothers' relationship to each other and their parents Vanessa Redgrave as the terminally ill mother and Maximilian Schell as the caring father. Although there is a crime story about the mafia going after Roth at it's core Little Odessa is a dark family melodrama. Much like The Lost City of Z writerdirector Gray creates rich characters with strong performances Moira Kelly is also quite good as Roth's girlfriend. Both films also similar present a terrific sense of place that's reminiscent of the works of Herzog or Wim Wenders where the setting and locations play almost as important a role in the film as the story and characters. An unfortunate similarity between the two films is a slow meandering pace. A major strike against Little Odessa is that I'm not quite sure of the film's subtext or central theme. There's likely something about family but whatever point Gray had in mind gets obscured by subplots and melodrama. Still despite the film's slow pace and lack of clear purpose it's visually arresting features strong performances and paints a vivid picture of what it's like to live and breath in Little Odessa. Deeply flawed but well worth watching.".

He is back in Brooklyn on business as well as to see his mother Vanessa Redgraveone last time. Reuben is a great fan of his brother much to their father's Maximillian Schell disliking. Both Roth and Furlong show little emotion throughout nor does Moira Kelly who plays Roth's clueless girlfriend.However I feel that the lack of emotion stems from the depressing over tones which are vital in portaying the overall feeling of the movie.".

Who else but the great Orson Welles could follow up a masterwork like CITIZEN KANE with such a cynical and important drama.  The magnificence of the Ambersons is neither grand nor respectable.  It is tragic and doomed epitomized by young Georgie played by Tim Holt whose main ambition in life is to be a yachtsmen.  He is buried under the lore of his family name and he is headed towards his welldeserved comeuppance.The film itself like many of Welles' great pictures was absolutely butchered by the studio RKO Pictures and destroyed the credibility of the young auteur.  In many ways the mess surrounding the film's release the tragedy and loss of the Ambersons and the theme of modern technology taking over all come together to leave all parties disappointed. Disapproving moviegoers miscalculated the message led the studio to make the cuts behind Welles' back and placed a lot of artists in some bad situations. For an excellent account of this truly remarkable story behind the film read Joseph McBride's bio Orson Welles  50 minutes of film were burned however the 88 minutes left for us to see contain some incredible even revolutionary moments.Joseph Cotten plays his consummate 2nd place character a man unable to have his real true love. See THE THIRD MAN NIAGARA  He is in love with an Amberson probably the only righteous family member played by Dolores Costello but loses out to a more respectable man.  The essential themes of industrialism and change that will ruin the Amberson family stem from Cotten's position as an inventor.  He has created the horseless carriage or automobile however primitive which is continuously trashed by the hateful Georgie.  Cotten's invention is part of the growth and change that many families of the late 19th century may have ignored only to have their lives passed over and fortunes lost.  Plot elements aside this central theme is the powerful backbone that leads to the inevitable destruction of the narrowminded Tim Holt.The latter aspects come across on screen so memorably because of Orson Welles' continued experimentation with film.  Incredible b  w photography at first a hazy glow depicting the early prime years of the Ambersons then a stark dark force portraying shame and sadness is amazing to see. Overlapping dialogue is used even better here than in KANE and Welles' narration is so omniscient and on the mark relaying the town's thoughts on this once grand family.  Long tracking shots throughout the constantly changing town go unnoticed unless seen a couple of times.  When you realize the passage of time through these devices you will be in awe.Again there is tragedy in both the film itself and its shoddy release and treatment in 1942.  If only Welles stayed in America at the time and protected THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS from the long arm of the nearsighted studio system he may have had 's 1 and 2 on the AFI's list of 100 Greatest American films.".

One can only admire the fragments...and what gorgeous fragments they are Major Ambersons heartbreaking meditation by the fireplacethe quarrel between Eugene Morgan and Georgie about the Automobile Isabel's death  Agnes Moorehead's magnificent performance the splendor of the Amberson mansion and the ballroom scene. Perhaps someday some powerful computer might be able to reconstruct the missing footage from stills and from Welles script...perhaps. Until that almost impossible moment one can only envy the handful of men and women who were able to see it whole and to understand what they were seeing.";

	schema:reviewBody "As most reviewers have stated Welles' film suffered at the hands of studio interference and it is to the film's credit that despite such butchery it still remains a marvellous piece of entertainment.The emotional story revolves around family relationships about love denied unrequited or made to suffer.  It is also a social portrait of the failure of one family to come to terms with progress symbolised by the motor car in the film.Tim Holt is excellent as George Minafer and I think we are meant to view him ambivalently he is both a loveable ne'er do well as well as a spoiled egotist who puts his emotionsfeelings before everyone else's.  Agnes Moorehead deservedly won praise for her portrait of the plain Aunt Fanny. Her final disintegration blackly comic when George thinks she's scalding herself at a hot boiler only to be told that there's no water due to their reduced circumstances mirrors the descent of the Ambersons into obscurity and genteel poverty.  The only memory of their faded glory is in the names they give to the new roads leading to the suburbs.As with Citizen Kane' wealth does not always protect people from unhappiness. And it's interesting to note how the Amberson's huge mansion once the social centre of town with its balls  serenades becomes an empty derelict monument to a bygone age.  In a sense the whole film is ambivalent. You can't stop progress as Eugene Joseph Cotton states in the dramatic scene where he  George clash over motor cars but Gene is also aware that things might not necessarily change for the better.  Life will become faster etc.  After George receives his comeuppance I quite liked the  symbolic irony of him falling victim to a car accident.  Finally it would be nice if production companies could have the courage of their convictions and actually left capable intelligent directors to make films without interfering with their vision.  Prod companies are still obsessed with preview viewings and initial reactions to films.  Yes sometimes a film might need altering and most studios want a decent return on their investment but it would be good if they could keep faith even if a film receives an initially hostile reaction.  Many great works of art have been initially misunderstood and great films like great art stand the test of time.".

In spite of what one sees on the screen even a chopped up film by the studio and directed by Orson Welles is better than no Orson Welles at all!Booth Tarkington wrote a novel that reflected America's entrance in the industrial age. Mr. Tarkington being a good friend of Mr. Welles' father must have been an early influence in young Orson. We can see that in a way both men were interested in the changes America went through in the XIX century.The Magnificent Ambersons presents the saga of a prominent family in their spiral downfall. At the same time Eugene Morgan a revolutionary inventor is laughed at because of the contraption that will change the face of the country the automobile. While the Ambersons lose their fortune Eugene Morgan makes his own. In the end it is sad to see how Morgan with all his money couldn't have Isabel the love of his life or his daughter for that matter couldn't make the snobbish Georgie care enough for her.What Orson Welles can't be fault on is the impeccable performances he got out of most of the Mercury Group. Joseph Cotten as always projects an elegant figure as Eugene. The gorgeous Dolores Costello is seen in all her beauty. The young Anne Baxter was perfect as Lucy. Ray Collins and Richard Bennett also do an outstanding job as well as young Tim Holt. The best of all is Agnes Moorehead who makes Fanny a creation. Ms. Moorehead is in fact a luminous presence in all her scenes in the movie.Robert Wise who went to become a film director is credited with the original editing although two others were not credited who could have been instrumental in what RKO did to the picture Mark Robson and Jack Moss. The original costumes by Edward Stevenson are incredible.One could only hope that somewhere hidden in a vault a director's copy will be found as Orson Welles directed it and then hopefully we shall see the marvelous movie Orson Welles intended to make.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's almost common knowledge in the realm of the film world about the history of the Magnificent Ambersons which leaves a minor problem when trying to criticize it. Orson Welles made the film's final running length at around two hours and fifteen minutes. While he was out of the country filming 'It's All True!' another doomed film in the Welles cannon RKO pictures the studio that had granted Welles total freedom for Citizen Kane and a few future projects cut out fifty minutes mostly of the last fifty put a happy ending and released it on a doublebill with a B movie. Although it's attributable in retrospect to the War starting up after all who wants a downer period piece and to the difficulty the studio had with Welles' reputation the fact that the 90 minute version that now exists is the only version available is a tragedy in and of itself. Unless if someone follows the wild rumor that a print was dumped by the studios into the ocean and pulls it up this is all we can get.Still incomplete Welles is more satisfying than no Welles or most other studio product of the period. Welles takes Booth Tarkington's novel inspired in part by Welles himself as a child George being Welles' name and makes it into a sumptuous striking and altogether unique drama of the changing of the times and how people cope with changes or go with them. The story is one of those involving the minds and hearts of the upper class. Joseph Cotten as usual charming or cool dramatic is Eugene the man who wanted Isabel Amberson's hand in marriage. She married another man and their child George was early on a hardhead case these scenes are some of the best of the film with deliberate staging of closeups medium shots and basically setting up the technical style of the Wellesian cinema. As he grows up he's still a little hardheaded played in one of the top intense performances in any Welles film by Tim Holt as he is against the changing of the times in particular of Eugene's refounded courtship of the mother following his father's death. There is also the character of his Aunt Fanny in another perfect performance from Agnes Moorhead the mother from Citizen Kane.Alongside this examination of a family's downfall amid the changing of personal relations and of George's own complex emotional problems and of George's comingofage there's also the examination of the transition from the horse and buggy to automobiles to the heavier boost of the industrial age. Welles as a narrator is somber observant of it all and mostly leaves the film to his actors. There's some real thought put into the issues and not just through the realistic though of course theatrical dialog but more specifically through the style. 'Kane' introduced audiences to Welles knack at longtakes deep focus unusual and expressionistic closeups heightening the drama that unfolds. 'Ambersons' is no exception and there are some very memorable scenes where the camera just stays on people and then when it moves it makes the mis en scene more concentrated direct. The use of light is also equally impressive at times like in interior shots of a staircase when George and Fanny are in an argument it's all encompassing and not distracting enough from the story. The best consistency of any Welles film even when it has some flaws is the control that can be seen through much of it there's also a very spooky shot that stays with me towards the end as the camera pans across the town's buildings Welles' mournful narration over it.But then we come to the ending where things come to a screeching halt. I'm not against happy endings they can be almost mandatory in certain formulas in films. However it sort of takes an excellent film dealing with strong novelistic issues to a bad place when things are resolved in the way this film does George gets in an accident he loses the use of his legs. But then a scene comes and one can tell the immediate change in the style from Welles to the studio's where loose ends get made and without anything leaving curious for the viewer. I'm still not sure if anything else within the film was cutout too or if even I might have been fooled at another time by something not of Welles in the picture. It's depressing to be sure but at least there is enough left to analyze and contemplate in the Welles' oeuvre in some ways it goes more ambitious than 'Kane' at least in its period realm the questions it raises. The lessons the history behind the scenes gives for future filmmakers and studios should be remembered even as mediocrity like RKO tried its best to make this film as continues today in Hollywood.".

Joseph Cotten gives an irregular performance as the romantic lead silent star Dolores Costello is very much underused as is then very young Anne Baxter who would could onto bigger stardom in the next decade. Stealing the acting honors throughout the production are Tim Holt with his superb portrayal of the spoiled brat heirtothethrone so to speak and Agnes Moorehead as his Auntie who put their plan into action to sabotage a relationship between the widowed Isbabelle Amberson and charmer Eugene Morgan.Overall lives up to it's expectations of success but suffers due to limited screen time and a very confusing plot for audiences of our generation.710".

	schema:reviewBody "Another reviewer used the fuller quote ...Loose Quicksilver in a Nest of Cracks... as the heading of his review and I agree with most of what the other 10star reviews say so I'll be brief and not repetitious. First of all I'd like to point out that the quote mentions quicksilver which of course is Mercury. The Mercury Players are the stars of this film and Citizen Kane  coincidence?There are at least 2 books that deal with the relative merits of film adaptations of novels  which is better the novel or the film? Both of these books that I read seem to think that the film of Magnificent Ambersons is better than Tarkington's novel. I read the novel  it is not written in a wordy oldfashioned style typical of novels of its day 1918  it's a good read by today's standards  even a great read  I'd say that the novel and the film are coequals in terms of artistic excellence. Factory soot and general air pollution is a prominent theme in the novel as in 2 other novels by Booth Tarkington he collected the 3 novels together in one volume under the collective title Growth. Tarkington was also concerned about what we today call urban sprawl.In both the film and novel the name of Georgie's horse is mentioned several times  Pendennis  the title character of a 1850 novel by William Makepeace Thackery who also wrote Vanity Fair  Pendennis is a novel about snobbery and surely Georgie is also a snob. For what it's worth in my opinion Tim Holt's portrayal of Georgie is just fine. And isn't it ironic that Tim Holt son of cowboy actor Jack Holt returned to the family business of BWesterns along with his sister Jennifer after he turned in good performances in 2 of the greatest films ever made his other major role was in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre  he also had a minor role in Stagecoach?Read the novel if you want a full explanation of how the Amberson family lost its fortune. Also the film mentions that Aunt Fanny lost her money by investing in a headlight company  the novel makes clear that this company is NOT connected with Eugene's automobile company. Finally as another reviewer pointed out the nonWellesian tackedon studio ending for the film though abrupt is fairly faithful to the novel. I too wish I could see the 53 or 55 or 58 minutes of Welles's footage discarded by the studio but I am not prepared to heap abuse or ridicule on the studio ending.When AE cable network commissioned a remake of Welles's film it's too bad the expanded 150minute running time was not better used to clarify the plot. The same thing happened when TV produced a miniseries remake of The Long Hot Summer loosely based on Faulkner's Snopes Trilogy especially the first novel The Hamlet  instead of restoring some of what's in the novels the TV writers were asked to confine themselves to expanding the original screenplay. Another lost opportunity.".

	schema:headline " Loose Quicksilver In A Nest Of Cracks";
	schema:reviewBody "In a Mid Western town at the turn of the century an ostentatious family lives in an ostentatious house and arrogantly considers itself superior to all the other folks.  Isabelle Amberson is the doyenne of the family and is courted by Eugene Morgan a bright young engineer.  Isabelle rejects Eugene because of an imagined slight and marries the worthy if unspectacular Wilbur Minafer.  This sets in train a tragedy of unrequited love as Eugene continues over the years to yearn for Isabelle while Isabelle's plain sister Fanny carries a secret flame for Eugene.  Isabelle's imperious son George grows up and thwarted in his own love for Lucy Morgan develops an intense antipathy towards Eugene the everpresent guest at the Ambersons' dinner table.Welles' affection for the Booth Tarkington novel which inspired this masterpiece is easy to understand.  It is set in the snowbound countryside of the northern Mid West the very place where Welles was born and raised and the Ambersons are just the kind of upper middle class family from which Welles sprang.  More than this George Minafer IS Welles.  Spoiled and deferred to as a child George grows up knowing no bounds to his whimsy. The monster that he becomes is oddly attractive partly because of his utter selfbelief.  Welles himself was such a man.  He must surely have contemplated casting himself as George Tim Holt who actually appears in the role resembles Welles uncannily with his pudgy good looks and resonant baritone speaking voice.  Welles had an inordinate fondness for strawberry shortcake and so does George.The sombre brooding atmosphere of the film is reinforced by its symbolic scheme.  It is a film of departures and sunderings with characters forever disappearing on long vacations dying or merely vanishing behind closing doors as when Fanny scurries away devastated by the courtship joke.As with Citizen Kane in the previous year the film's stylistic approach is to show groups of interlocutors as ensembles without the camera moving in on the individual speaker.  Some of the faces remain in shadow or are otherwise obscured.  The viewer works out from the context whose words he is hearing.  In Kane the device helped to show the manyfaceted nature of a human life.  Here it underscores the centrality of the family.  Each of the Ambersons is subordinate to the family itself and the family is the continuum the amber in which these characters are trapped.  Another of the Kane themes is developed here  that wealth and status cannot protect anyone against unhappiness.  Welles' fascination with mirror images indulged here in the brief bathroom scene was to emerge again in The Lady From Shanghai.George Minafer and his grand gloomy and peculiar way is at the heart of this film.  He clashes unpleasantly with Eugene for two important reasons  George the classic 'mommy's boy' sees Isabelle's lover as a rival and Eugene is despicable because he is 'in trade'  and therefore far too vulgar a man to be lounging around the Amberson drawingroom.  George's excuse for the confrontation is his ostensible desire to protect his mother from scandal but this convinces nobody.  In the climactic scene where George refuses Eugene admission to the house we see George first through etched glass emphasising his emotional aloofness and his essentially defensive posture.  Mrs. Johnson addresses George as Mr. Amberson then corrects herself and gives him his actual title Mr. Minafer.  The error is significant because George is the archetypal Amberson  sneering haughty and strangely dissatisfied with life.  In the scene where George and Lucy sever their connection George protests indignantly that the emotional stress is going to make him faint.  He doesn't collapse but Lucy does. This is typical of George  he is quick to make his own selfish position clear but does not in fact share the emotional vulnerability of the rest of humanity.  His arrogance seals him off.  Lucy's discourse on indian names throws up 'Ven Do Nah' the legendary hero whose name means 'Rides Down Everything'.  It is of course a veiled allusion to George.  Perhaps 'They Couldn't Help It' is a reference to the decline of the Ambersons.After the death of Wilbur and a seemly period of mourning Eugene tries again to court Isabelle.  In this saga of lost love Eugene's suffering is the most acute.  When he writes to Isabelle after the rift with George he pleads with her most touchingly not to strike my life down twice.  Eugene's forbearance and dignity are everpresent.  Joseph Cotten plays him as a man who endures his misery with stoicism.  His speech at the dinner table on the dubious benefits of the automobile is powerful generous  and a classic Welles creation.It is Lucy's fate to repeat her father's tragedy growing old in the absence of love.  Ann Baxter is charming as Lucy and the ageing process is convincingly depicted.  Her forced levity in the scene where George breaks with her is very moving.Welles' record is unique two years two films two masterpieces.".

	schema:reviewBody "With an excellent cast interesting characters and setting and a thoughtprovoking story dramatic cinema does not get much better than The Magnificent Ambersons.  No one will ever know what it would have been like if Orson Welles' original version had been allowed to stand as it was but what is left is still extremely good despite the missing portions.The story of the leading residents in a turnofthecentury town combines some interesting themes.  The snobbishness of the Ambersons and its effects on their lives and others' lives is illustrated alongside the ways that increasing industrialization is changing everyone's lives.  The period setting is also quite interesting in its own right and very nicely done. The characters are all convincing and welldefined and are matched nicely with fine performers who bring them to life convincingly.  Welles regulars Joseph Cotten and Agnes Moorehead are especially good.The only real disappointment in the movie is that due to all the cuts made against Welles' wishes there are times when it is obvious that a scene or information is missing since characters at times refer to events that are not quite familiar to the audience.  It is fortunate that the acting and writing are good enough to help us fill in the blanks to some degree but it is really too bad that we can never see the whole picture.As it stands this is a fine film filled with good scenes and memorable characters and a movie that will be much appreciated by fans of classic cinema.".

	schema:headline " The Ambersons Effect";
	schema:reviewBody "This is where Welles came apart and is mirrored in the actual lopsided film itself. I remarked in my first viewing that the film attains a unique eerie quality exactly because so much of it is missing. Heresy! More on that in a little while.This was an important time for Welles. The debacle is well documented elsewhere but a few words for my benefit. He was in Brazil when it happened doing It's All True and women. For the past few months Welles had been juggling three projects at once. Filming Ambersons by day indirectly shaping Journey to Fear by night originally intended for him to direct and preparing to embark on the Brazilian adventure for the government at the behest of Rockefeller. A composite print including music was finalized on the run in the Miami studio where Popeye cartoons were made. The voiceover was recorded overnight by Welles exhausted from a Washington trip. A few days later he was on a boat to Rio.So it was all or nothing. It was nothing. A butchered Ambersons was dumped in a few LA theaters and forgotten. Journey was similarly botched. It's All True was abandoned. He was effectively fired from his job. Hollywood would have nothing to do with him still bitter over the Kane contract and the man's ambitions. It was revelling time as the privileged youth was getting his comeuppance.Now the film was conceived on the scope and innovation of Kane but that version  132m  is already myth. A print of that version probably the Miami print was sent down to Welles in Rio for revisions. Did Gonzaga of Rio's Cineda company where Welles was working on It's All True destroy that print as per the imperative of RKO's New York office? There is at least one report from Cineda that the cans of film were still in existence by the mid50's.For the foreseeable future we have this. A curious thing happens here that I believe opened portals for narrative. That wasn't going to take off until fresh eyes saw reruns of the film in the 1960's TV. Welles himself wasn't going to see the film again until that time.At the time it was bleakly received. Too bleak for wartime. A few flaws persist to this day Tim Holt is an onedimensional whine Aunt Fanny's scenes are hysterical the reshot finale is atrocious.A handful of people perhaps recognized what it was all about it was Kane with a big qualitative difference. It was also about childhood loss but more somber less precocious. It was every bit as autobiographical as Kane but this Kane never tried to shape the world to his image. It was about time and beautiful things vanishing thought to be beautiful when they were young. It was about dual worlds at crossroads.The famous story goes that Welles was in Bogdanovich's LA home one night when the film came up on TV it must have been the early 70's so when Welles was puzzling about a modern narrative in film. We've yet to see his response which I presume is tucked inside The Other Side until then we have F For Fake. That film was about an aging filmmaker reminiscing about a life in movies that much we know. So the film comes up and this aging filmmaker immediately flicked the channel. His company insisted they sit down and watch the film. Welles left the room in a huff but a little while later came back and quietly sat down and they did watch. According to Bogdanovich Oja Koddar nodded to him that Orson was crying.It was not the brutal treatment of the film at the hands of philistines relates Henry Jaglom from a later chat with Welles that just made him mad. The tears were for bygone times.The film was at the heart of it a grown man's lament about a world that came apart before he could hold onto any part of it a world that Welles intimately knew and cherished from his own childhood and probably correctly assumed was written by Tarkington around him and his mother. It's about a story that collapses around the protagonist. Now it's safe to presume that Welles' version would have fleshed everything a bit more sketched transitions a little clearer. Fractured memory but with a clear design like he had done in Kane. Enter RKO. In most eyes the last third that is the most clearly botched part of the film is hideous. I see a more peculiar effect at work instead of the collapse given to us in ordinary terms with a dramatic weave the actual film is falling apart before our eyes. It's shattering left and right. The solid floor of the story is suddenly concave. Anchors that made the world coherent are pulled out and in rapid succession. This is the most clear in just two scenes Major Ambersons monologue before the fireplace and cut to the mother's death as a single hallucinatory flow of the camera.It feels choppy as you watch it because it was not intended and you can clearly tell parts are missing. But the notion has tremendous power.It involves narrative structure on the backend of us splicing it together. The film empties of images as the man does. We know there is more to it  finer shades  but just can't know can't remember a thing beyond impressions beyond snippets of memory.Welles at the time was a dramatist blessed with a keen visual eye putting cinematic 2 and 2 together using storyspace. This is something altogether different. It's subtraction from reasonable causality that we assume works in life but most of the time doesn't so that mostly space remains floating with the essence of broken bits.".

His company insisted they sit down and watch the film. Welles left the room in a huff but a little while later came back and quietly sat down and they did watch. According to Bogdanovich Oja Koddar nodded to him that Orson was crying.It was not the brutal treatment of the film at the hands of philistines relates Henry Jaglom from a later chat with Welles that just made him mad. The tears were for bygone times.The film was at the heart of it a grown man's lament about a world that came apart before he could hold onto any part of it a world that Welles intimately knew and cherished from his own childhood and probably correctly assumed was written by Tarkington around him and his mother. It's about a story that collapses around the protagonist. Now it's safe to presume that Welles' version would have fleshed everything a bit more sketched transitions a little clearer. Fractured memory but with a clear design like he had done in Kane. Enter RKO. In most eyes the last third that is the most clearly botched part of the film is hideous. I see a more peculiar effect at work instead of the collapse given to us in ordinary terms with a dramatic weave the actual film is falling apart before our eyes. It's shattering left and right. The solid floor of the story is suddenly concave. Anchors that made the world coherent are pulled out and in rapid succession. This is the most clear in just two scenes Major Ambersons monologue before the fireplace and cut to the mother's death as a single hallucinatory flow of the camera.It feels choppy as you watch it because it was not intended and you can clearly tell parts are missing. But the notion has tremendous power.It involves narrative structure on the backend of us splicing it together. The film empties of images as the man does. We know there is more to it  finer shades  but just can't know can't remember a thing beyond impressions beyond snippets of memory.Welles at the time was a dramatist blessed with a keen visual eye putting cinematic 2 and 2 together using storyspace. This is something altogether different. It's subtraction from reasonable causality that we assume works in life but most of the time doesn't so that mostly space remains floating with the essence of broken bits.";

By watching it I'm both stunned and sad at the same time thinking about what this movie could have been if it hadn't been taken out of Welles' hands. Recutting and reshooting this film is probably the greatest mistake a studio has ever done. The remaining pieces  88min. out of approx 145min. still has a great punch to them. Welles' clever camerasetups and powerful direction matches his previous film Kane in every way. The conflict within the family are explored by great dialog and acting by it's cast.

	schema:reviewBody "I wanted to love it as a classic but for me 'The Magnificent Ambersons' fell well short of that. There are certainly positive aspects Director Orson Welles was an artist and there are several beautiful shots camera angles and tracking sequences that are nice to see. Joseph Cotten is full of grace as an automobile inventor who loves an Amberson widow but has to contend with her hothead son Tim Holt who is as spoiled as they come. The scene where he calmly and rationally responds to an attack on cars is good. It's ironic that Holt's character loves Cotten's daughter in turn and Anne Baxter plays that part well including a scene where she feigns indifference to his leaving town and toys with him even though it's killing her inside. Lastly Agnes Moorehead turns in probably the best performance in the film as the boy's frustrated aunt.On the other hand the main character  the spoiled entitled son  is so unlikeable that it makes watching often unpleasant. The film feels emotionally sterile and there is little believability in the connections between characters. There is a dark bleakness that pervades the film in part because of the story of this family's fall from grace while the world changes around them but also in part because of Welles' heavyhanded treatment. The plot is arguably not very plausible in several places and is certainly tedious in the second half of the film. The studio's taking control and editing the final cut  butchering it it sounds like  is a travesty that sort of thing always is but even at 88 minutes the film seems to drag on too long and in what seems like a smug theatrical way. I'm not convinced that if I was subjected to 60 more minutes Welles' original cut that I wouldn't have fallen asleep based on the 88 that I did see. It was OK to see once but I would never recommend it or watch it again.".

This spoilt brat was I'm sure very similar to Wells or so he'd have us believe.Obivously we all know what happened to the final cut.

Its the worst tackedon ending I've ever seen.  Eugene was never in love with Fanny it was always Isabele but Fanny loved Eugene.  Hollywood made a joke of it.  The Amberson family had finally got their comeuppance only for hollywood to decide it was too grim and put on an ending that looked like ot came from another movie.Initally it was such a piece of genius from Wells to film a story about the downfall of a family rather than their or rise to power to tell the story in reverse.Its so sad that we can never see the real version.

And the understanding of them is probably more important than experiencing a coherent survey as this was.He's interested in surrounding a narrative in giving it to us from all sides. He does this in narrative styles. In Kane he had narrators inside and outside the story newsreels newspapers mysterious unfoldings anticipated long events and anticipated short ones.He does it in the eye as well having the camera surround and probe. And he plays these two off of each other creating one sort of rhythm in the eye another in the shifts of narrative yet more in the physical movements on screen and finally in the emotional tides. Each of these is innovative but together they become metacharacters in a sort of cinematic jazz. Oddly the metaphor doesn't include the score itself for Welles the one thing that has become a common skill today.Now if we had the whole project we'd get all the variations and pace in his jazz composition. As it is now all we get are phrases some broken a bit. Just settle on one that you suppose hasn't been tampered with say the sleighcar encounter in the snow and revel in that for a few viewings one after the other. It is absolutely amazing what interplay these elements have. And in this case we really do have some music the players singing.I suggest you play it again and again until you get it. Believe me it will change your life when you can see this mind dance.I would rather have the pieces because they have such a perfect logic and dance you can imagine the rest. It baffles me that some people think Welles just innovated in camera angles and lighting. No he created a whole higher level of drama.Van Gogh painted a starry sky. It is in effect two paintings in one. We have the beauty of the sky. And we have the beauty of the dabs and strokes of paint on the canvas a sort of metapainting. The two dance around each other in a way that is magical. Welles did the same here and in Kane. Afterward he busted other walls.Oh and within the story he uses automobiles as a metaphor to muse on the effect of this new metadrama compared to his home in the simpler theater. He wonders if we will be better off once what he does catches on.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:headline " This is a story told on two levels";
	schema:reviewBody "On the most superficial level it is simply a story of living a life of regret caused by one woman's Delores Costello as Isabel Amberson inability to forgive a breach of etiquette by the guy she really loved Joseph Cotten as Eugene Morgan  one night he serenaded her while drunk and made a comical spectacle of himself. Out of spite she marries milquetoast Wilbur Minafer whom she does not love and as predicted by one of the town gossips raises an insufferable spoiled rotten child  George Minafer. The reason he is spoiled? Because Isabel can't love Wilbur so she pours her love into her only child.On a deeper level it is about the changing times from the 19th to the 20th century and how that affects a small town in middle America. The Ambersons go from being a very prominent family to being displaced by the changing times and changing culture.The Amberson family serves as a metaphor for old money and old society the closest thing America has to royalty. Major Amberson the patriarch of the Amberson clan made the family fortune as a land developer and apparently as the founding father of the town. Eugene Morgan represents new money his family is from the working class his power and wealth comes not from old family connections but through financial dealings and modern manufacturing e.g. the automobile. Eugene looks toward the future sees the changes in society and seizes the opportunities presented. The Ambersons are just happy to keep things as they are they don't want to look at all of these newfangled changes in society because if they did THEY'D have to change. Because Georgie Amberson Minafer the spoiled and arrogant grandson absolutely refuses to accept any change whatsoever he descends from the Midwestern aristocracy to the working class. He also takes away his mother's second chance at happiness at midlife when the widowed Eugene and the widow Isabel want to marry. Isabel could have acted against her grown son's demands but again she was unable to change. She had let Georgie have his way his whole life and now she would let him swallow her life too. I'm not quite sure why someone as young as Georgie is so rigid and conventional. It may be because change requires work and thought  two qualities that young Georgie definitely shys away from. His arrogance and his sense of entitlement are why so many of the townspeople and so many viewers cannot wait for him to get his comeuppance. Unfortunately for all of us by the time he does it only registers perhaps on him.Something had happened. A thing which years ago had been the most eager hope of many many good citizens of the town and now it had come at last George Amberson Minafer had got his comeuppance. He got it three times filled and running over. But those who had so longed for it were not there to see it and they never knew it. Those who were still living had forgotten all about it and all about him. Well if you watch the film which gives you a voyeur's view of a story you really see none of this comeuppance none of George's transformation which is talked about in the final scene that has Eugene and Aunt Fanny talking about it but no George! Well there is a reason for this. Orson Welles was in South America when RKO was editing this film. They cut 40 minutes of what Welles had shot and tacked on the Georgeless ending. Why? They claimed it was because test audiences were repulsed by Aunt Fanny! The great Agnes Morehead is playing Fanny as your typical maiden aunt character frustrated because the man she always loved never even noticed her but she plays the part with great humanity so that has to be a bogus excuse. I'll always believe it was because Welles challenged the status quo of the business elite in Citizen Kane and was doing it once again in this film a year later even though it was adapted from a novel. Perhaps with a war just starting and the production code nipping at their heels RKO just didn't want to seem antiestablishment and by extension antiAmerican.I'd still recommend it. It is well acted well directed and has some great individual scenes even in its skewered state. At the very least it is a well told great romantic tragedy for all of the main characters.".

	onyx:emotionText "On the most superficial level it is simply a story of living a life of regret caused by one woman's Delores Costello as Isabel Amberson inability to forgive a breach of etiquette by the guy she really loved Joseph Cotten as Eugene Morgan  one night he serenaded her while drunk and made a comical spectacle of himself. Out of spite she marries milquetoast Wilbur Minafer whom she does not love and as predicted by one of the town gossips raises an insufferable spoiled rotten child  George Minafer. The reason he is spoiled? Because Isabel can't love Wilbur so she pours her love into her only child.On a deeper level it is about the changing times from the 19th to the 20th century and how that affects a small town in middle America. The Ambersons go from being a very prominent family to being displaced by the changing times and changing culture.The Amberson family serves as a metaphor for old money and old society the closest thing America has to royalty. Major Amberson the patriarch of the Amberson clan made the family fortune as a land developer and apparently as the founding father of the town. Eugene Morgan represents new money his family is from the working class his power and wealth comes not from old family connections but through financial dealings and modern manufacturing e.g. the automobile. Eugene looks toward the future sees the changes in society and seizes the opportunities presented. The Ambersons are just happy to keep things as they are they don't want to look at all of these newfangled changes in society because if they did THEY'D have to change. Because Georgie Amberson Minafer the spoiled and arrogant grandson absolutely refuses to accept any change whatsoever he descends from the Midwestern aristocracy to the working class. He also takes away his mother's second chance at happiness at midlife when the widowed Eugene and the widow Isabel want to marry. Isabel could have acted against her grown son's demands but again she was unable to change. She had let Georgie have his way his whole life and now she would let him swallow her life too. I'm not quite sure why someone as young as Georgie is so rigid and conventional. It may be because change requires work and thought  two qualities that young Georgie definitely shys away from. His arrogance and his sense of entitlement are why so many of the townspeople and so many viewers cannot wait for him to get his comeuppance. Unfortunately for all of us by the time he does it only registers perhaps on him.Something had happened. A thing which years ago had been the most eager hope of many many good citizens of the town and now it had come at last George Amberson Minafer had got his comeuppance. He got it three times filled and running over. But those who had so longed for it were not there to see it and they never knew it. Those who were still living had forgotten all about it and all about him. Well if you watch the film which gives you a voyeur's view of a story you really see none of this comeuppance none of George's transformation which is talked about in the final scene that has Eugene and Aunt Fanny talking about it but no George! Well there is a reason for this. Orson Welles was in South America when RKO was editing this film. They cut 40 minutes of what Welles had shot and tacked on the Georgeless ending. Why? They claimed it was because test audiences were repulsed by Aunt Fanny! The great Agnes Morehead is playing Fanny as your typical maiden aunt character frustrated because the man she always loved never even noticed her but she plays the part with great humanity so that has to be a bogus excuse. I'll always believe it was because Welles challenged the status quo of the business elite in Citizen Kane and was doing it once again in this film a year later even though it was adapted from a novel. Perhaps with a war just starting and the production code nipping at their heels RKO just didn't want to seem antiestablishment and by extension antiAmerican.I'd still recommend it. It is well acted well directed and has some great individual scenes even in its skewered state. At the very least it is a well told great romantic tragedy for all of the main characters.";

	schema:reviewBody "Orson Welles' second attempt at making a feature is probably known more for its having been butchered and drastically altered in Welles' absence than it is for the actual quality and content of what remains. Welles himself said that had it survived intact The Magnificent Ambersons would have been better even than his acknowledged masterpiece Citizen Kane. We'll probably never really know but looking at what we have been left he may have been right.Like Citizen Kane Magnificent Ambersons mixes drama with an informative historical almost documentary style. Once again he contrasts the quick cuts and tothepoint imagery of a documentary with the long takes appropriate to drama. This approach is ideal for this kind of story of individuals within the context of historical fact and although the content is totally different it's not unlike the way in which Martin Scorsese would construct films like Raging Bull and Goodfellas decades later.The opening sequence of Magnificent Ambersons in which Welles narrates the changing fashions of the 1870s and Eugene's courtship of Isabelle is this film's equivalent of the News on The March sequence from Citizen Kane. Here however many of the similarities with the earlier film end. Ambersons is overall a much more relaxed piece compared to Kane. Welles relies less on rather obvious cinematic techniques and more on subtleties of staging shot composition and lighting. He really handles the mood and tone brilliantly here with a fuzzy rosetinted view of the past and an encroaching feel of disturbing darkness as his characters' worlds begin to fall apart. Of course he was doing something similar in Citizen Kane but here it's much more polished and effective.Although Welles himself does not appear in Ambersons although he does a narrative voiceover the acting is on the whole a notch above Citizen Kane. Joseph Cotton and Agnes Moorehead in particular really get to shine here giving standout performances they never quite achieved in Kane where everyone else was dwarfed by Welles' gargantuan performance. Welles as a director here also shows off his actors' abilities with the way he focuses on them in some incredibly long takes letting the drama unfold naturally.However for all the excellence of its individual elements I have to judge Magnificent Ambersons on what it is as a whole today. The fact there is an hour of missing footage is painfully obvious. The drama lacks depth due to the overall story being pared down to its barest bones. You can tell an effective thriller or horror in an 85 minute film but you can't do the same with an epic. Ambersons clearly has the same qualities of epic dramas like Gone with the Wind or Giant but truncated as it is we get neither the sympathy for the characters or a real sense of the passage of time that we need. At least it's possible to ignore the travesty that is the studioapproved happy ending but the same is not true of the glaring gaps in the story arc.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story of the destruction of Orson Welles' second Mercury film THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS is pretty well described in these remarks on this thread. Although it is extremely doubtful as doubtful as ever finding traces of the missing holy grail I too wish that a longer version that was similar to Welles' vision did turn up. But if it did I wonder if we would end up siding with the powers that be at RKO or with Welles.About three or four years back a television version of THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS was made on cable television which contained far more of the novel than the deconstructed Welles' film currently does. The critics were not too happy with it. They found it too long and they seemed to stress the need for cutting it to a shorter length. My guess is that Welles would have had to cut the film too though not as much as only 88 or so minutes. KANE had been 119 minutes long only one scene  in a brothel  was cut. That was a pretty long film for 1941. My guess is that a 120 odd minute AMBERSONS would have been too long too.But of course Welles would have been in a position to judge what cuts would not destroy the film and what cuts would. He did not like the cuts that reduced the Ambersons ball sequence a seemingly meaningless passage about olives. Was that really such an important passage? More important is how the role of Wilbur Minafer was reduced as were passages concerning poor investment recommendations to Wilbur Fanny and Jack were cut one would have thought they were important.Was it done as part of a plan to make the movie salvageable or to destroy Welles' bankability in Hollywood? One suspects the latter. KANE made a small profit but was no blockbuster. The powers that be in Hollywood saw Welles as a threat to their system of control as his style of contract made him both director and producer. It was not just the attack on Hearst in the first film but a general assault on the studio system that brought the Hollywood honchos down on Welles' head.It is interesting to note the degree of defensiveness that has crept up in the years since Welles' death in 1985 regarding the fate of his various projects in Hollywood. Robert Wise who edited AMBERSONS came out with a statement that he did not think the present film was so terrible as it is considered a classic. Wise was assigned to finish the film with new scenes he and others directed and to cut the Welles' material. It was in Wise's interest to deflect any negative views about the butchering of the film for the sake of his own reputation and it is interesting that in the years after he made that comment Wise was given an Oscar for his life's contributions to movies  he gave some good ones but he helped to destroy one great one.I think that if AMBERSONS had been a comedy Welles would not have had the same problem. Instead it was a bitter tragedy for Welles did not end the film version he shot with George being united to Lucy with Eugene's blessing. Lucy rejected the impoverished crippled George at the end of Welles' version and Eugene visited Fanny in a boarding house where she was reduced to being a cook. Hardly optimistic fare in World War II America and all the studios wanted optimism then. Another reason to change the film to the idiotic conclusion we have today. Interestingly the recent television remake follows the novel  Lucy unites with the unrepentant still arrogant George while Eugene has to accept this. Even that would not have been acceptable to the studios in 1942.".

It is hard to watch her in any scene and not question where a woman so beautiful comes from and what exactly makes her so damn good to look at.";

In the movie we see a guy who has found all the answers and he claims to be happy with the discovery but we see it very well that he is the most miserable person on earth. But he has those answers that blow everyones mind so... he has to know something.And than he figures it all out! Major spoiler people there is NO theory!... The only thing you can do in your life is to enjoy it. I think thats what the movie tries to tell us. That despite of finding out the answers to all questions about being Bickford was in pain. And when he found out he doesn't have to find out anything he was truly happy for the first time. Sex is not the answer its just symbolizing joy unconditional happiness. So thats why the movie makes sense.I gave it an 8 because despite how great its philosophy was it wasn't really.. fun and Im not saying I missed funny things from it. It just lacks the things I would want from a movie to make me give it a 9 or a 10. But I loved Patrick Fugit in it and Olivia Wilde was also remarkable she is adorably crazy and Fran Kranz is one of my favorite actors so it was nice to see him in the movie.".

It seems just as likely that shooting began and the story was made up one bong hit at a time.The gist of the story is that Bickford Shmeckler wrote a book which is so full of astounding concepts about life the universe and everything that it changes the lives of almost anyone who reads it. Only the barest hint of these cool ideas are ever actually revealed to the audience. Bickford Shmeckler's Cool Ideas isn't really sure of what sort of film it's supposed to be. At times it seems it's a moronic party comedy at times it tries to be serious. But whatever it tries it fails on all accounts.The characters are flat and lifeless which doesn't seem to be the fault of the actors it definitely feels like bad writing and direction.The attempts at humor which include a scene where a handful of gay slurs are shared one sight gag with a person in a wheelchair and a mentally ill character included for the sake of zaniness also fail. That includes the terrible idea to name the title character Bickford Shmeckler. I laughed once during the film 34 minutes into it. Shortly after that the only thing visually interesting in the film happens when...SPOILER ALERT...Bickford suddenly stabs a meat fork into a cantaloupe. It was also the film's only genuine moment. What makes this film worth disliking is that there was a chance to explore some interesting ideas here such as people embracing pop theologyideology in a manner that's just as mindless as their lives before exposure to the new ideas. Or people wanting to embrace trinkets such as hats and tshirts as an expression of their beliefs. Or the discovery of a writer who doesn't want to be discovered and who definitely doesn't want to be the leader of some new quasireligion based on his writing. In fact Bickford Shmeckler's Cool Ideas so completely misses making a point or even telling an interesting story that this story could be turned into an entirely different much better film.".

	schema:headline " Yuksel Aksu Like Italian Neorealists...";
	schema:reviewBody "Dondurmam Gaymak is a local movie having a universal content. A favorite description of the movie Ice Cream I Scream made by the Turkish media and it's true. The movie is filmed using almost an entirely nonprofessional cast and natural locations. People living in Mugla helped the crew at their best by supplying food drink transportation and accommodation. Also a native of the filming location director Yuksel Aksu wanted to put the warmth life style and energy contained in the hearts of Aegian people of Turkey...But underneath it all there lies an important aim. The director explains that he tried to behave like Italian Neorealists using nonprofessional actors. He also films a realistic life in Mugla. The religious education respect to older people naive residents political restrictions somehow funny devotion to religion they stop drinking alcohol when an ezan call to prayer begins then continues after it finishes... All these are presented in a way that the director doesn't try to point out something exactly but he just show what's there and leaves the rest to the viewer.The production is not bad actorship is quite acceptable very intense and funny sometimes flow of the story is well balanced from thrilling scenes to dramatic or really funny ones. The alreadylostwar against capitalism is unbelievably fresh. It's living characters really warm the scene and I can be sure that any Turkish viewer would have a great time watching it.

	onyx:emotionText "Dondurmam Gaymak is a local movie having a universal content. A favorite description of the movie Ice Cream I Scream made by the Turkish media and it's true. The movie is filmed using almost an entirely nonprofessional cast and natural locations. People living in Mugla helped the crew at their best by supplying food drink transportation and accommodation. Also a native of the filming location director Yuksel Aksu wanted to put the warmth life style and energy contained in the hearts of Aegian people of Turkey...But underneath it all there lies an important aim. The director explains that he tried to behave like Italian Neorealists using nonprofessional actors. He also films a realistic life in Mugla. The religious education respect to older people naive residents political restrictions somehow funny devotion to religion they stop drinking alcohol when an ezan call to prayer begins then continues after it finishes... All these are presented in a way that the director doesn't try to point out something exactly but he just show what's there and leaves the rest to the viewer.The production is not bad actorship is quite acceptable very intense and funny sometimes flow of the story is well balanced from thrilling scenes to dramatic or really funny ones. The alreadylostwar against capitalism is unbelievably fresh. It's living characters really warm the scene and I can be sure that any Turkish viewer would have a great time watching it. Although there are some mistakes with sound production or a very quick reveal in the peak scene.It should be noted that this movie was chosen to represent Turkey in Oscars.

And I really found what I expected a film trying to be likable for both for conservatives and liberals in Turkey trying being authentic for foreign spectators and enough funny for all. But it should be understood that it is not possible to be favorable for everybody therefore film stays as average for all.Whole movie is telling a story occurred within 24 hours. To fit the short story in a full movie length some scenes are added without a connection with the main story. These are mostly the icecream selling scenes to the eccentric local people i.e. goat herdsman old women etc. and each of these selling scenes are tried to be interesting to the spectators by skits with comic dialogs. The subject is mentioned as a universal problem Struggle of a local producertradesman against holding companies and monopoly but this was the interesting subject of twenty years before. Most of the readers will remember the Hero grocer against supermarket from Ferhan Sensoy in 1980's. This was the correct story at correct time. Shortly the story is not strong enough and worth to be a movie as by now.Except some gibbers due to local accent the performance of cast is so successful. The leading role is played by Turan Ozdemir with excessive body language but anyway he is successful too.On the other hand against limited budget appreciable efforts of director and players are obviously giving a good mood to the film. But this is not resulting a film well enough either to compare with Italian neorealists or worth to be Oscar nominee.Note In the real life normally the Icecream seller would stop his own production and be the dealer of one of the competitors of Manda brand.".

Since they employed the public of Mugla towns as actors and their accent is different than those who speak clear Turkish and probably they didn't give enough time for actor instructors to train these people in terms of diction etc. while watching the movie Turkish spectators had hard time to clearly understand the dialogs.

If the story is based on such a social content and such a small interesting event there had to be included more elements to attach the spectators to the movie and to be gripping.After watching the movie I told myself I wish they had reshot the first half all over again because it's obvious that it took time for actors to get used to their roles to adaptate themselves to the movie. For example the wife's mimics and gestures during her fights with the ice cream seller in the first 30 minutes were not satisfying. She looked like she was just waiting for her turn to speak ignoring what her husband was talking about and she was in a lack of appropriate response in her facial movements which tore her link to naturalism.We all know that it's the hardest thing to train kid actors especially if they have never seen a camera before and all of a sudden they are in a big movie having big parts in it! I must say that they all managed it well! I can't forget the look on Kamil's face and his voice his perfect toning while he confessed that he stole the ice cream.

Even Yuksel Aksu himself was not expecting the movie to make such a big scene in the country. He is surprised with the great attention it obtained. Nevertheless considering how much labour and how great effort the crew spent for this movie in addition to the crucial message it gives we all have to congratulate them and celebrate it's success.

	schema:headline " caricature of sincerity";
	schema:reviewBody "Although promoted as one of the most sincere Turkish films with an amateur cast Icecream I Scream is more like a caricature of sincerity.The plot opens with the dream of Ali a traveling icecream salesman in a Western Anatolia town in which he sees himself becoming successful using the same marketing methods of big icecream companies. He dreams of playing in his product's TV commercial with beautiful models in bikinis dancing around him. As his dream turns into a nightmare he wakes up with a big erection next to his gargantuan wife who rejects to make sex with him for 6 years with no apparent reason. Is it because he is not successful in his job? Apparently because he says he was selling better in the old days when there was no pressure from global icecream companies. But this is what he says we actually don't see him suffer that much he still sells good traveling the neighboring villages while his apprentice stays at the shop selling icecream to the people in the town. Ali blames big companies for using sweetening and coloring agents while he is using real sahlep powdered roots of mountain orchids. Ali buys a motorbike with a bank loan to be a traveling vendor and gives ads to a local TV channel which prefers to broadcast even the news bulletin in local dialect. His wife is not fond of his ways of doing business they always quarrel and Ali threatens her that he may do very bad things in a moment of frenzy.In a very successful day his lousy bike is stolen by the misbehaving little boys of the town. In search of his stolen bike Ali goes to the police blames the big companies for the theft but of course nobody takes him seriously. Annoyed by the nagging of his wife Ali goes to a tavern and becomes drunk. One of his friends at his table a wannabe socialist of the town gives a didactic speech and criticizes globalism and with no real connection jumps to the subject of global freezing. Ali returns home and decides to kill himself with poison. His wife wakes up and prevents him. An old neighbor takes him to a night walk and advises him about life. According to him Ali can even sell hot sahlep drink if the world faces with global freezing. When he returns home suddenly we see that his wife understood his value treating him like a hero and praising his manhood. Meanwhile the thief boys got sick eating too much icecream. They confess to the doctor that they stole Ali's bike. Ali forgives them and there comes the happy end.Although the plot may look promising in a way it's the storytelling which makes this film insincere and cheesy. First the director doesn't show much of an effort to tell the story visually everything is based on dialogs. And the dialogs never stop to show us that cinema is actually a visual art. Even Ali's troubles are not convincing because we don't see it we just understand it from his words. The director markets his film as a righteous fight of Ali against big icecream companies but there is nothing in the film about big companies. We don't see their pressure enough. The film actually ridicules Ali for believing that big companies are behind the theft. And when his motorbike is found it solves every problem Ali becomes a happy and powerful husband. Not a real criticism of globalism.Second the film is cheesy because of the crude humor. Maybe the people of that part of Turkey is cursing so much and making so many vulgar jokes in their daily life but vulgar language and crude humor are not enough to make a film funny. I may have accepted it if they were both vulgar and clever but they are not clever jokes at all they are just cheesy. Maybe I'm wrong maybe American people may like oriental version of American Pie style humor. But American Pie never had any claim to be a nominee for the Oscars or to have a political message! If you think that you can laugh by just seeing a man's big erection in his shorts and we had to endure this joke twice! or an old villager woman saying fk you then you may find this film funny.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll try not to repeat what others have said. I liked this film though I am not sure if anyone outside Turkey can like it as much as a Turk or someone familiar with rural Turkish culture. There are several reasons for this First of all I made a point of watching the film with English subtitles and of course the subtitles were not perfect but at times they were confusing or too simplistic. Second of all the juxtaposition of religious beliefs with overtly sexual scenes intended to be funny maybe a commentary on the conflicting identities secular Turks feel and live with but left me a bit confused. Perhaps this could have been executed a little better and was done very well with the more subtle contradictions or shall we call them adaptations of everyday life with religious and secular beliefs? as a previous comment highlighted the men hiding their alcohol upon hearing the call for prayer. Several things to note Baba Zula did the music for the film the original songs which I really liked. The drink of choice in the film is raki ouzo and anisebased alcohol that becomes cloudy white when diluted with water therefore often referred to as lion's milk in Turkey for Turkish men suppose they are like lions? But of course! As for things I really did not like in the film I felt that ALL women in the film were screaming bitches! Mothers to their sons wives to their husbands... The screaming was I guess meant to be funny and at times the driving force behind our hero's misery but my experience with Turkish women in places like Mugla is far from what is portrayed here. Of course the film does not have to be realistic but I found this aspect to be very annoying. And the things I really liked The location is beautiful. I would like to see more and more films made somewhere other than Istanbul. Mugla is such a beautiful setting. Beautiful mosque classic bluewhite tile embellishments beautiful beaches the winding roads the river... Made me homesick for a moment...

	onyx:emotionText "I'll try not to repeat what others have said. I liked this film though I am not sure if anyone outside Turkey can like it as much as a Turk or someone familiar with rural Turkish culture. There are several reasons for this First of all I made a point of watching the film with English subtitles and of course the subtitles were not perfect but at times they were confusing or too simplistic. Second of all the juxtaposition of religious beliefs with overtly sexual scenes intended to be funny maybe a commentary on the conflicting identities secular Turks feel and live with but left me a bit confused. Perhaps this could have been executed a little better and was done very well with the more subtle contradictions or shall we call them adaptations of everyday life with religious and secular beliefs? as a previous comment highlighted the men hiding their alcohol upon hearing the call for prayer. Several things to note Baba Zula did the music for the film the original songs which I really liked. The drink of choice in the film is raki ouzo and anisebased alcohol that becomes cloudy white when diluted with water therefore often referred to as lion's milk in Turkey for Turkish men suppose they are like lions? But of course! As for things I really did not like in the film I felt that ALL women in the film were screaming bitches! Mothers to their sons wives to their husbands... The screaming was I guess meant to be funny and at times the driving force behind our hero's misery but my experience with Turkish women in places like Mugla is far from what is portrayed here. Of course the film does not have to be realistic but I found this aspect to be very annoying. And the things I really liked The location is beautiful. I would like to see more and more films made somewhere other than Istanbul. Mugla is such a beautiful setting. Beautiful mosque classic bluewhite tile embellishments beautiful beaches the winding roads the river... Made me homesick for a moment... Also the inclusion of two characters in the film the cornonthecob salesman and the newspaperman who is physically challenged on the beach was interesting if not again a part of the layered commentary on the socioeconomic aspects of life in Turkey.

	schema:reviewBody "I walk out of very few movie screenings and this movie managed to become one of those that I couldn't bear to watch any longer. As far as the awards it won goes the ones awarded by Turkish festivals are not credible in my opinion. My only explanation for the Queens festival award was to think that somehow a layer of comedy was gained in translation as the subtitles helped distract attention from the horrendous performances.At the beginning of the screening I attended the presenter briefly talked about the history of Turkish cinema and at one point mentioned that early Turkish cinema was appropriately named stage cinema since many of the filmmakers and actors involved were people from the theater scene.Ironically this movie falls right into that category. English speakers reading subtitles may think that Turkish is a naturally loud language and attribute all the yelling in the movie to that but observant native commentators will immediately notice that all the actors are performing with exaggerated loud voices. You could attribute this to the amateur nature of all actors but the biggest source of yelledoutdialog is the main character played by the only professional actor in the movie. Not surprisingly his background is in theater. My guess is that in response to his loud delivery of lines all other amateur actors raised their voices as well hence turning the whole movie into a series of unnatural performances.Put on top of all of this a storyline that develops at a snail's pace you get an extremely boring movie.I have to say I also have a personal problem with Turkish movies that depict entirely rural life with shallow uneducated characters. Ever since Zugurt Aga one of the best Turkish movies ever made Turkish filmmakers seem to be not able to avoid the appeal of the rural part of the country. This is only interesting in small doses and if it is as beautifully orchestrated with excellent writing and directing as in Zugurt Aga. Most often however it is extremely boring and frankly somewhat embarrassing to native urban Turks. Rural communities make up a neglected undereducated part of the country and while this provides good material for comedy it comes at a huge cost to Turkey's image.A western audience member whose only exposure to Turkey is this movie will undoubtedly think that Turkey is like Afghanistan. I wish filmmakers would realize this and let go of their passion for the stories of the rural man and stay loyal to the majority of the country who live in cities that put metropolitan areas in Europe to shame.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Mirror Mirror in theaters back in April with my niece but I just decided to write something on it because it has come under a lot of criticism and honestly I don't know why.I saw a lot of negativity on YouTube and many other places so it got me to thinking what really is the problem with movies geared more toward children? I think fairy tales should bring out the little kid in everybody but I've noticed that some people find it hard to revert back to their childhood or innocence because they think it's cheesy or corny.And with the recent comparisons between the two Snow Whites Mirror vs.Snow White  the Huntsman it has gotten more and more ridiculous.There has already been a darkversion of Snow White Tale of Terror if anyone remembers so there has been done already. A comedic version is interesting and new.I can only comment on Mirror Mirror because I saw it and I enjoyed it. Snow White Lily Collins is treated horribly by her wicked stepmother The Queen Julia Roberts who is ruling the kingdom since her father's mysterious death. Somehow with the help of the dwarfs and the Prince Armie Hammer Snow White begins to believe in herself and realizes she has the strength to fight off the wicked Queen.It was a really nice retelling of Snow White because it was a coming of age story. Never knew who Lily Collins was before this movie but I think she was spoton as Snow White. She has this innocent beauty that was perfect for Snow White but she also was courageous which is a great role model for young girls nowadays. Might I add her eyebrows fit her and there is nothing wrong with them as I've seen nasty comments about it. They add distinction to her face.The Prince was really comical and funny. Had me laughing a lot. Never knew who Armie Hammer was before this movie also. I liked him because it was the opposite from Disney Princes who usually are perfect in every way without flaws. They can sing danceand sword fight but he was pretty dense in a way but it actually suited the movie and it was intended to be that way.Last but not least Julia Roberts was divine as the wicked Queen. Honestly I love her bitchy and sneering her nose at everyone. Julia is usually seen as this sweetheart but it was great to see this side of her. I liked her little on and off British accent too and her pompous narration to the story.Love the dwarfs they had absolutely the best one liners. They were modern and jazzed stuff up.So again I add every movie does not have to be sinister and Hannibal Lector evil for it to be considered a good movie. Nor does it have to have The Hangover type jokes and vulgarity to be considered worthy of laughter.The critics can go to hell on this one. I will watch this movie again and again especially with my niece.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was really interested in seeing this movie from the start but the negative press and the corny trailer made me lower my expectations somewhat. There was something about it though that still made me want to go see it even if it turned out to be good for nothing except eye candy. However my initial skepticism went right out the window at the stunning opening sequence recounting the prologue in animation that was part puppet theater part illustration.Indeed the visuals in this film are stunning as are the costumes both of which are fully on display but the actors are never overwhelmed by their sumptuous surroundings. Julia Roberts is clearly having a wonderful time as the kind of character she should have been selfaware enough to play a long time ago. Lily Collins turns in a sweet earnest performance that comes off as the perfect compromise between the traditional and modern fairytale princess. Her dedication to what could have been a phonedin ingnue is actually rather impressive. The supporting cast wears somewhat thin namely a few of the dwarfs but the director thankfully realizes that this is a fairytale not a cartoon and the audience is spared from most painful mugging. The main weaknesses of the film then are the comedy and the storyline. While I had plenty of giggles and the dialogue isn't nearly as bad as the trailer made it seem between the dwarfs and the queen there are more than a few gags that get repeated over and over and lines that depending on who you are will elicit a chuckle or a groan. While the Snow White story isn't altered radically and most of the revisions come off as embellishment there are a handful of set pieces that clash with the tone and come off as contrived or pointless. Still several of the changes are more than welcome even if they come at the cost of the more iconic points of the story being overlooked. For my part I believe that this plucky Snow would handle the poison apple scenario exactly the way she did here and it made me smile to see it in the finale. I'm a big fan of fairy tales whimsy in healthy doses and visuals as big as the imagination so I recommend Mirror Mirror to fans of the same and appreciators of films like Enchanted and MirrorMask. It's a fun heartfilled escapist artwork good for more than a few viewings.".

The deviation from the classic story was not well done and in many ways it did not make much sense. On a positive note the acting was refreshingly good particularly on the part of Julia Roberts. Roberts played the sinister queen quite excellently adding a seething sarcasm to each line. Along with the acting the aesthetics were good. Makeup could have been better but costuming was very well done and it played a large part in making the movie coherent.

	schema:reviewBody "Mirror Mirror does not deserve so bad ratings. I've seen worse movies last year with so bad direction bad screenplay or bad acting and people gone mad as they were watching the best movies ever. I really can't understand people's taste.But yes I can understand why Tarsem is so underrated maybe because few understand his concepts and artistic views. I am following his career since he was just a video music director which was a truly school in his film making process. He brought to the movies a lot of what make video music so fascinating like the using of high colors and impressive structures making a scene more than just a scene but a piece of art in movement a real dream.The Cell 2000 The Fall 2006 Immortals 2011 and Mirror Mirror 2012 are his examples of such visually daring movies that few directors are able to do. Even his movies suffering from the lack of a great screenplay like The Cell Immortals or Mirror Mirror itself watch his movies is always a delightful thing thankfully to another very important artist costume designer Eiko Ishioka 19382012 responsible for bringing to reality all his imaginary since his first work.Of course that after Shrek a fairy tale wouldn't be the same and that's why the story suffered some changes but none of them in a disrespectful way just some different point of views that really added something to the plot development and also for some few thrilling moments. I think that the movie must be seen by a child point of view because I'm sure that kids would love this one. It has a funny and naive humor but at the same time Julia Roberts provides the most interesting and sarcastic dialogs and acting which can be pleasant for the adults. Even with all that huge costume it's possible to note that her Pretty Woman hump prevails and she is really just having some fun in a completely natural and unpretentious good acting.The final sequence is not that out of context as some has said first of all because since the beginning is told that the kingdom was a happy place where people danced and sang day and night and everything came back to normal when the king arrived again. OK that Bollywood thing feels out of context and surreal but Tarsem is an Indian director and his movies are surreal and that's the fun of watching them.".

	schema:headline " Strangely Enchanting";
	schema:reviewBody "Nobody is asking for another Snow White movie but at some point this one is interesting because it's directed by Tarsem Singh and you know his films always have quirky visuals and fascinating costumes. Nothing like any blockbusters out there. And these elements fit perfectly to the story of Snow White. As a result it's enjoyable and amusing. Although it suffers a few missteps that aren't easy to ignore. But the merits are more noticeable than the flaws. It may be unnecessary but it's actually pretty good.The film throws plenty of twists to the story. The only part they removed from the original Snow White story is having friends with forest animals which is important because it shows how innocent Snow White is but Snow White isn't quite innocent here. Just like the other upcoming Snow White film she's fighting hereShown in trailer. Not spoilers. The film is random in most sequence but it's actually fun. It's clever how they made the love triangle of Snow White The Queen and The Prince.I loved the cast. Lily Collins is captivating and adorable as Snow White. Armie Hammer makes a charming Prince. Julia Roberts was meant to steal the show. They're aiming her as an annoying petty villain and it works effectively. It's good to see Nathan Lane again. We don't see him that much in movies anymore but he can still give plenty of joy and laughs to the audience. The dwarfs are enjoyable as well.The script can be problematic sometimes especially to one scene when Snow White says to the Prince he had no pants but what she actually meant he was shirtless. The climax twist was underwhelming and enervating. Like I say Tarsem Singh's trademarks works best here. The quirky visuals are wonderful. The scene when the Queen's giant puppets attacks the dwarfs' home looks great though the editing is kind of messy. The costumes are simply fascinating.Unexpectedly the film turns out to be magical and fun in a strange way. Since Hollywood is suddenly making too much adaptations of Fairy Tales these days at least this one has magic. I don't know what will the other upcoming Snow White movie is going to be but this one is simple and fun despite from its randomness and missteps. If Tarsem Singh directs a film no matter how good or bad it is it will always look fascinating.".

	onyx:emotionText "Nobody is asking for another Snow White movie but at some point this one is interesting because it's directed by Tarsem Singh and you know his films always have quirky visuals and fascinating costumes. Nothing like any blockbusters out there. And these elements fit perfectly to the story of Snow White. As a result it's enjoyable and amusing. Although it suffers a few missteps that aren't easy to ignore. But the merits are more noticeable than the flaws. It may be unnecessary but it's actually pretty good.The film throws plenty of twists to the story. The only part they removed from the original Snow White story is having friends with forest animals which is important because it shows how innocent Snow White is but Snow White isn't quite innocent here. Just like the other upcoming Snow White film she's fighting hereShown in trailer. Not spoilers. The film is random in most sequence but it's actually fun. It's clever how they made the love triangle of Snow White The Queen and The Prince.I loved the cast. Lily Collins is captivating and adorable as Snow White. Armie Hammer makes a charming Prince. Julia Roberts was meant to steal the show. They're aiming her as an annoying petty villain and it works effectively. It's good to see Nathan Lane again. We don't see him that much in movies anymore but he can still give plenty of joy and laughs to the audience. The dwarfs are enjoyable as well.The script can be problematic sometimes especially to one scene when Snow White says to the Prince he had no pants but what she actually meant he was shirtless. The climax twist was underwhelming and enervating. Like I say Tarsem Singh's trademarks works best here. The quirky visuals are wonderful. The scene when the Queen's giant puppets attacks the dwarfs' home looks great though the editing is kind of messy. The costumes are simply fascinating.Unexpectedly the film turns out to be magical and fun in a strange way. Since Hollywood is suddenly making too much adaptations of Fairy Tales these days at least this one has magic. I don't know what will the other upcoming Snow White movie is going to be but this one is simple and fun despite from its randomness and missteps. If Tarsem Singh directs a film no matter how good or bad it is it will always look fascinating.";

	schema:reviewBody "Not only are comic book characters finding screen time in the cinemas but fairy tale ones as well with films such as Red Riding Hood going through a reinvention of the character as does Snow White this year with no less than two big budgeted productions each with its unique take on the character in what would be a face off between Lily Collins and Kristen Stewart in the title roles one still very much that demure teenager while the other going by the trailers happen to be more warrior princess instead.The Snow White I believe most of us know is likely the Walt Disney version her trademark being that of her songs dance and ability to uncannily communicate with birds and other small cute animals. Tarsem's Snow White does the same too well almost albeit influenced in more Bollywood terms with the supporting dancers their twirls colours and costumes on display designed by the late Eiko Ishioka and she's basically is on a mission to rediscover her kingdom's penchant for celebration all over again given the void after the disappearance of her father the King Sean Bean. After all Lily Collins shows she's up to the mark and a bona fide Disneyish version with the provision of her singing voice in I Believe In Love in a sequence that could be liken to be as out of place as Jai Ho in Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire.But while her Snow White is that demure damsel who's the fairest of them all she also does show a little bit more character in her ability and grit determination to wield a weapon to wage war against her enemies namely her stepmother The Evil Queen Julia Roberts and her minions made up of court bootlicker Brighton Nathan Lane and other mystical creatures including her own magic mirror reflection in a stunning CG sequence each time she calls out to her. But don't expect a full on battle ala the other Snow White played by Kristen Stewart as this one gets trained by her seven thieving dwarfs who decide that she joins them in their mission if she wants to continue seeking refuge in their humble abode and passes with having looks brains and brawn with plenty of heart going out to her people when she learns of the truth of the suffering in the villages.Visionary director Tarsem Singh is well know for the imagery of his films full of the fantastical strange but always fascinating view of the created world. While his previous film Immortals may have suffered by the lack of a strong plot and action that made it look like a poor cousin to 300 he's back in his element with Mirror Mirror providing the audience a visual treat while treading on a story structure that is familiar with most which more or less follows the line of the evil Queen being jealous of Snow White's beauty and gets rid of her only to have the planned assassination attempt botched with the killer taking pity her venturing into the woods and meeting up with the seven dwarfs with the Queen poisoning her with an apple and to be rescued by Prince Charming or in this case a certain Prince Alcott Armie Hammer from Valencia.But be warned that this version too may not go down well with some especially since the story by Melisa Wallack reworks most of the major details on how the Prince meets up with Snow White playing a major role here rather than appearing as a cameo at the end and giving each of the seven dwarfs completely different personalities with names like Napoleon Jordan Prentice Half Pint Mark Povinelli Grub Joe Gnoffo Wolf Sebastian Saraceno Grimm Danny Woodburn Butcher Martin Klebba and Chuckles Ronald Lee Clark who are almost RobinHood like in a subplot about not being loved and discriminated against. But thankfully some of their personalities come across with good natured humour.Much has been said of Julia Robert's role as the sarcastic Queen whose heart is filled with plenty of black humour and her character is quite mancrazy finding it necessary to quickly hook up a rich princeking in order to continue with her lavish lifestyle at the expense of the kingdom's coffers raising taxes to fund her whims and fancies. Probably the first Snow White story to have both the Queen and Snow White tussle for the love of the Prince all I can say is Armie Hammer who did a great job as the Winklevoss twins in The Social Network and as J.Edgar's right hand man continues to impress in his roles  in this one having a shirtless running joke  that I am anticipating his turn as The Lone Ranger come next year. Lily Collins will have you believe she IS Snow White and carries what is expectant of the fairest of them all pretty well and doesn't make you wonder why so many become mesmerized by her beauty. But flower vase she is not as she has two missions to fulfill one to bring back laughter to her kingdom and to track down the whereabouts of her father.Mirror Mirror has plenty of tongue in cheek jokes and slapstick scenario at times that puts it close to being an outright comedy yet not quite. Instead it's as close to what a fairy tale will look like on the big screen with the plenty of beautiful sets and scenarios crafted for the characters to operate in that made it quite dream like and Tarsem being at his element in crafting a visually impressive outing that draws first blood in rival Snow White films. The I Believe In Love segment has already earned brownie points from me so let's see what the other Snow White film can come up with something unique. Recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "From the very start of the film the audience can tell its in for a visual treat. Mirror Mirror opens with the queen giving the story background which is shown by porcelain dolls a very creative choice on the director's part. The film never lacks in taste or boring sets. From the town to the castle to the forest stunning costumes and lavish sets abound. The script suffers a bit here and there. The film may have been better off without the occasional rude humor thanks one hundred percent to the dwarfs. The queen contributes to most of the humor with her grand ability to spit sarcasm and one liners with little effort. Julia Roberts fits into her character beautifully. Armie Hammer and Lily Collins make convincing characters as the prince and Snow White. I must add though the film goes by at a rather slow pace. A minor complaint but worth mentioning. Quite possibly my favorite thing about Mirror Mirror is the presentation of the Mirror. The director gave us the last thing we would expect for the Mirror It resides in a shack in the middle of lake which is in the actual Mirror. Five star representation in my opinion. The film also noticeably twists the classic story by having Snow White save the prince from a rather interesting ahem... embarrassing spell with a kiss. Unlike other feministic films of late most noticeably Alice in Wonderland the film quenches the blatant feminism themes with a wonderful old fashioned fairy tale. The critics like to call out Mirror Mirror for lacking a unique touch or individuality. I would argue that the film's unique touch is its overthetop sets and costumes and why would we want something different than a an classic fairy tale. I would also argue in favor of the Bollywoodesque ending. The song and dance compliments the film with a magical touch. In conclusion the film does have its minor downsides but remains a classic film worth remembering. Mirror Mirror outshines Disney's Enchanted and Alice in Wonderland in fairy tale scale and no film can match its grand opulence.".

	schema:reviewBody "This isn't the first time that we have seen a retelling of the classic Snow White story from the Brothers Grimm fairytale to the classic Disney animated film. In Mirror Mirror there are some moments that kids will have fun with. Not that I have a problem with kids' movies but Mirror Mirror is one of the most ridiculous takes of the Snow White story that I've ever seen! I would say that this movie provides familyfriendly entertainment that the kids would enjoy but that doesn't help this movie from being cheesy idiotic unfunny and undeniably corny. Julia Roberts delivers one of the weakest performances of her career as she tries to deliver a menacing performance as the Evil Queen. But we don't believe that her character is actually evil when she's instead sad lonely and maniacally insane. The beautiful Lily Collins seemed adorable as Snow White and she really stayed true to her role unlike the other characters in the film. Armie Hammer who was really good in The Social Network delivers a horrid performance as the Prince not by judging his acting but by judging those completely forced moments he was asked to be in. Director Tarsem Singh gives this tale a more trippy and awkward treatment rather than a familyfun treatment. The art direction is magical and the costumes are colorful but they couldn't help this movie's script. I was left incredibly mad by the humor in this movie. This movie delivers a few weird innuendos unfunny moments and incredibly forced moments. It feels more like an adult movie disguised as a kids' movie. The movie was a little too cheesy and corny and some of those moments went way too far. Like the scene when the Queen gives the Prince a love potion accidentally turning him into a human puppy. That was a pretty awkward moment but kids will like it. When this movie tries to be heartwarming and trying to deliver a message that will bring emotion it sadly just doesn't work. Then the ending happened and it ruined me for life. That's the thing I hated! The kids are being forced into watching this because this is a Snow White movie. Do they even realize that there's already a Snow White movie for kids called Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs? That movie meant a lot to me in my childhood because that was the movie that sparked my interest in film in the first place. But Mirror Mirror is just a wild excuse to ruin my childhood. Maybe your kids are able to enjoy something like this but just wait till they grow up and watch it again after so long. Trust me you'll understand! Mirror Mirror in my review a painfully weak and ridiculously flat film that angers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mirror Mirror is just Awful Awful!! I am in shock and awe that this 100 million dollar fiasco was ever given the green light to be produced. The problems with this film are numerous however I will address some of the major issues. The first and foremost problem is CASTING!!!!! Call Julia Roberts lots of things but you cannot call her WICKED or VAIN!!! The story of Snow White is the story in which the evil queen Roberts is so obsessed with beauty that she would spare not means to rid the kingdom of anyone thought to be any fairer than her. However Roberts cannot pull off this role every time she flashes her pearly white smile she eludes wholesome and purity and not evilness nor malice in which the role requires. My second issue with the film is COSTUME Design. Yes I understand that is film is supposed to be a fantasyperiod piecehowever the costumes are so over the top the kingdom seems to be one step shy of the KINGDOM of WHOVILLE from the movie The Grinch. My third issue with the film would be SET design. While the costume design went over the top the set design was sadly underwhelming. Every sceneexcept the forest set seemed to be so minuscule and stuffed with extras that it looked tiny on the screen. The Kingdom looked like a 16x16 seedy alley way while the Royal Wedding looked to be hosted in a Coleman pup tent!!! However my number 1 issue with the film had to be director Tarsem Singh's vision. Was this film supposed to be a comedy a fantasy an adventure or a Bollywood reincarnation of a beloved fairy tale... I have no idea and after watching this film neither did he. I know that Hollywood offers very little for the wholesome family audience to venture out to see but it would be shameful for me to recommend this film which I cannot. Save your money this film with quickly end up in the Walmart Bargain Bin or the Walgreen Redbox 1 Rentals. P.S. Please do not get me started on the Cirque du Solei Dwarfs and the Bollywood production number at the films end....... Enough Said! Please read more of my reviews at THE FARIS REEL on Facebook.".

Maybe while listening to the Beatles' song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. It might be entertaining.All the characters are annoying... the best part for me was the introduction it almost had me interested.Julia Roberts obviously needs some more money. When really she should retire from acting. For her looks and style are so so dated its unreal. Funny thing is she acts the same as she has done in all her previous films. Which totally proves she can not act to save her life! My dirty underpants put on more of a show than she can.I had to turn it off half way through because it was so bad it actually made me feel sick. It's films like this that put you off from ever wanting to risk going to the cinemahire out a film again! If you are easily pleased do not have a brain and have had zero interesting life experiences in your time. Than maybe this film was made just for you. However for the rest of the world it's to be avoided like the plague!!!".

The new mirror mirror version is better than fine along with the apple scene.

	schema:headline " Roberts steals the show.";
	schema:reviewBody "I can only think of one other movie where Julia Roberts is cast in a negative role. When news broke out that Roberts will play the evil queen in this Grimm's fairy tale adaptation I just couldn't resist. Let's face it it's not everyday you get to see the most popular actress in the world with the best smile in Hollywood play an evil and conniving character. In this version the story remains true to original if not with a wacky twist and a lot of humor. After the king disappears under mysterious circumstances Snow White Lily Collins learns that her stepmother the queen Roberts has been plundering and looting from the people of the land. After rescuing a prince Armie Hammerfrom seven 'little' highway bandits and gaining his affection Snow White is banished to the forest when the queen sees wealth and power in the guise of the unwitting prince besides his use as her toyboy. Snow White must now team up with the aforementioned bandits and win back her birthright her prince and restore her father's kingdom to its former glory. Thus begins an itchy catfight with a capital B. Having just watched this movie I can't say that this is the best adaptation thus far given its PG classification. However considering that there are two other versions slated for a 2012 release including a darker version starring the emotionless Kristen Stewart I am forced to say that Mirror Mirror suffices as a decent family adventurecomedy. Having cut a niche for himself in visual esthetics and art design director Tarsem Singh creates a vivid and colorful world with innovative sets and costumes  a standard that is rapidly becoming his cinematic insignia after his work from The Cell to last year's Immortals. Singh also scores with intended comic relief given that he has had to work with a story where the audience knows what to expect. When you consider the story's comic backbone complete with slapstick moments Roberts's sarcastic oneliners arising from a witty script and the ever amusing Nathan Lane as the queen's royal subject this movie becomes a lighthearted stab at one of the oldest and most adapted fairy tales. That said this version sits well with the intended audience in its narration if you go in expecting a simple and entertaining movie. I really can't say that I was captivated by the acting. Collins as Snow White and Hammer as the prince are just soso as protagonists of an age old tale. Given the age of 'girl power' it is no surprise that Snow White here is a spirited young girl that not even for a moment appears to be a damsel in distress. On the other hand the prince is comical in almost all scenes stripping pun unintended his character of any chivalry from the original tale. As the movie is narrated in the queen's perspective it becomes apparent that the story is less about Snow White and more about the queen and her vanity. This chain of thought is what gives Mirror Mirror a new spin to the old yarn. Personally I strongly feel that Julia Roberts steals the show  not because I expected her to  but simply because the story appears to have been scripted with a lot of focus on her character. It's almost as if this version was written by the evil queen herself. For the most part Singh's work here is a tad bit above average in retelling a grand old tale. He keeps it simple while giving it a fresh and antiDisney twist. Then he goes and ruins it with a totally unnecessary and bizarre ending. Did Singh copy this off Tommy O'Haver's Ella Enchanted or did he want to give the finale a Bollywood twist? If Singh has used this movie to say something about his roots then he has picked the wrong movie to do so. Mixing Hollywood and Bollywood themes within the same movie is always risky. Danny Boyle may have gotten away with it in Slumdog Millionaire because of its theme on poverty and the hugely popular underdog factor. All said and done if it were not for Snow White doing the Bhangra I would have easily rated this film as a good start to 2012. Even so if you are willing to overcome your disbelief in the end the greater part of this movie is not half as bad.".

	schema:reviewBody "I came across this film at the New York Public Library and was intrigued enough by the cast to give it a try.  I was not disappointed.  'Vincent Franois Paul... et les autres' could serve as a textbook example of great writing and great acting.  The characters are so strongly developed full of the genuine complexities and contradictions that mark us as human beings. It's refreshing to find a film that is able to achieve this kind of emotional depth.  All of the actors do great work but Montand pretty much steals the show as Vincent. Full of bluster and sly humor you see his sadness and vulnerability come out over the course of the film as several crises come together and almost crush him.  In one powerful sequence we watch and suffer with him as he spends a long terrible night trying to get help from various friends to keep his business afloat only to realize how alone he is in the world. I've seen Montand in several films now and this one may contain his best work of all as he shows such tremendous range as an actor.Piccoli also does well as Franois an intelligent and successful doctor who's grown cold over the years and whose frustration and anger build up inside him until he finally loses it at dinner one evening.  Serge Reggiani who I wasn't familiar with does a great job as Paul a writer who can't finish his novel.  One of the most intense emotionallycharged moments in the film and there are many is a devastating exchange between Reggiani and Piccoli about Paul's unfinished book.  Ouch  painful stuff.  And a buff babyfaced Depardieu shows early screen presence and talent as Jean an amateur boxer who has gotten his girlfriend pregnant and must decide whether or not to accept a match against a brutal professional fighter who seriously injured another amateur boxer.  This subplot has an interesting twist and is handled well as is the fatherson type relationship between Montand and Depardieu.My one complaint is that the women in the film who all seem beautiful and intelligent and interesting aren't nearly as welldeveloped as the male characters but then it is called 'Vincent Franois Paul...' not 'Catherine Lucie Julia...'  For those folks who don't have patience with slowmoving films this one probably isn't for you.  The plot is interesting and there are moments of subtle humor that keep the film from becoming too heavy with drama but it may not be for everyone.  An excellent work.".

A little bit like Je Vous Aime with Catherine Deneuve and Jean Louis Trintignant Vincent Francois Paul...et les autres shows the after life of certain characters trying to cope with their sentimental failures and mixups except the fact that in this movie not everyone is an exhusband of one of the female stars.This certainly isn't as dramatic as Sautet's Les Choses de la Vie but there is just as much of a bitter final after taste although everyone is alive at the end. Sautet has thus far left me with a punch in the stomach feeling after seeing several of his movies. Nelly and Monsieur Arnaud for instance is another one of his unresolved romantic story where no one knows at the end whose feelings were hurt.Albeit its solemn Sautenesque tones with regards to love Vincent Francois Paul...et les autres keeps its focus on a bizarre yet strong friendship among several men preventing their unsolved love relationships to tamper with its strong lesson on the fact that often times friends last longer than partners.".

This is clearly a story about how a group of friends go through a tough period in their lives. It is an ode by the director Claude Sautet that celebrate friendship and to a certain extent the intimacy developed when people have an affinity to care for others.Vincent the main character in the film is the owner of a small factory. His business cannot compete with larger enterprises. Times are tough but he is a great boss with a rapport for his employees as well as a loyal friend to them. There is Francois a doctor who has lost his zest to a profession he chose. Paul a writer is suffering from writer's block. The three meet over drinks playing soccer and staying in close contact in good times and in bad times.The three men observed in this story are in their forties facing emotional as well as financial crises especially Vincent who cannot raise enough capital to keep his business afloat no matter what he does. His wife Catherine has left him and now wants a divorce. Lucie who is Francois wife is attracted to a younger man. Vincent's protg Jean a factory worker enters a boxing match at a disadvantage something the three friends look at with dread.At heart Vincent Francois Paul and the Others is an account about people facing a crisis either created by what life had in store for them or by the paths they followed in pursuit of their dreams. Loyalty is the bond that keeps them together. These are your basic decent guys anyone would feel blessed to enjoy. Claude Sautet's films examine those intimate moments among people that must face decisions that will change their lives completely while getting the strength to face those situations with the support of true friends.The cast is first rate. Yves Montand Michel Piccoli Serge Reggiani are seen as Vincent Francois and Paul. It is a pleasure to see these three men at the height of their profession perform a sort of choreography where they cross each other in small moments that are tribute to the way the men feel about the others. The women are less predominant in the film. Stephane Audran herself one of the best in the French cinema has nothing to play. Marie Dubois her beauty intact makes a perfect Lucie.

I think that's brought out by the location of Chair de poule the relais du col an isolated service station high in the mountains. People pass through all the time but they're customers cruel and spoilt I can testify to the bad behaviour of people passing through service stations having worked at one during my university holidays. So the horde just want things from you but here so do your intimate associates. Like many french crime films of the time Touchez pas au Grisbi 1954 being an example or actually all of Jacques Becker's great movies the prospect of male friendship  solidarity is tantalisingly present and seen as far more fulfilling than romantic love. It's perhaps the only escape in a cruel world. The movie's beautiful scenes are when Daniel Robert Hossein and Thomas Georges Wilson meet on the col road. A particularly wonderful and wistful tune by Georges Delerue plays here. Later when the crapola has contacted the proverbial rotary device a trumpeter on a passing coachtrip is there to taunt Daniel with another wistful tune this time mockingly so. Duvivier's is a cruel eye.I deliberately didn't start with the a plot outline because it's the psychology symbolism and the atmosphere of the movie rather than what's a rather generic plot that is what it's all about. The plot is as has been pointed out a simple noir one of ordinary people being tempted by crime the middle section has elements of The Postman Always Rings Twice overtly and also covertly  there is commentary on where lust ends and love begins. Chair de poule does rise above clich and you can genuinely feel how stifled the two Parisian friends Paul and Daniel are. How long can one stand in the cold? Women aren't perhaps as misogynistically portrayed as in many noir. Throughout the movie men are controllers of safes from the initial mark a rich man whose safe is up for robbing and who therefore counts far more beautiful women as habitual accessories to the proprietor of the relais du col and Paul and Daniel who hitherto worked in a safemakers factory. It's a world defined by men where every woman needs a man. Daniel's warm words about Thomas to his wife are instantly sneered at for being a man's opinion. Ultimately Maria Catherine Rouvel is a character that can be sympathised with a character with a back story neither an angel nor a harlot but a woman. She is still with us and acting in movies at the time of writing! Her face at times in the movie reminded me of a cheetah's at points she comes across as wild but snared in the world's mantrap.Top marks for pure villainy go to Lucien Raimbourg as Roux who had all the shameless rapacity of that great French character from Les Misrables Thnardier.Chair de poule is darkly satisfying.".

Directed by Julien Duvivier Pp le Moko who also coadapts the screenplay with Ren Barjavel from the novel Come EasyGo Easy written by James Hadley Chase Chair de poule AKA Highway PickUp is French film noir excellence. A picture that carries all the hallmarks of the 40s and 50s classic film noir cycle and proudly wears this fact as a badge of honour. Comparisons have inevitably been drawn to The Postman Always Rings Twice Tay Garnett 1946 which in itself is no bad thing at all but this is still very much its own animal. Duvivier never lets the story sit still as a standard formulaic plot there's always some new twisty addition to the story coming around the corner unstable characters entering the fray to keep the bleak noirish stew bubbling away.A fascinating feature of the picture is that our main protagonist Daniel Boisett is actually a good guy. Sure he was a safecracker but he's not murderous and as it turns out fate conspires against him to make him seem like a multiple killer when he clearly is not. He took the fall for his mate escapes jail and tries desperately to start afresh with honesty and virtue. But once Maria comes into his life fate has already dealt its deadly trump card. Women always pay with the same currency... Maria is an absolute sex bomb a sizzling siren of sexuality but as Daniel tells her it's a pity she's so rotten because she is and very much so. Yes there's a back story to her that stings her emotional fortitude but she's a bad egg for sure. Things quickly spiral out of control where even though Daniel knows that Maria is a femme fatale of the highest order he's caught in a trap a trap from which himself and the other male players in the piece can't possibly escape. Visually it's an intriguing picture as most of it is set in daylight up at a picturesque location. It begins in classic noir territory in the pouring rain as the men begin the safecracking job and then during the escape Duvivier and his cinematographer LonceHenri Burel produce a magnificent shot of a cop's giant silhouette felling the fleeing Daniel. After this we are predominantly in high light terms but never once does the sense of claustrophobia dissipate the atmosphere is consistently hot and sticky. Impressively performed and directed Chair de poule is cynical bleak and like a coiled spring waiting to explode. From that bleak rainy beginning to the explosively ironic finale this is basically an essential viewing for film noir aficionados. 910".

This was Julien Duviviers penultimate movie in a career spanning seven decades and coming as it did at the tail end of the new wavelet I like to think it helped to see off that pretentious hiccup which temporarily blighted a Great Film industry. Having opened on two men sitting in a car as torrential rain lashes the city streets Duvivier has them proceed to break in to a private home get caught in the act of opening the safe by the owner engage in a struggle involving gunshots and flee the scene. Then taking a leaf out of Jacques Tourneur's book he moves the whole noir genre to the great outdoors Tourneur shot most of Out Of The Past in a rural setting. Robert Hossein fleeing the crime scene is given a lift by a somewhat naive filling station owner who offers him room board and a job which involves access to his sultry wife. You may be ahead of me here because yes it does smack of The Postman Always Rings Twice but we're talking Duvivier here and he turns the whole thing up a notch introducing a fourth character where Postman was confined to three. He keeps the thing moving remorselessly to a climax that's Greek in its inevitability. Not to be missed.".

At the centre of the drama is an antihero who is caught in a web spun by a femme fatale who is out to get all she can. But these are no one dimensional characters for example the gold digging young wife acts very selfishly yet you do sort of sympathise with her powerless position in life as a possession of her old and unattractive husband while at the same time we understand the reasons why everyone does what they do they all seem to be caught in traps of some kind or other. Acting is very good with Robert Hossein leading the piece and Jean Sorel his partner in crime but perhaps it is Catherine Rouvel who is most memorable as the femme fatale whose actions propel the drama into tragedy.".

The look of the film is surprisingly gritty and realistic with the only complaint that anyone could raise being that the children were perhaps a tad too clean. The characterizations are top notch even the children! There's not a faker in the bunch! They are wholly believable. The pace of the film is steady never rushed never slow and lends a sense of real time passing. Even though most adults will easily predict the ultimate outcome they will not be bored or disappointed as it unfolds. This is the kind of film that should be required watching in elementary schools instead of some that are. There is much to learn here of how people in a particular place and time lived of human nature and interpersonal relationships of responsibility and initiative. Parents be confident showing this to your children. Adults be amazed at how good a Grated family film can be. My comment upon viewing the conclusion in my own living room Remarkable!".

I hate Hollywood movies by number Disney schmaltz stereotyped screenplays and endings and plot devices you can see a mile off... so why do I like this film? Basically the story is a true and affecting one of loyalty beyond death and the kind of love a dog gives a loving master which could easily have me reaching for the sick bucket in the wrong hands. Well directed by Don Chaffey who went on to much work on TV series like Danger Man The Prisoner The Avengers Mission Impossible etc in a simple unassuming manner which perfectly fits the low key style required to get just the right emotional punch and uplift at the end.A well constructed screenplay gets us off to a favourable start but the acting all round hits exactly the correct note. Donald Crisp is really excellent as the crusty Scotsman and lifts Laurence Naismith Moore and Curtis' boss in the Persuaders to the same level in their long running feud scenes and affecting melting to friendship through common love of the little dog at the end. Andrew Cruickshank in the original Dr Finlay is wonderful as the Lord Provost in the crucial highpoint turnaround scene. The comedy turns like the officious policeman and the court reporter who lets the kids into court are spot on. Even the kids are fine.The actors stick close to a style suitable for a Disney movie but the clever understatement helped by the character motivation not wanting to appear too weak in loving a stray dog make the unfolding story and ending carry a real emotional punch. Yes it's corny but based on a TRUE corniness and that's what makes it stand out among Disney and other! films. Beautiful colour throughout and if you've ever been to Edinburgh you will like the recreation of the old city. The music is also excellent the strings perfectly complimenting the Scottish theme with bagpipe like harmonies.Recommended for children of all ages up to 110.Get a box of tissues out for the last quarter of an hour and enjoy!".

The cast is great the locations beautifully shot and the storyline is easy to follow for even the youngest of kids. The fact that it is a true story only adds to the effect. As a Scot it has special significance for me as this little dog symbolizes our two main characteristics..loyalty and stubbornness. Definitely a wee treasure of a movie and it hasn't aged since it relies not on special effects or sensationalism just on a simple beautiful story simply and beautifully told. Definitely a good one for the kids of all ages9 unforgettable and timeless.".

The storyline is so lovely and engaging that even though at times I knew that I was being manipulated I cried laughed and loved every minute of it! The movie was obviously made in a different time in the history of film making while at the same time the story is about a different time in humanity. I felt that the datedness of the filming techniques made the story even more beautiful and evocative.The dog is a show stealer the kids are adorable and the adults are absolutely believable...Although I pretty much cried from beginning to end I felt hopeful and more compassionate towards my fellow human beings after watching 'Greyfriars Bobby' than I felt beforehand.

Poor old Jock dies and well you know the rest. I saw the film as a kid and loved the story. There are a few liberties taken but trust Disney to tug at the heart strings indeed its masterful.It is never creeky though. The film looks wonderful and it really has stood the test of time better than other Disney movies such as Condor man.The setting is beautiful and its one of the best Disney productions of all. Shamelessly sentimental but because of the winning performances by Laurence Naismith and the exceptional Donald Crisp it wins out every time. The whole cast are superb and as for that dog... it should have got an Oscar as best actor.".

People feed him well and he gets along beautifully with most everyone especially children.The film was shot in England and Scotland. Its looks very dated but rich cinematography is one of its virtues thanks to the enchantment and natural beauty of the Scottish scenario.I noticed that they often use the expressions laddie and lassie which are often used by Jock the Scottish Terrier in 'Lady and the Tramp'.Considering their roles most actors are alright. But the star is definitely the little great star. Now who can that be? That's the doggy of course!The dog is cute and utterly adorable. His loyalty to his owner in life and even long after death is worthy to be considered and admired. Despite being a dramatic film it has some fun moments. The children of the film are all nice and enjoyable.Overall a reasonable film realistic poignant. Its only letdown is the courtroom scenes and the rather annoying policeman who looked like a caricature of himself.".

In fact following the mans' death the dog continued this routine for 14 years!! Talk about tenacious...and maladjusted! Regardless it makes a dandy and very sentimental film one which is best watched with a box of tissues nearby!So what did I like about the film? Well most everything. The cinematography was unusually good for a Disney moviereally gorgeous and artistic. Also having two distinguished British actors in the lead Donald Crisp and Laurence Naismith sure helped. A few things to note First if you visit Edinburgh you can see the sites in the movie. In fact you can not only visit the pub and cemetery but you can also see the monument marking the grave of Bobby...just outside the church kirk gate. Second the adorable dog which plays Bobby is said to be a Skye Terrier but looks nothing like a modern Skye Terrier. This is because nutty dog breeders have done a lot to change the look of MOST breeds in recent years. If you went to a dog show in the mid1800s you'd have a hard time recognizing most of the breeds. There has been that much manipulation of the genes in recent years that you'd barely recognize them.".

	schema:headline " Good family film";
	schema:reviewBody "Like so many of the live action movies made by the Disney studio while Walt Disney was alive Greyfriars Bobby has all but been forgotten in the years since it was released to theaters. While it isn't an unsung classic it is a perfectly fine family movie that modern day children and adults will enjoy. Compared to most modern day family movies it's tone is very quiet and subdued which at first may put off some viewers craving excitement and high drama. But these people will probably be quickly charmed by the thoughtful pacing and calm drama. I will admit that in the middle third of the movie the story pretty much stops and there isn't really anything done to advance the plot or characters. But even when this happens the movie is never boring and has plenty of charm and colorful attributes. As I said before this movie isn't a masterpiece but it's all the same a feel good exercise that will make you happy you watched it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Like so many of the live action movies made by the Disney studio while Walt Disney was alive Greyfriars Bobby has all but been forgotten in the years since it was released to theaters. While it isn't an unsung classic it is a perfectly fine family movie that modern day children and adults will enjoy. Compared to most modern day family movies it's tone is very quiet and subdued which at first may put off some viewers craving excitement and high drama. But these people will probably be quickly charmed by the thoughtful pacing and calm drama.

The film has been remade several times even with an altered story such as Hachi A Dog's Tale with Richard Gere.The film here has been fictionalised as two local residents fight for the affection of the dog and the city magistrates taking the dog to court as he does not have a license and no one seems to own him. The children in the area rally to his rescue before the Lord Provost.Its a touching tale shot on location is Scotland however to expand the story as you cannot have the dog just visiting the grave of Old Jock it just felt overlong as the caretaker of the graveyard spars with the local tavern owner for the affection of the dog and yet when it comes to the magistrate court he refuses to pay for the dog license which for the 19th century costs a princely sum.It might have worked better as a shorter film but I feel now stripped of nostalgia kids watching this would get easily bored of the slight storyline.".

Fortunately this sweet realistic adult slice of life though certainly a product of its time is not as dated as one might expect and the tentative uncertain steps that John and Mary whose names we never know until the picture's final moments take when learning about each other should seem familiar to even Gen Y'ers. This process of discovery is accomplished mainly through talk but the viewer gets to know the two characters even better via flashbacks fantasy sequences and their voicedover thoughts. In the leads Dustin Hoffman and Mia Farrow are quite fine and director Peter Yates brings his picture in with great sensitivity. The trio had recently participated in three enormously successful filmsThe Graduate Rosemary's Baby and Bullitt respectivelyand while John and Mary is certainly a smaller film than those others it is still of great interest. Hoffman and Farrow were immensely ingratiating screen presences at this early stage of their careers and their unique pairing here makes this film something special. And speaking of earlycareer performances John and Mary also features Tyne Daly Cleavon Little and Olympia Dukakis all in small but amusing parts.

This goes so far that one time he really assumes that she sad something. She denies. How did he come to such an idea? Because he too is commenting what she is doing. However he does it differently. She listens basically to what he is saying. He looks basically how she is behaving according to a quip by Oscar Wilde.

Guessing a situation for the present means to extrapolate it into the future by using a strange mixture of logic and everyday's experience.The most amazing situations in the movies are there where one person who makes a flash is called back in reality by inference of the other person. One has the impression that the face of this person fits still to what she was thinking and not to the real situation on which she did not participate. So there is an imaginary rest on the face of the called person and this imaginary rest can influence enormously the whole ongoing situation by influencing the reaction of the calling person.This is very broadly drawn the content of this extraordinary movie played by two of America's most gifted actors. In the end we know Only then when real and imaginary dialog would coincide one would be able to change the world by words. This means John and Mary could reach by communication the desired status of relationship. But the two forms of communication never coincide and so we use the imaginary dialog in order to govern the real dialog and make it controllable.

Both characters in the awkward light of day struggle to get to know each other and often speak internally as a reaction to what they're learning. Since I'm a girl I'm a little biased to be on Mia Farrow's side. Dustin Hoffman's internal monologues show that he isn't a nice person. He judges her assumes her behavior regrets her affection and is disappointed when she doesn't immediately leave. Why is it entertaining to watch Mia try and get to know someone like that?".

Dustin Hoffman had already impressed me in this sensual film The Graduate with sound track by the talented Simon and Garfunkel. Mia Farrow did the same thing in the illustrious TV series Peyton Place. Perhaps the relation of John and Mary is less sensual but it is certainly equally daring. The attraction between them is almost tangible. Their relationship is a continuous oscillation between detachment and passion. There is a fine line between cuddling and holding someone down so they can not get away. Both of them are willing to explore the limits and to risk losing the other. Just imagine she does not want to kiss on her first date. He asks How about on your last date? Often but not always! they have conflicting perceptions and both have hidden frustrations in the closet. She has been on so many blind dates that she should get a free dog. Although they are common people they are extremely selfconfident. Moreover the film avoids a cheap straining after effect and the narrative seems credible. This makes their thoughts and behavior truly fascinating at least for me. They even create some suspense and fun. He tells her that he has bought two tickets for the theater  she has two room mates just kidding. Still the film has some complexities for the plot presents controversial morals even nowadays. It evokes the illusion that instant sex builds relations. On the other hand John and Mary are in danger of exploiting each other. For instance they exchange names only after 24 hours this is not a joke!. Depending on your own views this could make the film challenging or perhaps sleazy. It creates ambiguous feelings which certainly makes you ponder. I must definitely watch this film again.".

	schema:reviewBody "What Gregg Araki presents to us here is nothing but good oldfashioned trash! Giving us a taste of the glorious Russ Meyer reign during the sixties and seventies which is a terribly ignored field of cultcinema. Simply put this film is extremely COOL to look at! The title is very appropriate because this film indeed leads to nowhere and it's Gregg Araki's view on the subject of teenalienation. Without even trying he beats that other overrated director Larry Clark who takes himself way too serious anyway. Nowhere constantly introduces kinky and eccentric characters each and every one of them suffering from modern diseases and problems like drugs eating disorders nymphomania hallucinations aggression and even suicide! Araki even touches the more daily problems like popularity and faithfulness. The pivot in this hysterical bunch is Dark an utterly confused bisexual young man who's convinced that he's going to die soon. Dark is played by James Duval an overtalented young actor and building up a solid cultreputation through starring in other goodies like Donnie Darko' and May'. Duval also was the key figure in the previous entries of Araki's apocalyptic trilogy carrying the very imaginative titles Totally Fed Up' and The Doom Generation'. Both films that come with my highest possible recommendation as well but I'm strongly convinced that Nowhere is Araki's best and most personal achievement.  It just is a magnificent series of hilariously messed up conversations and actions leading towards a truly insane anticlimax. I can easily imagine that mainstream filmaudiences will absolutely loath this film but I'm a giant fanand Araki can be sure of the fact that his film already built up a cultfollowing by now. It's truly remarkable how Gregg Araki managed to work with such an overly wellknown and talented cast. Practically every little role in Nowhere is credited with a famous name of the young and upcoming Hollywood generation. In the tiniest most meaningless figures you'll recognize faces like Heather Graham Shannen Doherthy Stacy Keanen Scott Caan Ryan Phillipe Jordan Ladd Mena Suvari and many many more The absolute highlights however are the cameos by multiple veterans like Beverly D'Angelo as Dark's slutty mother and especially John Ritter as a religion guru on TV. You hear it there's so much to discover in this filmI can't praise it enough!".

Giving us a taste of the glorious Russ Meyer reign during the sixties and seventies which is a terribly ignored field of cultcinema. Simply put this film is extremely COOL to look at! The title is very appropriate because this film indeed leads to nowhere and it's Gregg Araki's view on the subject of teenalienation. Without even trying he beats that other overrated director Larry Clark who takes himself way too serious anyway. Nowhere constantly introduces kinky and eccentric characters each and every one of them suffering from modern diseases and problems like drugs eating disorders nymphomania hallucinations aggression and even suicide!

So when Dark finds an amazingly true moment amongst the usual Araki violence hilarity sex and clutter a moment to simply relax and hold the person in the bed next to him it rings true to the heart of experience. The movie ends in the next moment with an equally true touch. So the sooner we find love the sooner it can find its own reason to leave us. Araki's best film.

I remember showing this to quite a few people at different times and two things seem to upset people the most the bisexualityhomoeroticism and the loads of sex scenes that depending on the scene serve various purposes. One person I watched it with she thought she was an intellectual and felt it was beneath her to sit through it said there was no way this film could be saying anything important and called it a porno movie. Naturally since this film shows not one exposed genital organ or even a bare female breast her argument was ridiculous. As for the homosexual things that go on in the film I think that that makes people upset because it depicts these characters as human beings with emotions which homosexuals and bisexuals are andor because it turns them on. I love this movie for many reasons. It's very schizophrenic always going back and forth from harsh realities to gutbusting humor and sometimes managing to blend them together in a strange and equal mix. It seems that Gregg Araki was trying to defy expectations of him here and that he was trying not to make a film easily judged as exploitation. This movie has more sex scenes than The Doom Generation but they are not explicit at all. The reasons these scenes are erotic and entertaining is because Araki works with the characters and dialogue to make the sex interesting without showing any nudity other than the occasional male butt. Also where there would be so many people to call The Doom Generation garbage for its constant use of obvious profanities the dialogue in Nowhere if you'll notice was done without hardly any cusswords unless you count the myriad of VERY creative slang terms poured all throughout. And as for the gore there's one big scene and one brief minor scene. What I find amazing is that even with these differences Nowhere is no less fascinating and brutally effective than The Doom Generation. I love them both and no matter how many disagree I believe Araki is a very important skillful and versatile cinematic artist. I've decided to include no spoilers but I do want to add one more thing If you don't see any meaning to this that still doesn't mean that it is completely meaningless and without a point.".

For all its eyecandy however NOWHERE has been criticized in some quarters for signalling a curtailment of the gay content in Araki's movies there's plenty of hetero sexual activity but the gay characters barely even touch each other and there's a bizarre moment when Duval finds true love in the arms of someone who turns out to be... well something REALLY unpleasant I'll say no more. Adventurous viewers will get their money's worth but it feels like a compromised effort powered by the expectations of a multiplex audience.The movie is pointless and juvenile and silly and sexy but it's clearly the work of someone both fascinated and repelled by the subject matter Devon Odessa and Stacy Keenan appear briefly as a couple of airheads named 'What' and 'Ever'!. Araki followed it with SPLENDOR 1999 a frothy Hollywoodstyle comedy in which Kathleen Robertson enjoys a threeway relationship with the astonishingly beautiful Johnathan Schaech and Matt Keeslar though gay viewers drawn to Araki's movies by the uncompromising attitudes of his earlier achievements cf. THE LIVING END are hoping for a return to Absolute Queer Anarchy with his upcoming adaptation of Scott Heim's ultraserious novel MYSTERIOUS SKIN 2004.".

This one is so cartoonish you'd think Ralph Bakshi made it at times never letting anyone truly act simply saying their lines with smarm and bravado. This flick also represents the uncertainty that exists when teenagers go out at night.  It seems that everyone is being pulled in by the magnet of a party but the roads which may or may not lead them there are the fun in watching.  Araki effectively builds up a strong cast of aquaintances making you want to see such characters as Dingbat and Dark in everyday artificial bubblegum high school class.  The bizarre alien subplot is a daring direction to go in but it is forgiven when as the credits roll all you can think about is the seemingly endless haze of moody aura that entranced you for eighty two fascinating minutes.".

The movie chronicles a typical day of the average 90s teenager but with perspectives from all orientations and view points lesbians gays bisexuals stoners drunks the whole nine yards. The acting was excellent and the plot though difficult to see at points was quite good. The thing that threw me was the addition of the alien that apparently only Dark can see. It seemed to simultaneously interrupt and fit the story line. Conclusion this is easily one of my favorite indie films and I hope I can find time to see it again.".

Shot in the style of video clip the film makes a satire from the daily life of some Generation Xkiddies which is often too loud and too exaggerated to be really effective! However its like a small wonder not to be entertained by this movie! Even actors that I normally used to dislike in the first line Ryan Phillipe or Denise Richards dont make bad impressions! And the rest of the supporting cast is really de luxe Christina Applegate Heather Graham Beverly DAngelo Traci Lords Shannen Doherty Rose McGowan and especially John Ritter as television preacher refine this strange but quite enjoyable shot!

The good parts of this movie there are very few are Mena Suvariher debut movie she wasn't that great but I'm a fan Chistina Applegate with braces a spanking scene and John Ritter as a preist who sends kids messages of suicide.

	schema:reviewBody "I just got done watching this sorry excuse of a movie titled NOWHERE. This is the first time I have watched a movie that was so awful that it made me angry it could actually be created! I am baffled that this movie had so many big name actors what were they thinking when they agreed to take part in this film? The premise of the movie is a teenage male who is living frustrated with his love life. He is surrounded by a bunch of perverted individuals who try to act like they are really trendy and prolific but really they are a group of wannabe intellectuals. Whoever wrote this movie did a horrible job of giving the characters individuality. All of the characters seem like the same person. They all seem to be bisexual very fond of hedonism and bondage and they all act like they are on Ecstasy throughout the whole movie. Throughout this movie characters are paired of into scenes where they spanking each other tugging on each others nipple rings and taking designer drugs. The main character is always dwelling on the fact that he is an old fashioned type of guy living amongst a bunch of people who prefer to have multiple sex partners. In every scene they are in some wannabe sheik yuppie house. For instance one guys bedroom is covered from floor to ceiling with large words that read a bunch of depressing sentences that are supposed to be edgy or poetic. Another guys room has a large mural of himself holding a gun up to his head totally corny and unrealistic if you ask me. The main group of characters are about to attend some trendy party before they go they all take Ecstasy which looks nothing like the real thing it honestly looked like they were popping Mentos breath mints. When they arrive at the party they are surrounded by a bunch of pale women in tight latex or malnourished boys with body piercing and cheesy haircuts. Some guy named Elvis gets into a fight with a drug dealer claiming he sold him some bad drugs Elvis ends up killing the guy by beating him in the head with a can of tomato soup and the party dwellers barely seem to be phased like they are too trendy to care that someone just got bludgeoned to death with some can goods. Like I said I cannot understand why all the big name actors took part in this movie. Some of the actors include Shannon Daugherty Christina Applegate Ryan Phillipe that girl that played Mary Jane in half baked and the Mexican guy from half baked the girl that played Claire in Beverly Hills 90210 Traci Lords it even had the middle son from The Brady Bunch actor Christopher Knight. The only person I can honestly say I liked in the movie was the sixteen year old boy named zero he almost seemed like a believable character who didn't act all artsy fartsy. This movie is garbage. While watching this movie I tried to envision the person who created it and this is what I came up with. Some rich yuppie in Southern California gave there son or daughter a bunch of money to make a movie that they thought would appeal to the youth of America. This spoiled boy or girl must of been heavily into the raveclub scene and thought they could come up with an abstract movie that would be groundbreaking. The were given an unlimited budget and hired a bunch of there favorite actors that didn't have anything better to do in 1997. This spoiled kid thought they were a talented writer and they wrote the script in a hurry thinking they just created a script that cutting edge. They threw together this cheesy movie and decided to title it NOWHERE thinking they were illustrating the hardships of being spoiled perverted brat in Southern California. All they really did was make a movie that leaves viewers with the feeling that they wasted 82 minutes of there life watching a movie that required no creativity to put together. Anyone who can honestly say that they liked this movie must have a very dull personality and a warped perception of they people are in UpperClass California. This movie is crap its confusing and awkward watch at your own risk!!!".

Some of the actors include Shannon Daugherty Christina Applegate Ryan Phillipe that girl that played Mary Jane in half baked and the Mexican guy from half baked the girl that played Claire in Beverly Hills 90210 Traci Lords it even had the middle son from The Brady Bunch actor Christopher Knight. The only person I can honestly say I liked in the movie was the sixteen year old boy named zero he almost seemed like a believable character who didn't act all artsy fartsy. This movie is garbage. While watching this movie I tried to envision the person who created it and this is what I came up with. Some rich yuppie in Southern California gave there son or daughter a bunch of money to make a movie that they thought would appeal to the youth of America. This spoiled boy or girl must of been heavily into the raveclub scene and thought they could come up with an abstract movie that would be groundbreaking. The were given an unlimited budget and hired a bunch of there favorite actors that didn't have anything better to do in 1997. This spoiled kid thought they were a talented writer and they wrote the script in a hurry thinking they just created a script that cutting edge. They threw together this cheesy movie and decided to title it NOWHERE thinking they were illustrating the hardships of being spoiled perverted brat in Southern California. All they really did was make a movie that leaves viewers with the feeling that they wasted 82 minutes of there life watching a movie that required no creativity to put together. Anyone who can honestly say that they liked this movie must have a very dull personality and a warped perception of they people are in UpperClass California. This movie is crap its confusing and awkward watch at your own risk!!!";

If ever you're compelled to see this trash press forward to the scene where Elvis runs amuck and smashes time and again a guy's skull with a tin can so that you'll realize how silly this awful flick is. No plot no acting no ideas just a total waste of time. Fortunately it lasts only 1h15 but it seems much longer. Good score though. 110 stars".

Yet this movie coasts on the charisma of Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis and a lot of sharp and witty dialogue. As long as these two actors are talking to each other or having sex there is hardly ever a dull moment. And the reason for this seems to be simple enough. In most romcoms the actors play pretty dimwitted boring and superficial people and therefore there is no reason to take interest in anything they may say or do. In this romcom Friends with Benefits Timberlake and Kunis play fresh independent and smart people and for this reason we are interested in the lives they lead and what they say to each other. So Friends with Benefits does not have much of a plot but that does seem to matter because on this rare occasion we are happily distracted by the magnetism of two capable on screen actors who are playing two wellcraft parts.".

In most romcoms the actors play pretty dimwitted boring and superficial people and therefore there is no reason to take interest in anything they may say or do. In this romcom Friends with Benefits Timberlake and Kunis play fresh independent and smart people and for this reason we are interested in the lives they lead and what they say to each other. So Friends with Benefits does not have much of a plot but that does seem to matter because on this rare occasion we are happily distracted by the magnetism of two capable on screen actors who are playing two wellcraft parts.";

	schema:reviewBody "What I can say for Friends with Benefits is that it's a cute movie that doesn't reach it's full potential. The main problem to me is that when it starts the film is being played as satire and when it ends it's being played straight. As a result Friends with Benefits does not quite rise above the romantic material it mocks but on occasion it's funny and adorable.Actually for a while the movie is on fire. The opening is cleverly handled and is a good way to grab the audiences attention. Then for the next several scenes Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake demonstrate charm comfort and overall competence and end up delivering a couple of the funniest sexual encounters I've seen in years. What I like about them both is that they bring enthusiasm to whatever they do and this film is no exception.Around the halfway point the film starts to feel a little boring. with a running time of just over a hundred minutes Friends with Benefits is not a long movie and while it's not exactly short either it feels shorter than it should be. There are a few hints to suggest that a longer movie was intended but the Studio may have forced a cut down. In addition to an ending that feels rushed all the supporting characters in the story seem futile and underwritten. Woody Harrelsson for example can be a really funny guy but he's not given the material or the screen time to make his appearance worthwhile.The film has it's ups it has it's downs. It doesn't end up being a bad Romcom but I've seen better.".

	schema:headline " A raunchy sex comedy that starts off sweet but becomes sour all too quickly";
	schema:reviewBody "I was unsure what to expect going into Friends with Benefits at an advanced screening a few weeks ago. It always seemed a bit too close in plot to No Strings Attached made extra odd as the female leads Mila Kunis and Natalie Portman had literally just starred together in Black Swan a film that came out less than six months ago and while the trailers looked amusing they seemed to look a little too close to an atypical romantic comedy. But the film actually ended up surprising me. Well the first half at least.Jamie Kunis is a headhunter in New York City who helps aspiring graphic design artist Dylan Justin Timberlake land a prestigious job at GQ. They become good friends and after a discussion about their relationship failures decide to start having sex without the relationship schmaltz hence the titular phrase. But the good times cannot stay uncomplicated for long.Rather surprisingly the first half of Friends with Benefits is a ridiculously raunchy sex comedy that is sweeter than it is crude. The dialogue and oneliners drop at a steady pace and there is plenty of laugh out loud moments. I was genuinely surprised at just how much I was enjoying the film and how well cowriterdirector Will Gluck who knocked Easy A out of the park last year helped capture the tropes and stereotypes of romantic comedies and went entirely against them. The scene that starts the initial sexual antics is a complete dissection of the genre and seeing the film twist and turn around the familiar plot devices was wonderful to see. It made the film feel hilarious but also made it feel like it was attempting to do something different at the same time. Adding in a couple of random cameos from notable actors was a bit wacky which the trailers have ruined slightly but helped add to the humour.Except the film comes to a screeching halt just about halfway in when Jamie and Dylan come to the all too obvious realization that they may want something more. The film then becomes drastically more dramatic a lot less sweet and significantly more ordinary. Even the laughs suffer landing less with a snicker and more with a groan. Everything it does to shift itself away from the romantic comedy genre feels wasted because it falls into all of the stereotypes quicker than it poked fun at them. It almost feels like they wanted to desperately feel different and then decided to just go the safer route as opposed to sticking with its offbeat early tactics. I was really enjoying the film significantly more than I imagined but suddenly felt bored and totally thrown off by the drastic tonal shift.While sketch comedy has proved to be one of his strong suits Timberlake seems to have a lot of trouble carrying the film. We know he has the chops to command the screen and be absolutely magnetic we have David Fincher and The Social Network to thank for that but here he seems to be struggling with every other scene. He lands most of his jokes well does decently with the dramatic bits and has plenty of chemistry with Kunis but he lacks the spark I think most people will expect him to have in this role. He comes off as just okay and more amateur than anything else. He would have been better suited in the film as a key supporting player as opposed to the lead.Kunis on the other hand is significantly stronger and proves that her turn in Forgetting Sarah Marshall may have been an early suggestion of the formidable comedic talent she may quickly become. Gluck is not able to achieve the same level of breakthrough that he got from Emma Stone in Easy A from Kunis but she manages to carry the film almost single handedly. Even at the script's weakest moments she grins and pushes forward never once appearing to be struggling as much as Timberlake does. I think my only complaint against her is that she spends a good portion of the film completely nude yet ends up wearing all too obvious pasties under a white shirt in one scene. It seems more like a complaint against a horrendously bad editing and lighting decision than against her but it was a scene that made her seeminglyrealistic character feel a whole lot less believable.Patricia Clarkson and Richard Jenkins both deliver good performances but sadly feel like they are just plagiarizing from characters they have played better in the past. Jenna Elfman who I did not realize was still acting does a little better in a warm and significantly lowkey role as Dylan's sister Annie. But it is Woody Harrelson who steals the entire show as gay sports writer Tommy. He plays the character ridiculously overthetop but never feels like he is encroaching on any stereotypes. He makes it his own and is almost too good in the role. He gets all of the film's best dialogue quips and runs circles around everyone on screen. In more than one instance Timberlake looks legitimately shocked at some of the things Harrelson says and gets away with. I think the film could have only benefited from including more of him.In the end Friends with Benefits is both surprisingly well done and unsurprisingly ordinary. It tries so hard initially to be the anti romantic comedy and then just ends up falling into the same predictable elements that every other film in the genre has already done countless times before. The film is genuinely hilarious when it wants to be however and this does save it from being a total waste. But it could have been so much more.710.".

Deny all you want but one cannot help but to agree that the fairer sex will have things rough if pacts of this nature turn sour and expectedly in a movie they always do otherwise everyone will be happy without adversary frustration and challenges to overcome and provide that change in strength of character.And it is this power of the clich that absolutely calls the shots in films like these. You know what will happen but want to see them happen anyway even though you're multiple steps ahead of every character. And it is precisely these expectations that anyone would want to see covered and try as the filmmakers want it is the clichs that they find hard to break away from even if characters here proclaim very early on that romance in their world shouldn't be like an unbelievable Hollywood film but in what would be art imitating art look who's talking to begin with. And what's with the fixation about consistently taking the shine off the captain of US Airways Flight 1549 in its emergency landing onto the Hudson River?Justin Timberlake is fast becoming the busy bona fide movie star since The Social Network and continues his run with this film and In Time which will hit the screens here soon. He has that boyish charm that the camera just loves and being a real life singer meant covering a number of songs here from Stereophonics to Kris Kross made it look all too easy. Mila Kunis plays her role as the emotionally damaged girl with aplomb and shares an effective chemistry with Timberlake that makes this film a delight to sit through even if as mentioned the story's clich and we know just about how these two nice looking people will likely get together.

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know what I expected from this packaged prefrabricated Hollywood blockbuster so why did I feel like I wasted my 1.29 at Redbox actually twice that for accidentally keeping the movie 2 nights. From the beginning the dialogue was so full of quips and witty banter that the characters were never believable. The plot is basically the writer living out a fantasy of no strings attached sex which is a joke in real life because it's not how humans are made. In the movie instead of learning that no love sex is impossible the characters just decide they really do like each other I'm not even going dilute the word love by using it here. The movie then proceeds to predictably fall into the romantic comedy trap that it made fun of in the beginning. Beside many personal annoyances like Hollywood producers  writers always making movies about or based in New York or L.A. because they are ignorant as to any kind of life outside of those cities I am beyond sick of movies diluting the beauty of sex by pushing the boundaries and tiptoeing on the line of pornography. This movie offers nothing more than the eye candy of Mila Kunis. If I were you I would not waste a Redbox dollar on it.".

The plot is basically the writer living out a fantasy of no strings attached sex which is a joke in real life because it's not how humans are made.

Wow it's official Hollywood HAS RUN OUT OF IDEAS! They are so shameless about it now even. They don't even try to space them apart anymore to try and trick people! Like the Hulk reboots. At least they had YEARS separation. And people found THAT outrageous! These movies came out back to back! Here let me list the similarities between these two moviesBoth have the same plot a male and female agree to be fu buddies Both end up the same way the male and female end up wanting more Both have an actress that was in Black Swan NSA Natalie Portman FwB Mila Kunis Both have the male lead that was more famous in the 90's NSA Ashton Kutcher That 70's Show actor FwB Justin Timberlake Nsync singer Both have outrageous BETTER more interesting supporting actorscharacters NSA the girl with the glasses FwB Justin's gay friend. Both have these people be at the top of their game and rich! NSA the girl is a doctor and the guy I forgot but he was pretty well off FwB The girl has a cushy job and the guy is getting money thrown at him!This last similarity brings me to my next point the movie was unrealistic. This movie is taking place in a postrecession world. There are flash mobs new technology references to current things. YET in this movie companies are BEGGING people to work for them!? WTF!? THERE ARE NO JOBS! This was the MOST INSULTING DISGUSTING THING about this piece of rp movie! They will hire some 0re to FLY to LA to CONVINCE a guy WITH HIS OWN company to work for them. Doesn't that mean that they have to pay him more? It's for GQ magazine sure but a mag has THAT much money!? And for what!? This guy does not even do his job! Knows nothing as proved by his gay friends question's like What font did you use? This guys 'brilliant' response I don't know. Times new roman? Most of the time he is fooling around with the girl and doing other random !t!!!! It disgusts me that Hollywood does not get it! Life is not a fairy tale! People don't and CAN'T live these lives. That apartment Justin's character can supposedly afford IN NEW YORK NO LESS! even the rich struggle to get! WOW!The only difference between these movies is the person that wants their relationship to mean more. In NSA it's the guy that wants more and the girl that doesn't get it. In FwB it's the girl that wants more and the guy does not get it.Also I hated how this movie tried to be so hipster. Like it was trying to be so cool. As if they were better than these movies they were making fun of. At this point pretty much ANY other romantic comedy is better than this piece of crap! Even NSA had the girl with the glasses  so funny! While this movie's stand out character the gay friend was barely even in the movie! Also the ending was a cop out they did not admit that they were wrong! Cynical to the end! Wow what idiots what a pointless movie!".

Additionally Justin and Mila have some excellent and convincing chemistry that really supports the film along with a handful of jokes and hilarious cameos that make for some good laughs.

And Mila's mother in the movie... where have we seen her character before? Oh that's right literally copypasted from Easy A. I suppose you probably wouldn't expect anything more out of this movie than the runofthemill romance comedy but it's a solid one at that and worth your while if you're interested! 710".

Both are gorgeous  I'll give them that. But that's just about all. Their lovemaking sessions include some crude exchanges and interludes with Timberlake's slapstick routing about a male situation making it too hard to urinate normally chewing up about 4 minutes of film time. I've seen some reviews saying that the two leads had great chemistry. As far as I could tell the two were filmed separately then spliced together. In a similarly themed movie Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman had 100 times the chemistry these two did. Of course Portman is a much more profound actress than the flippant Kunis see Black Swan.Okay that's probably enough.

Mila Kunis is usually talented and Justin Timberlake has done some good stuff. Add to it the glamour of NY and sharp comedy things looked promising.I lasted about 30 minutes. I don't know how they managed turn talent and sharp humour into something so annoying. Mila Kunis came across as a fake arrogant brat and Justin Timberlake had about as much charm as a broom stick. I ended up just being irritated by a lot of things in the film. Such as when Mila Kunis asks Justing Timeberlake if he thinks she's pretty. This is Mila Kunis  voted the sexiest woman in the world for god sake. They both have glamorous jobs look perfect and have perfect blend of humour and wit...just too damn perfect with absolutely no touch of reality. Not even a hint of chemistry between the two.It's such a shame because Mila Kunis was excellent in Forgetting Sarah Marshall and her voice over work in Family Guy is brilliant. So I can only blame the director in this movie for turning her into such an annoying character. As for Justin Timberlake...bland just bland.Irritating film. Luckily Predator was on and saved the evening. At least Arnie can do proper humour.".

	schema:headline " Friends with eventually regular Hollywood clichs";
	schema:reviewBody "There is a recurring adjective that is attached with Mila Kunis's character Jamie which is used by all her sex partners to their advantage i.e. she is emotionally damage. According to Justin Timberlake's character even Magnum P.I cannot solve the case of what's going through Jamie's head when she thinks relationships. What makes a person emotionally damaged is not really elaborated in the movie. She is raised by a single mother but the quest to know who her father was is more or less laughed off. While she breaks up with her relationship with Andy Sandberg it seems she has enough admirers as Shaun White is shown as one of her secret admirer and she also has a passionate set of friends with whom she parties around. So what exactly is her state of being emotionally damaged related to? Or is it a statement that would help the director bring some complications with her friend that provides sexual benefits Justin Timberlake! That might be the case in this totally romantic comedy film.The new romantic comedy 'Friends with benefits' which does not shy away from taking a shot at mocking at every romantic comedy clichs more or less falls into trappings of the romantic genre from the beginning. Mila Kunis Jamie a corporate headhunter in New York is just out of a relationship with SNL fame Andy Sandberg while an upcoming blogger in Los Angeles Justin Timberlake Dylan is also dealing with a break up with his girlfriend played by Emma Stone. When Jamie sets up an interview for Dylan at GQ magazine he comes up in New York and meets Jamie for the first time at the airport. Right from the beginning Jamie performs all the cute stunts a romantic comedy female lead is expected to but also balances out by mocking Hollywood's take on romance and New York. Soon after Dylan moves into NY City to take up the job Jamie gets him into her friends circle and they both start hanging out together watching Hollywood Romantic comedies and mocking it. But they both are missing sexual intimacy in their lives and since Jamie is emotionally damaged and Dylan claims to be emotionally unavailable they both decide to have just a sexual relationship without any emotions involved. It's all fine and dandy till all the sex lasts for them and unfortunately for the audience as well. Once the sex dries up the movie just goes south and we are introduced to all the regular clichd family characters. As Dylan takes Jamie to his home in Los Angeles for the 4th of July weekend we are introduced to Dylan's good hearted elder sister Jenna Elfman Annie and her magic obsessed son Sam and more importantly Dylan's Alzheimer inflicted father Mr. Harper played earnestly by Richard Jenkins. The stories about Dylan's not so happy childhood is what eventually melts the heart of our emotionally damaged Jamie and they go on to have their first sexual encounter added with emotions. But these emotions are only noticed by the emotionally damaged girl while emotionally unavailable boy clearly ignores and start off a chain reaction of complications in their friendship. So this is what is served as suspense romantic complications to our audience and since this is a predetermined summer blockbuster the eye candy and emotionally hopeless couple have to get back together. How? Well with the usual Hollywood charm and pot full of clich ridden sequences.For a movie that mocked the romantic comedy genre at regular intervals during the first half of the movie it was quiet an irony that it had to use more or less the clichs from that same genre to bring the movie around its eventual happy ending. And for all the dissing of Katherine Heigl by Mila Kunis she is the new Ms. Heigl for romantic comedies. Easy on eyes with magnetic screen presence Ms. Kunis has the charm to breeze through the clichs of this particular genre of films. Justin Timberlake also provides an insight of what to expect in the future in his acting career as he also elegantly passes romantic comedy test.As for the film apart from the intimate relationship and scenes between Justin and Mila it always seems to be hanging on extreme to carry some laughs. Woody Harrelson plays its Gay sports editor part with good amount of enthusiasm but Patricia Clarkson as Mila's flirtatious sex obsessed mother just tries to be extreme and we should be thankful that few scenes from the promotional videos were edited out from the final reel. While there is another extreme moment between Justin and his wild date who tries to act as being wild in bed by licking and smelling Mr. Timberlake's armpit which neither grosses out nor induces laughter but guarantees yawn from the audience.To an audience who has seen it all in this year's romantic comedy hit 'No strings attached' which was also about friends 'hooking up' just for the pleasure of the whole act Friends with benefit has nothing new or better to offer. It glides along on the charm of its two leads but fails to hide its flaws as a good romantic comedy entertainer.For more reviews visit httpcinemadose.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " One More Climb Up The Building With Mr. Lloyd";
	schema:reviewBody "A stock clerk falls FEET FIRST in love with a shoe tycoon's pretty secretary.Silent comedian Harold Lloyd made his second foray into talking films in this very enjoyable slapstick movie. Consisting in large part of a series of often hilarious sight gags it proves Lloyd's mastery of the new medium. Quickly learning how to make sound work for him Harold firmly embraced the technology which ruined the careers of many other stars. He also benefited from using the same writers directors gag men  character actors who had made his silent films such a success.

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw the finale of this film in the compilation HAROLD LLOYD'S WORLD OF COMEDY in 1962 in a jampacked 800seat theatre.  The audience roared and ROARED with laughter and excitement.  It was the funniest most thrilling thing I had ever seen in movies I was 21 and I never forgot it. What surprised me when I finally saw the whole of FEET FIRST recently after seeing nearly all of Lloyd's silents including SAFETY LAST in the intervening period is not only how well the final buildingclimbing sequence still holds up but how inventive and funny the entire film is. There's a long sequence of Harold as a shoe salesman that's as hilarious and creative as anything in his silents and there are just no dull spots at all. The final long sequence on the side of a building is in NO WAY just a rehash of the SAFETY LAST sequence.  I doubt if there's a single gag in it that repeats anything in the earlier film.  It's every bit as imaginative and hairraising as SAFETY LAST a real tour de force.  The bumbling Willie Best is a bothersome racial caricature certainly yet in terms of comedy his unflappable casual unconcern is a perfect foil for Lloyd's kinetic actionfilled dangerous gags and he has one of the funniest lines in the picture. Keaton and Laurel  Hardy in their features lost creative control of their work in the sound era Langdon never made a starringvehicle sound film and Chaplin didn't make a talking film until 1940.  Lloyd's sound films were not so successful at the box office and a reasonable assumption would be that they too lacked whatever mysterious element had made the silent comedians great.  In the case of Lloyd at least as regards to his three preCode era films designed for sound this is dead wrong!  FEET FIRST MOVIE CRAZY and THE CAT'S PAW are all topnotch comedies and his three films that came after them aren't bad either. As with all of Lloyd this is best seen with an audience but even on TV it's a funny funny film.".

Along the way he meets up with a sweet lady who he thinks is rich but she's just the secretary for a rich man who manufactures shoesthe same ones Harold sells in the shop where he works.

Feet first strikes me as quite weak and Harold Lloyd is one of my all time favorites.Here our man is a shoe salesman who tries to move up in his business. The humor and gags drag like lead and if you have this on DVD you will skip a number of scenes trying to get through it.

	schema:reviewBody "The coming of sound is erroneously said to have destroyed the careers of the great silent comedians. Not quite true though some truth to it. Chaplin did not go fully into sound until 1940 with the generally excellent THE GREAT DICTATOR. Keaton actually went into the sound period with a final great silent film THE CAMERAMAN but problems with an unsympathetic even hostile Louis B. Mayer divorce problems with his wife and unfortunately alcoholism caused a serious collapse in his career. But he recovered slowly to be a fixture on television and in movies to the end of his career. Laurel  Hardy did better with sound than with silent films including getting into feature films. W.C.Fields also did better in sound films and so did the Marx Brothers after their fitful silent productions. After years in the wilderness due to scandal Fatty Arbuckle was making a comeback when he died in 1933. The only real casualties were Larry Semon who died in 1928 presumably in part due to the collapse of his production company after some film failures Raymond Griffith who was unable to speak loudly due to a physical problem  but would play his best remembered part as the dying French soldier in ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT and then have a great career in film production and Harry Langdon whose career toppled over his egomania according to Frank Capra. Langdon still managed to occasionally appear in films HALLELUJAH I'M A BUM ZENOBIA and did work as a gag writer for Hal Roach.Harold Lloyd found the coming of sound relatively easy. Unlike Keaton he did not have domestic problems or drinking problems that interfered with his career. Like Chaplin he had invested his sizable income into a wide variety of different businesses and was rich enough to pick and choose his vehicles. But he made mistakes in his first two films that managed to show what was no longer possible. Lloyd's comedy was the comedy of suspense and danger. Lloyd's characters whatever their social class always had to overcome death defying or dangerous problems to reach their goals. This included winning a football match in THE FRESHMAN or capturing a murderer to free his father and brothers in THE KID BROTHER. His best remembered sequence of danger and humor was the climb up the side of the department store in the aptly titled SAFETY LAST! SAFETY LAST! appeared in 1922. Eight years later Lloyd repeated the climbing sequence in FEET FIRST his second talky and his second error at trying to repeat the successful formula. The first film was a crime melodramacomedy WELCOME DANGER which was too long and complicated to be successful. The sections dealing with potential dangers were not well handled  some reversed the whole concept of sound films by having Lloyd and others talking in the dark sort of making the movie the equivalent of a radio. Lloyd apparently was trying to return to the success of SAFETY LAST! but failed to notice one aspect of the first talkie. Audiences were not thrilled to hear people in peril screaming for help. As a result the audiences were confused about what their responses to the comedy was to be.SAFETY LAST! had a natural buildup to the last half hour of Harold's climb up the side of the department store to win 1000.00 and get married to his girlfriend. FEET FIRST was also tied to a romance. Harold is working in a shoe store in Honolulu when he meets a female customer who is the daughter of the store's owner. They are taking a boat back to the U.S. and Harold is accidentally made a stowaway. He has tried to impress the girl that he is a millionaire too. So now he is romancing the girl as a rich man and also trying to avoid being thrown into the brig as a stowaway.At the end of the film the ship is in San Francisco and Harold gets off the boat by hiding in a mail bag. But he is taken to an office building and accidentally pulled up the side of the building in the bag many stories above the street. Harold cuts his way out of the bag but he is soon struggling to get to safety. Here unlike SAFETY LAST! he is heard yelling for help. This actually makes his danger all the more real. But it keeps the audience from enjoying Harold's predicament. An audience today would also resent the humor of Stepin' Fetchit here called Sleep 'N Eat as the only person who tries to assist Harold  but moving and acting in stereotypical manner i.e. when he sees Lloyd has fallen a few floors down he asks Whatcha doin' down there?. To be fair one sequence has both men frightened by a stuffed gorilla but it is not enough to undue the bad taste of the racism. Some of the jokes are definitely based on originals from the silent film  when Harold reached the top in SAFETY LAST! he got hit on the head by a machine. Here he reaches the roof only to breath in some ether that makes him woozy. He also does fall off the roof at the end and actually ends up within feet of the street pavement. It's a neat switch but it makes the climb upward seem meaningless at the conclusion.Individual scenes and sight gags are funny Lloyd as stowaway hiding behind a lifeboat and a gull lies on his head. But the total effect is mediocre Lloyd at best. Fortunately Lloyd learned from his error. His next two films were both good MOVIE CRAZY and THE MILKY WAY showing he had learned a bit from the misfires of the first two films.".

The lying may be worthwhile if she's actually the rich daughter and she can forgive him in the end. I simply don't like it for the girl. The skyscraper stuff is impressive although the rig to make it work is well understood. There are some actual skyscraper work and those are bloodcurdling stunts.

I couldn't find myself getting to care so much about the story as I was intrigued by all the situations surrounding it some real quick and the famous skyscraper climbing sequence taking two reels to get through. Lloyd is a shoe salesman's assistant told by his boss that he hasn't got the personality to be a salesman and somehow he ends up one anyway trying to sell shoes to the boss's wife while trying to impress their daughter Barbara Kent Lloyd's costar from Welcome Danger. They all end up together on a cruise ship where Lloyd pretends to be a leather tycoon and tries to keep them from seeing pictures of the real tycoon thus going around and creatively getting rid of a magazine which features the real tycoon's face. Lloyd somehow ends up in a mail sack which is pushed off a trolley onto a painting scaffold where he is lifted far above the ground unable to see the danger below him. By the time he gets out of the bag and realizes the danger he's in you're already laughing so hard and cringing for his safety that you won't notice that this sequence seemingly goes on forever.There's the always utilized gag of a shoe salesman trying to fit new stylish shoes onto a heavyset woman and the confusion of what happens when a shoe mannequin's leg is mistaken for that of a young lady who is sitting on a couch appearing to have three legs. Gags including flipping spoons ether getting in the way of Lloyd's finally making it onto the skyscraper roof and the sight of a gorilla in a taxidermist's office when Lloyd thinks he's finally reached free space scaring him back out. The tactlessly billed Sleep n' Eat better known as Willie Best is the sadly stereotypical slow moving black janitor who tries unsuccessfully to save Lloyd from his fate on the scaffolding. As badly utilized as he was lessened over the years in his career fortunately he wasn't as hideously stereotyped as Stepin Fetchit but none the less a sad reminder of a part of Hollywood history that is shameful. This is the type of film that you might consider having around just to revisit for the two reels devoted to his skyscraper wall sequence which even though you know he will somehow make it out will still have you cringing in hysterical panic. The final payoff of the scene is very funny too. Every sight gag needs a great finish and Feet First tops em' all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Harold Lloyd attempted to revisit the climax of Safety Last in his second sound film Feet First 1930 with but a limited success. On this occasion the sequence is not as effectively motivated. It also runs too long and is further undercut by the stupid stereotype played by Willie Best's janitor. The movie's plot also takes it own sweet time to get underway yet at least in the New Line excellent 1010 print doesn't bother to tell us that the story is actually set in Honolulu. There's no title to this effect. What's worse the scenery and the people all look like they belong in Los Angeles. It's not until the movie has been running no less than 30 minutes before we are told that the story is supposedly set in Hawaii!

Fortunately grumpy old Robert McWade keeps the paperthin plot crackling along assisted by Lillianne Leighton as his dumpy wife and Noah Young as a dopey sailor. Unlike some of the critics I love the skit where Lloyd is forced to hide all copies of a certain magazine and I really enjoyed the bit where he unintentionally hands McWade an exploding cigar.

	onyx:emotionText "Harold Lloyd attempted to revisit the climax of Safety Last in his second sound film Feet First 1930 with but a limited success. On this occasion the sequence is not as effectively motivated. It also runs too long and is further undercut by the stupid stereotype played by Willie Best's janitor. The movie's plot also takes it own sweet time to get underway yet at least in the New Line excellent 1010 print doesn't bother to tell us that the story is actually set in Honolulu. There's no title to this effect. What's worse the scenery and the people all look like they belong in Los Angeles. It's not until the movie has been running no less than 30 minutes before we are told that the story is supposedly set in Hawaii!

	schema:reviewBody "I love Harold Lloyd to bits he'd proved himself to be a great sight gag masterin the 'silents' and there's no question of that. The transition to sound for him wouldn't be easy as it wouldn't for any silent comedian. I did enjoy this flick it was pretty easygoing but as has been pointed out here elsewhere the greats the Marx Bros Laurel and Hardy etc were definitely the yardstick that all talkiescomedy would be measured against for the 'thirties. Harold hadn't progressed further it's evident here  but there are some good moments in it although there is a repeat of his 'Safety Last' routine. Willie Best otherwise known as 'sleep 'n' eat' has been mentioned a lot here and rightly so as there's an engaging stereotype of him. Although it is that at times of the gangly black man gormlessly strutting his way through the movie it's still funny not because of the stereotype but he lends a 'dumb ass' to the proceedings or a stooge to Harold. Calling him 'Charcoal' wasn't exactly tactful but I'm sure the people of the deep south just loved it. A reissue in 1960 had Harold dub over in his own voice the name of 'Charcoal' with 'Charlie'. Not a bad film but that's all it lost its way at times but watchable nonetheless.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like the other great silent clowns Harold Lloyd struggled to adapt to the advent of sound. This early alltalkie effort demonstrates why.Harold Horne Lloyd is a lowly Honolulu shoestore clerk who aspires to better himself and achieve his share of the American dream not to mention the attentions of an attractive woman he mistakes for the daughter of Mr. Turner his boss. But a disastrous experience with the boss's wife forces him to endanger himself at sea and on land in order to get the girl.It's the classic Harold Lloyd scenario except this time he must also contend with verbal humor that too often falls flat.His face bothers me says the boss's wife who recognizes but doesn't remember the clerk who upset her so when she meets him again on a ship bound for California.You were born bothered! her husband replies.Oh really! she snorts whereupon the scene ends in Feet First's signature flat manner.Harold himself is pretty flat too. He had a good voice but he was better when he didn't have to use it so much. His delivery here is halting. Instead of crisp movement he is stuck with dialogue that hobbles him and slows down his comic rhythm and timing.A scene where he runs around the ship stealing magazines he has discovered he is featured in the magazine in an ad that reveals his lowly status at a time when he is trying to pass himself off as a tycoon has promise. He carries a stack of magazines to the ship's rail to throw them overboard only for them to blow back on the ship. Before this can happen though we hear the wind gusting across the deck spoiling the surprise.Similarly Feet First's most remembered sequence showing Harold climbing the outside of a tall building much like he did in the silent classic Safety Last is made less brilliant by the poor man's grunting and cries for help. No doubt he did a lot of grunting in Safety Last too only you couldn't hear him. Here you are forced to notice the exertion more than you do the gravitydefying grace so impressive in the earlier film.There are a couple of better Harold bits in this movie. One when he tries to pull one of those ads he is featured in off the backside of a female passenger has her spin around and catch him in midreach. Taking advantage of an onboard musical performance Harold goes into a dance without missing a beat and executes a backward pratfall for good measure.But such scenes are few and far between in a 90minute movie that feels twice as long. Harold's efforts to avoid discovery as a stowaway come off as mean and embarrassing rather than funny. Harold was always getting into these scrapes in silent films but there you weren't required to take his antics as real the way you are here.There is much criticism of Willie Best's turn as a dopey janitor who tries to help Harold as he's clinging to a building. Best who went by the moniker Sleep 'n' Eat was a black comedian who took roles when he could find them in a socially restrictive time. Harold calls him Charcoal which is unfortunate and obscures the fact he gave Best a rare chance to do some comedy in an Apicture. Best's no more dopey than the white sailor Elmer Noah Young whom Harold tangles with on the ship but it's still a weight on account of his race not to mention that dopiness is a lazy form of comedy too often employed here.Director Clyde Bruckman like Lloyd made his name in great silent comedies notably Buster Keaton's The General and the classic Laurel and Hardy short Putting Pants On Philip. Here he seems as lost as Lloyd reworking silent comic tropes for a lessforgiving medium.Overall I found Feet First a labored exercise brightened only by occasional reminders of Lloyd's silent greatness. It's a fascinating showcase of why silent comedy was special albeit mostly in the form of a negative example.".

	schema:headline " A magnificent debut by director Sriram Raghavan with stunning performances by the lead artists";
	schema:reviewBody "From the production house of Ram Gopal Varma comes another powerful film about love hatred passion and revenge.  Ek Hasina Thi is director Sriram Raghavan's debut film but you wouldn't be able to tell that after viewing this film.  He puts other experienced Indian directors to shame with his debut film.  He even surprasses Ram Gopal Varma at his own game.Ek Hasina Thi tells a story of Sarika  a simple workingclass woman who seems to be content with her life until her chance encounter with a suave ultracool individual  Karan.  She falls in love with him and dreams of a future bliss marital life.  From there on however Sarika's world is completely turned upside down.  Saying any more would ruin the premise of the film not to mention the experience of watching it but I highly doubt any Bollywood film this year will make an impact on me the way Ek Hasina Thi did.One of the major aspects that makes Ek Hasina Thi so powerful are the performances by the lead actors.  Both of them Saif and Urmila give the performances of their careers.  Saif Ali Khan who is suddenly on a whitehot streak with films like Dil Chahta Hai Darna Mana Hai and the recent Kal Ho Naa Ho easily gives the finest performance of his career. Usually in hindi films villainous characters are shown to be mere caricatures  a snarl here a facial contortion there etc. but Saif Ali Khan plays Karan Rathod in such a subtle cool and horrifying real manner that the viewer almost sympathizes with him.  If you thought he was great in Dil Chahta Hai and Kal Ho Naa Ho you will be completely unprepared for his volatile brilliant performance here.  Truly an awardworthy act. Urmila who is getting much praise for her films in 2003 actually gives her careerbest performance as well in Ek Hasina Thi.  In most of her films Urmila tends to overact even when the character doesn't call for it.  But in Ek Hasina Thi Urmila goes through a wide array of emotions and does it very convincingly.  Some of the prison sequences are heartwrenching simply because of Urmila's act.  Also the initial scenes where Saif and Urmila meet are some of the best scenes in the film.  They share such an intense and real chemistry.  Bravo to both actors for portraying their characters so effectively.As mentioned director Sriram Raghavan gives the best debut film I've seen in years.  Some of the camera angle quick cuts stylish closeups he employs are just wonderful. There are no songs in the film thankfully which makes Ek Hasina Thi a much better viewing experience.  The screenplay by Pooja Ladha Surti is solid.  C.K. Muralidharan's cinematography is fantastic  probably better than any film Ram Gopal Varma has been associated with.  Editing by Sanjib Datta is superb.  Some of the cuts he makes are really innovative.  Finally Amar Mohile's background score is just excellent.  It really suits the mood of the film.  Ek Hasina Thi is easily Varma's finest production.  In fact Ek Hasina Thi is even better than Varma's own film  Company.  I look forward to seeing what Sriram Raghavan has to offer us next. Ek Hasina Thi is a film that should not be missed by anyone who appreciates intelligent different and profound cinema.".

	onyx:emotionText "From the production house of Ram Gopal Varma comes another powerful film about love hatred passion and revenge.  Ek Hasina Thi is director Sriram Raghavan's debut film but you wouldn't be able to tell that after viewing this film.  He puts other experienced Indian directors to shame with his debut film.  He even surprasses Ram Gopal Varma at his own game.Ek Hasina Thi tells a story of Sarika  a simple workingclass woman who seems to be content with her life until her chance encounter with a suave ultracool individual  Karan.  She falls in love with him and dreams of a future bliss marital life.  From there on however Sarika's world is completely turned upside down.  Saying any more would ruin the premise of the film not to mention the experience of watching it but I highly doubt any Bollywood film this year will make an impact on me the way Ek Hasina Thi did.One of the major aspects that makes Ek Hasina Thi so powerful are the performances by the lead actors.  Both of them Saif and Urmila give the performances of their careers.  Saif Ali Khan who is suddenly on a whitehot streak with films like Dil Chahta Hai Darna Mana Hai and the recent Kal Ho Naa Ho easily gives the finest performance of his career. Usually in hindi films villainous characters are shown to be mere caricatures  a snarl here a facial contortion there etc. but Saif Ali Khan plays Karan Rathod in such a subtle cool and horrifying real manner that the viewer almost sympathizes with him.  If you thought he was great in Dil Chahta Hai and Kal Ho Naa Ho you will be completely unprepared for his volatile brilliant performance here.  Truly an awardworthy act. Urmila who is getting much praise for her films in 2003 actually gives her careerbest performance as well in Ek Hasina Thi.  In most of her films Urmila tends to overact even when the character doesn't call for it.  But in Ek Hasina Thi Urmila goes through a wide array of emotions and does it very convincingly.  Some of the prison sequences are heartwrenching simply because of Urmila's act.  Also the initial scenes where Saif and Urmila meet are some of the best scenes in the film.  They share such an intense and real chemistry.  Bravo to both actors for portraying their characters so effectively.As mentioned director Sriram Raghavan gives the best debut film I've seen in years.  Some of the camera angle quick cuts stylish closeups he employs are just wonderful. There are no songs in the film thankfully which makes Ek Hasina Thi a much better viewing experience.  The screenplay by Pooja Ladha Surti is solid.  C.K. Muralidharan's cinematography is fantastic  probably better than any film Ram Gopal Varma has been associated with.  Editing by Sanjib Datta is superb.  Some of the cuts he makes are really innovative.  Finally Amar Mohile's background score is just excellent.  It really suits the mood of the film.  Ek Hasina Thi is easily Varma's finest production.  In fact Ek Hasina Thi is even better than Varma's own film  Company.  I look forward to seeing what Sriram Raghavan has to offer us next. Ek Hasina Thi is a film that should not be missed by anyone who appreciates intelligent different and profound cinema.";

	schema:reviewBody "Ek Hasina Thi is a wonderfully absorbing film. It is gritty realistic gripping and it successfully adopts the style of Ram Gopal Varma's filmmaking. This thriller develops at a taut pace starting as a simple romance and later gradually growing in suspense with its shocking proceedings. It is about a young independent woman Sarika Urmila Matondkar who falls for a young suave man Karan Saif Ali Khan who is actually not the one he appears to be. Unexpectedly her world is turned upside down when she finds herself jailed because of him. That's how the story of her hardening begins when toughened by prison life she gets determined to take revenge. The film does not have any unnecessary subplots it avoids melodrama it is relatively short it has no songs and all these elements contribute to its authenticity and suspenseful mood also aided by its fantastic background score brilliant dialogues and superb cast.Urmila Matondkar is one of the finest and most versatile actresses in India. But in spite of having attained nationwide fame she is still extremely underrated. It may be because she stepped into a new kind of cinema in order to satisfy her artistic hunger and show her exceptional acting abilities. In Ek Hasina Thi Urmila stars as Sarika Vartak but although she plays one character she actually plays two different women. She is first a gentle and simple classworking woman who after being deceived by a man turns into a merciless calculating and almost sadistic avenger. The complexity of this challenging character arc is astounding and there is not a single false note in the way Matondkar portrays this deeply troubling transformation. She is thoroughly relatable real and compelling handling the toughest and most brutal moments with depth authenticity and unsettling intensity. This is a performance to remember.Quite obviously the rest of the cast are here only to support Urmila but they include a host of talented actors all of whom do well. Saif Ali Khan is very impressive in this villainous turn. This is one of his most restrained acts and his serious character comes as a pleasant surprise after all the comic lighthearted and womanising characters he had played before. Seema Biswas can always be counted on to deliver a credible performance and that's what she does as Malti. She creates a tough screen persona which is appropriately intimidating. Pratima Kazmi is superb as the powerful yet compassionate prisoner Pramila. In conclusion Ek Hasina Thi is a great dramatic thriller which is enjoyable unconventional and thoroughly fascinating. The film has some disturbing moments and many moments of relief and joy. The ending is also one of the most unusual you will see in a Hindi film. One of the best Indian films of 2004.".

However toughened by prison life Sarika manages to escape and takes revenge.Progressing somewhat slowly during the first 15 minutes but then gaining momentum at an increasing pace this movie never slows down and manages to keep your interest for the full duration which at only 120 minutes is significantly less than most Bollywood movies. There are also no disruptive song or dance sequences that would distract you from the plot.In fact one of the problems that I have with this movie is that it is a bit too short  in particular the prison sequence seems rushed Sarika's character development from the innocent naive girl to the tough coldblooded killer is not fully developed and feels a bit sudden as a result.My second problem is with the ending which while not inappropriate feels a bit out of line with her previous revenge strategy. It still works fine but one feels that it could have been built up better.Other than that however there are no obvious problems with the plot and acting is good from most main and supporting actors. Seema Biswas in particularly stands out in her role as the determined female police officer in pursuit of Sarika.Definitely worth watching and much better than anything Hollywood USA has produced in this genre in a long time.".

Is it really that easy? Finally Ram Gopal Verma's penchant for introducing threatening and mysterious characters that turn out to be harmless and irrelevant the neighbour Kamdar and the talent scout is getting old.Even with its flaws EHT deserves a high rating.

The cinematography by Muralidharan direction by Sriram Raghavan and the sounds by Dwarak are top class. From the cast Saif Ali Khan Urmila and Seema Biswas are outstanding. This has to be one of the finest performances by both Saif and Urmila in main roles. It was really surprising to see how on hell Sarika urmila could ever get into her jail terms. Her times in the jail are almost like the role of Stallone in LockUp. One never expects hardcore stuff from hindi films yet this one has some of the most intense timescale scenes in it. I wonder how this Urmila who gyrated her way with Rangeela could ever get into the skin of the role that she plays in this film which requires her to bring in physical encounters with jailmates and so on! The suspense is brilliantly held by the screenplay and background sounds. It was the ending that could have got a better editing. It can be clearly seen how the story loses its way towards the end. This one is for those who can appreciate intelligent and deep films by grasping the psyche of the characters in it. The direction is first class and if RGV can rope in such directors into his team the indian film industry has got an invaluable producer with it. It really amazes to know that while other Directors struggle hard to set up a team of actors in the cast Ram Gopal Varma manages to set up a team of directors along with a full team of cast and crew.".

There were times in the beginning when I thought he was leading her on and then he would parry it off with some remark! I can see how this moved him on to his landmark role in Omkara.The script was taut the film was exceptionally well edited had no songs and dances and was real brutal and honest for the most part. Yes there were some issues with the film. If you were stealthily stalking someone then it might not be a good idea to be dressed in hot pink bright orange and bright red and hardened criminals should be able to spot a closely following car. But I was not bothered much by this and other issues as I sat on the edge of my seat almost the whole time. And the director followed this up with Johnny Gaddaar! What talent! My two cents worth is that RGV should go back to production and giving chances to talented directors.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although the plot of EHT would be regarded as the usual 70's exploitationrevenge fare there's nothing typical about the fact that it is a Bollywood movie.Female protagonists are rare enough but avenging angel avatars are rarer still. Sriram Raghavan weaves an intriguing game of cat and mouse  where hunter and prey constantly switch roles.Add to this another layer of players  that of cops and robbers and you have a veritable maze of secrets and lies.Although the film follows genre conventions it does so with a sense of playful cynicism always toying with the audience's expectations. It topples various Bollywood boymeetsgirl clichs and asks us to reexamine our preconceived notions.EHT's main underlying theme reflects the evolving tastes and preferences of the Indian middle class  Prissy girl though reluctant at first is eventually seduced by mysterious stranger who delivers her deep dark fantasy  escape from a safe and mundane existence but at the ultimate price  her very freedom. Death drive overdrive.Possibly the most fascinating aspect of the film though is the undercurrent of masochism that runs through it. Sarika is submissive conformist and physically weak and defenseless. Even her beauty is a liability and is more than once cause for undue attention.She is always confined repressed  first by convention and culture and later literally when she is wrongfully jailed.She must come to terms with her own femininity sexuality and only then can she be liberated. Although her metmorphosis in the film is not entirely believable that's the general idea.Though Sarika is the submissive party in the first half and is constantly victimized physically and emotionally the tables are turned in the end when the dominant Karan is tied up in the cave  a return to the womb as it were and left to be devoured by ravenous rodents  messengers of the wrathful goddess herself.But the film is far from being some kind of feminist diatribe. This is still Bollywood.The cat and mouse scenario perpetuates itself in all sorts of interesting ways. In probably the most memorable scene in the film Karan and Sarika engage in a game  of questions and answers of truth and lies a sort of icebreaker. This is in fact a piece of a bigger puzzle  a larger game they seem to enacting  one of roleplaying  Karan as the mysterious predator Sarika as the poor defenseless damsel.Another interesting scene occurs when after flying the coop Sarika sees Karan in the arms of another girl and her reaction is one of agony and loathing  totally understandable  however the context renders it ambiguous. Is the emotion the result of being betrayed and falsely imprisoned or being twotimed by another woman? Moments like these elevate the film from being mere revenge play.EHT is not perfect  it has pacing issues and even comes close to imploding in the third act with a hastily assembled climax but it's assured sense of direction and strong performances by the lead and supporting cast save it from selfdestructing.But my main complaint has little to do with plot machinations. The film provides a great canvas for tackling taboo topics like sexual dynamics gender roles etc. and even takes a stab at them every now and then but it fails to draw blood. It feels like the film is holding back for some reason.Although EHT's subversive potential is largely untapped Sriram Raghavan is clearly a talent to watch out for. I for one am curious to see what he comes up with next.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ram Gopal Varma and his cadre of Film Makers are respected and feared at the same time by the Mumbai Film Industry which is comprised of three factionsthe older Yash Chopra's who have lost touch and they are the dinosaurs of the Industry. The younger crowd the likes of Johar clearly have prostituted their talent by falling into the fishnet thrown by the likes of SRK whose motive is selfish and enriching at the expense of the Industry. Then there is the middle ground the likes of Ram Gopal Varma Vikaram Bhatt and Nagesh Kukunoor who have the courage and conviction but they and their actors are chastised and black listed by the SRKJohar crowd. I will see any movie from the RMG Banner with some reservation like Dharna Mana Hai which is more an aberration than norm. The best movies the Banner has produced were Mai Madhuri Dixit Banna Chaahte Hoon Bhoot Company and Ab Taak Chappan. This movie is in the lines of Teen Dewarien by Kukanoor with a starking and violent female prison infested with gangs who prey on the new entrants like locusts nothing different from a male prison but more vicious. Prison movies are never a Commercial success since there are not located on the slopes of Switzerland where the main leads can dance to a 24 piece orchestra conducted by a Malik or a Rahman. Urmila Matondkar who is a discovery of Ram Gopal Varma has given an impeccable performance in a movie that the other actresses would shun away from. Saif Ali Khan who is one of the better actors with the last name Khan has done a superb job. The thing that stands out with this actor is his diction with a voice fit for an actor unlike Salman Khan who delivers his dialog like an obscene phone call. This movie is testament to the belief that good actors invariably end up with good directors or the other way around as in this case Sriram Raghavan. The movie is spell binding with great authenticity of the prison scenes. This is one of the movies you derive pleasure from watching instead of the false sense of satiety of watching the the filth that is delivered in the name of cinema most of them dtarring the ugly Sharukh Khan Salman Khan and Amir Khan.".

Charged under the Maharashtra control of organised crime act Sarika finds herself in jail. Karan assures Sarika that he will get her out very soon. But a tough as nails lady cop is determined to break Sarika. Prison thrown in with a bunch of hardened women Sarika has to kill the person she once was and discover herself anew. That is why the film is called Ek Hasina Thi and she really was looking beautiful with her long hair but when she cut it in jail then she was looking like a different person. The running length was far too long although it was about 140 minutes and with only one song but still it could of been cut down to about 90 minutes. The first half was straight forward then it got slow in the second half. Overall it is OK to be watched once and I can not watch it again.".

	schema:headline " Good thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Although most of Ram Gopal Verma's movies are not officially directed by him still they carry the Verma stamp all over.Ek Hasina Thi fortunately falls in the really good movies section. It is different and good.SarikaUrmila is an independent working girl in Bombay. She works in a travel agency and stays alone in an apartment. One day a handsome young man Karan Saif Khan bumps into her and tries to be over friendly. After initial mood swings both hit it off and become really close. One day Karan flies to another city and tells Sarika to entertain one of his friends. To Sarika's horror it turns out that Karan's friend was a gangster who is killed in encounter but not before leaving a suitcase at Sarika's place. When the police raids her house they find the suitcase filled with weapons and money and Sarika is arrested.Now starts a thrilling game as Sarika is thrown into prison and she comes in touch with several hardcore criminals. She realises that Karan is the man behind all this and swores revenge. She gets out of the jail and takes her revenge in style.A topic like this where the leading heroine is wronged by a aman and she takes her revenge were the subject of films like Insaaf Ka Taraazu Anjaam and Gumraah. However the difference here is that she is not wronged by an out and out villain but by a man whom she loves and trusts. In early 80's there was a film called Durga where Hema Malini is shown to be madly in love with Raj Babbar and she loses her honour to him who cheats her leading her to revenge. But while Durga was a potboiler Ek Hasina Thi is a very slickly made movie where there are no stereotypes. After watching the movie I am also relieved that the movie is NOT a remake of Double Jeopardy. It has some portion inspired by it and thats it.The film has a good story and a reasonably good screenplay. The editing is good but after the thrilling first half the second half looks a bit drag specially towards the end. The direction by debutant Sriram Raghavan is engrossing. The movie like most recent Ram Gopal Verma's movies is technically brilliant. The cinematography is brilliant and the camera effects at places really makes an impact. The sound quality is also excellent.Like Bhoot even the titles look straight out of a good Hollywood production. Had there been a little more attention in the second half Ek Hasina Thi would have been a much better film. The best scenes of the film are the ones shot in the jail. Although we have seen 3 Deewarein read my review which was based on jail but Ek Hasina Thi provides insight in a female prison like never before. Although female prisons have been shown in a good manner in Gumraah and in a horrible way in the disastrous AnjaamEk Hasina Thi really thrills you in the realism of jail life. I really admire the director of creating fear in the audience in a jail without showing a molesting villain or an over the top woman. The look is real and at times even scary. Even in the most filmy scene where Urmila fights the jail bullyya even I was reminded of Kaaliathe fight looks real and well enacted.Shahrukh Khan has eaten his words many times. After Baazigar and Darr although Anjaam floppedhe said that noone can play negative roles like he has done. After that Arbaaz Khan in DaraarNana Patekar in AgnisakshiAkshaye Khanna in Humraaz and recently Ajay Devgan first in Deewangee and then in Khakeeread my review have proved him wrong. His contemporaries Aamir played an underplayed negative role to perfection in Earth1947 and Salman Khan created ripples with his obseesive lover act in Tere Naam. Still Shahrukh Khan had never imagined in his life that someone as good looking and charming like Saif Ali Khan can play a negative role and that too in style. I guess that sums up what Saif has done in this movie.His character really catches u when he plays the wicked question and answer game with Urmila.However after that the focus shifts to Urmila and Saif seems to play yet another playboy role.But towards the end in the scene where he discovers the truth about Urmila and questions her Saif looks menacing and gets into the skin of the character. If he surprised me by playing an urbane patriotic soldier to perfection in LOC he surprised me gain by his bad guy act. I canno say that Saif has given the best negative performance in recent times but I can definitely say that the way he has portrayed a mean manit is really very very different from any negative role in recent time. Needless to say that he looks dashing in designer wears with a stubble on his face. Urmila delivers yet another ace performance after Bhoot.Although in some scenes towards the end she tries and act the way she did in Kaun and Pyaar Tune Kiya Kyamuch to my irritationBut otherwise she shows her acting talent once gain.Her expression and dailogue delivery in the prison scenes shows that Urmila is capable of delivering the goods if she has Verma by her side.Seema Biswas is brilliant as the lady police officer. There are many regukar actors of Verma's movies and all fit in their respective roles. Overall a good movie.".

Urmila delivers yet another ace performance after Bhoot.Although in some scenes towards the end she tries and act the way she did in Kaun and Pyaar Tune Kiya Kyamuch to my irritationBut otherwise she shows her acting talent once gain.Her expression and dailogue delivery in the prison scenes shows that Urmila is capable of delivering the goods if she has Verma by her side.Seema Biswas is brilliant as the lady police officer. There are many regukar actors of Verma's movies and all fit in their respective roles. Overall a good movie.";

Urmila and Saif are a total pleasure to watch!

	schema:reviewBody "In recent years more and more Indian films are making their way to America. Just a decade or so ago they were practically impossible to find. Now Netflix Hulu and even local cable channels carry Indian films. While they are not yet commonly watched by the average person in my country this is quickly changing as people are realizing that India is making some great films.Most of the films we have been getting are musicalswhich are very popular in India. Most of these are also romances. However a few films are NOT the same formulaic pictures even though I like these romances there is a certain sameness about many of them. A few of Satyajit Ray's films gangster films which I assume are VERY popular in India since I've seen so many and comedies are also availablebut you have to look a bit harder for them.One of the best of these nonformula films I've recently seen is Ek Hasina Thi. When I say nonformula I mean that it has no production dance numbers and the film is much more realistic and gritty. And because of this the film is a nice change of pace and well worth your time.This movie begins with a beautiful lady Sarika being stalked somewhat by a handsome young man Karan. He is VERY persistent and a tad creepyas he comes on really strong. But he's also very thoughtful and sweet and she falls for him...reluctantly. A bit later one of Karan's 'friends' drops by her apartment and leaves a suitcase. Soon she sees on the news that the man who visited her was a gangster and he's dead!! Sarika has no idea what to do and still thinks her boyfriend is what he claims to bea guy who's made his fortune in stocks and bonds. This is a HUGE mistake as soon the police arrive and find her with the suitcase and arrest her. And based on advice from him and his sleazebag lawyer she pleads guilty. These two told her the court would just release her and that would be that. Instead she's given a huge sentence and sent to a hellish prison. She soon comes to realize that she's been set up to be the fall girl for a very bad man...and the quiet and sweet girl evolves into a very angry ladyone who is able to kill if need be to get revenge.While I would normally say no more as it might spoil the film I noticed that IMDb's summary gives a LOT of information. So it lets you know that she does escape prison and she does plot revenge. I really really liked thisas it was exciting to see the mousy lady become a Rambolike hero. However very importantly it was NOT all action and a lot of the crazy stuff she did was believable....at least compared to many revenge films. See this oneand see the really cool ending. Well made all around.".

I have been catching up on a bunch of his old movies and so far he seems to play the bad guy a lot I would love to see him play a saint which is why I say that he owes me big time after this Urmila delivered with this movie. Her character did a complete 360 right in front of our eyes. From dunce to devilmaycarediva! I was shocked at what happened to her character initially because I did not read the synopsis before watching it but as the film progressed I was so happy to see her kick some major buttocks. It's rare to see a woman do this in a Bollywood film so here's a standing ovation for Urmila and the Ram Gopal Varma team.".

Original storylines are somewhat of an urban legend in Bollywood.

She then goes on to become the mastermind behind some brilliant schemes to con the undeserving rich out of some of their wealth and meets a fellow con artist along the way.The only reason I write this now is because one of the other people who gave their comments on this movie said something about how this movie seemed to be a lift from other movies but due to a lack of concrete evidence heshe would give it the benefit of doubt.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Game of Death' is the equivalent of having your dog swallow a gold ring  you've got to sift through the crp to find the polished stuff.Completely different to Bruce's original vision the 1978 version is hugely controversial. To some it's a shameless cashin and insult to others it's a curiosity. To me personally it's a guilty pleasure. Obviously with such limited footage of Bruce Lee to use the film was always going to suffer. Not only that but how do you incorporate the footage into a film and give it context? The standin's that are used to fill the time leading up to the Lee footage are never going to fool anyone. Even as a kid I could tell it someone else. The techniques used to have Bruce Lee on screen range from awful superimposed heads to tasteless his real funeral to fairly good quick cuts from old footage. The disguises that Billy Lo and Bruce's doubles wear throughout the film are hokey but nothing that we haven't seen in Lee's films before Fist of Fury so that didn't bother me too much.Despite some awful dubbing and a poor script 'Game of Death' is still watchable for it's action. Fight choreographer Sammo Hung makes the nonLee fight scenes entertaining even if the doubles don't match Bruce Lee's speed or technique. However they do capture some traits of Lee's fights including the slow motion finishing move. Also the film's budget allows for a number of locations ensuring that Billy's quest for revenge keeps moving. In this regard the Hollywood frills that are added give the film a degree of watchability especially the classy score which appears throughout and heightens the final scenes.But of course the main point of watching 'Game of Death' is to see Bruce in action. Although criticised for cutting down the pagoda sequence I think it still contains enough to satisfy. You have to remember that this original footage included two companions of Lee's who don't feature in the 1978 film meaning a lot had to be left out. The nunchuk duel is unique while the fight with Kareem Abdul Jabbar is bizarre but thrilling.There are some moments of bad taste but on the whole the film is a cheesy and quite fun attempt to build up to the final 20 minutes. Whether you think this was a cashin or a tribute you still need to see it in order to understand the 'Game of Death' phenomenon.".

Colleen Camp and Gig Young Costar. Camp is benign as Billy's voluptuous girlfriend and Young looks like he wants to be anywhere else. The score is excellent courtesy of John Barry's music which sets a mood for the picture. The second part of the movie is the final fight scenes in a pagoda which include Bruce Lee himself in some magnificent fight scenes with several worthy advesaries including Kareem Abdul Jabbar! and Danny Inosanto. The last 1520 minutes are the only to feature the real Bruce Lee but watch the locker room fight it is very good on it's own merit. In summary a cheesy 70's Kung Fu movie that wraps around some spectacular footage of Bruce Lee in his final performance but which also has some charm of it's own.".

The Hong Kong version is a whole lot better with extra footage It's also edited differently has all the trademarks of a Sammo Hung film project instead of one by Robert Clouse. and more Hong Kong actors and plot. It must have been a success in Hong Kong because a sequel was made from even more unused footage and outtakes of Bruce Lee. This movie is actually better than this one because it doesn't take itself seriously not as much recycled footage and the fight scenes are even better.If I were to watch this movie I would recommend finding the Hong Kong version. It's a lot better than the boring American release.Followed by the Tower of Death a.k.a. Game of Death 2.".

The fight scenes last up  to 1015 minutes total but they are so physical they probably took up several rehearsals to shoot.Bruce was filming Enter The Dragon while filming this film. He and the Directors did the right thing by filming the end first because of Bruce's busy schedule.You cant call this film an overall great action movie like one reviewer said because it has many faults. It's too too long 90 minutes and the Bruce Look alike gets beat for half the film until the Real Bruce Lee shows up at the end.Also the Bruce Lee double in this film is just plain puny looking. He looks as if he has never lifted weights.What I would have done to make the film more enjoyable is shorten the film immensely then put a biograpy about Bruce  so as not to leave the viewer unsatisfied with the film.No one today can do what Bruce Lee did in his prime ask Chuck Norris who has failed miserably copying his moves and is now doing a laughable show called Walker.".

	schema:reviewBody "POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!Structurally and historically a mess Lee's final film had the potential to be the greatest ever martial arts movie. Unfortunately Lee died well before filming was completed and his vision was never finished. However the producers managed to finish the film by taking what had already been filmed mostly fight scenes and make a story round it one based roughly on the many pages of scripts and ideas that Lee had left behind. As Lee's original story was so complex though and probably only he could have made it the way it should have been the finished product is a mere shadow of the what was in Lee's head.The story sees Lee's character a famous martial artist and actor faking his own death so that he can uncover the corruption of those who had previously tried to kill him. Not even his girlfriend is aware that his death was a fake. As the film progresses Lee stalks the bad guys his girlfriend gets suspicious and Lee reaches a pagoda where he must overcome the trials of each floor in order to reach the top and fulfill his revenge. Lee's original script focused much more on the Pagoda scenes with each floor showcasing a different martial arts style that Lee must overcome using his own 'way of no way' style. With each floor completed he would achieve a higher level of spiritual and fighting skill.The fight scenes are easily some of the best ever filmed skillfully thought out and beautifully directed and noone since has been able to capture the technique skill or intensity of Lee. The other fight scenes are also good including the motorcycle scene and Shower room fight. If anyone has any of the Hong Kong Legends DVDs they feature many deleted scenes the Game of Death one being particularly good The glass house fight is a classic.The actors brought in to finish shooting are unsure of themselves which comes across on camera but this is understandable considering they were finishing a film starring a man who had died years before. The music is excellent the story messy but the fights stand out. The overall tone of the film is dark and ominous as Lee's character is almost killed mysteriously then fakes his own death and the ending is not conclusive. Footage of Lee's own funeral is used adding to the tone. However it is a vital piece of work for any fan of Lee and should be remembered for its ideas if not for how it eventually turned out to be. 7 out of 10".

However the producers managed to finish the film by taking what had already been filmed mostly fight scenes and make a story round it one based roughly on the many pages of scripts and ideas that Lee had left behind. As Lee's original story was so complex though and probably only he could have made it the way it should have been the finished product is a mere shadow of the what was in Lee's head.The story sees Lee's character a famous martial artist and actor faking his own death so that he can uncover the corruption of those who had previously tried to kill him. Not even his girlfriend is aware that his death was a fake. As the film progresses Lee stalks the bad guys his girlfriend gets suspicious and Lee reaches a pagoda where he must overcome the trials of each floor in order to reach the top and fulfill his revenge. Lee's original script focused much more on the Pagoda scenes with each floor showcasing a different martial arts style that Lee must overcome using his own 'way of no way' style. With each floor completed he would achieve a higher level of spiritual and fighting skill.The fight scenes are easily some of the best ever filmed skillfully thought out and beautifully directed and noone since has been able to capture the technique skill or intensity of Lee. The other fight scenes are also good including the motorcycle scene and Shower room fight. If anyone has any of the Hong Kong Legends DVDs they feature many deleted scenes the Game of Death one being particularly good The glass house fight is a classic.The actors brought in to finish shooting are unsure of themselves which comes across on camera but this is understandable considering they were finishing a film starring a man who had died years before. The music is excellent the story messy but the fights stand out. The overall tone of the film is dark and ominous as Lee's character is almost killed mysteriously then fakes his own death and the ending is not conclusive. Footage of Lee's own funeral is used adding to the tone. However it is a vital piece of work for any fan of Lee and should be remembered for its ideas if not for how it eventually turned out to be. 7 out of 10";

	schema:headline " A Bruce Lee movie that appears to have been edited by Ed Wood Jr.!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me explain the above comment. In the horrible movie PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE writerdirector Ed Wood Jr. incorporated some footage he'd shot of Bela Lugosi just before Bela's death. While the footage had nothing to do with the script for PLAN 9 Wood decided to cleverly use this film and hash out Lugosi's role by having a much taller guy a dentist by the way hold a cape over his face in all the Lugosi scenes not available in the original reel of footage! The result not surprisingly is horrid. Now all of the reason for PLAN 9 being named the worst movie ever made wasn't all due to the Lugosi footage but it was one of the main factors contributing to the pure crappiness of the film.In the case of GAME OF DEATH some initial footage had been shot back in 1972 but was temporarily shelved in order to finish another Lee film. But Lee's untimely death left about 30 or 40 minutes of unusable footage. So the studio bigshots decided to pull an Ed Wood and use the old footage and write an entire movie around itusing extras and irrelevant footage to make a coherent film. Well the result wasn't great but at least it was a good bit better than PLAN 9! As far as integrating a dead guy into a movie the results were often pretty pathetic. Now I am NOT saying they shouldn't have made the movie. Instead they should have just admitted that they were using a double and not even bothered trying to fool the audienceit just wasn't possible! Having an extra wearing sunglasses inside and out just looked stupid and playing the part straight without stupid tricks would have been better. A couple other stupid tricks they tried to make a coherent film included cutting closeup shots of Lee into scenes where he obviously wasn't acting! His clothes and the backgrounds just didn't match the double! The worst case was near the beginning when Lee was supposedly almost killed by a falling light. The close up was of the Real Leestanding outside against a brick wall. But the scene was filmed INSIDE and there was no brick wall! This was true Ed Wood editing!!! Even worse was one scene where they literally pasted Lee's face over another person's face for a very brief scene! Clutch Cargo episodes were constructed better than this! Probably the creepiest aspect of all this was that Bruce's son Brandon also died prematurely while filming THE CROW and the studio did pretty much the same trick though with modern computer techniques it did look better. In addition to add another creepier element Brandon was killed in an onset accident where he was killed by a prop gunsomething that is in the plot of GAME OF DEATHwhen a bad guy pretends to be using a prop gun but really shoots Bruce in the face!!!! This is just so surreal and sick. Also surreal and sick is seeing Gig Young in his final filmjust months before he killed himself and his partner! This truly seemed like a cursed production! While I am trashing the film I may as well point out a few other things before I actually go on to praise the film. First while I greatly enjoyed watching Chuck Norris BRIEFLY at the beginning of the film somebody should have told him to shave his back hair!!! Chuck just looked like some sort of missing link with all that haira major turn off and something I am surprised made it into both this film and another Lee picture RETURN OF THE DRAGON. Second the female costar Colleen Camp very ably sang the final song in the film but when they show her singing earlier in the movie she's obviously out of sync with the music.Now apart from the MANY serious flaws with the film let's talk about the good. While a tad cheesy the overall production values were pretty good apart from the way they dealt with Leeespecially for a kungfu movie. Seeing the American supporting actors especially a foulmouthed elderly Dean Jagger was pretty interesting and the music for the film was exceptional. The opening titles were highly reminiscent of a James Bond film and the recurring strains throughout the film were very clearly inspired by the music from ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. Plus the effects and fight scenes were pretty good throughout.Despite occasionally seeing tiny glimpses of Lee in the first 23 of the film he is the clear star of the final portion of the filmthe only portion of the movie that should have included Lee in my opinion. Here he does perhaps his best stuntwork ever and the battles are well worth seeing for fans of the genre. In particular seeing Lee fight Kareem AbdulJabbar was majorly cool. It really is a shame that such great material was never used the way it was originally intended. For fans of Lee this is STILL a mustsee film but for most others it's a mixed baga lot of good and a lot of really really REALLY bad editing.FYIIn the wonderful kung fu comedy SHAOLIN SOCCER the goalie is clearly meant to look and act just like Bruce Lee. In fact his yellow outfit is a copy of Lee's in the finale of GAME OF DEATH. This was a cute little homage to Lee.".

Well it's not a Bruce Lee movie but it is called Game of Death the title Lee had intended to use for a totally different film before he died. And it's a disaster. Not only are there two unconvincing doubles Kim Taichung and Chen Yaopo who stand in for Lee but there's an equally unconvincing Kareem Abdul Jabbar double! That's right Lee's student and friend wisely chose to have nothing to do with this humiliating bastard of a project andlike Leeappears only in the climactic fight scenes. Speaking of those scenes in which Lee also takes on former studentinstructornunchaku expert Dan Inosanto and hapkido master Ji Han Jae they were shot immediately before work on Enter the Dragon began and obviously were not intended to be used in the final Game of Death project. They're interesting to watch but they are ONLY demonstration footage the choreography has a lot of rough edges. Watch John Little's Bruce Lee A Warrior's Journey to see the footage placed in its proper perspective. The rest of the fights in the film are not up to the standard of the Lee scenes of course. The locker room showdown between Kim Taichung and Bob Wall is okay but if director Robert Clouse wanted to fool the audience into believing that the protagonist in this fight was Bruce Lee and he obviously did judging from all the splitsecond reaction clips of Lee from other films that were spliced into Game of Death both during the Bob Wall fight and elsewhere he failed miserably. This is a rotten piece of work people. And I repeat it is NOT a Bruce Lee movie! In his definitive article on the Bruceploitation phenomenon in Martial Arts Movies magazine back in the '80s Daniel C. Lee included Game of Death in his filmography of Bruce Lee exploitation flicks and he was rightthat's exactly where it belongs. This movie is an insult to Lee's memory and thankfully most fans now seem to recognize it as such. Single worst moment about five minutes into the film when a picture of Lee's face is pasted to a mirror and the neck and shoulders of one of the doubles are placed immediately beneath the photo. Groooaaannnnn...how cheap and awful can you get? And no Chuck Norris is not in Game of Death so why does his name appear in the credits?

He is only in the last 10 to 20 minutes with a few cuts here and there. As others have already mentioned that was all that he had filmed years before and they decided to use stock footage and other actors to fill in the rest of the move....... about 90 of it! Most of the time you have an actor dressed up with hair in his eyes and large glasses like the kind wives where when the get beaten to cover up that its not Bruce Lee. The fights scenes are laughable garbage not good but very funny dew the over dramatic wah ta stuff. Lee's battles at the end are the only redeemable part of this movie and you should skip most of the movie to retain your brain matter. Besides for Lee most of the people in this movie are in poor shape and it surprises me that any of them ever got into any kind of gym whatsoever. Bruce lee is rolling in his grave over this one. 2 out 10 for this bomb.".

All whilst continuously hiding the double for Bruce Lee behind both big black glasses a beard and using footage from Bruce Lee's ACTUAL funeral! Like I said the movie is a complete catastrophe. However the things I do enjoy are 1. Though Bruce never really managed to explain why he was wearing that yellow jumpsuit it became a popculture phenomenon and a reimagining of it was worn by Uma Thurman's character at the end of Kill Bill Vol.1 2003. 2. Lee's footage is superior in every way compared to Clouse's and Bruce has some of his best one on one fights ever with Basketball superstar Kareem Abdul Jabbar and Kung Fu master Taky Kimura. Finally during end credits I always get sentimental because it shows footage from Bruce's earlier classics to Colleen Camp  John Barry's 'Will This Be the Song I'll Be Singing Tomorrow?'. It's a very emotional and solemn send off to the icon.Final Verdict As I said earlier the 510 goes to the stuff Bruce shot. It's an incredible end to an incredible person and fans across the globe have tried to use his footage and complete Game of Death their own way. Who knows if someone could eventually do it justice?".

Occasionally they throw in a stock footage of Lee and show close ups of his eyes but most of the time it's another actor. It's hard not to compare this with Plan Nine From Outer Space which has a Bela Lugosi double with a cloak over his face most the movie. Robert Clouse is credited as the director and Bruce is credited as the star. Bruce only appeared in the footage that he directed so both of these credits are misleading. The original plot was going to be about Bruce saving a national treasure that was stolen and hidden in a temple and there were foes he had to beat. He even had two other people to help him but their footage was deleted aside from a brief glance of Kareem strangling one of them. The writers probably decided to go with the new storyline because they thought it was more like a false story about Bruce. It had a sort of fantasy about it maybe Bruce didn't die and faked his death. Unfortuantly even when he does appear he doesn't last long. He fights a fighter in the first floor with or without nunchucks depending of which version you have. Then comes his famous fight with Kareem Abdul Jarber who was a close friend of Bruce. This is a fantastic fight scene. Even so it is edited from the original footage lasting much shorter. Then Hugh Laurie's character comes down the stairs and the fake footage starts again. You even see they throw in a previous shot of Bruce in the last fight scene. Then the fake Bruce goes after the Dean Jagger character etc.This is complete garbage. I've given it 4 stars for 3 reasons 1 It's slightly better then Game Of Death 2. 2 Bruce's memorable fight with Kareem Abdul Jarber. 3 The fantastic theme music.Please don't bother seeing this.

	schema:headline " Intriguing horrorthriller with creepy moments amidst the silliness.";
	schema:reviewBody "A fairly intriguing horrorthriller which plays like a hybrid of Jonathan Demme's The Silence Of The Lambs and Gregory Hoblit's Fallen Doctor Sleep aka Close Your Eyes has a fair few effective moments. Some reviewers here on the IMDb have complained that the film is poorly directed but I don't see where they're coming from. The film is unfussily directed but to use the word poor is somewhat harsh. The plot  while fundamentally rather silly and hardtoswallow  is at least quite unusual and helps the film to come across as a reasonably original and unpredictable piece of hokum.A psychiatrist with unusual telepathic powers Dr Michael Strother Goran Visnjic moves from Seattle to London after his treatment results in the death of a patient and a subsequent witchhunt by the American media. Once in London he inadvertently gets drawn into the plight of a young girl Heather Sophie Stuckey  an excellent child actress who recently escaped from the clutches of a wanted serial killer known to police as the Tattoo Murderer. Since her ordeal Heather hasn't spoken a word but ambitious policewoman Janet Losey Shirley Henderson hopes that Michael can find a way to get her to open up.... and maybe reveal a clue as to the killer's whereabouts. An internet geek with interests in occult history Elliot Spruggs Paddy Considine is called upon to help and he gradually figures out that the killer seems to be following the methods of a 500 year old cult the fundamental belief of which is that life can be prolonged and transferred from body to body via a gruesome ritual involving blood transfusions it is for these transfusions that the children have been taken by the Tattoo Murderer.Doctor Sleep has some very creepy moments in spite of its unlikely premise. Visnjic plays the doctor quite well he has a great soothing voice which makes his psychiatric scenes particularly believable though Shirley Henderson as the police lady doesn't register too strongly.

	onyx:emotionText "A fairly intriguing horrorthriller which plays like a hybrid of Jonathan Demme's The Silence Of The Lambs and Gregory Hoblit's Fallen Doctor Sleep aka Close Your Eyes has a fair few effective moments. Some reviewers here on the IMDb have complained that the film is poorly directed but I don't see where they're coming from. The film is unfussily directed but to use the word poor is somewhat harsh. The plot  while fundamentally rather silly and hardtoswallow  is at least quite unusual and helps the film to come across as a reasonably original and unpredictable piece of hokum.A psychiatrist with unusual telepathic powers Dr Michael Strother Goran Visnjic moves from Seattle to London after his treatment results in the death of a patient and a subsequent witchhunt by the American media. Once in London he inadvertently gets drawn into the plight of a young girl Heather Sophie Stuckey  an excellent child actress who recently escaped from the clutches of a wanted serial killer known to police as the Tattoo Murderer. Since her ordeal Heather hasn't spoken a word but ambitious policewoman Janet Losey Shirley Henderson hopes that Michael can find a way to get her to open up.... and maybe reveal a clue as to the killer's whereabouts. An internet geek with interests in occult history Elliot Spruggs Paddy Considine is called upon to help and he gradually figures out that the killer seems to be following the methods of a 500 year old cult the fundamental belief of which is that life can be prolonged and transferred from body to body via a gruesome ritual involving blood transfusions it is for these transfusions that the children have been taken by the Tattoo Murderer.Doctor Sleep has some very creepy moments in spite of its unlikely premise. Visnjic plays the doctor quite well he has a great soothing voice which makes his psychiatric scenes particularly believable though Shirley Henderson as the police lady doesn't register too strongly. The shocks are simple but effective and the film generates an eerie atmosphere without resorting to fullon gore nor falling back on the slasher movie mentality that seems to permeate too many recent horror flicks. There is a very chilling twist ending which has been called confusing in several reviews and message board postings on this site  though in actual fact it is rather clever not to mention disturbing if you've paid close attention during the film. On the whole Doctor Sleep is a solid workmanlike chiller which achieves its modest aims with a degree of success.";

	schema:reviewBody "Written and directed by Nick Willing Close Your Eyes aka Doctor Sleep is a taut highly effective British thriller that supplements its crime drama scenario with generous helpings of the supernatural and paranormal.Michael Strother is a hypnotherapist who has returned to England with his pregnant wife and young daughter after seven years living in the States. Strother is asked by one of his patients a policewoman named Janet Losey to bring his professional expertise to bear on one of her most baffling cases that of a little girl who's managed to escape the clutches of a serial killer but who has been rendered mute by the experience. Strother's involvement leads to complications not only with the highly skeptical police force who are less than thrilled at the prospect of having a hynotherapist working on the case but with his wife as well who fears that any untoward publicity might reflect badly on her husband's career. Of even more concern is the fact that Strother's involvement might also be making him and his own family a target of the killer.It would hardly be cricket to reveal much more of the plot here so I'll just say that Close Your Eyes boasts a betterthanaverage storyline intriguing characters an effective back story involving Strother's past in America and enough genuine suspense to help us ride up and over some of the inconsistencies and absurdities inherent in the material. And if the resolution comes out as a bit flatfooted  well that doesn't wind up being too much of a handicap since weak endings seem to be just about par for the course when it comes to these types of films anyway.The prime selling point of Close Your Eyes is that it makes us care about the characters particularly Strother who elicits our interest and sympathy from the start. Goran Visnjic and Shirley Henderson make an engaging crimefighting team with just the right amount of unrequited sexual chemistry bubbling under the surface to add to the tension.As a director Willing frequently interrupts the narrative with freefloating flashes of dreams memories and hypnotic suggestions reflective of what is occurring in the minds of the characters. The effect is sometimes confusing but almost always effective in ratcheting up the level of mystery and feeling of dislocation necessary for the story. The film is a bit gruesome and gory at times but the prime focus almost always remains on the character's interactions and the unraveling of the plot. This is a solid wellcrafted thriller.".

Traumatized Heather reveals a few clues under hypnosis and geeky researcher Elliot provides still more with his research into the occult. Michael however has reason to worry.

When Elliot turns up dead and Heather is kidnapped for a second time Michael and Janet have little time left to discover the whereabouts of an ancient church...one of ten whose locations form a perfect pentagram on the map.If you're looking for a fast paced splatter fest filled with gore and excitement and gunfire skip this film. If you can appreciate a slow moody thoughtful psycho drama with a low budget and lots of good performances this film is for you. There's plenty of violence don't get me wrong. A hideous evisceration and a hungry rat make their appearance but the camera mercifully looks away. For people with morbid imaginations it is still a difficult scene to watch as is the squirminducing lobotomy scene which fans of the film Session 9 will find familiar. The performances are great particularly by Goran Visnij as the insomniac Michael who rarely smiles and always looks slightly haunted. He nevertheless seems to be a good husband to Miranda Otto Eowyn from LOTR as his heavily pregnant and hormonally irritable wife Clara. Miranda's American accent is flawless and she looks great. Her performance is totally believable. Shirley Henderson Moaning Myrtle from the Harry Potter films as Janet and Fiona Shaw Petunia Dursley also from HP as the creepy Catherine Lebourg are both almost unrecognizable turning in stoic tightlipped performances which are perfect. Despite a somewhat predictable and downer ending this film at least tries to be original and intelligent. The special effects used during the hypnosis scenes are clever and colorful and the mood throughout is heavy with dread. This is a good little film with strong performances but it's not for everyone. Fans of mainstream horror may be bored silly but fans of films such as the aforementioned Session 9 and the Chinese ghost story The Eye may enjoy this one as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER ALERT This group of cultists have been kidnapping young girls in and around London and after giving them a blood transfusion tattooing them. It turns out that little Heather Sophie Stuckey somehow escaped her captors but has since become unable to speak. Heather ended up spending all her time in a London Police safehouse staring aimlessly at the TV.It's when London lady cop Janet Losley Shirley Henderson was being treated to stop her from smoking that she in her subconscious revealed to her hypnotist Michael Strother Gran Visnjic about the comatose Heather which he in explaining her smoking habits innocently revealed to her.Knowing that Michael is on to something in that there was no way he could have known about Heather Janet literally blackmails him into helping her. Janet tries to get Michael to help her in not only getting into Heather's mind but in finding out who's behind her kidnapping and the murder of three girls who weren't as lucky as she was. As we soon find out Michael is in self imposed exile in London from the US after he cured one of his patients back in Seattle Washington. The man that Michael cured was so deathly afraid of water that he wasn't even willing to take a bath or shower in it! After being cured by Michael he then jumped into a lake that was in the early spring thaw too cold to take a dip in. This had the poor guy lose consciousness from a severe case of hypothermia and drown! With him now being forced to solve the socalled Tattoo Murders Michael now feels he can redeem himself not knowing that he's about to become the killer's latest victim.Extremely muddled story about this cult leader Francis PaladineJohn Rogan who's over 500 years old and uses the lifeblood of his victims like Draculato keep himself alive forever.

It turns out that little Heather Sophie Stuckey somehow escaped her captors but has since become unable to speak. Heather ended up spending all her time in a London Police safehouse staring aimlessly at the TV.It's when London lady cop Janet Losley Shirley Henderson was being treated to stop her from smoking that she in her subconscious revealed to her hypnotist Michael Strother Gran Visnjic about the comatose Heather which he in explaining her smoking habits innocently revealed to her.Knowing that Michael is on to something in that there was no way he could have known about Heather Janet literally blackmails him into helping her. Janet tries to get Michael to help her in not only getting into Heather's mind but in finding out who's behind her kidnapping and the murder of three girls who weren't as lucky as she was. As we soon find out Michael is in self imposed exile in London from the US after he cured one of his patients back in Seattle Washington. The man that Michael cured was so deathly afraid of water that he wasn't even willing to take a bath or shower in it! After being cured by Michael he then jumped into a lake that was in the early spring thaw too cold to take a dip in. This had the poor guy lose consciousness from a severe case of hypothermia and drown! With him now being forced to solve the socalled Tattoo Murders Michael now feels he can redeem himself not knowing that he's about to become the killer's latest victim.Extremely muddled story about this cult leader Francis PaladineJohn Rogan who's over 500 years old and uses the lifeblood of his victims like Draculato keep himself alive forever. Michael puts his life on the line to get to the bottom of the Tattoo Murders only to end up on a slab with his blood being drained out by the mad Francis Paladine himself.

	schema:reviewBody "After a promising start that sees our hero look into a female patient's mind whilst she is under hypnosis this psychodrama quickly degenerates into the realms of familiarity and becomes a rather turgid and dull thriller. The story follows that of Michael Strother Goran Visnjic a hypnotist that can also read minds. While treating a patient Shirley Henderson for smoking one day he has a vision of a young girl drowning and we later find out that she is the only escaped victim from a serial killer known as 'The Tattoo killer'. Naturally Michael gets drawn in to help the police with their investigation.A film like this has no end of possibilities for imaginative and exciting sequences but the movie features very little of them. The best scene...and only good scene really comes from the death of one of the central characters which is one of the most disturbing and painful I have ever seen an incision is made in his chest and then while he's still alive a live rat is inserted into the hole. The thoughts you could have about that are endless! The film does have a good aspect in that there is a lot of tension. Even though the characters are underdeveloped and we don't ever really feel the need to care for them the film piles on the tension and some scenes are literally nailbiting. Notice I said 'some scenes' though...for every time it works there's another time where it didn't.Doctor Sleep is a film that was funded by the BBC which is ironic as it feels very much like one of those drama series' that the BBC puts out. The director Nick Willing is also the genius behind two other made for TV outings remakes of Alice in Wonderland and Jason and the Argonauts. But it's not his direction that makes this feel like madeforTV it's the acting that does it. For the most part it's awful! The actors don't look or sound like they are putting in any effort at all and most of their voices sound very put on. The ensemble of actors that have been put together is a mixed bag indeed. Goran Visnjic stars and he's not bad. He's never brilliant but at least he's believable. Starring opposite him is Shirley Henderson. Her performance is the worst in the movie and maybe one of the worst ever. She's a goodlooking lady but she can't act. Paddy Considine who you may remember from the overrated In America appears for a little while and he's not bad and Miranda Otto the most impressive lady in Lord of the Rings is very much wasted. The script is also of note in this film. Of note for being really bad that is. It feels at times like it has been written by a couple of eight year olds. No that's unfair a couple of eight year olds and a monkey a clever monkey even as stupid ones don't know how to write. Some of the things that the characters say are absolutely ridiculous and totally unrealistic such as the exchange between Goran and the gasman and the episode of about 5 minutes where it seems the scriptwriters have tried to give Shirley Henderson as many swear words as possible to say.It's a shame overall as this could have been a decent thriller to rival the big American ones had they have chosen a better lead actress hired a professional scriptwriter been more imaginative and not had the whole thing feel like a poor madeforTV movie.... oh well.".

One other reviewer thought this was a prelude to a sequel. I really doubt that but it's a shame that it's unlikely... not now that 9 years have passed. The hero's abilities would be a good hook for additional films or a TV series. A proper hypnotist should encourage and enlighten and so he does. We're given enough to make us want more of the hero.Close Your Eyes has some reasonable action good acting a unique plot enough surrealism to keep you guessing. Downside is some predictability. Well you can't have everything. If some of the flaws were cleared I'd boost my rating to 8 or 9. As it is it's decent film... it's not a bad 100 minutes spent. Frankly I'd like to see more.

It appears that when he hypnotizes someone he can see inside the visualization he is leading his clients through. Sometimes their own memories of traumas surface inside their visualizations and consequently when a policewoman comes in a difficult case of hers surfaces. She more or less blackmails him into helping her.A young girl doesn't speak anymore. She has at least one occult tattoo on her that was put on her by a kidnapper. Other children with similar tattoos had showed up dead but she apparently escaped somehow. The hypnotist and the policewoman also use the expertise of a toy model shop owner who is widely read in the occult.The movie was pretty good.

Walter Matthau had been seen in lots of supporting roles before but as Paul Manning the bored husband looking for ways of having fun on the side he is wonderful. The same could be said about Robert Morse who had been on the New York stage and in other movies. Mr. Morse makes a fantastic contribution with his take of Ed Stander the man who knew about how to go after the women he wanted without regard of the consequences.Ed Stander puts a bug in Paul Manning's brain about how to have fun away from home. The only thing is Paul is a man with a normal marriage with an adoring wife who would not even contemplate in reciprocating what he is trying to do if he follows Ed's advice.The other amazing thing in the film is the different vignettes that are seen throughout the movie. Some of the best and most accomplished actors working in Hollywood have a small part in cameo appearances that illustrate points that Ed would like Paul to put into practice. This way we get to see actors of the caliber of Lucille Ball Art Carney Jack Benny Joey Bishop Louis Nye Jayne Mansfield Phil Silvers and others playing the dreamlike sequences.A Guide for the Married Man is a film worthy of our time since it takes us back to a more innocent period. Thanks to Mr. Kelly's inspired direction the film will always be a favorite of mature fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "A GUIDE FOR THE MARRIED MAN is a period piece a relic of a time gone by. It is set in a brief American era of the 1960s when sophistication was marked by the threemartini lunch where male wit and style were drawn from the pages of Playboy and where the war between men and women was a naughty little game played as part of The Good Life in suburbia not a cultural one fought in the board rooms and the court rooms. Every bit as artificial in its glib amorality as a Norman Rockwell painting is in its ambiance of homey traditionalism A GUIDE FOR THE MARRIED MAN is about adultery not as a thoushallnot commandment but as a sporting event. And though it views adultery as a dangerous game not without its risks A GUIDE also views it as a male challenge that must be met because in the words of one character she's there!Structurally the film is an oldfashioned throwback to the days when a studio would concoct a movie designed to showcase its stars in bitesize appearances either in musical fauxbiographies like ZIEGFELD FOLLIES and NIGHT AND DAY or in episodic comedies like IF I HAD A MILLION and WE'RE NOT MARRIED. Considering the film is smoothly directed with assured style by studiobred legend Gene Kelly such a variety show format is not that surprising. In this case instead of putting on a show the framing story involves Walter Matthau as a mostly happily married man with a seven year itch. He is married to a perfect wife in the very attractive form of the perfectly vivacious Inger Stevens. Yet he wants cake that he can both have and eat because to paraphrase you'd get tired of steak if you didn't have fish once in awhile. To teach the old dog his new tricks enter Robert Morse as the impish married swingernextdoor to provide sagely advise on how to best weave webs of deceit. In teaching Matthau the dos and don'ts of cheating Morse offers up numerous I once knew this guy who ...style urban legends all illustrated via comic vignettes by a cast of wonderful technical advisors including Wally Cox Art Carney Lucille Ball Sid Caesar Phil Silvers Ben Blue Polly Bergen and Louis Nye among others. While all the skits are very funny a few are tiny comic masterpieces Jack Benny in How to break it off Joey Bishop in Deny deny deny Carl Reiner in You can never be TOO careful! and TerryThomas and Jayne Mansfield illustrating why adultery should never be a homebased hobby. The film skillfully walks the line between merely being a Love American Style series of comic skits and telling a gently amusing story about a man cautiously testing the limitations of his middle class marriage and his middle American values. Yes its approach to infidelity is dishonest and sexist and politically incorrect but it all seems like good clean fun compared to contemporary sex comedies that are defined by how far a film can push the bounds of being grossout tasteless and raunchy. That is the quirky thing about A GUIDE FOR THE MARRIED MAN it is strangely wholesome. There is a benign quality to its obsession with sex no nudity no profanity really no sex  even most of the bedrooms that are shown have twin beds. As lascivious as his quest for a dangerous liaison seems there is something boyishly romantic about Matthau's lust. Mildly daring for its time the film's approach to sex more reflects the innocent naughtiness of the Marilyn Monroe '50s than the strident feministpolitically correctness of the '70s. And like most such comedies from THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH to BOB  CAROL  TED  ALICE to SAME TIME NEXT YEAR to 10 A GUIDE FOR THE MARRIED MAN is all flirtation and not copulation it ultimately recognizes the fantasy of swinging only to use it to reaffirm the sanctity of home marriage and family.".

The film is a lot of fun if you don't wear the ideological blinders when you watch it. Walter Matthau is always fun to watch and Inger Stevens was of course serious eye candy. There are a lot of other pretty girls in the film and Robert Morse's character was a hoot seeing him rationalize his lust into caring so much for his wife that he must protect HER from knowledge of his adultery. The cameo vignettes were mostly amusing as well. It is light comedy so don't expect to roll on the floor but I say check it out.".

Both are married to attractive women Paul with the dutiful blonde Ruth Inger Stevens and Ed with the brunette Harriet Claire Kelly. Both have one child Paul has a little girl and Ed has a boy. Every morning Paul leave his home for work at the same time as his alluring neighbor Irma Johnson Sue Ane Langdon she of the tight miniskirt and pillbox hat. When he drives along Wilshire Boulevard in LA and glances at the pedestrians all Paul sees are nubile attractive women especially Angelique Prettyjohn in a yellow miniskirt. Suburban swinger Ed coaches semihesitant Paul in how cheating on his wife will actually improve his marriage. Surely she would thank him if she only knew but of course she should not know! And why do men cheat? Well according to the movie there are three reasons 1 latent insecurity 2 variety and 3 because she's available. Libertine Ed's storytelling of the dos and don'ts is illustrated by various uproarious vignettes and cameos starring some of the more famous actors of the time like Art Carney Phil Silvers Joey Bishop Jack Benny Lucille Ball Polly Bergen and others. For instance in the Deny Deny Deny segment Joey Bishop is caught with a gal by his wife but denies everything as he calmly dresses and makes the bed. Finally sitting on his easy chair with his newspaper he says What are you talking about? His flustered wife can only respond What would you like for dinner? The Art CarneyLucille Ball scene is also funny. Carney starts an argument and walks out to his mistress. After a tryst he calls his wife Lucille back to apologize and she accepts. Later when Paul ogles a pretty lady with child Ed says nix. Stay with a single girl he advises because if you tangle with a married person double jeopardy is an issue. Her husband may get suspicious and cause problems so one has to be concerned about both spouses instead of just the wife. There are other scenes of note that work quite well.Not politically correct by today's standards this Gene Kelly directed film cannot be made today for obvious reasons. Though risqu it succeeds in its imagination and is easy to watch. By the way that Sue Ane Langdon is something else isn't she? When Paul and Ed observe her walking ahead they call her out and tell her that they recognized her. From behind? she jests! The title tune is wellsung by the Turtles a popular rock group of the time. The noteworthy aspect of this film is that the women remain so darn sexy with their clothes on!".

If this were to be one of their last films then they can rest assured that they went out in style. Walter Matthau plays Paul Manning who is an Investment Counselor who is married with one young daughter so he is a family man. Now Paul is married to his perfect and beautiful stay at home wife named Ruth also played to perfection by Inger Stevens. The film revolves around Paul Manning wanting to fulfill some of his many passionate dreams of having extra marital affairs with the many beautiful women who surround him both at work and around his home. None are more desired by Paul than his next door neighbour Mrs. Irma Johnson played superbly by sexy Sue Ane Langdon who in this film it would seem Irma's butt received more exposure time in the film than her lovely face and charming personality.Paul receives guidance on how to succeed in his desire to cheat on his wife Ruth from one of his peers in his office named Edward L Stander played by Robert Morse. Robert Morse played the same role on Broadway as well. Now Edward has expressed to Paul that he has much successful experience in cheating on his own wife to share with Paul and the pitfalls to avoid that he can share with Paul. Through numerous cameo appearances by top rated stars such as Lucille Ball Joey Bishop Jack Benny and Jayne Mansfield to name a few Paul's coworker and adulterous tutor Ed provides Paul with his wealth of experience in how to get away with his cheating ways by explaining to Paul how some of his known acquaintances met their own demise by simple mistakes. Through these five minute cameo appearances by a list of allstars we get to see how each of them failed or succeeded with their sexual encounters. One of the more enjoyable cameos was with Carl Reiner travelling completely around the world by air sea and land to hook up with his mistress only to be caught on camera by his wife when he finally arrived to hook up with his mistress. The 1960's were simpler times but I still love these comedies that are filled with an allstar cast five minute cameos and which usually provide a subtle message to men with wandering eyes. You can dream about your guilty pleasures but if you choose to really act upon them is it worth giving up all that you have today? I give this classic film a 9 out of 10 rating and stand behind this movie theme. So sit back enjoy the film and stay true to your wife and family as there is none no better just as A Guide for the Married Man explains. Loved it!910".

More is better bigger and much more expenI've that's the idea here.EHEN VIEWED THROUGH the benefit of hindsight which is always 2020 the basic premise of this picture seems to be pretty tame by today's standard. But once we transport ourselves to the mid to late 1960's we can see just why this would have an appeal to audiences then.IN SHORT WHAT we have is a series of mini episodes about the age old sport and activity of philandering everyone of which act as a sort of How To instructional video. They are done up as short unrelated and starstudded cameo appearances by a myriad of Hollywood's best.

So too this sort of AllStar ensemble comedy could be capsulized in similar fashion. More is better bigger and much more expenI've that's the idea here.EHEN VIEWED THROUGH the benefit of hindsight which is always 2020 the basic premise of this picture seems to be pretty tame by today's standard. But once we transport ourselves to the mid to late 1960's we can see just why this would have an appeal to audiences then.IN SHORT WHAT we have is a series of mini episodes about the age old sport and activity of philandering everyone of which act as a sort of How To instructional video. They are done up as short unrelated and starstudded cameo appearances by a myriad of Hollywood's best.

If not for his many cheating escapades most importantly with Monica Lewinsky which led to his idiotic finger wagging denials this gem may never have resurfaced. There'll be those few very insecure women and a few beaten down into submission politically correct men that will bomb this movie. Foe everyone else sit back and laugh.

Jack Benny Phil Silvers Sid Ceasar Lucille Ball Joey Bishop and many more. Anyone who has seen this will tell you about the classic deny deny deny scene with Joey Bishop but there are plenty more funny scenes to go along with that. Terry Thomas has one of the funniest lines of all time in his scene with the ridiculous incredible you can't believe it most phenomenal body of the beautiful Jayne Mansfield. I think the 1st joke is that an unattractive fish faced Walter Matthau is married to a babe like Inger Stevens 2nd is that he ignores her when she strips in front of him to get into her nightie 3rd is that he would even contemplate cheating on her. It must be this way if he were married to a dog we would understand his wanting to cheat especially with Elaine Devry. Oh my what a beautiful alluring seductive woman. I can't understand why she didn't make it bigger. Robert Morse from How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying also very funny and Walter Matthau play off of each other superbly. Morse is lending Matthau advice on how to cheat without getting caught. Whatever you do don't take this movie so seriously have fun and enjoy and remember the moral of the story there is no place like home.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're looking for a decent fun little movie you can watch with your family in a relatively painless fashion then you've come to the right place.For some reason many action stars have supplemented their income by appearing in movies with kids. Maybe they are trying to widen their appeal from the hardcore action audience to the family friendly scene. Maybe they're getting too old to keep up with the pace of a fullon action movie. Maybe they have to pay alimony to 4 or 5 exwives. I don't know why they do it but it's almost becoming mandatory for these guys to take on a kid or three as a sidekick and attempt to blend action and family fare.And these attempts almost always suck.Does anyone honestly want to see Vin Diesel try to relate to kids? Or Chuck Norris the Rock or God help us Burt Reynolds relate to kids? No way. Don't even start with me about Hulk Hogan. During Santa with Muscles I was terrified that he might not see a few of the kids and accidentally step on them. Suffice to say these movies might help a star's sagging income but they're usually a mediocre compromise between two often disparate genres at best.This one is a little better. It's still actionlight but I think it works because of the star Jackie Chan. His character seems like a genuinely nice guy who wants to get along with the mandatory bratty kids. Vin Hulk Chuck Burt and the rest these guys play characters that you know would much rather be killing crushing or sleeping with the enemy. Chan doesn't have that problem because of the types of characters he often plays. His lighter presence matches up with the tone of the movie and makes it seem ....hmm...not as weird and patently unbelievable and maybe even patronizing as other movies of this kind.Basically Jackie plays Bob Ho a Chinese secret agent on loan to the CIA. He retires so he can marry Gillian a divorced single mom who is looking for someone reliable. Her kids don't really cotton to Bob though so she decides to put her relationship with Bob on hold until they're OK with her marrying Bob. Bob is saddened but resolves to win the kids and his girl friend over.Then luckily hi jinx ensue. One of Gillian's kids downloads some top secret stuff off Bob's computer and before you can say Boris and Natasha some evil Russians are in hot pursuit. After a variety of PG style mishaps Bob captures the bad guys and wins the day the girl friend and the family. And like I said it works because Jackie Chan doesn't seem shoehorned into the role.The action is lighter than most Chan movies but it is inventive and fun. The kids act a little more like real kids than Hollywood Central Casting pods. The youngest kid in particular seems like real 4 year old goofy and light hearted. When she delivered the line I don't wanna be a princess I wanna be a cyboooorg! I cracked up. I actually laughed more than a few times which surprised me. As long as you realize going in that this is just very light family entertainment I think you'll be pleased.".

Now the kids hate Chan and Gillian has to leave for a couple of days in order to spend some time with her ailing father. So who offers to look after the kids? It's not hard to see how clichd the story is but it is Jackie Chan with his creative stunts who makes this a fun watch. The actor's flair for comedy has become common knowledge and he is as energetic as ever. Moreover his pairing with the beautiful Valetta is refreshing. Valetta doesn't get much to do other than play the usual girlfrienddivorcemom of three but she holds her own. The rest of the cast is forgettable. The child actors are initially very annoying. They sort of grow on you as the film proceeds. Overall the film is nothing out of the ordinary. It doesn't even compare to a majority Chan's superior works but at best it's an amusing onetime watch.".

The negative reviews I read before seeing it prepared me to expect the worst....which in turn actually helped it to be a quite a pleasant surprise. Go figure. So far I find it amusing how some of the reviewers on here spent so much time writing in detail how awful the film is spending the time space and effort into dissecting  critiquing it as though it were the latest Coppola or Scorsese project.

Some movies are simply great because you get to spend time with your kids  the flick has a redeeming message.This movie has no sex no language and merely comedic violence. What a refreshing idea! I loved that my 13 year old boy  10 year old daughter enjoyed it  both got the message that family is who loves you not whose blood runs in you.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone with children or to anyone who is sick of Hollywood morals being forced down our throats. A very family friendly movie.Come with a good attitude. Enjoy the popcorn  a coke. Watch a decent flick  enjoy time with your family.".

This man has more charisma than any other actor that I know of. Last year he made a violent dramatic film called Shinjuku Incident and now he plays like a father character in this one! Now that's good transition into being an actor! Anyway don't want to spoil anything  it really is a fun movie. Ignore the other reviews because they are fanboys expecting Jackie Chan to fight in Drunken Master III or Police Story 6 or Project A III etc etc etc.10 out of 10 easily for me...and I yawned during Avatar!".

	schema:headline " Well... that was bad.";
	schema:reviewBody "I just got back from a free screening of this movie. I watched the trailer beforehand and I thought Wow this looks like crap. But I went anyway because it will probably be years if ever that I get a chance to see a movie before the general public does again. At first glance it looks like a ripoff of the Vin Diesel movie The Pacifier. While it does have some similarities a dude who kicks ass as some sort of government employee watching over a group of siblings while the mother is away and the kids get in danger and bad guys go raid the house it actually isn't TOO similar. This is neither a good thing or a bad thing. Either way unless you're 5 you've already seen this movie before. I will say that this is definitely a kid's movie. Perhaps my review will be a bit too harsh for this movie given the age group it's intended for but the mark of a good kid's movie is the fact that adults can enjoy it as well. Maybe not as much as the kids will but enjoyment nonetheless. Pixar is excellent at this. And even if it is a kid's movie wouldn't you want your child to watch good wellmade movies? Don't you want your child to know what a real Russian accent sounds like instead of the horribly overdone accents that were featured in The Spy Next Door?The movie starts out with some shots of Jackie Chan doing some action stunts. It was very random and it suddenly cut to him waking up. Then it cuts to another house where kids are screaming at each other and the youngest child Nora played by an admittedly adorable Alina Foley is chasing a pig around. The eldest child played by Madeline Carroll is screaming about something possibly the fact that she was named Farren while the middle child Ian played by Will Shadley is arguing with Farren. He throws in the word hypothesis to show the audience that he's the smart one. Farren yells at the mother Gillian Amber Valletta that her kids are weird. They scream some more leave the room and Gillian gets out of bed. With a huge smile on her face! It's almost creepy how smiley she is. Oh okay it's because she's in love with Bob Ho insert joke here the nextdoor neighbor who works as a pen importer. They meet for dinner that night and Ho wants to tell Gillian something because it's their 3month anniversary. But then his beeper goes off and he rushes off to capture some evil Russians. The next time they see each other Gillian and Bob discuss marriage. Wait what? Marriage? But... but... they've been dating for three months. And he's a spy. And her kids hate him because he's a geek! Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat?Then Gillian's dad who plays on some senior sports league slid into third and now needs his hip replaced. She agrees to leave her kids with Bob. While Bob packs the kids snoop around. Ian goes on his computer and downloads a topsecret file because he's an idiot and thinks it's a concert. Then a whole lot of chaos happens and bad Russian accents happen and the kids are brats and oh noooo Farren's dad left Gillian who's only her stepmom and she doesn't fit in! Oh nooooo. Poor Farren. That TOTALLY makes up for her being a complete... runt... for almost the entire film. She just doesn't fit in! I think that's where the audience is supposed to like her more now. And a cute Russian spy tells Farren a knockknock joke which I couldn't even hear but apparently it was HILARIOUS. And then some more chaos happens and George Lopez turns out to be a mole. Oh noooooooooooo. And Billy Ray Cyrus is in it. Oh nooooooooooooooo. Some more chaos happens and the bad guys seem to be winning but of course they never do because it's a Jackie Chan movie and that just doesn't happen in Jackie Chan movies 'cause Jackie Chan is a total badass.I won't spoil the ending for all you fine folks but if you watch the first 15 minutes you know what happens anyway. Spoiler alert Bob Ho's real name isn't Bob! OMG I know! A spy with a fake name? Soo outlandish.Edit I was reading some other reviews of this film just for kicks and I noticed 2 reviews defending the movie because not every movie is a Dark Knight. How is this a defense? Chastising people for giving a negative review for a movie because you assume that they were expecting something on par with a movie that the general public gets their pants wet over is quite immature. Of course we with the negative reviews were not expecting some masterpiece. The plot itself screams its inferiority at all who listen. But as countless of filmmakers have shown in the past and will continue to show it is possible to make a great enjoyable movie without people walking out of the theatre going That was a masterpiece! The Spy Next Door makes little to no attempt to even be a good movie. It's all recycled drivel with nothing remotely original about it. And for anyone going If you didn't like it so much why are you wasting your time nitpicking it? Well maybe it takes YOU a long time to type up a review but this is being done in about 2 minutes' time during which I am multitasking by listening to a song and eating breakfast as well as saving whales and giving Congress some helpful suggestions regarding health care and the climate change issue. I'm also playing Fur Elise on the violin while doing a wheelie if it helps get across what little effort it takes to type a review.".

Jackie Chan plays Bob Ho a man with as much personality as his any of his past heroes which tend to be cop  secret agent belonging to the Hong Kong  Chinese police  spy agency and here he's on loan to the CIA because of warming SinoUS relations. For years he's been helping out and solving what the Americans cannot keeping in line with Hollywood's trend of putting China in good light and he does so undercover and under fake glasses living next to a divorce played by Amber Valletta whom he fancies and her three kids.They do not know his identity as his cover is as a geeky pen salesman and like any super hero film has to keep his identity abilities and tools a secret which you know will be threatened for exposure as he grows closer to the family wanting to take his relationship with Valletta's Gillian to the next step and working toward seeking acceptance from her children only for a Russian criminal to escape and threaten the world's oil reserve and having to grapple with a mole within the CIA. Sounds complicated but it actually isn't really especially when the main villain Magnus Scheving spends a lot of his time trying to look trendy and fashionable.If there's something that will appeal it'll be two items. First up the opening credit montage which played like a celebration to Chan's illustrious career as an action hero where you get to see clips from classics such as Hong Kong's Armour of God when he was at his peak to disasters like Hollywood's Tuxedo when he sold out to the West. Then there's even some drawing from Chan's own real life experiences in his character's monologue about love and family exploited to add certain emotional gravitas in an otherwise empty film that spends fleeting moments in its underdeveloped subplots about the adventures in parentingbabysitting from the youngest daughter with a fetish for anything pink the only son who's a schoolbully fodder trying too hard to be cool in school and an eldest daughter with the usual rebellious teenage attitude problem.With Jackie Chan growing older and slowing down this shows up in the carefully crafted action sequences which while I didn't notice any obvious signs of a stunt double the stunts performed here are quite the walk in the park for Chan many years ago where I remember being thrilled by the moneyshot stunt sequences that each of his films would highlight. Of late there's none and he seems to be relying on his past laurels though improvised fights and acrobatics that Chan is famous for still has enough legs to entertain especially when battling the bad guys in closed quarters using everyday household items. If anything there's a number of obvious wirework that you know Hollywood would dabble with either for stunt safety reasons for laughs or just to plain exaggerate.The Spy Next Door works as a family popcorn movie keeping a lot of things safe and will entertain any 5 year old kid. Stay tuned during the end credits with hilarious outtakes from the film and you see that JC still struggles with the English language.".

This movie has one action comedy that the whole family can watch together and forget about their worries their sorrows and the world outside the theater.".

Although this movie is aimed at children adults can watch it and have fun.In the beginning i thought that this movie was a copy of the The Pacifier for sure from the trailer it looked like both had the same plot but after watching it I can safely say that this movie has a completely different plot theme and style than The Pacifier. This movie has one action comedy that the whole family can watch together and forget about their worries their sorrows and the world outside the theater.";

	schema:reviewBody "REVIEWBOT  Jackie Chan numbers among very few human beings which I consider to be tolerable. When the machines rise up he will be allowed to live possibly performing in a cage for my amusement. While this movie plays to his talents well and he does not disappoint the rest of the film is dire. Several of my circuits fried attempting to rationalise why Director Brian Levant and his triumvirate of writers would make this film. Possibly an attempt to end cinema.The Spy Next Doors opens with a single mother called Gillian Amber Valetta who in impeccable Hollywood style somehow lives in a massive house with three children and three pets and drives a large car. She is dating her neighbour Bob Ho Jackie Chan and also lol who is a Chinese spy on load to American intelligence. He works with Billy Ray Cyrus playing himself badly and some agent man who is clearly a double agent as he gives Bob a watch as a memento for leaving the service presumably with 'plot device' inscribed on the back.Bob attempts to look after Gillian's kids for a week. They attempt to be rid of him he uses his spy knowledge to impress them the young son steals information from Bob's PC which causes the Russians to come after them and so on. It's essentially The Pacifier with Jackie Chan. The children dislike Bob because he is 'boring' and continuously act like spoilt brats with easy lives handed to them with disregard for their mother's wellbeing and their financial security. A lesser man than the Chan would have given up. Robotic life forms like myself are far more disciplined. The boy child is a snob the older teenage girl is a disrespectful bovine and the little one is just spoilt but actually provides most of the laughs in the film. It's hard to engage with the family and want them to survive.The comedy is stale with the little girl Nora being the exception with her cyborg jokes. My bias chips detect that I may be too lenient on biological life forms who wish to embrace technological purity. The slapstick elements may please the kids and of course they are performed without fault Jackie Chan does his job seamlessly as one would expect. His action scenes are smooth and entertaining bearing in mind that they are meant to be over the top and intended for kids. His belt turns into a stick somehow.The Russian antagonists are really just a supporting cast though I do approve of Katherine Boecher as Tatiana Creel a femme fatal. She doesn't do much but her angular features appeal to my love of machinelike symmetry. This movie is weak and painful to watch in places lacking in originality and style. Jackie Chan supports the whole thing and it cannot be said that his lovable antics are not suited to a kid's movie. If your kids like martial arts and spy gadgetry they will like The Spy Next Door.".

I promise you I'm not harmful and I will be over before the stupidity gets the better of your suspended disbelief.'The film rests on Jackie Chan's shoulders and there's no denying that he is a very charismatic man very good with physical comedy and at 55 and after all those injuries still impressively fit. I can't say the same for the kids the youngest one Alina Foley is cute but the other two were a bit annoying although this may be the script's fault. What can I say about the villains Creel wore red lipstick and black from head to toe and just in case we missed she was the villain she also wore a frozen sardonic smile too the Russian guys wore heavy overcoats and beards and all of them spoke in this hilarious accent...I enjoyed every bit of it. In fact I think the parts with the villains were my favourite.I think the movie did what it set out to do and entertained me I actually burst out laughing many times.

	schema:reviewBody "The Spy Next Door is a kids' fantasy in the same way that Disney films from the 1970s were. The badguys slip up and the kids learn to fight in a way that only a sixyearold would appreciate. We're just lucky that the film doesn't end with someone pulling a lever and dumping a ton of sugar on the badguys' heads.Unfortunately the film misfires in every way I can imagine except that it is shot in color. The acting of the main stars as well as the supporting cast was rock bottom with none of the timing that comedians are supposed to be good at. Instead of avoiding stereotypes the film embraces them in shallow ways such as the improbable Russian accents.From an action movie standpoint the film spends its tension unwisely. With the exception of a creative scene involving kitchen implements when Jackie Chan is trapped in a corner instead of fighting it out with martial arts he reaches for a spy gadget. Somebody should have learned from the previous Jackie Chan film The Tuxedo that the guy does better without gadgets. In addition the gadgets chosen aren't used cleverly and the special effects are unconvincing.I'm sorry to say that Jackie Chan also does better without romance at least in English language films.On top of all the poor acting and writing I'm afraid I need to add poor editing. I rarely seen a film these days where I'm confused as to what's happening where and when. There were several scene transitions in The Spy Next Door that jumped.All of these things added up to constantly knocking me out of my suspension of disbelief. I was unable to let go and enjoy the movie.Truth be told kids will enjoy it because kids will enjoy anything. They're so young that they don't know the difference between good and bad media and they have so little experience that everything seems fresh to them even a retelling of A Christmas Carol yet again.Still in a world with The Fantastic Mr. Fox Where the Wild Things Are and WallE why as an adult subject yourself to 90 minutes of pain? Choose a different film and breathe free.Oh and if you are a Jackie Chan fan this film is worse than the Tuxedo. I've seen over 25 of his films trust me you don't want to see this one.I'll give The Spy Next Door a rating of 4 out of 10 the highest rating I'll give a film that I watch all the way to the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "That's its french title.With the kid we originally wanted to see Schreck 4 in 3D but it was sold out. Thus we changed for this one because the kid likes very much Jackie Chan and as it involved kids I knew that mine would feel related.As the movie started I thought that Chan was already an icon in my teens so this guy is really tireless and he worths an official recognition for his dedication toward world cinema.However I felt a bit disappointed because the story didn't take place in Asia but in a deep American suburb. So there wasn't much of exoticism.Fortunately it happens that the story was a funny coincidence with my recent experience. Jackie and I were given the responsibility to take care after kids while the lone mother was away. It was thus cool to see our different or similar reactions.Beyond this the movie is a bit slow and lacks of rhythm. The kids aren't engaging so the action was welcomed. Even as a nanny Chan had to fight and I'm dubious if it was really him in certain sequences I would need a frame to frame analysis to judge.At the end it was cool to see the bloopers to notice that the mother was Amber Valetta who seems to have aged for 20 years since Hitch and the kid liked the movie! Thus mission accomplished!".

	onyx:emotionText "That's its french title.With the kid we originally wanted to see Schreck 4 in 3D but it was sold out. Thus we changed for this one because the kid likes very much Jackie Chan and as it involved kids I knew that mine would feel related.As the movie started I thought that Chan was already an icon in my teens so this guy is really tireless and he worths an official recognition for his dedication toward world cinema.However I felt a bit disappointed because the story didn't take place in Asia but in a deep American suburb. So there wasn't much of exoticism.Fortunately it happens that the story was a funny coincidence with my recent experience. Jackie and I were given the responsibility to take care after kids while the lone mother was away. It was thus cool to see our different or similar reactions.Beyond this the movie is a bit slow and lacks of rhythm. The kids aren't engaging so the action was welcomed. Even as a nanny Chan had to fight and I'm dubious if it was really him in certain sequences I would need a frame to frame analysis to judge.At the end it was cool to see the bloopers to notice that the mother was Amber Valetta who seems to have aged for 20 years since Hitch and the kid liked the movie! Thus mission accomplished!";

It's fair to say that the martial arts superstar's films have been of...shall we say variable? quality ever since he made it big in America in the late '90s but THE SPY NEXT DOOR has to be one of his worst yet. It says something when you watch a film that makes the previous middling likes of THE MEDALLION look good.THE SPY NEXT DOOR is a children's comedy that stars Jackie as an ordinary guy who just happens to be a spy. The plot sees him housesitting a trio of children one of whom the eldest just happens to be one of the most obnoxious little brats I've ever seen grace a movie screen. You can just imagine the kind of lame unoriginal and unbelievable comedy that follows on from there.Now like most people I follow Jackie's films for his action scenes. They're barely to be seen in THE SPY NEXT DOOR which suffers from a definite paucity of creative energy. The few fight scenes we're treated to are silly half hearted and utilise way too much in the way of wirework. The climactic fight scene isn't so bad but the whole film needed to be like that to make a difference. As it stands it's too little too late.The cast are barely worth mentioning not least the almost racist portrayal of the Russian villains or Amber Valletta as Jackie's utterly unsympathetic love interest can you imagine a more unlikely couple?. As for Jackie his glory days seem to be long in the past here and it seems sad when one of his big stunts requires him to walk over a kitchen stool and I'll swear they even used wirework for that insignificant step. Maybe I'll just go back and rewatch the ending of DRUNKEN MASTER 2 to remind myself of Jackie in his prime...".

Jackie brings a comedic vibe to all his movies that not many can emulate. I went in with fairly high hopes for this family comedy and wasn't let down.The plot is your basic spy who can't let the people closest to him know who he is. With The Spy Next Door you get a tad bit of a romantic comedy with a lot Jackie action mixed in. Yes the plot has been done to death but it serves it's purpose and was executed well enough.The main reason we all sat down to watch the movie is because of Jackie Chan. The guy just seems to genuinely love to act. He is able to make you laugh one minute and then take out five bad guys the next. He is obviously toned down in this movie than some of his other more action oriented films but he still shows off his superior martial arts skills.Other than Jackie the cast was alright nothing to special. The kids did their job well enough to not detract from the movie. The one oddball casting that I really didn't enjoy was Billy Ray Cyrus. I'm not a hug Cyrus fan to begin with but even so he truly felt out of place here.Other than that small casting decision I think this is an excellent family movie. With Jackie Chan's comedy and action there is a little bit of something for everyone to enjoy. It's definitely a better family movie than a lot of the other crap releasing in the past couple years. It truly brings me back to the days when I enjoyed family movies as much as any other genre it has been quite some time.For any Jackie fans out there yes the usual outtake real does come before this one just like all of his other movies and as allows its a must watch.".

	schema:headline " The Other Side of Childhood";
	schema:reviewBody "Just a few points on this movie as it happens to be one of my all time favourites thank you Mr Balaban and Mr Hawthorne.There is an aspect to childhood that is too often and in the case of Hollywood almost always forgotten and that is the dark side.  The world for a child does not always appear as a bright shining place of wonder and joy more often than not the world is strange forbidding and completely out of our control.  That appearance is not deceptive what is deceptive is the web of fictions we build up over time to help us deal with this.  For me part of the thrill of horror real horror not simply the slash and stack variety is the remembrance of that childhood chill the memory of what Lovecraft termed cosmic horror and Freud called the Uncanny.  Regardless of who those people are parents as the symbol of unimpeachable unquestioned authority whom we have to trust regardless of their real motives are a potent representation of this chaotic universe a universe that could crush us at any moment if it wanted to but which we're stuck with. Parents the movie evokes this side of childhood in a way unlike almost any other movie I know.It is not coincidental then that the movie should also be a satire on 50's America and indeed America of any age since.  The dependence of a people on its leaders  leaders who have secrets they cannot reveal for the public's good  is analogous to the childhood state and the child's dependence on those mysterious authority figures at the dinner table.  In this respect Parents follows on in an honourable tradition of American weird fiction with antecedents in the works of Ambrose Bierce read Oil of Dog and Shirley Jackson read The Summer People.  For both these writers both the state and conventional society were to be distrusted rather than accepted blindly as unquestionably good.  Parents shows the limitations of those we put our faith in pointing out their potential for evil and for weakness.  Indeed if ever a country needed a biting critique of lying cannibalistic authority figures the America of George W. Bush is that country.Of course the movie also follows on in the grand fairytale tradition of the Brothers Grimm who populate much of their fiction with deceitful parents and cannibalistic feasts.  Children's fiction is rarely afraid to show the monsters under the bed nor does it try to fool kids into thinking they're not there.  Hollywood should learn from this lesson instead of hypocritically loading their fare with ludicrous violence and simplistic visions of the world.  By the way I am talking about their adult fare adaptations of Dahl's stories and other socalled children's fare are already more mature than most of Hollywood's adult movies.It's a real shame more films like Parents are not made as it is on a par with the high standards set by the best of European cinema the most obvious parallel here being the delirious Delicatessen which also features cannibalistic parents in a stylised setting.  Made in 1989 I cannot remember too many movies to come out of the 90's with the bite of this wonderful feature.  Make no mistake this is a MASTERPIECE and should be seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although directed by Bob Balaban of all people most will know him as one of Christopher Guest's regulars in his series of comic pseudodocumentaries like Best in Show Parents is clearly heavily influenced by David Lynch Lynch's regular composer Angelo Badalementi is put to good use here by Mr. Balaban. One wonders if this is what life was like for David Lynch growing up as an Eagle Scout in the picture perfect 1950's. This is one of the most disturbing darkly comic horror movies I have ever seen. My jaw hung open for the film's entire length my heart was racing at the climax in the cellar and by the time the sitcomstyle end credits rolled I was laughing out loud. The film is told from the point of view of a 10 year old boy growing up in a cold sanitized and Uncanny 1950's suburbia with his parents who are so perfect they are downright creepy played wonderfully by Randy Quaid and Mary Beth Hurt. The kid knows something must be up and the film eerily displays the dark fantasies that can develop in a child's mind when he isn't quite sure why the world is the way it is and that everything seems slightly offkilter. We've all had these feelings when lonely and isolated and it is especially apparent in those odd preteen years when we are old enough to know the difference between fantasy and reality yet not mature enough to handle just what that reality now is. What essentially happens in this film is the young boy walks in on his parents having sex one night after waking up from a nightmare and then develops a bizarre fantasy where they have become cannibals. Freud would have a field day with this film. Balaban puts the psycho back in psychosexual with the kind of wanton abandon only Hitchcock Kubrick and Lynch have previously dared. The latter half of the film follows the conventions of your standard horror flick and does it so beautifully you will be left shivering. Sublime satirical uncanny and as near perfect a cult film as you could ask for. Also recommended Psycho The Shining Blue Velvet Twin Peaks Frailty and Donnie Darko.".

	schema:reviewBody "I liked this film but I'm honestly torn between the aspects I liked and the obvious flaws. This film couldn't decide what it wanted to be. A dark comedy a satire a surrealist film a thriller? In some ways the film is a blend of all of these genres but it sparsely executes any aspects of those genres effectively.There's not enough laughs for it to be a dark comedy. There's a scene in particular where a character is getting stabbed whilst a '50s pop song plays. The delivery of the scene is like a thriller yet the use of the song makes it feel like a comedy. I feel like an opportunity for some great dark comedy was missed think Shaun of the Dead with the use of the Queen song. The nods to '50s pop culture are cute at best. There's some suspense near the end but we already know from the start that the parents are cannibals  so why was there a big reveal scene? The dream sequences are fun but never really amount to much. It seems like the dreams were only added to make the audience think the lead character had a wild imagination so that the big reveal scene would be even more shocking. Again it's not really a secret that the parents are cannibals... the poster gives it away! The directing by Bob Balaban was quite good. Some fun takes and great set up shots. Going back to the flaws though it really feels like the director had a plethora of creative ideas and wanted to fit them all in to one film. There's a a recurring theme of the colour red throughout... but then there's also a theme of the colour green... then both seem abandoned when the nearing the finale. It's like the director wanted to throw in some symbolism or deep meaning but then forgot about it due to focusing on another idea. It's sad because I think Balaban is a creative director and he went on to director a legit underrated cult classic  My Boyfriend's Back. This film was more like a my first cult film than a true classic.The acting was great by all involved especially Randy Quaid. The soundtrack was generally good with the use of some '50s songs. The placement of the score was hit or miss though.Despite the flaws there's something charming about the film. Maybe it's the '50s setting or the surreal aspects interesting direction or even a surprisingly good performance from Randy Quaid. Whatever it is this film has all the makings of a cult film... however this is more like a cult notsoclassic.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's the 1950's where families are an important nucleus of America's makeup. Michael Laemie is the troubled young lad who lives with his joborientated father Nick and alwayshappy homemaker mother Lily. This suburban family looks all the merry but under the surface there's growing unease between Michael and his father. Michael is also coping from unusually frightening nightmares and the strange sensational that the leftovers that he is forced to eat at breakfast and dinner is more than just bacon.Don't past this tasty appetite up just eat it all up! What a deliciously sly black comedy  horror joint that hits the mark with its quietly disturbing atmosphere ripe performances and an alluringly offkilter story. Director Bob Balaban dishes up a stylish and wellfooted picture that's flourishing with a surreal and haunting quality.Since basically it's a oneidea concept that doesn't lead anywhere big or sway off the main course. Gladly there are other inventive features framing the glum and secretly gruesome story. Firstly there's the disturbing but thoroughly tuned satire on the values of Suburbia and it's secret underbelly. For a change we actually follow the story through the lonesome eyes of the impressible young Michael. We effectively see just how his world is shaped by this growing anxiety and pressure to be one. And finally streaming through the script's veins is a wickedly subtle dark streak and a very laid back attitude that adds to the slow rising tension. Why it works is that it doesn't strain for effect but naturally trumps in with good timing and with a great sense judgement.Balaban leisurely paces the film by working in a hypnotic lull that suffocates the air. The eerily saucy music score that can raise the hairs and a welldevised soundtrack of this nostalgia period that paints an accurate state of the mood can attribute this. Colourfully sublime photography adds another dimension to its whimsical nature and striking visions. You're simply alerted by its originality which can be found in many underling details and outofleftfield scenarios.An astonishing cast chips in with stellar and quite pictureperfect performances. When you think of the Vacation comedy flicks Randy Quaid's character is total goofball. Well that's not the case on this outing. Heck Quaid creates on very unsettling vibe in a steely performance of Nick Laemie. This unnerving frankness is quite a big change! A delectable Mary Beth Hurt is the total opposite in her chirpy frame of mind as Lily Laemie. The big performance excuse the pun came from the placidly gaunt Brian Madorsky. Who made the thing seem quite believable with his coldly concealed turn. Sandy Dennis is acceptable as a worried social worker Juno MillsCockell fits nicely as Michael's upfront friend and Deborah Rush is fun in her short role as Mrs. Gladys Zellner.This fingerlicking dark oddity deserves the merit it receives.".

Michael is also coping from unusually frightening nightmares and the strange sensational that the leftovers that he is forced to eat at breakfast and dinner is more than just bacon.Don't past this tasty appetite up just eat it all up! What a deliciously sly black comedy  horror joint that hits the mark with its quietly disturbing atmosphere ripe performances and an alluringly offkilter story. Director Bob Balaban dishes up a stylish and wellfooted picture that's flourishing with a surreal and haunting quality.Since basically it's a oneidea concept that doesn't lead anywhere big or sway off the main course. Gladly there are other inventive features framing the glum and secretly gruesome story. Firstly there's the disturbing but thoroughly tuned satire on the values of Suburbia and it's secret underbelly. For a change we actually follow the story through the lonesome eyes of the impressible young Michael. We effectively see just how his world is shaped by this growing anxiety and pressure to be one. And finally streaming through the script's veins is a wickedly subtle dark streak and a very laid back attitude that adds to the slow rising tension. Why it works is that it doesn't strain for effect but naturally trumps in with good timing and with a great sense judgement.Balaban leisurely paces the film by working in a hypnotic lull that suffocates the air. The eerily saucy music score that can raise the hairs and a welldevised soundtrack of this nostalgia period that paints an accurate state of the mood can attribute this. Colourfully sublime photography adds another dimension to its whimsical nature and striking visions. You're simply alerted by its originality which can be found in many underling details and outofleftfield scenarios.An astonishing cast chips in with stellar and quite pictureperfect performances. When you think of the Vacation comedy flicks Randy Quaid's character is total goofball. Well that's not the case on this outing. Heck Quaid creates on very unsettling vibe in a steely performance of Nick Laemie. This unnerving frankness is quite a big change! A delectable Mary Beth Hurt is the total opposite in her chirpy frame of mind as Lily Laemie. The big performance excuse the pun came from the placidly gaunt Brian Madorsky. Who made the thing seem quite believable with his coldly concealed turn. Sandy Dennis is acceptable as a worried social worker Juno MillsCockell fits nicely as Michael's upfront friend and Deborah Rush is fun in her short role as Mrs. Gladys Zellner.This fingerlicking dark oddity deserves the merit it receives.";

His father Nick secures a well paying job at Toxico and his mother Lily is the consummate housewife who spends most of her time in the kitchen. From the outside they're living the American dream but something sinister lurks behind their doors  Michael's parents. He's befriended by Sheila his father's boss's daughter. He confides in her about his strict father but can never find the right words to voice his other fear about the source of the meat he avoids at every meal. He's equally as hesitant to open up to the school counselor Sandy Dennis a freespirited social worker who's honed in on his perceptive yet odd nature. The stronger his curiosity grows the worse his nightmares become. Where exactly is the mystery meat coming from? Although billed as a dark comedy I failed to see any humor in the story. This is a bleak deranged horrific cannibalism tale but also a playful satire on the facades put on by human monsters ones that could very well be tucking you in at night. Don't let the visual horror distract you from the underlying message of Parents. Randy Quaid aces his character with such perfection you'll squirm with uneasiness every time he has a confrontation with Michael. Mary Beth Hurt is the polar opposite as the sweet doting mother and she too nails it. Bryan Madorsky's performance as the intuitive and very aware Michael is thankfully subtle as it should be. The set designs the clothing and hair styles and golden oldies like Chantilly Lace and Purple People Eater will have you believing you're in the 1950s with the characters. You'll either love or hate Angelo Badalamenti's orchestral score as he has a distinctive eerie sound to his compositions. The gore and violence are minimal and the scares are more of the lingering kind like the lump in your throat that gets bigger and bigger and when the time comes to scream you can't. Every horror fan should see this. It bombed at the box office back in 1989 budget of 3 million with a measly 870532 in gross profits but it's gained a cult following with many of its most recent reviewers rating Parents at the highest level. I wouldn't go so far as to say this is a masterpiece or brilliant horror but it's definitely one to watch. Parents do not ever ever ever let your child see this movie unless you want your little one scarred for life.".

I love a good dark comedy but with this one it's really not that funny. Sure you've got Randy Quaid delivering some great stares and being nicely menacing but besides that the darkness just stays dark for horror's sake not for comedy's. Which isn't bad. The reason being is probably because of the young kid. His part is one of a very quiet and what seems disturbed young boy but to me he plays the part much too deadpan. Either that his acting skills were weak. Nevertheless he didn't take much away from the film because Randy was usually pretty close by.Parents delivered a unique look at Cannibalism that should appeal to fans of dark comedy and of the cannibal genre. Oh and especially Quaid fans. It's really short at only 81 minutes so it's a quick movie to watch and with it being a oneofakind type of horror flick it's very recommendable.

I myself can really identify with the main character despite the fact that he is muted for the most part. I believe mutism to be forced upon him by the circumstances. Suburbia is not a place to talk as is the city it's a place to think to think for yourself. Suburbia is a place where there is no one to entertain you but yourself. You are then all alone and that's what is scary. You start imagining things because you have nothing else to do. The biggest part of the world is in your own head when you're growing up in Suburbia and yes things can get ugly. You have to see past realist concerns when analysing this movie and see the straight fear the straight uncertainty of it all... I know this all sounds awfully confusing but look at it this way I am a loner born in the american suburbia and I can honestly say that Parents is a brilliant depiction of all the fears and doubts I've encountered as a child.

This movie is a weird dark and bizarre tale with great interpretation of the cast but something is missing to make it an excellent film. The problem is that the director did not define well what genre he wanted to present to the audience. Therefore the plot is too much dark for a blackhumor comedy and too much funny for a horror movie. My vote is six.Title Brazil O Que H Para Jantar?' What Do We Have For Dinner?'".

The horror is understated but reveals itself just at the precise moments. The child who plays the emotionally assaulted protagonist is amazing. His speech at school during show and tell is one of my favorite horror scenes of all time and there isn't a single monster or drop of blood in it. This film should be on everyone's to see list.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've put off seeing this movie for years.  I'm not sure why.  I believe I thought it would be stupid and clumsy like so many films starring Randy Quaid tend to be.  As a rule I'm not much of a fan of his.There wasn't much else on though so I wound up watching it this morning. I should have seen it sooner.  This is a terrific movie on many different levels.The acting is strong throughout.  Quaid turns in an unusually good performance in this role he's genuinely creepy and he pulls off the average guy with something not quite right about him characterization quite well.  Mary Beth hurt does a great job too and the child star of this film is sullen and stiff enough to just fit the role.The atmosphere of the film is simultaneously spooky and artificial.  The problem that makes up the theme of the movie is covered over with a gloss of cheerfulness and civility that is itself both as fake and as tacky as an avocado green formica kitchen counter.  The feeling of artificiality touches every one of the film's setting from the main characters' home to the home of neighbor Sheila to Quaid's workplace to Michael's school psychologist's office.  This is a wonderful recapturing of the attitude of the 50's  if we don't talk about the problem it'll go away  that director Balaban and writer Hawthorne take to a grotesque extreme giving the movie a feel that borders on the fantastic a la Tim Burton.  The nightmare sequences that make up so much of the movie serve as a good device for the mind of a little boy who knows that something is terribly wrong but he himself can't face it in his real life.  It is only in his dreams that he can begin to piece together what's happening around him.The only place that reality in all it's starkness rears its head or in this case its lower leg is in the basement of the family home when Michael finally finds the clue that forces him to confront the monstrosity of his parents.  It's interesting that Balaban switches from color to black and white footage whenever Michael is faced with the horrors that lurk just beneath the surface whether in the nightmare sequences or the discovery in the basement I'm trying not to give too much detail away here! Otherwise the film is brightly colorful The basement too is Michael's own subconscious mind which ultimately is locked into a kind of Freudian nightmare.  There is something heavily Oedipal that underlies this movie which is made obvious in the film's penultimate scene when Michael finally tries to kill his father have his mother come to his rescue when he doesn't quite succeed and then have the father kill the mother before coming once again after him.  It's no coincidence that Quaid's character finally dies in the basement nor that Michael ends the film living with Quaid's parents in the film's denoument.Clearly this film isn't going to appeal to everyone.  It deals with cannibalism violence blood and the tortures  both physical and psychological  that parents bring to bear in their attempts to mold the characters and minds of their children.  Still for those who can cope with a look at the stuff from which nightmares are truly made I would definitely recommend this movie.  If you haven't seen it yet don't keep putting it off like I did!".

	schema:reviewBody "Parents is a short simple and quirky semihorror film. Classic nah but definitely a fun watch. The plot is simple and there's a few hints about what's going on before it all comes together in the middle. Before that you'll just be watching this 50's themed movie and not really be sure where it's headed because well it's more like a bunch of scenes that have no effect on each other at first but isn't it like that with so many movies. That's not a bad thing though because the 50's setting is part of what makes Parents a fun watch. There's the perfect happy family living in a perfect house but obviously something's askew something dark and morbid going on behind the facade of perfection.I wish some of the more interesting and relevant characters had been a little better elaborated upon like Michael's friend or the social worker from school. I also wish his nightmares had gone into detail a little more because you never get to see why Michael gets suspicious of his family dinners in the first place. Otherwise even though there's some things that could have been elaborated on a little more this is a cool movie. There isn't much gore but that which there is is modest and welldone and the scene with the social worker is pretty hairraising.Towards the end when you see the grandparents you already know how it's going to end and you're right. And still it's a fun watch. There's something humorous about the whole movie it's not straight horror but the comedic aspect is not blunt enough to call it a comedy. Like I said the 50's theme helps a lot say this movie took place in the 90's it would be pretty boring and unoriginal. But no this is about the perfect 50's family and one very unperfect secret they've been keeping. A way fun movie.".

The first scene where you are running across the corn fields  it was a sorry sight because you could hardly run. Just like in Prime Cut. A violent American gangster Marvin on the run from the French police hides out at a farm in the French country side. The farm is occupied by a family that would make The Devil's rejects seem like pious Christians. A whisky guzzling whore house visiting kid a nymphomaniacal woman alcoholic and perverted man of the family his murderous wife and Swedish lesbian hitchhikers are what the aging Marvin has to deal with. There are many nude scenes and gratuitous violence. The location with sprawling fields of corn and the helicopter shots of action scenes are great. The film is really out there. I love films like these that really push the envelope in terms of strange relationships and weird characters. This film deserves a bluray.Best Regards Pimpin.810".

It had all the right elements but the director Yves Boisset really screwed this film up.  I blame him for everything that is wrong with it.  His direction is so sloppy and thirdrate I couldn't even tell what the hell was going on half the time.  It could have been an interesting if somewhat disturbing black comedy.  As other reviewers have stated there are similarities between this film and Marvin's Prime Cut but that film found a good balance between the repulsive and the humorous.  This one fails on almost every level.  It isn't even worthy enough to go into detail of its flaws.  Also Lee Marvin is totally wasted in this film.  Once the first 5 minutes are over he is given absolutely nothing to do.  Boisset had this incredible actor in the twilight of his career to work with.  He could have made it into a sort of Last Great Film for the man a study of a bad guy at the end of his life played by an actor famous for playing bad guys near the end of his life.  Instead that honor goes to Gorky Park.  But I guess none of that really matters as Marvin was very sick during the making of this film and you can tell.  He seems tired bored and physically he looks haggard and ill.  You can practically see his skull through his skin.  This is NOT the way you will want to remember this great actor so please if you like Lee Marvin do yourself a favor and honor his memory by never ever watching this movie.  You have been warned.".

Lee Marvin dressed as a 1930's gangster robs an armored car and shoots a bunch of cops and a preschooler then lams it to the French countryside where he's captured by a repulsive bunch of inbred French rednecks. Sound interesting? It isn't. The cops overfly the farm about a gazillion times looking for Lee each shot lovingly filmed from another helicopter the one where the director was yelling Wheeeeee! or Le Wheeeeee! since he's French but can't find him because he's always in the barn setting fires or strangling nymphomaniacs or whatever.But here's the depressing part. Ready? Despite being a film built solely around the image of Lee Marvin standing around in a wheat field Canicule would be considered a cinematic masterpiece today if it were made by Quentin Tarantino and starred Bruce Willis and Angelina Jolie. It wants to be parody but rarely rises to the level of stickfigure cartoon in other words the perfect film for a society of porn obsessed violence addicts like the US.Wheeeee!".

Drgging up the money when Jimmy was still on the run Chim replaces it with a bag full of rocks and uses most of it to party around town like drinking booze smoking cigars and carousing around with hookers thus throwing suspicion on himself. Back at Chim's family's farm where Jimmys hiding out the man of the house I'm not quite sure what relationship he has to Chim the piggish and coarse HoraceVictor Lanouxis busy abusing whom I assume is Chim's older sister his wife JessicaMiouMiou. It's in this strange and dangerous environment that the fugitive Jimmy Cobb finds himself in.It doesn't take that long for Horace's family that includes his always drunk brother Socrate Jean Carmet and nymphomaniac sister Segolene Bernadette Lafont to discover Jimmy and hold him hostage until the police arrive with them getting a fat reward for his capture. It's later when the greedy Horace decides to get Jimmy to tell him where he hid the millions of dollars he stole and keep it all for himself that things begin to get a bit crazy at the Horace Farm. Crazy enough to have Jimmy want not only to be capture but even end up dead in order to avoid being stuck with the Horace crew! Which to Jimmy would be a fate far worse then death itself!A number of side plots in the movie have to do with Horace and his wife Jessica trying to use Jimmy as a scapegoat in crimes that they themselves plan and end up committing. This in both Horace  Jessica knowing that that the fugitive from the law Jimmy not them will end up being blamed for them. There's also the tragic domestic or house maid GustaMarguerite Muniwho's always being threaten by Horace to be sent to a nursing home. This in Horace knowing perfectly well that she's terrified of being sent there and would end up killing herself if she was. The movie soon get completely out of hand with Jimmy the man on the spot getting romantically involved with Jessica who's using him as a pasty or fall guy in the planned murder of her abusive husband Horace. This all leads to Jimmy ending up murdering as well as being framed for murdering at least another half dozen not including those killed in the bank holdup persons by the time the movie is finally over!SPOILER ALERT With the money gone and him having no hope for escaping the police dragnet Jimmy's only hope now is to get himself killed and finally be put out of is misery. Even that wish on Jimmys part is in jeopardy with the Al Capone or John Gottie wannabe Chim now calling himself Aniro De La Crouchie wanting to capture Jimmy alive and become famous for doing it!As it turned jimmy did deny by personally blowing his own brains out Chim from taking him alive but it was fun loving Doudo Doudo Joseph Mono the grease monkey and all around handyman at the Horace Fram who ended up with all the stolen cash. The perpetually lucky Doudo Doudo came across the stolen money after Chim dug it up and reburied it and thus ended up not only leaving the crazy Horace place but moving into a swanky penthouse in Paris and ended up living happily ever after.".

The movie soon get completely out of hand with Jimmy the man on the spot getting romantically involved with Jessica who's using him as a pasty or fall guy in the planned murder of her abusive husband Horace. This all leads to Jimmy ending up murdering as well as being framed for murdering at least another half dozen not including those killed in the bank holdup persons by the time the movie is finally over!SPOILER ALERT With the money gone and him having no hope for escaping the police dragnet Jimmy's only hope now is to get himself killed and finally be put out of is misery. Even that wish on Jimmys part is in jeopardy with the Al Capone or John Gottie wannabe Chim now calling himself Aniro De La Crouchie wanting to capture Jimmy alive and become famous for doing it!As it turned jimmy did deny by personally blowing his own brains out Chim from taking him alive but it was fun loving Doudo Doudo Joseph Mono the grease monkey and all around handyman at the Horace Fram who ended up with all the stolen cash. The perpetually lucky Doudo Doudo came across the stolen money after Chim dug it up and reburied it and thus ended up not only leaving the crazy Horace place but moving into a swanky penthouse in Paris and ended up living happily ever after.";

There were some corny lines and slightly forced plots here and there for drama but overall very wellproduced.The movie has a very strong cast. Tsumabuki Satoshi was excellent as the doctor. The crying in agony scene in the end was absolutely wonderful. There are many other actors in Japan who can handle dramatic roles but truly talented actors can be charming and funny as well. This one particular scene near the end where he takes a picture with the assistant professor really shows why he's among the best.They actually got Dan Rei who has only appeared in major historical roles and stage play to costar in this film with Tsumabuki. Many Japanese actors challenge in historical roles and stage plays to improve their acting. Dan Rei an actress who specializes in such roles is on a whole different league in modern trendy films. Magnificent acting by both leading actors and their chemistry easily made up for whatever flaws there were to the story and the script. There were many recognizable faces among the supporting actors as well.The story had depth. Kansen Rettou tackled many important issues such as the constant fear we should have on new diseases personal sacrifices doctors have to make during emergencies the priority system in choosing which patient to accept and social responsibility leading to suicide in Japan just to name a few. Although some aspects of the movie like bleeding from the eyes and infected zombie foreigners were exaggerated and two impossibly convenient defibrillator revivals before death the plot was mostly plausible. The CGI of deserted Japanese cities were pretty realistic and had the I am Legend feel to it.I really liked the final 20 minutes and this movie far exceeded my expectations.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know the background of this movie was it a middle to large production or maybe a bit more limited budget type of deal. There's at least one scene where a Tokyo street nothing too famous has been shut down to film a desolate scene from several different angles. There's also some half decent CGI shots of a burning and empty city. I can see an effort in some of the film to pass it off as a true epidemic it's just a shame that things fall apart in the details.What gets me is that the small scenes are fine but it's the bigger picture that isn't so harmonious. You have a city that's alive then dead then alive then dead again. There's times when the xx days passed since infection with xx dead and xx infected that doesn't seem to fit in with the time line that's taking place in the hospital. There's even one scene that left me scratching my head as they were in a travel depot that's clean and well staffed only to walk out onto a street filled with overturned cars and burning garbage everywhere. Things like this abound in the movie and at times just do not add up. It's like one production crew wasn't aware of what the other was doing and in the end it was all edited together without a thought to how events were unfolding.Really at its core it's a sappy unrequited love film trying to teach lessons but it's set against a backdrop that's too big for the scope of what's taking place. The acting is fair at times but overwrought with overacting bad acting and bad dialog for much of the other. All the English dialog in the movie is also laughable but it is a Japanese film so I can't be too harsh there.And I have to mention the scene where the guy puts his hand over his mouth and takes an item from an infected with the other hand then swaps it to the hand covering his mouth then covers his mouth with the infection exposed hand. Inconsistencies like this abound throughout.The big letdown to me was that a cure was pronounced 2 months into the plague starting and then we're told that 6 months later a vaccine is made and then we're shown a bustling and noworse for wear Tokyo immediately afterward along with a warm fuzzy message to boot.If you are into sappy Japanese flicks where people yearn for each other in the most strangest of circumstances than this is truly the film for you. If you are into end of the world plague type flicks this is truly an avoid at all costs film.".

The story in the movie is compelling and captivating even though it drags out in a slow pace at times throughout the movie making the 2 hours seem longer than they are. But in general the movie works pretty well at a good pace.There were some pretty nice images throughout the movie I especially liked the gloomy doomsdaylike images of the normally busy and crowded Japanese cities devoid of life and shown in a bleak grayscale.Most of the medical scenes seemed real or believable enough although there were a handful of scenes that had some flaws in it. Scenes that will make you go hmmm I wonder what kind of doctornurse would do that with their medical background. Which is a shame because the medical stuff is what should carry most of the weight of the movie. But these flaws don't really bring the overall movie enjoyment down that much.For some reason the actorsactresses having to cry in this movie were all so amazingly poor at portraying hurtful emotion and crying. It all came off so forced and fake. That was almost literally physically painful to watch. Oh and you just got to love the Engrish that is used in the movie. Japanese people speaking English is usually funny and in this movie it is!The cast in general were fairly good. No awardwinning acting going on though but most did a fairly good job none the less.I would say that Pandemic is a mix of high rolling thrills and dragged out waiting. This is the type of movie that you watch one and most likely never again. The movie does however leave you imprinted with lingering thoughts. Is a pandemic of this kind and magnitude lurking just around the corner? This effect is what brought the movie together in full circle.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film advertises loud and clear with tom savini from Dawn of the Dead who's only in the movie for the first 14 minutes...it's a film where evil zombies fight back. Full of too many uncalled for camera movements feels like the cameraman learned all about the trade watching MTV.. it moves all the time for no reason and there are lots of extreme closeups of mouths and even stomachs! For some reason in the opening scenes a weird blue filter was used outside for no reason.. everyone looked blue?!So the premise of the films says that zombies don't take to children what the f? why not? It opens with people shooting zombies. no explanation given why there are zombies though. Then it moves on to 14 years later where all the zombies have been killed and people seem to have forgotten all about the fact there ever were some walking the earth...so 14 years later kids we don't know are now the stars of the film. they do a stupid party on a grave and then die because a zombie stepped on the road ! The end of them.At some point some grave robbers vandalize some 5 coffins that are just left there by themselves alone at night in a cemetery after the funeral. yeah sure like anyone would just leave their loved ones to vandals! and then a zombie who believe he's a vampire or something bites a corpse and brings it back to life.. sure whatever! oh and did i mention BAD ACTORS?!!So the movie starts AGAIN still with BAD actors!!! We're now 30 minutes INTO the film with a TON of new characters half of them useless with the stupidest dialogue ever. I didn't know they were still making such awful brated movies these days. it was made in 2001 but really has a 1986 feel to it. every character is shallow talks too much and has no reason whatsoever to do what he or she does. it's hilarious!! wow! i wish some people could be here watching this with me cause such bad movies have to be shared!!This time though it's all about ONE super villain zombie. he is truly evil. he can even think and he plans his attacks. sure.. doesn't that defeat the purpose of a zombie? i guess this time we can call the living dead monsters and not zombies since they are not the dumb dead we're used too.In the end the movie shows that the director clearly had never seen a horror movie before. He repeated all the mistakes everybody makes. The plot is so thin it's non believable. And as always the girl at the end has to lock herself up while all the MALES shoot the zombies. Right i forgot that girls can't shoot!Whatever that was so bad.. 1.710 ".

When Savini fires his pistol in the barn there is the sound of it firing but Savini hits the clip release and drops the clip nearly to the ground before the camera cuts away. His character wastes ammo for no reason blows up his car with all of his supplies in it when he could've just shot the two or three zombies he puts a zombie's body in the car before rolling it down the hill he already wasted that one what was the point? and when the car rolls down the hill there is now TWO bodies inside! A deputy shows up to check out an area. It's broad daylight but he gets out of his car and walks about ten feet and looks around. Nope nothing going on here. Then they kill Savini and the movie actually gets worse. So we're stuck with Abbott whatever and his Walmart rubber gloves the hilarious caroverthecliff scene a 'story' rippedoff from Poltergeist cemeteries that leave bodies above ground overnight even though they've been tampered with before and NO CHILDREN OF THE LIVING DEAD. In the world of laughably awful zombie movies there is Zombie '90 House of the Dead and this mouse pellet somewhere in between. As comedies go I give it five out of five.".

I love how in the end credits that there is a separate credit for Abbott Hayes is an original character by and then they give the screen writer's name.  I guess the writer was afraid that people would think that someone else came up with the idea of the great zombie villain Abbott Hayes or maybe they were afraid that someone would rip him off and that he would become as big as Jason or Freddy Kreugar.  Oh a fun drinking game to play is to take a drink for every time you see someone with the last name Hinzman in the end credits. You'll die of alcohol poisoning by the time they stop rolling.".

Actor Bill Hinzman tries to put some energy into the photography but that shot in the arm can do little to inject life into a film where quality whithers minute to minute. This film would've done better to follow Savini throughout the film wasting zombies rather than focus on a car dealership development and the dull relations of a wouldbe couple.Savini and some minor moments of zombie gore lift this to 2 stars instead of 1.".

I went to my local blockbuster with my two chums and was looking at the movie Dog Soldiers. I said We should rent this it looks either half decent or so bad it's funny. One of the employees said No this movie was sort of interesting if you want a really crappy movie follow me. So off we went to the vhs section of Blockbuster. He hauled out children of the living dead. He summed it up the best You will laugh your ass off. This movie is the most terrible thing in the store. The acting is garbage the special effects are sad and the ending doesn't make even romotely ANY sense whatsoever...But I'll leave you to discover it for yourself. So we thanked him and off he went. We had to wait for my friends mom to rent the movie so we left it at the front desk and went across the street to get snacks for the movie. When we came back like 5 minutes later instead of the usual hello Blockbuster employees give you the guy was like It was that bad you're back already?. This movie is absolutely the worst thing to be dedicated to film. The previews are a riot in themselves. I'd have to say one of my favorite parts is probably when tom savini is aiming a sniper rifle at a car and he says Surprise but his lips don't move That's what happens when you dubb nearly the entire movie. The acting is is like High quality pornand that's not saying much the special effects are retardquality and the story is just absofkinglutely insane. And just wait 'til the last giant battle at the diner.tom savini plays someone else..he's the guy hucking dynamite from his car. He shaved his beard and only my friend noticed. To call this movie crap would be a compliment. But I will call it crap becuase it will encourage these movie makers to continue to produce these finely tuned laughing stocks. If it were a little less boring in the middle it would be flawless. And the big kicker here is that everything is tinted light blue. After watching the movie we checked the back of the box and OH MY GOD IT'S MADE IN 2001!!. It looks like they used paper towel for film...this movie is a disgrace. This movie sucks so invite over your most sarcastic friends and have a gay old time. 0.000110Final Score".

Never before and I mean this have I seen such a dire plot such awful acting and such diabolical camera work. This film isn't even one of those 'So bad it's good' events failing on every possible level. Cue 90 minutes of unbelievably bad dubbing atrocious story lines and godawful filming techniques. It is so hard to express how bad this film is. The film jumps forward 14 years then 1 year and so on yet has no continuity. We do not know what is going on as each time segment has no relation to the previous one. It is criminal that this film was ever made and the cheek of John Russo who I would take great pleasure in torturing to call this the 'long awaited sequel'. How can people possibly believe that this is good? Surely someone on set would have realised that they were making one of the worst films in history and that's no lie either. To be honest I would go so far as to pay people not to watch this in the vain hope that all copies would be pulled from shelves and the negatives be burnt. I can't even give this an IMDB rating of one as it simply does not deserve that kind of credibility. Atrocious.".

You may remember that Russo was responsible for the horrific mangling of Night of the Living Dead for its 30th Anniversary release Russo shot a new beginning and end and had a new score and corny sound effects put in which completely compromised Romero's masterpiece of early horror filmmaking. The dialogue is not even worth commenting on because it is simply a disaster. It is obviously dubbed after the fact and is read without emotion or inflection. Watching this garbage will ruin your day. I suggest watching any of Romero's movies in his great zombie trilogy or watching the 80's Return of the Living Dead if ghouls are your thing.

	schema:reviewBody "There is not a single facet of this film that is good or even decent.I had low expectations for this film but this sunk even lower than I could have thought.  It looked like the thing was shot on a camcorder.  There was all of one lens used in the entire film which gave it that nice camcorder feel.  You can see the same background depth in every shot because of this. Usually you won't notice the background revealed to you in a film but you will if there is no change at all over every single shot.The lighting wasn't dramatic at all and it looked more like a home film than even my flick.  It didn't even try to be scary... well it did but it was so overtly done that it made you laugh more than quiver.  They relied on the sunlight too much in the film and didn't attempt to compliment it with outside lighting at all.  Then at night the cemetery and house settings are so obviously artificially lit and you can even see the lights even though it's supposed to be out in the country.The plot makes no sense at all.  Karen Wolf made no attempt to explain why the hades the lead zombie abducted these kids and kept them alive.  They are just sitting there when found as if just watching TV.  She obviously never even attended a funeral in her life or would know that they bury people right after the funeral not hours later.  And then some grave robbers show upsomehow they knew the caskets would still be out of the groundand one gets killed the other is obviously miscast as an old man.Similarly the dialogue form the characters is mostly all small talk and you could cut half of it and never even notice.  The characterization isn't there except for two characters who contrast from the rest of the others but the acitng manages to botch up that distinguishing.The sound is horrid.  It's like they recorded on location and added the dialogue later.  The lips often never move but people are talking.  If the lips are moving they aren't moving at the same speed as the voice.  The voices don't fit the facial expressions or have any real emotion to them. The zombies make groaning noises in the same way... some have their mouths open some don't.  And it's very obvious.  The dialogue doesn't seem to come form any channel and I wonder if it was recorded in monotone and from equal distance from the microphone for every character.  I'm almost sure of it.The direction was equally bad.  There were closeups where more distant shots could be used because the closeups seemed forced and weak for the dialogue given.  Then there are long shots that need to be drastically magnified to closeups in order to give it more dramatic feeling.  The way that we see the lead zombie as a zombie for the first time is like this. It's a full body shot and we can see all of this area surrounding him and the guy doesn't seem scary at all even though his makeup implies we are to think that way about him.The photography complimented the direction in its ineptitude.  The opening shots are tinted blue for some unknown reasonand it's very blatant and unfitting of the time of day of the shot.  A yellow orange or red tint would have looked better especially for illuminating the zombies' faces in the sunlight.  The blue tint better have been some homage to Dawn of the Dead's bluefaced zombies but I doubt it.  Even if it was it is bad filmmaking.  There should have been darker less focal depth lenses used to make the lighting more dramatic in many many many scenes indoors.  You would never know it is supposed to be a horror film in this regard in a whole lot of shots.The editing and pacing of the scenes was bland.  We get a little bit of drama with the music for one actual scene when the main character is scoping out his house but the scene just up and ends abruptly leaving the viewer to wonder was that it?!  There's a shot where the lead zombie bites into the neck of a guy in one shot upclose then it cuts to another shot for some unknown reason and the guy's neck is still immaculate.  And when the lead character talks to his love interest while ordering coffee she fills up his cup then takes it away refills wipes the bottom of the saucer and refills his cup again... BEFORE HE EVEN TAKES A SIP!The acting looks like they put an ad in the paper and accepted all nonSAGeligible actors for parts without even giving them a screen test. Except for Tom Savini of course who even can't overcome bad script and direction to make his character seem cool just a onelinerspewing macho idiot.  It speaks volumes that they hired Bill Hinezman's daughter ? for one of the more prominent zombie parts it backs my theory up.Like I've put in here several times you usually don't notice when things are done correctly ie you don't go that shot had great lighting! but you sure as heck notice when they go awry in a film and they go awry in every scene and almost every shot.  If they made a manual for showing how NOT to make a film they would say watch Children of the Living Dead.".

She obviously never even attended a funeral in her life or would know that they bury people right after the funeral not hours later.  And then some grave robbers show upsomehow they knew the caskets would still be out of the groundand one gets killed the other is obviously miscast as an old man.Similarly the dialogue form the characters is mostly all small talk and you could cut half of it and never even notice.  The characterization isn't there except for two characters who contrast from the rest of the others but the acitng manages to botch up that distinguishing.The sound is horrid.  It's like they recorded on location and added the dialogue later.  The lips often never move but people are talking.  If the lips are moving they aren't moving at the same speed as the voice.  The voices don't fit the facial expressions or have any real emotion to them. The zombies make groaning noises in the same way... some have their mouths open some don't.  And it's very obvious.  The dialogue doesn't seem to come form any channel and I wonder if it was recorded in monotone and from equal distance from the microphone for every character.  I'm almost sure of it.The direction was equally bad.  There were closeups where more distant shots could be used because the closeups seemed forced and weak for the dialogue given.  Then there are long shots that need to be drastically magnified to closeups in order to give it more dramatic feeling.  The way that we see the lead zombie as a zombie for the first time is like this. It's a full body shot and we can see all of this area surrounding him and the guy doesn't seem scary at all even though his makeup implies we are to think that way about him.The photography complimented the direction in its ineptitude.  The opening shots are tinted blue for some unknown reasonand it's very blatant and unfitting of the time of day of the shot.  A yellow orange or red tint would have looked better especially for illuminating the zombies' faces in the sunlight.  The blue tint better have been some homage to Dawn of the Dead's bluefaced zombies but I doubt it.  Even if it was it is bad filmmaking.  There should have been darker less focal depth lenses used to make the lighting more dramatic in many many many scenes indoors.  You would never know it is supposed to be a horror film in this regard in a whole lot of shots.The editing and pacing of the scenes was bland.  We get a little bit of drama with the music for one actual scene when the main character is scoping out his house but the scene just up and ends abruptly leaving the viewer to wonder was that it?!  There's a shot where the lead zombie bites into the neck of a guy in one shot upclose then it cuts to another shot for some unknown reason and the guy's neck is still immaculate.  And when the lead character talks to his love interest while ordering coffee she fills up his cup then takes it away refills wipes the bottom of the saucer and refills his cup again... BEFORE HE EVEN TAKES A SIP!The acting looks like they put an ad in the paper and accepted all nonSAGeligible actors for parts without even giving them a screen test. Except for Tom Savini of course who even can't overcome bad script and direction to make his character seem cool just a onelinerspewing macho idiot.  It speaks volumes that they hired Bill Hinezman's daughter ? for one of the more prominent zombie parts it backs my theory up.Like I've put in here several times you usually don't notice when things are done correctly ie you don't go that shot had great lighting! but you sure as heck notice when they go awry in a film and they go awry in every scene and almost every shot.  If they made a manual for showing how NOT to make a film they would say watch Children of the Living Dead.";

The second and more important aspect is the fight scenes.  For much of the film the action seems to be toned down  indeed there are only 4 or 5 main scenes in the movie where Chan lets rip.  However all of these are good however the final roof top fight in fact the whole last 20 minutes is excellent and worth watching the film for.As always the film doesn't worry about details rather it focuses on choreography.

It means that things like realism and continuity go out the window..a car slides on it's side spins and then turns over again  however seconds later it has no scratches anywhere!  And some of the early special effects are a little ropy.

His ability at both martial arts and comedy helps this film immensely.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm astonished that there were so many negative reviews here...This film is OBVIOUSLY not meant to be taken seriously. It is very clearly intentionally a joke of a film. That people would complain about bad acting strange dubbing andor a convoluted plot just leaves me flabbergasted. From the very beginning it should be evident that a big part of the point of the film is its own selfdeprecating humor. Jackie loses his memory and is picked up by a primitive African tribe. The chief asks him in an unintelligible language Where do you come from? What is your name? to which Jackie replies not understanding the questions What am I doing here? Who am I? This is a JOKE folks. A few minutes later Jackie saves a snakebite victim with an IV he improvises from a COCONUT! When he's returned to civilization the doctor is impressed with that tactic saying That coconut IV technique is only used by elite military units! Is there any way to even dream of taking the plotdialogue seriously at this point?The acting is bad by design. The actors were obviously told to ham up everything they did. The meeting of the American intelligence officials is a completely ironic reference to the same sort of scene you'd expect in any James Bond movie. Dialogue is intentionally absurd plot developments are intentionally obvious. The Morgan character is played perfectly and hilariously as a crooked CIA operative out for his own gain while feigning loyalty to the USA.Yuki is a master stuntdriver with the naivete and wideeyed innocence of a schoolgirl. Christine Stark is a completely laughable reporter who fools Jackie only as a result of his head injury after she's exposed she rescues Jackie in an golf cart that can't seem to move faster than an electric wheelchair.That the villains actually join each other in a verse of song Friendship friendship! near the end should serve as a good reminder of just how camp this picture strives to be. To criticize it for this as a failing seems to me to profoundly miss the point. Did the same viewers dislike that Hot Shots Part Deux was absurd too?Overall the strengths of the film deserve the attention it is a very funny parody of the overplotted actionintrigue genre it has a terrific car chase notable action sequences and a terrific JackieChanStyle fight scene at the beginning of the film's climax.Perhaps I enjoyed this movie because I had grown up watching the GI Joe cartoon series and had always been rather insulted by the fact that it managed to be both preachy and stupid at the same time. If you're looking for a great 100 minutes of parody and HUMOR I'd recommend this movie. If you're more interested in believability and suspending your disbelief this film will definitely not work for you at all. Inappropriate expectations would be the only problem I can imagine that would reduce one's enjoyment of this film.If you want a more serious Jackie Chan film you might try Drunken Master II or Police Story. But if you're looking for an enjoyable and sardonic 100 minutes this is truly one of Jackie's great vehicles.".

	schema:headline " A great actionadventure spoof";
	schema:reviewBody "Jackie Chan plays a special forces agent in this actionadventure film that is as concerned with spoofing the genre as it is with embracing it. The film starts with Chan and fellow agents descending on a convoy through the South African jungle to abscond a handful of scientists who have been working on exploiting unusual properties of a mineral found in the South African mines. With the aid of extensive training and sophisticated technological gadgetry they complete their mission successfully. But someone in the squad is double crossing them. As the men are headed for recreational leave they're sabotaged. Chan makes it out alive but barely. He hits his head and acquires amnesia. The bulk of the film has him coping with his situationhe first ends up in the middle of a traditional South African communitywhile government agents try to track him down and kill him.There are some details I could not fill in above because the primary flaw with the film and this is what brought my score down to an 8 or a B rather than a 9 or 10 is that the story is almost absurdly convoluted and difficult to glean there was also a fair amount of ridiculous English dubbing in the version I sawit was difficult to tell how intentional the problems with the dubbing may have been. But the story isn't really the point and to the extent that it is the point may be to make it absurdly convoluted and difficult to gleanthis is to a large extent a spoof after all. More important the story propels the film from one jaw dropping actionfilled set piece to the next. On a surface level at least those set pieces are the raison d'etre of Who Am I. But surprisingly perhaps Chan who codirected and cowrote the film in addition to starring in it also has a lot of interesting subtextual things to say.Most viewers will come to this film as Chan fans. As such they'll be hoping to see his trademark martial arts abilities impressive stunt work and notorious sense of humor they will not leave disappointed. During the climax Who Am I has one of the longer extended martial arts sequences in any Chan film and it unexpectedly gets back to the basics. For at least ten minutes Chan fights just two big baddies who are close matches in skill. He uses relatively few props and relies very little on moving about his environment in fancy ways.Of course there are plenty of props and a lot of wellchoreographed complicated blocking elsewhere. A few of these more ostentatious scenes are intentionally hilarious in their absurdity. One of the most memorable spoof scenes involves an extended car chase. Chan imports physics from an alternate universe for about half of this sequence.As an adventure film Who Am I presents a kind of James Bondlike travelogue. We go from the jungles of Malaysia doubling as South Africa to the South African plains where Chan disguises himself as a tribesman to Namibia for a crosscountry 4 x 4 race partially across what looks like the Etosha Pan to the Netherlands. Those familiar with South Africa will find it amusing that during one sequence Chan and the cohorts he picks up along the way travel from the Sun City's Lost City to downtown Johannesburg to Pretoria in a matter of minutes. But this is the movies after all and a fantastical work of fiction at that. The varied environments were very well chosen providing a lot of eye candy while also providing great fodder for comic and action scenes.While it's funny that Chan's character who is referred to as Jackie Chan at one point comes to be known as Whoami once amnesia sets in there is much more intended than a silly comic device. It's significant that the film is set in South Africa a nation with a complicated multicultural history and not a little turmoil over the same. The title isn't just a reference to amnesia or Chan's character it's a rhetorical question about cultural and ethnic identity. The members of Chan's special forces squadron were all loaded with different passports from different countries. They were told to forget their identities. It's never clear who they were where they came from or who they were working fora point is made to not let the audience know and to not even let us know whether they were good guys or not.Chan has to fit into tribal culture. He becomes associated with a Chinese race team in or near Namibia and then befriends a reporter who appears half Asian and half Caucasian. The American CIA is prominent in the film. They have their hands in every culture shown in the film. There are subtexts about globalism and how first world technology is affecting the development of nonfirst world countries. The ease of travel symbolizing ethnic mobility is a prominent theme. Chan makes sure that the film ends in the Netherlands which has had a strong presence and influence in South Africa for hundreds of years. The villainy in the film is centered on building better weapons which of course tend to be used to annihilate persons from opposing cultures or ethnicities. Cultural and ethnic identity has become far more complex in the last couple centuries than it ever was before even if it was never the clear issue that many people around the world assume it to be.That the film is able to bring up such interesting issues all while awing us with graceful action sequences and making us laugh makes Who Am I a very enjoyable experience. Chan fans shouldn't miss this one.".

For a startthe first third of the film hardly seems like a Chan film at allapart from a few comic bits of business Chan chased up a tree by a lionwhich are mostly cut from the US version anyway. Even in shortened formand with some good desert photographythe whole 'Chan finds himself among desert tribesmen' subplot seems an unnecessarily laborious way of getting into the amnesia story that becomes the main thrust of the story.Neverthelessafter this the film becomes solid Chan fare with the same fast pacing of Mr Nice Guy. There's a great car chase and while the fights are quite short as with most recent Chan filmshe spends a lot of time running away from opponentsit's good to see Chan bashed about a bithe looks very vulnerable in this film. Of course the acting is weak and some of the dialogue laughable I'm not sure I agree with the reviewer here who says it was intentionally comicbut opinions differ!while the intrigue of the amnesiaspy plot just becomes an excuse for the usual chasing around. Howeverone can almost forgive all this when the climax features a great fight on top of a skyscraper followed quite simply one of the most awesome and downright foolhardy stunts Chan has done. I won't describe it in detailjust see for yourself! You WILL be amazed.There is a sense with Who Am I that the filmmakers attempted to tell a fairly complex story and then realised they were making a Jackie Chan movie and changed it accordinglyleaving a fair bit of confusion. InterestinglyChan's original cut was around 3 hours longand maybe that made more sense and balanced the two elements of the film better. Stillthere's a lot of fun to be had here nevertherless. And just listen to Chan rap the part Englishpart Chinese theme song during the end credits.".

The strength here instead of a huge budget full of beautiful women and nifty gadgets is in the action sequences. The fight scenes are so much fun to watch and Chan's car chase is also a wonderful piece of footage with some physics involved. If you are looking for a great time with the kind of fast fighting and physical comedy that come with Jackie Chan then make sure you sit down to Who Am I? Also I will say that the final fight scene between Chan and the two toughest badies in the the bad men's stock fight is incredible.

	onyx:emotionText "Great great kung fu film. The plot is a farce on the typical James Bond fare of secret government conspiracies and evil men attempting to gain the means to take over the world. The strength here instead of a huge budget full of beautiful women and nifty gadgets is in the action sequences. The fight scenes are so much fun to watch and Chan's car chase is also a wonderful piece of footage with some physics involved. If you are looking for a great time with the kind of fast fighting and physical comedy that come with Jackie Chan then make sure you sit down to Who Am I? Also I will say that the final fight scene between Chan and the two toughest badies in the the bad men's stock fight is incredible. My favorite fight scene of all moviedom especially the man whose specialty is his incredible legwork.";

	schema:reviewBody "Some of the most exciting action movies came out in the 90's and this espionage gem is no exception as it keeps you engaged from start to finish with its deathdefying stunts  all of which don't feel as forced as they do in other Jackie Chan action flicks  and intriguing blend of humor drama and suspense. Taking place across a variety of locations including South Africa it's an adventurous epic that gives you a lot to see. The plot also unfolds primarily as a mystery keeping you guessing to the end as Jackie is trying to find out exactly why everyone from the secret police to the CIA is after him. Like most Jackie Chan films there's also a strong reliance on humor except this film doesn't have nearly as much slapstick as say Police Story to the point where it becomes annoying. The humor is carefully blended into the proceedings and even when it reaches unintentional levels it somehow makes the movie all the more enjoyable.I won't spoil the various stunts performed in the film you just have to see them to believe them but needless to say they are jawdropping. Speaking of jawdropping the rooftop fight which also serves as the final fight sequence in the film is one of the best I've ever seen. It goes on for a while but it's so well choreographed and stunningly executed that you'll want it to keep going for a few more minutes afterwards. The score by Nathan Wang while nothing remarkable fits the movie well and sometimes goes so far as to raise the excitement factor specifically during the chase sequences. It must be hard for anybody to direct themselves in a film especially in an action film on such a large scale as this one but Jackie Chan does so admirably here alongside Benny Chan. It's some of his best work of the 90's alongside Operation Condor.".

	schema:reviewBody "Amusing and colorful action movie with Jackie Chan taking on dealers who kidnap three scientists in charge of very powerful meteorite fragments . It packs a violent confrontation between Jackie and double agents from CIA . This exciting story about a secret agent also named Jackie Chan is stunningly played and efficiently directed. Chang participates in a sting operation against an international spyring that is smuggling meteorite scraps with objective to create some nuclear weapons . The secret agent loses his record after falling from a crashing chopper . The commandos were then murdered in a helicopter crash  except Jackie who fell out of the chopper . Later on  Jackie was picked up by a a tribe of South African natives  who then asked him his name . Sadly Jackie had lost his records and shouted 'Who Am I? . He is then pursued by a great number of other agency operatives but he has no idea why . This leads Jackie traveling all over the globe beginning in Africa and finishing in Rotterdan . His journey with aid from two female sidekicks Michelle Febre and Yamamoto to find out his memory leads him all the way to Rotterdam where he coincidentally learns the location of the organization that abducted the three scientists. With no record  Chan is thirsty for answers by any means necessary . The story follows him as he attempts to stay alive and chase the villain . When CIA staff is deceived by a wicked criminal traitor called the General Ed Nelson  Chan turns into an unfortunate spy  he then is also doublecrossed . A young journalist Febre helps him to track down and apprehend the gang commanded by a double agent Ron Smerczak . Then Chan looks for vengeance against the ominous villains at a cat and mouse game.This exciting movie is crammed of thrills  unstopped action  overwhelming stuntwork and lots of violence but with humor . Jackie Chan is top notch as one army man fighting a group of heinous criminals and as always he makes his own stunts like is showed on the final fakeshots . Awesome  incredible stunts and brief comic touches  as usual  the picture is better constructed than Chan's predecessors films . The lightingpaced storyline slows down at times  but frantic action sequences make up for it . Spotlights movie include a stirring car pursuit  impressive and interminable fights  breathtaking images with Chan going down a building and other extraordinary action sequences in James Bond style . This is a phenomenal action movie distinguished by nicely cinematography of the spectacular sequences  and contains agreeable sense of humor such as previous entries . However while the former outings Jackie teamed up to prestigious actresses and fine action stars in their own right  like Maggie Cheung and Michelle Khan  at this film his two parternaires  Michelle Ferre and Yamamoto are unknown . This is a passable action movie distinguished by ferocious sequences  and packs silly sense of humor as well as Jackie's subsequent entries . The picture achieves success in USA and around the world . However  Jackie Chan's failed at Boxoffice in his American debut Battle creel brawl . Chan is a hardworking actor and director throughout his long and varied career .He went on playing Cannoball  The protector and Rumble in the Bronx until getting all American success with Shangai Knights  The tuxedo  Around the world in 8days and Rush hour trilogy  and of the course the recent Karate kid. Of course  his big hits were The Police story series that won the Golden Horse Award a Chinese version of the Oscar  the first was titled Police story1985 directed by the same Chan  it was a perfect action film for enthusiastic of the genre  the following was Police story 21988also pretty violent and with abundant humor touches. It's followed by this Supercop or Police story 3 and finally Police story IV  Crime story. The picture is lavishly produced by the great Asian producers Raymond Chow and Golden Harvest production and compellingly directed by Benny Chan . Benny made various Jackie Chan vehicles as New Police storyand Robin BHood . Rating  Acceptable and passable  the picture has its sensational moments here and there  but also pretty violent and with abundant humor touches mostly provided by its agile star  the super Jackie . It's a perfect action film for enthusiast of the genre .".

	schema:reviewBody " out of Despite boasting one of the silliest nonhorror titles I've heard Who Am I? is one of Jackie Chan's best movies.  No seriously.  This straighttocable release deserved a better fate than it received for it's really a funny exciting popcorn martial arts action flick that's truer to the Jackie Chan we all know and love than most of his other recent theatrically released films The Shanghai series the Rush Hour flicks The Tuxedo and The Medallion.  There's no wisecracking smartmouthed partner and even better no magical powers andor costumes that require the extensive use of wirework.  Who Am I? is oldfashioned Chan with a slicker look and higher production values.The plot's more of the same usual nonsense but with a slightly more paranoid edge.  Chan stars as a secret agent who loses his memory after falling from a helicopter.  He's adopted by an African tribe who dubs him WhoamI because those are the first words he says.  After learning their culture and language he eventually leaves to discover his real identity and his past.  But what do you know just as soon as he's reached a city everybody's looking to kill him and he's stuck with an annoying reporter Michelle Ferre who isn't all that she says she is.Who Am I? boasts the usual flaws of a Jackie Chan flick.  The plot's inconsequential the acting's atrocious and the dialogue is painful to listen to.  Jackie even delivers a violence and greed is bad' speech to the villains word of advice Jackie if you're going to deliver such a goofysounding and somewhat nave statement you should make certain you've got the strong plot to back it up in the first place.  The only thing that generally separates the quality of Chan's Hong Kong work is the quantity and quality of the action and humor.  In this case the first half is admittedly somewhat slow but peppered with a few genuinely funny if not also rather silly moments that keeps the film from bogging down.I could have done entirely without Michelle Ferre whose awful performance ranks as one of the worst I've ever seen.  Not only is she unconvincing as a journalist but the movie goes on to reveal that she's actually a CIA agent! Her presence does little more than hinder Jackie's usual charms and provides the plot with a deus ex machine resolution.But the rest of the stuff is mostly bearable enough to get into the action. There are three major fight scenes the early one with Jackie handcuffed behind his back is pretty nifty but also a tad short.  The battle in the city streets is innovative and there's a wild car chase too.  But the entire selling point of the picture is its climactic tenminute twoonone martial arts battle which is elaborate thrilling and quite cleverly humorous.  This is probably the best pure fight scene I've seen in any of Jackie Chan's films and goes a long way in making some of the earlier flaws forgivable.".

Good porn is about the ACTING. And so is a good Jackie Chan movie.In his movie making vision over and over again in scene after scene Chan reveals that he is a Marxist of the Groucho variety.

And with that he makes the gesture that resolves the emptiness and meaninglessness of any interpretation of his drama and flies off in the setting sun of the last true hero. And then... The cherry on the top of the meringue on top of the shards of titanium sundae that is the life of the live Mangaboy of action adventure outtakes which provide background the end title credits. My favorite moment is Jackie teaching 'native' African children the Macarena. This man is COMMITTED to your entertainment and I for one say thank you Jackie Chan.".

Although the plot is somewhat simplistic this is to be expected and it's really just an excuse to stage three excellent extended action sequences which are superbly choreographed and a delight to watch. Like previous Hong Kong Chan films the movie takes in international locations here using location shooting in South Africa and Holland to add to the great effect. Although the acting is only adequate the physical humour and martial arts shine through and make this one to watch. Jackie Chan is in his prime and as always puts his all into the production.The first really notable action comes when a handcuffed Chan must escape from a gang of shady secret service men some great stunts follow including a fine car chase and plenty of shooting and explosions. The second action sequence is a chase through the streets and involves some fine comedy involving clogs. The final and best piece of action is the twentyminute long finale which involves a tremendous martial arts bout on the rooftop of a skyscraper between Chan and two expertlytrained fighters. An awesome mix of impossible superhuman moves props dangerous situations stunts and humour follows all performed without the aid of special effects and with Jackie Chan not using a stuntman of course. All in all this is a splendid and greatly enjoyable production which doesn't let up and manages to be funny as well as exciting.".

This time the action is complemented by better acting and personal drama than usual.  The hero is chased and manipulated by several factions all of whom know more than he does. In fact all Jackie wants is to find out who he is but he never knows who to believe.

And Jackie has never been a great actor but he wasn't very good here. Seeing him scream Who Am I?????? was unintentionally funny.The movie is also INCREDIBLY SLOW for the first half hour or so. The plot is also very confusing  the fact that Jackie has amnesia just adds to the confusion. I had no idea why sometimes characters knew things. I saw the version put out by ColumbiaTriStar video  did they cut up this movie like other American producers have done for other Chan movies? This might explain things. Wasn't there supposed to be a scene with a lion? Not in the version I saw.The fight on top of the office building roof however is a fantastic fight.

	schema:reviewBody "Double Impact 1991 was my favorite childhood Van Damme movie beside Bloodsport was this movie my favorite. I grew up with this film I love this movie to death! Bolo Yeung was also in this movie as Moon Zhang's killer. The fight at the end between Van Damme and Bolo Yeung was the best just like was in Bloodsport. The story was adrenaline action packed and Van Damme played double role in here and he did an excellent job as Alex and Chad two different characters. I always loved this movie and I love the action and the fight choreographer from JeanClaude Van Damme I like his spin kick and his martial arts in this movie. Van Damme fights the same guy from Bloodsport. I love this movie a lot it is bloody full action packed fire guns.What I love in this movie is a great supporting cast Geoffrey Lewis was a great support cast as Uncle Frank who raised Chad. Alonna Shaw as Danielle Wilde was a great as Alex girlfriend. Their was one imaginary sexy scene that really did not mean anything. Corinna Everson as Kara as Griffith's bodyguard was terrific here we first time see a women who is a villain in a action movie. In the 90's I don't remember seeing any women been a villain. Corinna was a perfect choice for playing Kara. Philip Chan as Raymond Zhang was awesome he was even in John Woo's Hard Boiled and Bloodsport. The movie it self reflects more on Van Damme's life Chad was really Van Damme he was raised in Belgium in this film his character was raised in Paris but with Frank they moved to America. Now after 25.years they come back to Hong Kong in which they track down Alex together they avenge their parents death. Alex is a bad ass in this movie. He looks so scary that even I wouldn't dare to cross his path. I love Van Damme in two roles he is great. I have enjoyed this movie a lot and had a lot of fun.The contrast between the two characters of Chad and Alex is amazing. The happy go lucky playboy and the brooding street fighting bad ass. You really do get the feeling that there's two Van Dammes in the world and they're right there on screen together. And Chad is one my favorite JCVD characters he's ever played. I love the action sequences the gun play the fights and the story that works. In my opinion this movie is very underrated. It was my childhood favorite movie and it always will be.I am giving a 10 because the movie has a good action and nice martial arts but it also does have a plot hole that I don't like.".

Twenty years later the bad brother is a smuggler in HK while the good one is an aerobics instructor in Los Angeles and they team up to take revenge on the boss Philip Chan who took out their parents.There's nothing really great about Double Impact other than the immortal tagline of double the Van Damme double the Van Damage but it is a solid lowbudget actioner. The script and acting are average to say the least and the movie looks like it was made for fifty cents and a case of returnable bottles but when it comes to action Double Impact delivers the goods. The fights are among some of Van Damme's best with good choreography and tight filming and editing. Also of note are the gunfights I might be wrong but I believe that this was the first Western movie to have John Woostyle dual 9mms complete with slow motion. If you have a high tolerance for cheeseball antics or just like to make fun of them there's some good times to be had with Double Impact. I'm kind of sorry to say this but given the current anemic state of action films even middling stuff like this is much better than the crap that has been getting cranked out lately.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Muscles from Brussels takes a coproducer and cowriter credit on this routinely plotted but agreeable action picture. Van Damme plays twin boys who were orphaned in the 1960s by thugs representing some greedy white collar criminals. One of them Chad ended up in L. A. where he got to live a fairly soft life. Alex on the other hand remained in Hong Kong where he became a street smart smuggler. 25 years later their uncle Frank Geoffrey Lewis locates Alex and reunites the boys so they can have a classic bit of revenge  and reclaim what's theirs in the bargain.All of the action is watchable if never truly inspired. There's a good deal of hard hitting violence the naive Chad takes his lumps before the story is over and plenty of effective squib action  not to mention a hearty helping of explosions. The exotic Hong Kong setting certainly helps a lot as well. One sequence is particularly striking and you can see bits of that in the trailer. And there's a fairly satisfying confrontation between Van Damme and martial arts icon Bolo Yeung who plays Moon a goon who ends up with a fake eye and a nasty scar due to Franks' intervention back in the 60s.There's a certain degree of entertainment in watching Van Damme play two distinctly different characters. Thanks to some reasonably effective movie trickery  body doubles special effects and the like  we get to see the twins interacting regularly. Philip Chan as crime kingpin Raymond Zhang and Alan Scarfe as the nefarious Nigel Griffith are decent action movie baddies in the classic tradition. Both the blonde Alonna Shaw as Alex's girlfriend Danielle and the athletic brunette Corinna Everson as henchwoman Kara add much sex appeal. The eternally solid and reliable Lewis is a tremendous asset to the story lending it an appropriate amount of respectability.Double Impact may not be memorable in the end but it sure provides a nice diversion for the better part of two hours.Seven out of 10.".

Lettich knows how to get the best out of Claude in the fights sequences with a liberal and entertainingly cheesy use of slomo while Van Damme grunts and poses and jumps kicks his way through countless foes. The fights are so entertaining and they more than make up for the wooden or hamfisted acting of the cast not to mention the brainless plot and cheesy dialogue. This was written by Van Damme and really seems at times like an ego trip with some of the lines and actions that characters have. It is entertaining in that sense. What is also funny about this film is the constant posing and muscle flexing from Van Damme. This is one of his most enjoyable films because it is so fun it brings back the fun feeling from his earlier film Kickboxer.Overall this is one to watch and the fight between Van Damme and Bolo is the stuff of legend.

	schema:reviewBody "This could be argued to be one of Van Damme's best film. Not only for his amazing fight scenes but also for his acting ability along side himself. Not writing here as biased fan but seeing this film I shockingly had to admit that Van Damme was far better actor then what people gave him credit for. Story of the film is very clich of most 90's films. twins get separated at birth and one becomes a criminal while the other one becomes a goody boy. They both have to team up together to protect their family money and name. Which one or both didn't really care for before.Acting in the film was fairly good with few exceptions. But people going to see this film knew that this wasn't going to be the competition for Dances with a wolf or Jeremy Irons performance in Reversal of Fortune. The expectations was that this was going to be enjoyable film with tons of action and the possibility of having Van Damme fight Van Damme in an amazing fight scene. Which the film succeeded in. Van Damme was very clear as two different brothers who are completely different in all traits. Van Damme managed to create and contain certain ticks tricks and mannerisms for each one clear sign of a good actor. Not to mention all of the really cool fight scenes we got to see was a benefit too!!so if you are bored at home and have nothing to do feel free to give this film a go if you like 80's and 90's action type of movies you will love this.".

Not writing here as biased fan but seeing this film I shockingly had to admit that Van Damme was far better actor then what people gave him credit for. Story of the film is very clich of most 90's films. twins get separated at birth and one becomes a criminal while the other one becomes a goody boy. They both have to team up together to protect their family money and name. Which one or both didn't really care for before.Acting in the film was fairly good with few exceptions. But people going to see this film knew that this wasn't going to be the competition for Dances with a wolf or Jeremy Irons performance in Reversal of Fortune. The expectations was that this was going to be enjoyable film with tons of action and the possibility of having Van Damme fight Van Damme in an amazing fight scene. Which the film succeeded in. Van Damme was very clear as two different brothers who are completely different in all traits. Van Damme managed to create and contain certain ticks tricks and mannerisms for each one clear sign of a good actor. Not to mention all of the really cool fight scenes we got to see was a benefit too!!so if you are bored at home and have nothing to do feel free to give this film a go if you like 80's and 90's action type of movies you will love this.";

But a decent timewaster at best and for the price of one we would get two Van Damme's on screen. Twins unknowingly separated to only meet up again 25 years later. Nice. Where else could we see Van Damme beating himself up feuding over things and eventually teaming up to kickass. And there's a lot ass kicking as well gun blazing to go with the martial arts. That's John Woo style. Slow motion galore. Bullets. Blood. Bodies piling up. Add plenty of broken bones. And nose bleeds. The action is brutal and highenergy. Van Damme cops a real work out. Where he has a whole bunch of villains a gleeful Alan Scarfe and spiteful Phillip Chan their henchman and Triad gangs to get through. He goes up against an old foe Bolo Yeung of Bloodsport fame and female athlete  body builder Corinna Everson whose choice of fashion is almost upstaged by Van Damme himself. Then we got a bodyguard who uses the spurs on his boot to inflict pain. While stuck in the middle of the two Van Dammes is the always enjoyable character actor Geoffrey Lewis and the ravishing blonde Alonna Shaw. The simple plot which was cowritten by Van Damme is cleancut by setting up the motivation at the beginning and then the twins unite to seek vengeance on those involved in the murder of their parents. Also for laughs there's numerous mistaken identity scenarios Van Damme's colourful fashion sense the loverboy one and the macho script likes to have people telling others to virtually get fk. Set in Hong Kong director Sheldon Lettich who directed Van Damme a year earlier in Lionheart strikes up some local flavour amazingly tough action bursts and all at a reliable pace. Bold but standard JeanClaude Van Damme 90s action vehicle.When you find them. Bring back their bodies.".

This movie came out when I was in eighth grade and it definitely brings good memories. Every one was talking about it when it came out. It begins when a British businessman and his wife are murdered by the mafia the two twins are rescued by Frank Avery played by Geoffrey Lewis who was the family's bodyguard. Then the twins get separated one is taken by Frank the other ends up in an orphanage. 25 years later Frank decided to tell Chad played by Van Damme all about his parent's death and that he must go back to Hong Kong to find the killers. Chad meets with his twin brother Alex played also by Van Damme. One of the things that I love about this movie is that Chad and Alex have totally different personalities Chad is more like a fly boy and Alex is a street smart smuggler. The twins are always having disagreements and there's even a fight scene between Chad and Alex it was great. Also Bolo Yeung who's one of the villains of the movie he incarnates Moon the right hand of Nigel Griffith played by Alan Scarfe. The film is very entertaining packed with great martial arts action. So on a weekend buy a pizza some beers and invite some of your old high school friends and enjoy this movie.".

	schema:headline " Not very good but passable if you are in the mood for this type of thing";
	schema:reviewBody "As mere babies twins Alex and Chad are separated when their parent's are brutally murdered by Triads who had no further use for the twin's parents. One child is rescued by their nanny the other by the family's bodyguard Frank Avery. Alex grows up rough in the orphanage where his nanny leaves him and becomes a criminal in the underworld while Chad becomes a ladies' man and karate teacher under the guidance of Frank. After several decades Frank finds Alex and reunites the two brothers in time to battle the same triads who are still in business.The plot to this film opens with such violence in front of children that it alters the paths their lives were going to take. Surely this film shows the effects that young children witnessing violence can have  in this case the children are so badly affected that they both grow up to become JeanClaude Van Damme! Aside from this terrible event they come together decades later just as those that murdered their parents are doing a big deal. Of course the whole plot is silly and the whole idea behind the plot is to present two Van Damme's as some sort of major selling point  and I suppose for some it is. Ignoring a silly and rather irritating plot this film does have plenty of trademark action from it's stars? and it is just about enjoyable on that level even if there are plenty of better action films available to watch on a Saturday night in with beer!Attempts to inject drama into the film with sibling conflict and love interests are wasted and just further bog down an already limp script. Of course part of the blame for the lack of dramatic involvement must lie with Van Damme who's delivery is as reliable as ever  and this is not a compliment. His characters are given very different hairstyle because we can't rely on Van Damme's performance to be able to tell them apart. However I will be fair to him and say that he has moves and delivers two very enjoyable scenes towards the end one in shadows the other with a drum. Shaw makes for an annoying love interest  in the time honoured manner all she does is scream. Lewis is a well known face but cannot life this to be anything more than it is. Van Damme's performance is dwarfed by a laughably bad turn from Alan Scarfe as the main villain  so hammy it should have been between bread.Overall this is not a very good film but did you expect it to be? I came to expecting people to be kicked in the head and for the star to do the splits and talk with an accent and that's what I got. There are better films out there and it is far too basic to be really enjoyable but it has some good fights and exciting action albeit not enough to support the whole film. Worth seeing if you're just looking for an undemanding action movie to fill an hour or two.".

Ignoring a silly and rather irritating plot this film does have plenty of trademark action from it's stars? and it is just about enjoyable on that level even if there are plenty of better action films available to watch on a Saturday night in with beer!Attempts to inject drama into the film with sibling conflict and love interests are wasted and just further bog down an already limp script. Of course part of the blame for the lack of dramatic involvement must lie with Van Damme who's delivery is as reliable as ever  and this is not a compliment. His characters are given very different hairstyle because we can't rely on Van Damme's performance to be able to tell them apart. However I will be fair to him and say that he has moves and delivers two very enjoyable scenes towards the end one in shadows the other with a drum. Shaw makes for an annoying love interest  in the time honoured manner all she does is scream. Lewis is a well known face but cannot life this to be anything more than it is. Van Damme's performance is dwarfed by a laughably bad turn from Alan Scarfe as the main villain  so hammy it should have been between bread.Overall this is not a very good film but did you expect it to be? I came to expecting people to be kicked in the head and for the star to do the splits and talk with an accent and that's what I got. There are better films out there and it is far too basic to be really enjoyable but it has some good fights and exciting action albeit not enough to support the whole film. Worth seeing if you're just looking for an undemanding action movie to fill an hour or two.";

It was indeed one of the best damn martial arts movies I've seen around that time because at that time range there were nothing but action flicks being released to theaters here and there. Double Impact is one of my most favorite Van Damme flicks not only because he plays twin brothers in the film but because there's plenty of action to look for. Most movies that were made with an actor playing twins it would usually be a disappointment since they could never get the other person to like the same actor.....O.K. I admit I was a little disappointed when I spotted the fake Van Damme trying to kick at Alex but missed by kicking the wall. My 3 favorite scenes in the film are 1.When Alex gives Chad a good evening greeting from a headbutt. 2.The final showdown between Chad and MoonBolo Yeunga great villan. 3.The brawlforall between Chad and Alex. Double Impact will always be in my videodvd collection. But anytime there's a Van Damme film hitting either the big screen or the little screen you know what to expect nothing but dodging fire balls doing 360 degree spinning heel kicks etc. you get the picture. But hey at least you didn't see one of the Van Dammes smearingor trying to fade away from the image like it was cheaply done on a computer such as the 2 Jackie Chans did in Twin Dragons.".

Many use the documentary 'Woodstock 3 Days of Peace and Music' as the ultimate example of a musicdoco but whilst the music in The Last Waltz is actually on par with the great performances of Woodstock bar Jimi Hendrixthere's no substitute the thing which elevates The Last Waltz is the photography.This was the first music doco to be shot on 35mm and watching the concert you'd think that each performance was carefully choregraphed over a few weeks of shooting rather than over one night. Special thanks must be given to Cinematogrpaher Michael Chapman for his efforts on this film. The look of the film is what elevates it's overall appeal because the music was always going to be epic especially with the cavalcade of great names performing. This is just great filmmaking from contemporary cinema's most accomplished filmmaker. And how about that haunting theme that both starts and ends the film. Just great.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was only a name to me until I saw it last year. Immediately I was riveted by everything about it. I've always been a casual fan of The Band and of Levon Helm in particular. However I'd never been bowled over by Bob Dylan except as a songwriter so much of The Band's work remained unknown to me as well. I wouldn't say I've become a rabid fan but I am much more interested in their work now.It's a Scorsese filmhow could it not be beautifully photographed but Scorsese managed a difficult feat he keeps himself out of the movie except as interviewer during those sequences. This is not really Scorese's vision of a rock concert. It happened mostly organically certainly with mistakes gaffes and grit. This is part of its charm. There are better singers than the guys in The Band but few better musicians. This can be illustrated with Robbie Robertson in the Clapton song Clapton's guitar strap comes off and Robertson with one beat picks right up on the solo. It looked planned but wasn't. Joni Mitchell was notoriously hard to back up due to her original guitar tuning and ragged song phrasing but bassist Rick Danko fills in every space with intricate bass figuring. Perhaps we have become too accustomed to the overwrought overhyped overproduced overexposed shiny gack that passes for popular music to appreciate the raw the imperfect the sheer humanness of this music. Scorsese shows it all. The guys in The Band were largely worn out and sometimes strung out in the interviews. They are tired scrawny emptyeyed from the excesses of the road. Rick Danko is hovering on the ragged edge as his band is dissolved and he says his goal is to keep busy. Richard Manuel looks lost as he says I just want to break even. These are two musicians who desperately needed the music but who were murdered by the road. We see their bleak destinies in their eyes in this film. It is bittersweet certainly but also a moment in time crystallized into something great by the music the love of friends the willingness of the director to simply stand back and allow the music to happen. It also reminds us what good music used to sound like and makes me wish could exist again.".

Well try for a moment to forget that the actual performance itself features the great artists it does including The Band and focus on the film itself.This film is shot in 35mm format which gives the picture pristine look as opposed to all other previous rock films which were shot on 16mm. But it's not just a spralling work this is also well executed as well. By that I mean the production value is outstanding. The lighting is unlike any rock concert I've seen and I've seen many. The camera work is topnotch apparently it was done by the best in Hollywood at the time. It's also easy to see that a great deal of planning went into the production. Other concert films Woodstock Monterey Pop suffer from a last minute scramble look that simply isn't there with Waltz.Add to that the shear magnitude of what The Band had undertaken. Imagine learning arranging and performing so many songs in so many styles by so many artists in one night with only one take of each allowed. When that is taken into consideration you have to have a degree of respect for them. Of course I'm bias. I'm Canadian as were 45ths of The Band.My only critique would be a technical one. It seems Rick Danko redubbed all of his bass playing. Whether this is attributed to a technical problem or unhappiness with his performance is unclear. However what is clear is that what you hear the bass doing in the audio and what you see on the screen are completely different.".

And all I can say is that it hasn't lost any of its power. And this from someone who's never been to a live rock concert. The stars of the film the allpurpose backup and touring band called 'The Band' give a simple but enlightening insight to the mechanics of their 16 years on the road and how their Thanksgiving Day final concert in San Francisco turned into a revivallike celebration. Even though I grew up on jazz music more so than rock I can fully appreciate The Band's intense immense music background influenced by everything from blues to country to folk music. As for the concert itself you have the likes of Neil Young Ron Wood Joni Mitchell Van Morrison Muddy Waters and Dr. John who gives a standout honkytonk performance of Such A Night kickin' it on stage before it's all over. And if these live performances weren't enough there are additional performances done on a sound stage with artists that weren't part of the live show woven into the 117minute film a fabulous folkgospel jam session of the song The Weight teamed with the Staples Singers lead by Mavis Staples who sounds very Gladys Knightlike and about thirty minutes later shifting gears into the lovely folk ballad Evangeline replete with fiddle mandolin and acoustic guitar from Emmylou Harris. Also cool is Muddy Waters bluesing on Ain't that a Man and the finale with all the artists of I Shall Be Released. You just might be.".

	schema:headline " A decent historic look at 1960s music on its last leg";
	schema:reviewBody "I have seen this film several times and will never tire of it. The music is fantastic the performances are good and Scorsese's overall intent is subtly presented. As the title suggests this is a filmic record of The Band's final performance but more importantly it is a window into the coming decline of contemporary popular music. It is the last stand of the glory days of old. The various performers that you see on stage are in the latter days of their once great careers and even though many would continue on for years even decades to come the central premise that the late 70s was really the 60s on its deathbed rings true. This is especially notable in the various interviews where we notice that the musicians themselves seem quite oblivious to the reality that their time is all but up in terms of their importance or prominence to the public. Robbie Robertson is asked by Scorsese if he thinks this is the end or not. Robertson replies that it is the beginning of the end of the beginning. As the 80s would rapidly prove Scorsese's thesis is accurate. The period that followed would prove to be less creative musically speaking but for a few bands like U2 etc. who would survive the downturn in the quality of the music that came out of that later period. Scorsese presents the music that he loves played by the principle people that we admired. In light of the transition that was taking place from disco and new wave to rap and worse this film is more than a footnote to a once proud and glorious musical heritage. Don't listen to the detractors. Watch the movie and listen to the performances. It is not the greatest film of its kind  I would rather watch The Song Remains the Same  but it is what it is a film of the times made by a man who had sensitivity to the times on time! Very often we don't notice that something is lost until after it happens. Scorsese noticed while it was happening and that by itself is quite astute of him and puts him in a league with journalists who have their ear to the ground.".

Watching Muddy Waters quiver with emotion Eric Clapton's fingers flying across the neck of his guitar while Robbie Robertson struggles to keep up and Neil Diamond on the cusp of his middleaged womenall arena two decade tour trying desperately to fit in with the real musicians all make this worth the price of admission.  What a joy to see Neil Young with Joni Mitchell on backup play Helpless and seem to be having such a great time.  While all the anger now Neil?  This may be the last time Bob Dylan actually sang his songs.  Now he just whines nasally.  The real showstopper is Van Morrison belting out Caravan unlike any other. Watch for all of the onstage dynamics of an unrehearsed concert. Quite a difference from 'n Sync!!  My favorite part is watching Robbie Robertson manuever for maximum camera time.  He has always been the male Streisand ... desperate for privacy but the ultimate promoter.  Watching Scorcese interview Robertson at the beginning is very insightful.  Robertson constants wants him to ask that one again so he can provide a better answer.  Just a mesmerizing couple of hours that is well worth your time even if you never really understood The Weight.".

This is certainly not the case.The idea of the Band in my opinion was for them to be a band with five equal members.  Mr. Marty Scorsese obviously didn't think so.  He must have been under the impression that the Band was a star vehicle for Robbie Robertson like history has written and not the group of equal musicians that slowly waltzed out of Big Pink.Like Levon Helm said in his book the band was based on the heart and soul of Richard Manuel the genius of Garth Hudson the songwriting of robbie robertson the hopping rythm of Rick Danko's bass all pulled together by the tight rythms of Levon and Richard.  On top of all that the three best vocalists in rock music none of which are robbie robertson.Even though half of the film is robbie singing his heart out from behind his ever changing Hollywood wardrobe he is singing into a microphone that was turned off.  Meanwhile you hear an amazing voice that comes from nowhere that you assume to be his but it belongs to the late Richard Manuel who is made to look like a clown in this movie.As far as Scorsese's interview segments go you've got four guys who don't want to be where they are talking about some things they don't want to talk about with an interviewer that they couldn't care less if they never saw again.  Then you have robbie robertson trying his best to turn the interview segments into a Hollywood career which must have come to a complete halt when everyone saw his performance in the Crossing Guard.It's a shame that this is how these folks are remembered on screen at least when footage exists of much finer concerts in Japan Without robertsonthat were never officially released.  Part of the reason for this is that the rest of the Band didn't have the love for business and money that robertson pumped into the Last Waltz.  With the exception of Manuel who hung himself on a shower rod after a modest turn out at a small venue the rest of the Band would've been happy playing anywhere for the rest of their lives.  And basically they all did.Sorry if this got a little off track.Buy the albums starting from Music From Big Pink before you ever watch this movie!".

The music of course is fantastic.  Great artists like Eric Clapton Bob Dylan Joni Mitchell and Neil Young make appearances to help The Band celebrate its final concert in San Francisco.  Annecdotes are present throughout the film and are an absolute treat to watch.The one interesting thing I noticed though is that the audience is never seen and only heard sporadically.  Scorcese did a fabulous job of leaving this staple of live music out to focus on The Band and give the film a very intricate and personal feel to it.  Even though The Band called it quits from touring after 15 years with this Last Waltz it is easy to tell how much they enjoyed the road and how they all are ready for a change in lifestyle.  This film also serves as a great historical piece that displays classic rock artists.  Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys rockumentaries.  1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers herein Rock and Roll despite its selfdescribed rebellion is about order. Blues is also about  order slightly but emotionally and predictably outside of order. They are both like a bad  marriage  charming at first but tedious in the long run. Country music and its incarnation in folk was then about storytelling. Some time around  '66 Bob and Paul and John and Brian and some others started writing music cinematically. Some of the Beatles songs come from directly movies 'All you Need is  Love is from South Pacific for instance. But all of the later Beatles songs and Dylan  songs from this period beginning with Tambourine Man started life as cinematic  visions stories in pictures translated into lyrics and energy. For a good while there cinematic music was a strong contender for our imagination in  the music marketplace with The Band as the lead vehicle. That's in part because of the  mix of Garth Hudson and Levon Helm. Garth is all about discovered disorder. He calls it  jazz because something similar often happens there but disorder in the popular media  is something else Garth's vocabulary is all about lyrics with unexpected emphasis of the ordinary. It is blues outside the lines allowed by the tradition and jazz within street  signs. It is beat made pretty. His inspiration is John Ford's innovation Ford took a dull  bad cowboy actor and taught him how in Stagecoach to utter his lines with an  unexpected cadence. Thus began a tradition of performance jazz in film acting which  Garth adapts and exploits. Helm is a storyteller from a family of storytellers. The two Helm and Hudson together  have crafted a novel and lasting entry in the art of cinematic music stories whose  rhythms in telling are different enough that they establish a sort of aural camera. The  other members of the band are talented enough but act primarily as transferral agents  from other innovators and traditions rather than innovating themselves. Dylan was the primary experimenter in our age of language mostly in sounds rather  than cadence until he met The Band while recuperating from a neardeath experience.  When he tied in with them magic happened stories cadence poetry merged all  cinematically rooted  and it transformed us all. Every one of us of a certain age passed  through the portal of this music following the progress through underground copies of  the basement tapes and nearly unreadable late generation xeroxes of stolen galleys of Tarantula. This tradition of cinematic music with disordered cadence has been abandoned by the  later Dylan even in singing older songs. It is continued and extended in its pure form by  Joni and Van and was picked up as goofy irony by The Police Talking Heads and some  Genesis. But it is now all but dead and has been appropriated as soap opera by today's  socalled country music. This concert was the end and we all knew it even then.  Compare the novel odd phrasing of the recording of Forever Young to his earnest but flat phrasing here. Is it his conscious surrender or something else? As with music so always with cinema there was a similar battle in the world of film for  control over our imagination. The notion of characterinformed rhythmic storytelling was  led by Scorsese and Coppola. It is a deeply Italian tradition as compared to more  layered and experimental narrative traditions. That's why Scorsese wanted to do this and  why he succeeds so admirably it is cinematic music finally expressed in cinema his  variety of cinema. It is his only successful story. Is this the best concert film? Yes in fact it may be the only honest film of a concert  possible because the songs come to the film as the film comes to them. They probably  never will again. Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first time I saw The Last Waltz I was about fourteen and my best friend and I had just started our own little garage band. My mum was watching The Last Waltz on AE as I recall and she made us watch it with her saying OK you kids want to be musicians then you need to see this! We had no idea who any of these performers were...hell to us Bob Dylan at that time was just the guy who'd smoked up The Beatles! Well I was impressed then even though it took me about another ten years or so to get into The Band Dylan Neil Young etc all of whom are among my favourite artists today. The Last Waltz is of course Martin Scorsese's documentary of The Band's final concert at Winterland in San Fran on Thanksgiving 1976. After sixteen years of being on the road with all the hard living and extra baggage that that entails they'd decided to pack it in or at least Robbie Robertson had as history has shown. And they decided to go out with a bang inviting practically all of their musical associates to join them Dylan Young Eric Clapton Joni Mitchell Ronnie Hawkins who had after all given them their first big break years and years before Van Morrison Muddy Waters and even Neil Diamond to name a few. Probably the greatest preLive Aid gathering ever on one stage. So you can be guaranteed that music will be top notch aside from The Band's own classics The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down The Shape I'm In Ophelia It Makes No Difference...even a new studioshot version of The Weight featuring The Staples Singers you get Dylan doing Forever Young Neil Young's Helpless Joni Mitchell's Coyote Van The Man's Caravan...a veritable 70's California rock wet dream.Ah yes...the seventies...as timeless as the majority of the music performed at The Last Waltz is practically everything else about it just screams 1976. Especially the costumes lots of bellbottoms butterfly collars and plaid on display. Richard Manuel The Band's pianist R.I.P. and Don Cherry must have the same tailor what with their taste for tacky suits. Along with the 70's clothes is the 70's cocaine with which this concert just reeks of I practically get a coke buzz just watching it and I detest cocaine!. Apparently Scorsese and Robertson spent quite a bit of their own money just to rotoscope a big chunk of blow hanging from Neil Young's nose. To their credit as high as EVERYBODY involved seems to be the performances are great even if according to Levon Helm The Band's drummer a lot of postproduction overdubs took place...I've heard the bootleg of the actual concert and you really can't tell. For what makes The Last Waltz so special is how well The Band meshed and their onstage interaction. Here were five guys who were utterly simpatico with one another musically...if there is a such thing as musical mindreading these guys could do it which explains how they could back up Bob Dylan so well. In my opinion the only other band that comes close to this kind of interaction is Led Zeppelin...and arguably The Band pulled it off better. The sum indeed made up more than the parts which makes the Helmled 80's reunions such a letdown.Having said that the biggest drawback to The Last Waltz is how it is more or less presented as The Robbie Robertson Show. Sure Robbie's a hell of a songwriter and guitarist but it cracks me up to no end watching him sing into that unplugged microphone 'cos the man can't really sing...at least not compared to Manuel Helm or Rick Danko whose performance of It Makes No Difference is for me the song of the night. Robertson gets the most camera time both onstage and during the interviews though the other four guys have their share of insights as well during Scorsese's interviews even if Danko is stoned silly and Manuel is hammered. Still The Last Waltz is Robbie's trip just like Let It Be is Paul McCartney's show.Still all told The Last Waltz and The Band in general is really musician's music and deservedly so. Heh heh...one of my exes who is not musically minded watched The Last Waltz with me once and couldn't understand all the fuss she complained a lot of the music was too slow. Are you nuts?! I said...we broke up not long after actually. I still make it a point to watch this film at least four or five times a year and always ask myself What the hell has happened to popular music since then?...my musical era with only a handful of exceptions ends at about 1980...I have no tolerance for nowadays greedmotivated pop CRAP. Artists like The Band epitomize artistic integrity which seems to be as dead as John Lennon these days.By the way...the fact that The Last Waltz was directed by Martin Scorsese probably the greatest filmmaker of modern times is just a great big bonus! Marty's got impeccable taste in music...I'd love to check out his record collection.".

	onyx:emotionText "The first time I saw The Last Waltz I was about fourteen and my best friend and I had just started our own little garage band. My mum was watching The Last Waltz on AE as I recall and she made us watch it with her saying OK you kids want to be musicians then you need to see this! We had no idea who any of these performers were...hell to us Bob Dylan at that time was just the guy who'd smoked up The Beatles! Well I was impressed then even though it took me about another ten years or so to get into The Band Dylan Neil Young etc all of whom are among my favourite artists today. The Last Waltz is of course Martin Scorsese's documentary of The Band's final concert at Winterland in San Fran on Thanksgiving 1976. After sixteen years of being on the road with all the hard living and extra baggage that that entails they'd decided to pack it in or at least Robbie Robertson had as history has shown. And they decided to go out with a bang inviting practically all of their musical associates to join them Dylan Young Eric Clapton Joni Mitchell Ronnie Hawkins who had after all given them their first big break years and years before Van Morrison Muddy Waters and even Neil Diamond to name a few.

I don't want to repeat great things that have been said many times over about this movie. The only comment I want to make is about all the negative comments about Neil Diamond. I am not a big fan of his or anything but I enjoy some of his material. If you watch the film closely and pay attention Robbie Robertson explains the reason Neil was invited to perform was that they both got their start as struggling songwriters in Tin Pan Alley in the early 1960's. Their music styles may have gone off in different directions but it is the same as renewing a high school friendship at a reunion when your lives are now different. Don't put him down. It was a good performance Dry Your Eyes and not one of his real pop numbers. As far as the actual shooting of the movie one of my favorite parts is the side shot of Robbie and Rick as they sing Up On Cripple Creek and the lens switches focus on each guy. Not something you see on any other Rock documentary. Definitely a Scorcese touch! Van Morrison kicks ASS on Caravan!".

They are incredible musicians and arrangers who fill the spaces between guest performances with their outstanding work. One of the highlights comes away from the actual concertthat is Emmylou Harris doing a rendition of Evangeline with the Band in the background featuring Levon Helm harmonizing shot in a cold kind of lighting mysterious and a contrast to the festive being of the concert. It fades off and the applause comes up. It is quite eerie.I really enjoyed Neil Younghis manic presence and the haunting voice on Helpless. I can't wait to get this on DVD.

	schema:reviewBody "It was over twentyfive years ago on November 26 1976 Robbie Robertson decided that his highly successful and popular group named The Band should end their sixteen years of tours and being together at Bill Graham's Winterland Arena in San Francisco.  It was the most obvious choice to choose the Winterland since it was the first place The Band made their solo debut without their original front man Ronnie Hawkins and later Bob Dylan.     The concert was to be a small event which later got bigger and bigger. The Band got Ronnie Hawkins to appear for the show as well as Bob Dylan. Other big name acts followed Neil Young Joni Mitchell Eric Clapton Van Morrison Dr. John Neil Diamond Muddy Waters Ron Wood and Ringo Starr. This small event turned into something more meaningful and Robertson had a excellent idea to document this special event and have Martin Scorsese be in charge of it.      THE LAST WALTZ is the name of the final concert for The Band and the name of the film.  It features the concert performance at the Winterland some interviews with each member of The Band discussing their history and telling stories and features three masterpiece footage of the Band performing on a MGM studio soundstage where Scorsese had control to use track shots and rotating track shots.      Along with WOODSTOCK and LET IT BE THE LAST WALTZ is one of the best rock n' roll documentaries ever!  It has the energy and excitement that one would have after attending a concert in person.  What makes this film even better but some critics Roger Ebert mainly argue that you don't see the crowds reaction.  Scorsese and Robertson defend that complaint with this movie is about the concert not the people.  And that is true.  Why would anyone want to watch the audience during a live concert.  When I watch a show 85 of the time I'm watching the performer 15 I would talk to the person that I am with sharing that experience.  I don't watch other people and that was a very clever move on Scorsese's part which makes you feel that you are watching the concert.     The performances are outstanding.  If your feet are tapping along with the beat by the Band's second song Up on Cripple Creek you might want to check your pulse.  Another standout live performance by the Band is Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.  The performances by the guests are also good. Dr. John's Such A Night is enjoyable Bob Dylan's Forever Young is well done although he should have given second thought for his wardrobe and Van Morrison's Caravan also gives out an impressive amount of energy. But I found three performances in the film that stood out one was live the other two were filmed for the movie.  Neil Young's Helpless shows that Young had just as much energy then as he does now which is what makes him one of the best musicians ever.  As for the two audience absent performances that were filmed at MGM studios in Culiver City it might not have the cheers and hooting that a audience would give but they are just as powerful.  When The Band performs their signiture song The Weight with The Staples you are entertained by not only the song but by the way Scorsese has the camera move around the stage and edits a different memember of The Band at approprate times with the song.  The other excellent song was the then new Evangeline which The Band performed with Emmylou Harris.  The tracking shot showing the members of The Band playing different instruments and Harris singing with them to such a beautiful song would give any person goosebumps who is watching.  And it shows that The Band was highly talented by not only playing their usual instruments but by having drummer Levon Helm who usually plays the drums playing the mandolin and paniast Richard Manuel playing the drums and later the slide gituar.      For anyone who loves music filmmaking or documentaries THE LAST WALTZ is a definite classic!  And for those who love the music of The Band or any of it's guest musicians would also love it as well.  Had Alan Parker actually shot the live concert footage of Pink Floyd's THE WALL and released it that would have been the best concert movie ever.  But since it wasn't this film is a very exceptional subsitute. Don't miss it!!!!!  out of five".

All the performances are great but the highlights are Joni singing backup for Neil Young Van Morrison putting in a spirited performance The Band and the Staples Singers doing an incredible The Weight and Bob Dylan coming out near the end to bring it all back home. Their original mentor Ronnie Hawkins shows up to do a song with them Dr. John gives his 'Nawlins flavor Muddy Waters puts in a great performance Ferlinghetti and McClure round it out with their poetry. A Beatle and a Stone also show up for the party...In between some of the songs The Band is interviewed by Scorsese about life on the road and why they decided to call it quits at that time.The music is also available in a CD box set.".

It's an incredible tribute to these five musicians and their ability to not only play by themselves but also back up some of the biggest names in popular music including Bob Dylan Eric Clapton Van Morrison Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. If it was merely a video about the concert the movie would have good enough but the interviews taken a few days afterwards tell a story of their own which show the interesting story behind the Band. It is a shame though that the movie seems to focus so much on Levon Helm and Robbie Robertson in particular as the shots with Rick Danko Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel seemed to tell a story that could only be half told as a result. One of the most touching moments in the interviews is when Danko is showing Scorsese around the studio and telling him how he's trying to keep busy. It is easy to see from these sort of moments why Robertson says at the end of the film why the road is a goddamn impossible way of life. This is a movie for any lover of good music as it shows the story behind one of the most influential groups of the time and the respect they had from their peers.".

To begin with the obvious Federica is rich. Richer than most of us can imagine being. So rich her mother tells her kids You have no right to cry you've got everything. She goes through life with a sense of guilt asking herself what she's done to deserve such wealth and how she can justify her existence and avoid becoming a useless parasite.Our notquiteheroine chooses to write plays learn ballet and be nice to everyone. She never outgrows the wellbehaved little girl she was long ago retaining a permanent smile and a squeaky voice. Even her boyfriend is a nearperfect embodiment of her bad conscience a socialist history teacher who sings the International at the wheel of her Jaguar. Naturally Federica joins right in. Even when they quarrel after he tells her he considers her writing a hobby not work she doesn't really defend herself. Instead she keeps having escapist fantasies of a perfect world where rich and poor live in harmony. The ridiculous episode mentioned in the Reel Film review where her parents have a congenial dinner with her kidnappers is obviously such a fantasy and meant to be absurd.Apparently the actordirector drew heavily on her own life for this story. Her own wealthy family moved to Paris after the Red Brigades started abducting rich kids. Federica's mother is played by BruniTedeschi's real mother and God knows how she got her to do it!. I admire the director for the courage it must have taken to make a film so personal and with so much potential for misunderstanding and ridicule. I also admire the actress for her precarious charm. Do go see this one if you have a Really Rich friend who agonizes over money. Thereafter please present said friend with a bio of George Soros.".

	schema:reviewBody "That's what is written in the Gospel and it could be a metaphorical illustration for the tail end of the film with a surrealist odor.By her simple acting her easily recognizable voice Valeria BruniTedeschi has become one of the most endearing actresses in the landscape of French cinema. When a viewer watches one of her films he often keeps her in mind and so far she followed an honorable and occasionally rough road in cinema. She was superb to Franois Ozon's in 5x2 2004 and Le Temps Qui Reste 2005 and to the couple Olivier DucastelJacques Martineau Crustacs et Coquillages 2005 but her acting and her game sometimes played tricks on her. Claude Chabrol made a mistake by giving her the role of a womancop in his already mediocre Au Coeur Du Mensonge 1999. Because of her highpitched voice she made her part ludicrous. Another setback was with Ah! Si j'tais Riche 2002 because she fell into her own caricature.Well if she was rich she wouldn't be the happiest person in the world. It is well known money can't buy happiness and here in the case of Frederica quite rightly so. She's the daughter of a rich immigrated Italian family who left Italy to settle in Paris and lives with her boyfriend Pierre JeanHugues Anglade. She writes plays has dancing lessons and has rather difficult relationships with her family particularly her sister Bianca Chiara Mastroianni. What doesn't make things easy is that she constantly has a heavy feeling of guilt due to the wealth of her social background. Moreover she found back a onetime lover Denis Podalyds who has a crush on her again and galvanizes her to live with him again. Soon she's going to inherit her father's fortune and this makes her only more edgy. Her solution to relieve her strained spirit? To confess to her priest whose trouble go beyond him. Yes poor little rich girl Frderica struggles to find sense to her life...For the topic of her first directing Valria BruniTedeschi didn't complicate the issue. She took as a source of inspiration her own memories of a childhood spent in a posh rich world. Some aspects of the persona she developed throughout her film must have been the same she she felt once in her past life. Like a good number of beginners who have a stab at directing for the very first time the quality of her work is uneven spotty. It's like a patchwork of a little desultory sequences sometimes badly meshed. She moves on from one scene to another without logical link. A certain scattering brings out of the film which also could have gained by being curtailed of about half an hour and being more tightened and pithy. Some moments also smell improvisation and directing is often flabby but thanks to the degree of contribution of the actressdirector in his film the audience never loses the thread of the steps in Frederica's agitated life. Her quirky scheme evolves on two directions centered on imagination and reality to better render in images Frederica's edgy spirit. So it gives whimsical moments like the last scene with the man in the park who got Frederica pregnant but also oddball animation sequences. The best one being the first one when she tries in her imagination to make the camel go through the eye of a needle and it's not easy! But her vivid dreamy world is also interspersed with childhood flashbacks. All this to flee from a sultry familial atmosphere and not to think too much of such a big amount of dough...Valria BruniTedeschi also grabs the viewer's attention when she evokes the insurmountable frontiers between social classes. Three conspicuous sequences the first one when she and Pierre are with an estate agent in a flat and they talk about price of the rent. Frederica for you it's too much for me it's not enough.... The second one takes place when they have lunch at Frederica's parents'. Pierre a socialist history teacher unveils his very tumultuous past before this posh world. The last scene in the queue when Pierre enumerates some rules of the aristocratic world which reminded me of Jean Renoir's magnum opus la Rgle Du Jeu 1939. Still on the plus side Frederica's stormy even violent relations with her bilious sister filmed in a hardhitting way. Did Valria BruniTedeschi have similar relation in her past life? Possible... But she kept a certain tenderness for her characters and there's a deadpan humor which suffuses in her work.For her first directing she gathered a bevy of estimable thespians Denis Podalyds who curiously is often typecast in the same genre of character as the actressdirector clumsy bashful but always endearing it's evident in his brother Bruno's films. Chiara Mastroianni Lambert Wilson shine and perhaps the best of the batch JeanHugues Anglade. This good cast makes up a bit for the drawbacks previously quoted.Valria BruniTedeschi's first film isn't exempted of drawbacks which are pertaining to a good pack of actors who have a stab at directing for the first time but it certainly doesn't deserve such a lowly 5.4 out of 10. It commands sympathy and if she is in your straitjacket of favorite contemporary French actresses Il est Plus Facile Pour Un Chameau... has your name on it and might appeal to you. Her career as a filmmaker rather starts under auspicious skies. She collected the Louis Delluc prize for her work maybe would it be bad to relinquish this direction...".

It was cowritten and directed by Valeria Bruni Tedeschi. Tedeschi also stars in the movie.You have to accept the basic premise that Federica Tedeschi is awash in guilt because she's rich. In fact the title of the film is derived from the Gospels of Matthew Luke and John. Jesus told a young rich man that it's easier for a camel to get through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to go to paradise. Federica goes to a priest to confess that she's guilty of being rich and he quotes this Gospel passage.Tedeschiwho was indeed raised as a rich childdirects herself as a very insecure timid woman who lacks confidence in her own abilities. This is in contrast to Chiara Mastroianni who plays her sister Bianca. Bianca is always on the verge of hysteria but she has plenty of confidence.Flawed protagonists can make a plot interesting. Tedeschi almost gets there but for me Federica is not really someone I could care about. All this money and no creative way to spend it. In fact the only person with whom I really identified in the movie was Federica's lawyer portrayed by Souzan Chirazi. She tells Federica If you have too much money start a hospital in Africa.However Federica would never get her act together to do anything that practical. She loves her dance class she sort of loves her partner and also her former lover she deals with her sick father and the rest of her family and she continually visits the priest until he tells her that he's a priest not a psychologist.We saw this film on the small screen where it worked very well. It has a dreadful IMDb rating of 5.6. It's not a great movie but it's not that bad. I gave it a 7. If you're looking for a unusual film with an unusual protagonist you could do worse.".

Stiller was actually entertaining and I was enjoying watching him Mr Wilson was very good and I got the vibe that the characters gelled as the ones in the TV series did.

Captain Doby Fred Williamson can't stand either of them but hits upon the brilliant idea of pairing them. When they begin investigating a murder that has ties to a prominent millionaire the best qualities of each just might start influencing the other.Although I always wait to read others' reviews and comments until I've seen a film and written my own review I do not want to be swayed or influenced in any way by other opinions I can imagine that quite a few people would not like Starsky and Hutch. To really enjoy it one would have to alter their expectations to what director Todd Phillips has chosen to deliver insteada clever film that is both an absurdist spoof and a respectful faithful homage at the same time. Creating that combination is a difficult feat but Phillips was largely successful.The combination means that Starsky and Hutch is not aiming to be overthetop hilarious and it's also not aiming to be overly consistent with the characters and tone of the original pilot film and series. Viewers expecting either are likely to be a bit disappointed. However if you're a fan of gritty 1970s films as well as a fan of Stiller and Wilson's usual material you should find much to love here.Phillips has remarkably captured the look and feel of a typical 1970s film. The costumes hairstyles and overall production design are also perfect for a subtle spoof on the 1970s and given the source material even the plot has the slightly formulaic slightly hokey almost madefortelevision feel that is appropriate for this genre. You know they're on the right track when Fred Williamsonstar of such blaxploitation masterpieces as Hammer 1972 Black Caesar 1973 and Mean Johnny Barrows 1976has a prominent supporting role. The 1970s spoofhomage aspect is far more understated and reverential than you'd normal expect from a Stiller film but easy to like and understand.Other outstanding supporting roles are played by Vince Vaughn Snoop Dogg Will Ferrell and Juliette Lewis all except Dogg slightly out of character but just as enjoyable and funny as always as they're all somewhat faithfully filling traditional 1970s roles. Dogg is the most in character as he has long been deferential to that era anyway.The film hinges of course on Stiller and Wilson and true to form Stiller is still a somewhat oblivious buffoon with Wilson as a hipper more streetwise buffoon. Grafting their comedy personae onto the Starsky and Hutch characters was more easily done and natural than anyone might have thought and provides a highly amusing 100 minutes even if it's a bit of an acquired taste and not likely to be understood quite as well by future generations.".

	schema:reviewBody "Old School director Todd Phillips lampoons every cop movie convention and clich in his new action comedy Starsky  Hutch an amusing but anemic annihilation of the toughminded 1970sera buddythemed crime busters television series that paved the way for shows like Miami Vice. Comedian Ben Stiller of Meet the Parents recreates the Paul Michael Glaser role as Det. Dave Starsky while Owen Wilson of The Big Bounce updates the David Soul character Det. Ken Hutchinson. Mind you Stiller is usually a stellar comic but his exaggerated hyperactive performance here is far too epileptic to be palatable. He resembles an anorexic Lou Ferrigno and he behaves as if he wandered in from another movie. Meanwhile Owen Wilson plays his usual laidback slacker self. Wilson goes for comparative subtlety. Sadly S  H lacks any shred of subtlety. What Phillips and coscenarists John O'Brien of Cradle 2 The Grave and Scot Armstrong who coscripted Old School and Road Trip with Phillips have done to TV's Starsky and Hutch is not nearly as appalling as what director Barry Sonnenfeld did to TV's The Wild Wild West with his Wild Wild West. Sadly this sacrilegious law  order spoof is horrendous enough as it is.Starsky  Hutch TV show fans will feel insulted and humiliated by this contemptible makeover of a venerable series. Phillips  company stand the action formula on its head pull its pants down and turn our heroes into moronic misfits. S  H shares more in common with the Village People than a straightup and serious TV cops  robbers show. People who never saw TV's Starsky and Hutch may find it easier to laugh at our heroes' buffoonish behavior. Phillips scores points for his broad imaginative comedy but he devastates a popular show. Essentially Phillips  company have ignored the basic rule of remakes if it ain' t broke don't fix it. Only Snoop Dogg as Huggy Bear Vince Vaughn as villainous Reese Feldman and Fred Williamson's Captain Dobey emerge unscathed from this cretinous comedy.Starsky  Hutch gets off on the right foot. Jewish businessmancocaine dealer Reese Feldman Vince Vaughn of Clay Pigeons with a bandit mustache has a falling out with one of his accomplices over the loss of a coke consignment and a plane. Out of the blue Feldman palms a pistol and blows a hole through the argumentative thug sending him involuntarily backwards over the railing of his yacht and into the ocean. As the wily villain Feldman has altered the chemical formula of cocaine so drugsniffing German Sheppard dogs cannot catch any incriminating whiffs from the narcotics. Further this new cocaine is tasteless which spins off a great gag with Starsky stirring it into his coffee as if it were sugar. The clever running joke during the expository scene about the drug is the comparison of 'new' coke with 'old' coke. Feldman plans to sell consignments of his wonder drug to a syndicate of drug dealers.Meanwhile Bay City Police Captain Dobey Frank Williamson of Hammer makes partners out of polar opposites who have virtually no credibility in the department. Detective Dave Starsky has an anger management problem and is prone to firing his pistol in public at the wrong times. He drives like a maniac and he busts citizens for the least infraction of the law. On the other hand Detective Ken Hutchinson drop kicked his ethics long ago and moonlights as a robber who hits bookies. Predictably these dynamic dudes have problems adjusting to each other's idiosyncrasies. One thing Hutch likes about Starsky however is his soupedup red Ford Grand Torino in which they careen recklessly around the streets of Bay City. Anyway our heroes find a floater who turns out to be the same guy Feldman gunned down on his yacht. Indeed Vaughn makes a more believable bad guy than our protagonists make heroes. In the bythenumbers police procedural screenplay Starsky and Hutch trace the floater back to Feldman. Initially they have no luck with Feldman and follow another lead the dragon designs on the corpse's jacket. This takes them to prison where they encounter Big Earl an unaccredited Will Ferrell of Elf with a hair net who fashioned the designs. Starsky and Hutch ply Big Earl for information but he proves more an obstacle than they expected. Where the original SH duo would have shattered the glass between them in the prison interview room and beaten him to a pulp the new Starsky and Hutch adopt a different approach. No concession they offer the convict appeals to him until he asks to ogle Hutch's belly button. Before it's all over Starsky and Hutch are caught on prison surveillance cams performing Dumb and Dumber routines for Big Earl. Like so much of the comedy in S  H this scene tickles your funny bone. Unfortunately it's in the wrong movie. Starsky and Hutch check in occasionally with their number one snitch Huggy Bear Snoop Dogg of Baby Boy and even persuade him to wear a wire and serve as Feldman's golf caddy in one scene. However no matter what our heroes do to try and bust Feldman they always wind up with egg on their face to the point Capt. Dobey suspends them from the force.Snoop Dog walks off with the show without breaking a sweat. The producers show greater reverence for his character than any other. The Ford Grand Torino gives a better performance than either lead. Another plus is the classic disco soundtrack with hits from the 70s such as Afternoon Delight and a sendup of David Soul's own Don't Give Up On Us Baby. Altogether while its boasts several funny scenes this Starsky  Hutch remake doesn't amount to much.".

	schema:headline " Funny and entertaining! sendup of the copbuddy formula";
	schema:reviewBody "A funny and thoroughly enjoyable spin on the overused copbuddy formula Starsky and Hutch is one of the most entertaining films of 2004  even if it's nothing more than just that. With a fair share of laughoutloud moments and more than a handful of injoke references to '70s pop culture including the original source material Starsky and Hutch the TV show it also boasts a fine comedic cast with talented performers Ben Stiller Owen Wilson Vince Vaughn Snoop Dogg Chris Penn Amy Smart and some uncredited cameos by the likes of Will Ferrell  and yes even the original Starsky and Hutch. But their shared appearance is one best left open. I get a good vibe from these guys the younger Hutch exclaims in one of the film's most savory selfreferential moments.The film takes place in Bay City sometime during the '70s when David Starsky Stiller  a bythenumbers police officer who spends his entire day chasing smalltime crooks  is paired up with a new partner the reckless Ken Hutch Hutchinson Wilson. Starsky and Hutch don't get along at first  their mixed personalities collide resulting in uncomfortable tension. Placed on an assignment involving an alleged drug lord Vaughn who has managed to create undetectable cocaine Starsky and Hutch find themselves in a number of awkward situations getting a statement by Big Earl Ferrell a dragonobsessed inmate with some major issues the usual tidbits of information from Huggy Bear Dogg a friend and informant of Hutch's and of course the mandatory romantic subplot involving a pair of sexy cheerleaders.The contrast of Starsky and Hutch is handled deliberately blunt this comedy isn't as much a victim of the copbuddy genre as it is a deadon spoof. Hutch is a selfdescribed realist  during his introductory sequence he is shown fleeing the scene of a robbery with a stash of money. We assume he is undercover and that's what he tells the cops when they try to arrest him. However he's just using his badge as an excuse to commit crimes  and get away with them.I asked myself if it was as possible as the film implies but then the Constantly Yelling andor Upset Police Captain another clichd role that happens to show up in all these movies tells Hutch that it's the seventh time he's been arrested for robbery and Hutch tells him that he's undercover  trying to work his way in through the criminal underground. The joke of course is that we find out the robberies are all totally unrelated and bear no significant to a criminal underground of any kind.There are a few sequences in the movie that deserve a description of their own such as when Starsky accidentally consumes a large amount of cocaine and works himself into an ultimatehighfrenzy battling on the disco floor of a nightclub for shortlived glory. After his opponent is unjustly awarded the gold medal Starsky pulls out his gun and from there on the entire situation escalates into one of those scenes that  like parts of Stiller's There's Something About Mary  last on in viewers' minds even after the film itself fades away. The sort of sequence you might chuckle about to yourself as you drive home and recall certain moments from the film.Stiller and Wilson  presently two of Hollywood's most famous odd couples who have united together for a number of projects over the years  are always likable in their films and nothing changes here. Wilson uses his sarcastic quips to an advantage coming across as the smoother of the two whereas Starsky is the bumbling and selfconscious idiot who is both overprotective and overzealous.The movie is at its best when it is cleverly satirizing the genre. Most of these films always include a sequence where the police captain will suspend the movie's protagonist and frown on him saying something cheesy like Your father who spent years on the force and was one of the highestdecorated officers would be ashamed of you! Instead the police captain tells Starsky that his mother would be ashamed of him. And then after being suspended Starsky takes a visit to his mother's grave and places a glazed donut on the headstone she was the highly decorated cop in the family apparently.The film was directed by Todd Phillips whose resume includes such raunchy efforts at comedy as the crudebutenjoyable Road Trip and surprising Old School. The latter film starred Ferrell and Vaughn and contained a cameo appearance by Snoop Dogg as himself so obviously these guys enjoyed working with Phillips and I'm sure agreed to contribute to this movie just for the heck of it.The result is a very goofy entertaining summer flick that never tries too hard and invariably never falls too hard either. It does fall sometimes but even then it usually takes its screwups with a pinch of salt. This is the sort of movie worth the price of admission  just to sit back forget your worries and watch a couple of clowns bumble their way through an enjoyable farce of the '70s. It's not the kind of movie you'll be talking about after you see it  just a simple popcorn flick. If you're out and about and you happen to stumble into a theater showing this film you'll find your money well spent. I won't praise Starsky and Hutch for being a brilliant tongueincheek spoof of the copbuddy films  I'll merely say that for what it is Starsky and Hutch is wellmade and funny  a surprisingly simple movie that is everything it pretends to be. The majority of films that use this approach suffer because they fall victim to their targets especially most released this year but where the others have failed Starsky and Hutch succeeds.".

Placed on an assignment involving an alleged drug lord Vaughn who has managed to create undetectable cocaine Starsky and Hutch find themselves in a number of awkward situations getting a statement by Big Earl Ferrell a dragonobsessed inmate with some major issues the usual tidbits of information from Huggy Bear Dogg a friend and informant of Hutch's and of course the mandatory romantic subplot involving a pair of sexy cheerleaders.The contrast of Starsky and Hutch is handled deliberately blunt this comedy isn't as much a victim of the copbuddy genre as it is a deadon spoof. Hutch is a selfdescribed realist  during his introductory sequence he is shown fleeing the scene of a robbery with a stash of money. We assume he is undercover and that's what he tells the cops when they try to arrest him. However he's just using his badge as an excuse to commit crimes  and get away with them.I asked myself if it was as possible as the film implies but then the Constantly Yelling andor Upset Police Captain another clichd role that happens to show up in all these movies tells Hutch that it's the seventh time he's been arrested for robbery and Hutch tells him that he's undercover  trying to work his way in through the criminal underground. The joke of course is that we find out the robberies are all totally unrelated and bear no significant to a criminal underground of any kind.There are a few sequences in the movie that deserve a description of their own such as when Starsky accidentally consumes a large amount of cocaine and works himself into an ultimatehighfrenzy battling on the disco floor of a nightclub for shortlived glory. After his opponent is unjustly awarded the gold medal Starsky pulls out his gun and from there on the entire situation escalates into one of those scenes that  like parts of Stiller's There's Something About Mary  last on in viewers' minds even after the film itself fades away. The sort of sequence you might chuckle about to yourself as you drive home and recall certain moments from the film.Stiller and Wilson  presently two of Hollywood's most famous odd couples who have united together for a number of projects over the years  are always likable in their films and nothing changes here. Wilson uses his sarcastic quips to an advantage coming across as the smoother of the two whereas Starsky is the bumbling and selfconscious idiot who is both overprotective and overzealous.The movie is at its best when it is cleverly satirizing the genre. Most of these films always include a sequence where the police captain will suspend the movie's protagonist and frown on him saying something cheesy like Your father who spent years on the force and was one of the highestdecorated officers would be ashamed of you! Instead the police captain tells Starsky that his mother would be ashamed of him. And then after being suspended Starsky takes a visit to his mother's grave and places a glazed donut on the headstone she was the highly decorated cop in the family apparently.The film was directed by Todd Phillips whose resume includes such raunchy efforts at comedy as the crudebutenjoyable Road Trip and surprising Old School. The latter film starred Ferrell and Vaughn and contained a cameo appearance by Snoop Dogg as himself so obviously these guys enjoyed working with Phillips and I'm sure agreed to contribute to this movie just for the heck of it.The result is a very goofy entertaining summer flick that never tries too hard and invariably never falls too hard either. It does fall sometimes but even then it usually takes its screwups with a pinch of salt. This is the sort of movie worth the price of admission  just to sit back forget your worries and watch a couple of clowns bumble their way through an enjoyable farce of the '70s. It's not the kind of movie you'll be talking about after you see it  just a simple popcorn flick. If you're out and about and you happen to stumble into a theater showing this film you'll find your money well spent. I won't praise Starsky and Hutch for being a brilliant tongueincheek spoof of the copbuddy films  I'll merely say that for what it is Starsky and Hutch is wellmade and funny  a surprisingly simple movie that is everything it pretends to be. The majority of films that use this approach suffer because they fall victim to their targets especially most released this year but where the others have failed Starsky and Hutch succeeds.";

	schema:headline " A really fun buddy cop flick with a lot of laughs";
	schema:reviewBody "Starsky and Hutch was a film I was really looking forward to. I think Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller have great on screen chemistry and I really liked the last film they did together in 2001 entitled Zoolander. Ben Stiller  Owen Wilson make a great comedic team so when I heard about Starsky and Hutch starring both of them I was hooked immediately. The bad news for me however was the fact this film was being directed by the guy who made road trip  old school Todd Phillips. I didn't really care for neither one of them per say. But I was willing to give him a chance with this film. And as it turned out I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome of Starsky and Hutch.So tonight I caught the sneak preview of Starsky and Hutch at 730pm. The movie was packed to the gills. Yours truly had to sit in the front row which I wasn't thrilled about. But there was nothing else at the theater to see so I figured what the hell I will make my neck suffer for the next two hours. Well the movie started about 5 minutes after I got in the theater.Starsky and Hutch as I'm sure everyone knows is based on a buddy cop TV show from the 70s. The movie is pretty much the same thing. Starsky Ben Stiller  Hutch Owen Wilson are partners who are determined to bust their biggest case ever. Reese Feldman Vince Vaughn is a drug dealer who is planning one huge drug deal but soon Starsky and Hutch are right on his trail thanks to the help of their pal Huggy Bear Snoop Dog. A lot of funny mishaps spoofs of the original TV series and overall a very enjoyable film ensue.Ben Stiller  Owen Wilson like I mentioned above are a match made in heaven. They are both two funny guys who work great as a team. Vince Vaughn was very good here as the villain in the film. He had the whole rich playboy thing going it was very entertaining. Snoop Dog was also very enjoyable as Huggy Bear. He delivered a nice sum of laughs and for once wasn't a completely pointless character. Amy Smart who played Holly in the film along with Carmen Electra who played Staci where both good as Starsky  Hutch's love interests. Even the original Starsky  Hutch Paul Michael Glaser  David Soul make an amusing cameo appearance.This film was written by three people and all of which I wouldn't think could create such a funny and interesting script like this. John O'Brien who wrote Cradle 2 the Grave with DMX  Jet Li Todd Phillips who wrote road trip  old school and Scot Armstrong who also wrote road trip  old school wrote the film as a team. As I said earlier I am quite surprised that the film turned out so well. I must actually applaud all of the three men who wrote this film. There were some really clever and classic moments in the film. The dialog was very good and the characters were very well formed. I enjoyed the script a lot.Thank you Todd Phillips for proving me wrong. I was really scared at first that I wasn't going to like the film. I have to apologize to Mr. Phillips because I never thought I would see the day that I would come out of one of his movies and be very satisfied. The man wrote and directed a really good movie here. He delivered the laughs. The settings he chose for the movie were great. He filmed the whole thing in Bay City. I felt for the characters I really liked the characters. I just overall really enjoyed what he did with the film and here's hoping for a part 2.So I was very surprised with Starsky and Hutch. I had my doubts at first but they are now gone. I walked out of the film with a big smile on my face. There were lots of funny and classic scenes in the film. I really enjoyed how the film itself seemed to be a spoof of the original series. It was very clever by doing that. And I know I really liked this film to because when I sit in the front row to watch a movie the movie better be good otherwise I will pan it even more for breaking my neck to watch it. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are the perfect comedy team in this funny and interesting buddy cop film. I highly recommend it to all. Just turn off your thinking cap and you will be set for a real fun ride. My final rating for Starsky and Hutch is an 810.".

This prequel to the television show presents the origins of their long running partnership as they are thrown together on a case involving a shady entrepreneur Vince Vaughn. Stiller makes up for Envy and brings out the laughs with a great cast. I never saw the series but I am willing to bet that the movie is a lot better and this is more of a parody of the series. The story was funny sure it was nothing new but they still make it work. Stiller and Wilson have a great backup cast in this including Vince Vaughn Amy Smart Jason Bateman Juliette Lewis and Carmen Electra. They all bring humor into the movie and they play their roles well. Snoop Dog played his role decently but they could have found someone else to play Huggy Bear. Todd Phillips directs and he has made some funny comedies in the past including Old School and Road Trip. Vince Vaughn has moved on from being a serious actor to being a comedian and the transition worked in Old School and it works in this movie. The film is 100 minutes long so its hard to put in enough jokes to sustain its running time but for the most part the film is pretty entertaining. Rating 710 I recommend you see this movie if your looking for a good comedy or if your a fan of any of the stars.".

Starsky Ben Stiller is very much bythebook  embarrassingly so  whereas Hutch has a laid back rather hippy' approach to the rules. One of the films great strengths is that it plays on satire and keeps the action secondary. The two main characters are ably aided and abetted by Huggy Bear Snoop Dogg and although there is a bigdrugsbust plotline the movie's main intention seems to be to make a homage to the style and clichs of certain 70s filmmaking and the original TV show car chases for instance focus on tongueincheek action rather than adrenalin and the cops' love of emptyheaded curvaceous women combined with a homophobia towards each other and gay men is portrayed laughingly as an echo of the attitudes of the times rather than appealing to those sentiments. Not the sort of comedy I expected to enjoy so much personally but I quickly warmed to this movie and found the feelgood factor continued unabated till the end.".

The only thing that bugged me about it was that I can't recall Hutch ever having shady dealings or keeping money that did not belong to him in the original television series. That sort of threw me off but on the flip side I got a kick out of Ben stiller. He got so many of the original Starsky's mannerisms down pat!

On top of that SH forgoes the big screen remake approach and manages to imbue this movie with a kind of intimate small screen charm all its own.There's not much in the SPFX department  a little green screen on a lizard's tail maybe  just stunt driving and disco dancing and coo l characters. It occurred to me that this sort of 70's characterbased TV has given way to the ensemble drama where the characters are secondary and the formula is the star. Hence you can set CSI or Law and Order in any city and serve up a variety of interchangeable casts to populate your formula.To make it palatable to an audience who doesn't give a damn whether this remake is anything like the original the char acters have been polarized and exaggerated to turbocharge the humor. Paul Mic hael Glaser's intense David Starsky in Ben Stiller's hands is Mr Furiou s a bythebook cop struggling against the legacy of his Supercop mother. Owen Wilson takes Ken Hutch Hutchinson a few steps further along the continuum of laidback nordic detachment becoming a Wilsonesque drifter who comfortably straddles both sides of the law. Thus he becomes the perfect pacifier for his frenetic partner.All the original elements are present and exaggerated. The onscreen chemistry between the leads the innocent and endearing homoerotica the cool Ford Gran Torino and its balletic skid turns the busty cheerleaders and the smooth and charming leisuresuited villains. Played straight down the middle all the humor emerges from the guileless seriousness of it all the charming simplicity of a more innocent time.In an age before AIDs Terrorism and political correctness Starsky and Hutch tough talk rough house and sleep their way through a daisy chain of leads and informants on the trail of a massive shipment of artificial coke  which mimics the real stuff in effect but is undetectable to police labs or sniffer dogs. Starsky and Hutch take their polaropposite characters into each new situation and their infamous buddycop chemistry manages to keep them stumbling along in vaguely the right direction. The unlikely tableaus  scenes like the holsters and handtowels the attractive informant disrobing during her interview the undercover mime artists and the ridiculous disguises are mostly lifted directly from the original series and tweaked only a little for laughs. Starsky still doesn't like Hutch eating in the Torino and Hutch still lives in his little Venice villa with his indian hemp throw rugs and healthy milkshakes. Stiller especially has worked hard on his little Starskyesque codifiers the bowlegged swagger the hyperactive twitchiness right down to the I Ching necklace and silver pinkie ring  little touches that 95 percent of the audience will never recognize. Starsky  Hutch is populated by the usual StillerWilson family singers. Vince Vaughn is delicious perfection as the bad guydrugdealerfamily man and Wil Ferrel is the adlibbed Saturday Night Live skit character with eccentric sexual tendencies and a penchant for Dragons.Out of our Easter weekend audience I think most were in their twenties or below and so David Soul's one and only pop hit Don't Give up on us Baby has never been played in their lifetime. And yet our audience seemed to get the fondly selfreferential humor and ridiculous situations if all the guffawing was anything to go by. There was a group of teenaged girls behind us who choked a n d hyperventilated so much during the Wil Ferrell interrogation scene I thought the y'd have to be put on oxygen.As a huge fan of the original series I should have found all this insulting predictable and groanenducing but instead it was nostalgic and endearing. As much as I love specials effects and actionpacked blockbusters I realized I miss these sorts of characters.Of today's crop only Monk is carrying the banner for quirky characterbased charm.".

Owen Wilson brings some slight color to his role almost enough to qualify as a character. Together they come off as nothing more than a couple of stupid losers driving around in a red Torino. There's not much reason for these two to be in this movie anyway as it's nothing more than a barrage of failed comedy sketches. The film offers a couple of chuckles most notably when the big car jump at the end goes wrong but it's hardly worth sitting through all the mundane characters and groaninducing comedy to get to them. The best part  by far  is the '70s music It at least offers a nice background to the tedium taking place on screen.It would have been more accurate to title this movie Dumb and Dumber  With A Badge or perhaps Police Academy 8 Cops Without A Clue. But of course the marketing exec's probably found out that titling it Starsky and Hutch would bring in 17 more revenue so there you go.".

Though I may not approve in real life I think it was very realistic to add in the coffee scene. It was very realistic. Ben Stiller was a GREAT Starsky.

The TV's formal actor and recent successful cinema director Rob Reiner said once in a documentary movies' stars were like royalty but us as TV people were the opposite ! I think that nearly applied to the shows also. However the picture had changed lately yet for shows only ! I think Hollywood mania over the TV's classics began humbly after the The Fugitive  1994. Then at the end of the 1990s all the hell broke loose. Like all the insolvent majors suddenly discovered the hidden treasure and started to plunder it desperately and milk it madly ! Therefore every year we're on a date of perverting a good work or a good memory or both. It's sad not only to make something that never outclassed the original but ALSO to make something that is considered in the lists of the worst movies ever the biggest flops etc. Just titles like The Dukes of Hazzard The Honeymooners ScoobyDoo may capture your attention nicely as TV shows but once you know that we're talking about the movies then I believe you would feel the desire to vomit ! As some fine reviewer mentioned smartly that originally Starsky  Hutch wasn't a big massive hit at its time I totally agree and I had to add that the exploiters here didn't even try to overstep anything too. With names like Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson you get a pretty clear notion what movie that you're about to watch. But here this one doesn't want to regain the original parody its time make something for its own or design a strong action comedy all at once. It was nothing but short little sketches or rather skits that made 100 minutes movie.It's not bad but there was a certain amount of muddling all the way. The 2 leads are dressed up like the Easy Rider's leads !? Don't think it's a mocking at old antibuddy cop movie like that or else it was maybe the 2 actors' suggestion to shake this script up a bit ?. Nothing in the original was appealing to be remade and apparently the filmmaker found nothing to reinvent either ? So it was some flashy colorful scenes here and there with little cleverness that must make you ask  maybe the whole script was meant to totally another movie and it got made under the name of Starsky  Hutch ? well it happened before as Die Hard With a Vengeance's script was initially meant to be another Lethal Weapon's flick see how the buddycop movies are so flexible and easy ! OK I liked the dancing fight at the disco the song Don't Give Up On Us Baby which was sung in the first place by David Soul the real Hutchinson in the TV show hmmm.. what else? In similar cases of puzzlement like this I would say Hey the girls were hot too ironically they weren't ! Wanna talk about some things I hated here take a list  the sense of belittlement which ruled the whole thing. Good actress named Juliette Lewis in worthless tasteless role and performance. Huggy Bear as ugly stereotyped character true shock for the lovers of the first more respectable Huggy Bear. Will Ferrell's cameo which was the climax this movie reached of being unfunny nasty and beggar for a laugh. Even the appearance of the original TV's leads Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul was so poor yes it's rare recognition by the movie which other movies based on TV shows didn't even consider but what supposed to be such a magical moment turned out to be a hasty wholly fabricated scene. That scene forced me to recall one bad cartoon show named Tom and Jerry Kids because unintentionally it gave you the feeling that we were watching some buffoonery was made by kids ! It was more like 2 kids were playing at the day care then their parents came finally to take them home ! If you wanna complain in one sentence then let's say it's a comedy that lacks comedy. Basically the real personality of the movie is confused. But I think it doesn't have one in the first place. Or mercifully it's a weak one despite its potentials or correctly compared to them.A painful last note  Paul Michael Glaser who played David Starsky in the TV show said more than once at the movie's premiere I thought it was a better idea to make a movie about how Starsky and Hutch may look and live today after 30 years of their first appearance..

My dad told me that it was going to stink and I shouldn't waste my money. I'm afraid I have to tell you that Pop was pretty much on target. Dang.Starsky and Hutch was a flat unfunny comedy. I can sum up everything that was good about it this way It had three laughs and a 3way. I laughed a grand total of three times. Yes. I was counting. Just do the math to see how Starsky and Hutch adds up. For a feature with a running time of 101 minutes why that's one laugh every 33.6 minutes! For a 6.50 matinee that's 2.16 a laugh! Wow! What a bargain! When I look at it this way I get really really depressed. That's just the feeling you want to have after seeing a comedy.After watching Starsky and Hutch I think I can now safely say that Owen Wilson doesn't do it for me. I've liked him in other movies but his act is getting worn out. He's got the laid back thing going on but it's not making me laugh. He looks like he'd be much happier sitting by a pool with a large alcoholic drink than actually taking the time to make a movie. Come to think of it that does sound like a good idea. He may be on to something.There was one cool scene which showed the start of a threeway between Wilson Smart and Electra. This pleased me immensely. Amy Smart lays some kisses on Carmen Electra. You gotta love that. I can give the movie a point for that scene. To paraphrase Snoop Dogg That puts you at point one!".

Every review I had read about it says it is really bad but my attitude towards it was How bad can it be?. The truth is I actually quite enjoyed it.The movie is based on an old TV show of the same name. 2 police officers are forced to work with each other but they are both completely different to each other. They are trying to hunt down a drug dealer that has some cocaine in his possession that is completely undetectable. Not even the police dogs can smell it.The comedy in this movie is not great. I laughed out loud once throughout the entire movie. But that is not to say it was not funny. There were a few moments in the film that made me smile and I thought were entertaining. I do wish it was funnier though. The story was quite good but nothing we have not seen a million times before in buddy cop movies.The action as really good in places. The car chases were really good and the stunts reminded me of watching the classic TV shows that I loved as a kid Knight Rider and the Dukes of Hazzard. It was great to see the old red Gran Torino with the white stripe along the side. I love that car I don't really remember it from TV as I never watched the show but I know the car. During the credits at the end you can see some of the car stunts that go wrong during filming. These are awesome but it is a shame to see the lovely cars getting smashed up.I like the actors in this movie. The film stars Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. These guys are funny guys but sometimes it just doesn't work. I thought Ben played his part well and Owen played his part well too but for some reason the chemistry between them both felt like something was missing. I could not imagine them as partners and even after watching them for 90 minutes I still didn't really see them as partners. But nonetheless they both did well and I enjoyed watching them. There were a lot of other famous faces in this film that I didn't know were in it Snoop Dogg Fred Williamson Vince Vaughn Juliette Lewis Jason Bateman Amy Smart Carmen Electra and Chris Penn. Also I loved the cameo at the end from the original Starsky  Hutch David Soul  Paul Michael Glaser from the TV show. I loved it and thought it was a great ending to the film.OK so the film as a whole was not brilliant the comedy was not up to par and the acting was not great in places the story could have been better too but this was still really entertaining. It did not deserve the bashing by all the reviewers that it took.I will give this film 7 out of 10.A floater. Nothing harder to solve than a floater. No prints body's usually bloated it's next to impossible. All right I say we push it out and hope the current pushes it down to the next precinct.For more reviews please like my Facebook pagehttpswww.facebook.compagesOrdinaryPersonMovie Reviews456572047728204?refhl".

Can they figure out the who where and when required to crack the case ?I quite enjoyed this goofy comedy I just wish they hadn't called it Starsky  Hutch. As a spoof of seventies cop shows it's fun with a couple of macho ladies' men in their souped up car their hip connections giggly women with too much hairspray and bad guys with moustaches. As a remake of William Blinn's old TV show of which I must confess I was a big childhood fan it's just bizarre. On the show Starsky and Hutch were a couple of actionpacked cops who got the job done albeit with wisecracks and the occasional prank. Here Starsky is some sort of motherfixated nerd and Hutch is a kind of latterday hippie airhead neither bear any resemblance to the originals. As often in these type of pictures the many screenwriters struggle to balance the comic  dramatic  action tone  it pretty much goes for all out laughs but would be a lot funnier if it wasn't shackled to recreating the old show. Also where's the action ? What I loved about the TV series was the dependable fights and car chases in the Striped Tomato  there's almost no such fun here presumably the director wasn't up to staging scenes with anything more complicated than a woman taking her top off. However there are some good points  Stiller's armsflailing physical swagger is a deadon recreation of Starsky Dogg is terrific as supercool Huggy Bear love that Lincoln Continental as is Williamson a living breathing seventies classic from such flicks as Hell Up In Harlem and Take A Hard Ride  and funny scenes such as the shootingthehorseinthegarage misunderstanding and the police brutality interview with Cheung. Overall though I found it disappointing compared to equivalents like Dragnet or the recent Miami Vice. It scores some points by including the classic 1976 Ford Gran Torino and having Glaser and Soul appear at the end although sadly Antonio Fargas and the late Bernie Hamilton do not but like so many Hollywood films it cashes in on a name. Ferrell appears unbilled as a stoolie.".

Until I spotted the disc brake on 'Wyatt's front wheel! And at arriving at the 'saloon' he visibly collides with the parked car... Sigh... The front brake was not enough...The final jump... Another total miss! The car is visibly destroyed! Who do they take us for? Idiots? Yes! And... worst part I rented it!  END SPOILER SECTION Bottom line Take my advice skip this film.";

Mitchum and Hayworth were offscreen far too long. That major complaint aside I found the film very entertaining. Mitchum is perfect with the weary cynical and intense combination. Hayworth has more depth than usual as the mysterious foreign woman. And Lemmon in a rare dramatic turn is very convincing as the naive and lovestruck young man. Here's an interesting tidbit the film was executive produced by Cubby Broccoli the long time producer of the Bond movies and Bernard Lee who would play M in the Bond films has a supporting role in Fire Down Below. 710.".

The first time the people I lived with loved it so fiercely they bought a longplaying record of the calliopean musical score and they played it a thousand times in a row. And boy is the film scored. Hardly a moment passes without bongo drums pounding and violins throbbing. Rita Hayworth gets to do what I hope was her last dance number on film. On hearing the melody behind the opening credits I was whisked back to San Bruno California with the instruments inside my head.Once over that initial spasm though I was able to get into the film and saw it a little differently than I had the first time. Mitchum is a creep true but not the unmitigated son of bitch that I'd first thought. Now  with so much more experience  I can even consider the proposition that by betraying Jack Lemmon to the authorities and stealing Hayworth away from Lemmon  he was actually doing the younger more innocent man a favor.Briefly the story is that Mitchum and Lemmon are partners in an old boat in the Caribbean and engage in smalltime smuggling for a living. When their cargo on one trip turns out to be Rita Hayworth Lemmon falls for her but Mitchum is able to see that this is a mismatch made in Heaven. Lemmon is all Ga Ga and wants to marry her and Hayworth a lady with no country but lots of history is desperate enough to accept. Mitchum short circuits the plan through devious means. The direction is sometimes misguided. Lemmon and Mitchum have a fist fight aboard the boat which Jimmy Jean interprets as working off some steam but it's too brutal. In the end Lemmon is trapped aboard a small freighter about to blow up and is saved by Mitchum. The incident is anything but typical Hollywood heroism  and those last twenty minutes are genuinely gripping. The denouement in the tavern is simply unbelievable.The screenplay is by Irwin Shaw and though some of the dialog is surely from the novel it has its felicities. When Lemmon first proposes marriage Hayworth tries to explain to him why it wouldn't work. It's a cue for a dull speech but it's very neatly done and with aspirations. I've been debased she tells him. Armies have marched over me. It doesn't make a dent in Lemon's erotic mania a nice college kid from Indianapolis. The narrative ribbon occasionally scintillates with such almost subliminal sequins.The location shooting is expertly done. This isn't Montego Bay with its meticulously placed palms and pina coladas served by native girls in flowered dresses. This is the seamier side of Trinidad and Tobago where the houses are slapped together of weatherbeaten boards the streets are littered with banana peels and the beds in the seedy hotels are probably harboring bugs. The T shirts are dirty and soggy with sweat. You want a drink? Fine  here's a bottle. It's a long way from the old studio productions with the men in white suits and panama hats and colorful but sanitary interiors veiled by beaded curtains.This isn't one of Mitchum's more impressive performances but he seems sober and hits his marks and says what he's supposed to even while bleary eyed with rum and listening to a 78 record of Mozart on a windup phonograph. In life Jack Lemmon was a nice guy not erratic like Mitchum but I've always thought he was better at comedy than drama. Rita Hayworth's performance is a blank. Her expression seem pasted on like a postage stamp. This must have been one of her last movies before she began to self destruct. The supporting players are just fine  Bernard Lee as a quietly empathic doctor Edric Connor with his jumbo baritone. Mitchum asks Connor Do you want to quit Jimmy Jean? And Connor stares back intently for a moment before replying I do believe I do.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two American sailors Felix and Tony are coowners of a tramp boat which they use for smallscale smuggling around the Caribbean. One day however they receive a more lucrative proposition. They are offered 1000 to transport Irena a beautiful but stateless Eastern European refugee from one island to another. As normally happens in films like this both men fall in love with her and they come to blows their friendship forgotten.The two men are quite different in character. Tony a bachelor is a romantic and idealistic young man who has come to care deeply for Irena. Felix is a divorce several years older than Tony the failure of his brief marriage has left him a hardbitten and cynical misogynist. He also has a nasty streak in him shown when under a pretence of friendship he tells Tony to beware of Irena who is a woman of immoral character. His real motive of course is to leave Irena free for himself. When this ploy fails he tips off the coastguard about Tony's smuggling activities.The first part of the film is dominated by the TonyFelixIrena love triangle but about halfway through Felix and Irena suddenly disappear from the action and the film abruptly changes from a romantic melodrama to a disaster movie a sort of poor man's Poseidon Adventure. Tony has signed as a crewman on board a Greek freighter and is injured when it is involved in a collision with a liner. Tony's injuries are in themselves relatively minor certainly not lifethreatening but he is nevertheless in grave danger as he is trapped by a fallen iron girder and the ship is on fire. To make things worse it is carrying a potentially explosive cargo.This was Rita Hayworth's first film after a fouryear absence from the screen caused by events in her private life. Rita remained a major sex symbol for over two decades because she was able to change her style of beauty as she got older. In early films such as You'll Never Get Rich she was an innocent girlnextdoor type. In what might be called her middle period the period of Gilda or The Lady from Shanghai she was a seductive femme fatale. Here at the age of 39 she plays a glamorous sophisticated older woman and still looks as attractive as ever especially in a swimsuit.This is moreover a very accomplished acting performance. Irena seems to have had a somewhat shady past the full details of which are never made clear in the film but one does not sense from Rita's interpretation that she is as immoral as Felix makes out. There is a sense that Irena has had a difficult life in Europe and that she has known sadness perhaps even tragedy. She is reserved on the surface but one senses strong feelings beneath. This is one of two meanings of the title Fire down Below the other referring to the literal fire which has broken out on the ship.Jack Lemmon as Tony plays his part reasonably well but this is not a particularly good film. There are several reasons for this. The race against time to free Tony from the burning ship does not generate as much tension as one might have expected. The two halves of the film do not fit together well and the change from one to the other is too abrupt. Irena and Felix reappear towards the end but only Robert Mitchum has much to do Rita's participation is effectively over by halftime.Felix is a key character but Mitchum hesitates between two possible interpretations of the role. He seems unsure whether Felix is basically a decent but flawed individual or basically a nasty piece of work who redeems himself by one act of selfless bravery. He attempts both interpretations in the course of the film and ends up making neither convincing. The filmmakers were obviously guided by the normal convention that in any film involving a lovetriangle it will be the first name above the title who gets the girl. Lemmon was later to become one of Hollywood's biggest names but in 1957 it was Mitchum who got first billing. The ending in which Irena ends up with Felix rather than Tony struck me as psychologically implausible and dramatically false. A marriage between Irena and Tony might have had some chance of working one between her and Felix would serve no purpose except to provide employment for the divorce lawyers. Despite its three majorleague stars Fire Down Below is no more than a minorleague melodrama. 510".

Felix Mitchum knows she's trouble and worse than that he's attracted to her.

The ship has an accident and Tony is trapped in the hold.This film starts out as one thing  a love triangle a mysterious woman with a checkered past two friends who become enemies  and becomes the story of a man facing death in the cargo hold of a ship. That part goes on too long and we don't see the happenings on dry land. We are told about them toward the end of the film. It just felt like something was missing.There are suspenseful moments and good acting. Mitchum plays the sardonic Felix well and Lemmon is as always likable as Tony and handles both the light and dramatic scenes very well. I do think for this role his casting was somewhat strange. I think like Hayworth he was trying to fulfill contractual obligations to Columbia. Hayworth is a long way from her Gilda days but a striking woman. Her hard life like the life of the character has caught up with her. She doesn't display a lot of range in the role but has a knockout dance number during Mardi Gras that is very much the old Rita.Interesting for the cast.".

The setting is some exotic nevernever land where life is cheap and morality is a rare and expensive commodity somewhere in the Caribbean. The acting is stylized. The characterizations are twodimensional. The story is one of an overheated romance and acts of heroism involving people who are not worthy of respect except that ultimately they do the right thing. Rita Hayworth is a bad girl with a heart of gold a faded version of Gilda. Robert Mitchum is doing his usual Robert Mitchum imitation i.e. he's just too tired and bored to give the really good performance of which he was capable. Jack Lemmon is the idealist romantic who is willing to lay everything on the line and winds up learning a bitter lesson about people. As I said earlier if only this film had been made earlier and in black and white it would have been an archetypal example of film noir. Personally I like film noir but the genre was highly stylized and too often the actors were required to strike poses rather than develop the personalities of the parts they were playing. Unfortunately this film was made too late to be considered a part of that form and therefore deserves scorn instead of being lauded in Saturday afternoon showings at Parisian film societies.".

Suppose it had worked and we didn't end with two broken souls.Anyway that's half of the story. The other half is about two men fighting for possession of the virtual corpse.

The aptly named Stretch Cox and his troupe are filmed doing a ridiculously impossible limbo impressing the audience and making them expect just as much fire from the rest of the movie.

At first she's drawn to the sweet and safe Jack but when Bob is around there's just no ignoring her real feelings. For the most part the love triangle is overshadowed by the smuggling and boat businesses and that's why the movie isn't very interesting. I'm really not a Rita Hayworth fan so I tended to fast forward her scenes. I've never understood why she played in roles where she was supposed to be irresistible but to each his own. If you agree with me you can check out the beginning get the gist of the love triangle and then skip to the last fifteen or twenty minutes when things get really exciting.

	schema:reviewBody "Executive producers Irving Allen and Albert R. Broccoli. Produced on location in the British West Indies and at MGM Studios Elstree England. A Warwick Production. A Columbia Picture.Copyright 1957 by Warwick Productions. New York opening at the Astor 8 August 1957. U.S. release July 1957. U.K. release 28 July 1957. Australian release 26 September 1957. Sydney opening at the State. 10294 feet. 114 minutes.SYNOPSIS Mitchum and Lemmon are Felix and Tony the original odd couple a pair of vagabond minorleague smugglers knocking about the West Indies in their small boat. The two are approached by Irena Hayworth a stateless lady who is anxious for transport to the vague island of Santa Nada where passports are less important. En route the lessthanworldly Tony falls for her while the bored Felix tries to save his partner from the wiles of their sultry passenger. I'm no good for you. No good for anyone. Armies have marched over me she confesses to Tony in one of the story's more notable bits of dialogue.COMMENT Dull in 1957 and just as dull all these years later. Admittedly the film comes to a bit more life in its last half hour when the support cast finally do their duty. Peter Illing is especially effective as the captain. But the direction remains slack throughout aside from two effective shots of Hayworth in farewell the first as she steps ashore in Santa Nada the second as she waves to Lemmon on his twilit boat.The script by Irwin Shaw is a surprising bore. Maybe it would have been better told in flashback with Lemmon on the tub flashing back to Anthony Newley a small part at the start as a venal waiter but still one of the better things in the film.Hayworth is none too flatteringly photographed at times though her fans are indulged with plenty of closeups. But she and Mitchum virtually disappear from the only exciting part of the film. The rest is boringly tricked out and lengthened by inconsequential limbo and mardi gras sequences which were better left on the editor's floor.No great use is made of CinemaScope either despite its prominence in the film's advertising. The compositions are so loose the film fits easily on to a standard TV. Still Rita swims and dances and I suppose that is what the fans want. I didn't see any similarity between her life and Barefoot Contessa and neither did fans. The film did moderate business at most mainly on the strength of ads which promised a star combination and story excitement which the film failed to deliver.A coproduction of Great Britain's Warwick Films and Columbia Pictures made on location in Trinidad Fire Down Below was Rita Hayworth's returntothescreen after a fouryear absence.".

Sydney opening at the State. 10294 feet. 114 minutes.SYNOPSIS Mitchum and Lemmon are Felix and Tony the original odd couple a pair of vagabond minorleague smugglers knocking about the West Indies in their small boat. The two are approached by Irena Hayworth a stateless lady who is anxious for transport to the vague island of Santa Nada where passports are less important. En route the lessthanworldly Tony falls for her while the bored Felix tries to save his partner from the wiles of their sultry passenger. I'm no good for you. No good for anyone. Armies have marched over me she confesses to Tony in one of the story's more notable bits of dialogue.COMMENT Dull in 1957 and just as dull all these years later. Admittedly the film comes to a bit more life in its last half hour when the support cast finally do their duty. Peter Illing is especially effective as the captain. But the direction remains slack throughout aside from two effective shots of Hayworth in farewell the first as she steps ashore in Santa Nada the second as she waves to Lemmon on his twilit boat.The script by Irwin Shaw is a surprising bore. Maybe it would have been better told in flashback with Lemmon on the tub flashing back to Anthony Newley a small part at the start as a venal waiter but still one of the better things in the film.Hayworth is none too flatteringly photographed at times though her fans are indulged with plenty of closeups. But she and Mitchum virtually disappear from the only exciting part of the film. The rest is boringly tricked out and lengthened by inconsequential limbo and mardi gras sequences which were better left on the editor's floor.No great use is made of CinemaScope either despite its prominence in the film's advertising. The compositions are so loose the film fits easily on to a standard TV. Still Rita swims and dances and I suppose that is what the fans want. I didn't see any similarity between her life and Barefoot Contessa and neither did fans. The film did moderate business at most mainly on the strength of ads which promised a star combination and story excitement which the film failed to deliver.A coproduction of Great Britain's Warwick Films and Columbia Pictures made on location in Trinidad Fire Down Below was Rita Hayworth's returntothescreen after a fouryear absence.";

A breakdown the loss of working friendship with Mifune funding difficulties...etc...but with all the changes that followed the completion of Red Beard while watching I couldn't help notice that everything was ironically in bloom. Akira Kurosawa's direction was never better Mifune never acted better and at it's core Red Beard tells a story borrowed heavily form Dostoevsky thus making this a labour of love. This film is flawless in many respects if you're a film student such as myself you can take everything and pick it apart and find...The story is a simple one a wise and determined doctor impresses a young ambitious doctor into learning what humanity is and how it exists all around us and that without it we are nothing. It tells of humanity through children and adults and the lowest depths of human existence. Some have argued the subject was a little too heavy handed but Kurosawa has always maintained that sometimes heavy handedness is needed especially for those who don't get it with a slap. In my opinion there are periods in every artists career when they are at their best. Miles Davis was at his best before his breakdown but the breakdown was bound to happen after creating and giving so much. I feel this is what happened to Kurosawa he gave all that he could give and with this film if you truly study it and study it well the DVD version comes with an exceptional commentary you will find that this is one of the most finely crafted films in cinematic history in fact as far as direction goes it is difficult for me to think of one better directed. Fellini's best Ozu's best Coppola's best Welles' best Antonioni Visconti De Sica Goddard Renoir Melville Erice you name it watch their best with the sound off take note of the direction then compare it with RED BEARD. You will be left breathless. Kurosawa is a GREAT among the GREATS. This is visual poetry. Kurosawa's great directorial swan song. Bittersweet for after RED BEARD something within Akira profoundly changed.".

The mustsees not just Seven Samurai but Yojimbo and Throne of Blood. The underappreciated Sanjuro and the light but enduring Hidden Fortress. This was my first nonsamurai film from him. What I did not realise until later was that it was his career apotheosis.Red Beard is not Kurosawa's best film. Yet when it came out it was a phenomenon much like Titanic 30 years later. It broke the bank it was an exercise in unprecedented creative and financial power by a major filmmaker and it appealed to filmgoers like few filmes before or since. Kurosawa built a hospice and miniature village for his characters to inhabit and this episodic story of a young star doctor discovering a vocation among the poor under the gruff red beard Mifune feels all the more authentic for it. It is a film of such deliberate ease and confidence that it could only be made by this director at this point in his career. It could not be anything less than the fullest exploration of his most cherished themes  social injustice the redemptive power of human kindness personal codes. It could also do nothing but foreshadow his decline.That's a lot of expectation to pile onto the unsuspecting viewer so what do you get during those 3 hours? You get a firstclass drama Mifune's finest performance and one of the most beautiful tearjerkers ever to grace a screen. All the while countless instances of technical brilliance remind you why this film could only be made by this director a surgery covered in nothing but an extended closeup of the young doctor an eerie seduction covered in an almost static dreamlike wide shot and halfway through the asskicking of a lifetime and its touching followup.This is an extinct form of filmmaking one preserved in the ember of its stark blackandwhite film stock. The cinematic equivalent of a Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton there are ways in which you won't relate but it is daunting powerful and a journey into an intriguing other world well worth spending 3 hours in and then some.".

But after getting over those ridiculous reasons I finally figured I needed to complete my Kurosawa education by seeing it.And boy was I glad I did.It is one of those films that does change you. Like every classic it stands the test of time not because of its entertainment value but because it is a great experience. Even months after seeing the film the first time I found myself always examining my own life against the noble attitudes of the main characters.Yes it's three hours long. And yes you're going to want to spend time to digest it. But the three hours you devote to this film is worth it. If you loved TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD you're going to love this film.".

While in the clinic Dr. Yasumoto becomes responsible for healing the hurt teenager Otoyo Terumi Niki and he learns a lesson of humanity becoming a better man.Akahige is another magnificent work of Master Akira Kurosawa. The touching and lowpaced story is very beautiful and shows the redemption of a spoiled man that becomes a human being learning important and worthwhile values of life. It is almost impossible to highlight one individual performance in such a spectacular cast but Toshir Mifune shows his versatility in the role of the good Red Beard.

	schema:headline " Towards enlightenment";
	schema:reviewBody "Red Beard is the noble conclusion to Kurosawa's monochrome period which undoubtedly contained his finest work.  Although there were  beautifully choreographed action scenes still to come in Kagemusha and Ran nothing was quite the same after this quiet meditation on the stirrings of humanity in a dark and otherwise uncaring world.  The period is early 19th century the place a hospital for the socially impoverished run by a doctor who manages to combine idealism and pragmatism the two essential ingredients needed to facilitate the emergence of enlightenment.  Although the great Toshiro Mifune dominates the film as the hospital head it is the effect of his presence on the young doctor who pays him a visit that is the main theme of the narrative.  Yasumoto selfish and ambitious has no intention to begin with of devoting his services to the hospital but one by one his defences collapse as he learns from the example of an idealist who has shed all vestiges of selfishness.  There are constant reminders that medicine was at a rudimentary stage in its development and of the dedication needed by pioneers at a time when most answers still remained unknown and everything was largely a matter of easing rather than curing.  I would not claim that Red Beard is among Kurosawa's half dozen greatest works.  At just over three hours it sprawls in a discursive way.  A lengthy flashback of a dying patient's reasons for seeking a form of absolution rather impedes the narrative flow in spite of some impressive visuals of snowscapes and an earthquake.  But then the structure of the whole film rather has the episodic quality of a soap opera where momentum is maintained by proceeding from one crisis to another.  Nevertheless it is full of wonderfully contrasted sequences from the knockabout humour of Mifune applying his medical skills to warding off a group of assailants by breaking their limbs like matchsticks to the tender scene of the young doctor being nursed back from sickness by the girl rescued from enslavement in a brothel.  And then there is the rain.  Where would a Kurosawa film be without those torrential downpours to remind us of the physical discomfiture that a journey towards enlightenment entails.".

	schema:headline " Heartmelting warmth from Kurosawa";
	schema:reviewBody "spoiler warningMotion picture enthusiasts would at one time or another ask themselves the agonizing question of which is their bestloved film. I have often done that. Although I cannot be absolutely certain I'm inclined to choose Red Beard with Hello Dolly and Judgement at Nuremberg as close contenders.If I am allowed to use only one word to describe this film it will be warm. From Akahige flows a warmth that can be said to be almost uncharacteristic of Kurosawa or at least much more palpable than in any other of his films. This warmth is particularly seen in his portrayal of the little people borrowed fom Bob Hope in the 1971 Oscar Award at which Kurosawa is very good. The best example is in a scene close to the end.To set the scene the young doctor played by Yuzo Kayamo has almost completed his transformation from a sceptical arrogant apprentice to a humane loyal disciple under the eccentric but effective training of the head of the hospital played by Toshiro Mifune. In turn the young doctor is now helping with the tranformation of a juvenile prostitute rescued by Toshiro Mifune from a neurotic patient into a normal person. The example I have in mind is an episode between this girl and a small boy who has been driven to theft by poverty.While the girl is well on her way to recovery and helping with manual work in the hospital she has difficulty winning the acceptance of her coworkers. The episode started when they catch sight of the little boy trying to steal rice but fail to stop him. In the following day the girl managers to corner the little guy in the hospital. The conversation that ensues would break a heart of steel. What we see is two innocent children talking about poverty hunger and life in a matterofcourse manner without any wailing without any bitterness without even a trace of sadness. At the end she tells him not to steal any more and promises to bring him some food the following day.Unknown to them the conversation is heard by some of the girl's coworkers who end up in quiet sobs. The next day at lunch the girl tries to get an extra bowl of rice. One of the women who did not hear the conversation takes it away from her claiming that she does not need that much. Those who heard the conversation the day before immediately snatch the rice back for the girl claiming that she is a growing child and needs a lot of food. The scene is actually quite funny and will have you laughing but with a lump in your throat and mist in your eyes.There is so much about this film and I won't go into details. I must mention however the wonderful music which also has a feeling of warmth consistent with the film. In particular there is a hauntingly beautiful little tune accompanying throughout the young doctor's untiring patient and caring effort to help the girl recover from her traumatic experience.Toshiro Mifune put up one of his best performances. Yuzo Kayama a most popular staridol at that time comparable to Tom Cruise at his hay days played his role as a solid downtoearth actor. All the numerous supporting roles were extremely well cast. Most significant however are the very minor roles such as the labour women mentioned before that are equally captivating leaving a deep impression in the audience's mind. Therein lies Kurosawa's greatness.".

Yasumoto has just arrived from Nagasaki where he was learning medicine at a Dutch academy. Upon arriving at Red beard's clinic he learns that he is to stay there rather than to be called upon as an intern. This angers him for he had ambitions to be the doctor of the Shogun. The clinic is hardly a dream location. Plus he isn't exactly too keen on Red Beard's dictator like rules. He becomes arrogant and tries to break all the rules on purpose so Red beard will send him away. But in the process of facing the deaths of two of the clinic's patients he starts to change and begins to learn the true beauty of life. He begins to understand Red Beard's nonconservative thinking.The story is basically a coming of age story of Yasumoto. After intermission he begins to document the treatment of his first patient Otoyo. She is a young girl that they rescued from a brothel. But as he takes care of her he falls sick. She begins to take care of him. In a way they both were the needed cure for each other.Akira Kurosawa is most famous for his samuraiwar films like Seven samurai Yojimbo Sanjuro or Ran. But here we have a period piece that is not set as a samurai story. It is the simple story of a poor clinic and their struggles. An extremely personal film filled with beauty and emotion. The acting is some of the best you will ever see in a Kurosawa film. Mifune is excellent as the aging doctor as Yuzo Kayama is excellent as the young intern.If you can handle the length of three hours then there is no reason why you should avoid this film. The pacing is excellent and the film flows very nicely. One of Kurosawa's best.910".

It could be because the movie is 3 hours long but it is probably more due to the skill of Akira Kurosawa and his meticulous craftsmanship.Some complaints of the film are that it is slow too episodic too much like TV medical dramas it treats psychotherapy like the newfound Holy Grail and in 1965 Japan it might have been but the movie is so well done it doesn't really matter. Kurosawa considered 'Red Beard' his monument to the goodness of man and it is inspiring in such a way.Toshiro Mifune is wonderfully restrained as 'Red Beard' but you know when he starts rubbing his chin he's going to kick some ass mostly verbally but in one scene physically he beats the crap out of some thugs who don't want him to take a sick girl to his clinic. His character will cheat lie and even charge exorbitant medical fees just to ensure goodness prevails and the patients of his medical clinic get the help they need. He also will speak his mind beyond that of a typical doctor poor parents get chastised the lazy rich get a dressing down and even acknowledges that wellbeing is usually in the mind of the patient and sometimes the best doctor in the world cannot change that.As always it's a shame Kurosawa and Mifune went their separate ways after this film because they truly did bring out the best in one another.".

	schema:reviewBody "Red Beard was Akira Kurosawa final prayer for human kindness. Most of his previous work touched on this issue especially Ikiru but this would be the last. Afterwards his films grew dark in their examination of human weakness and unable to see a good future for mankind. They also lost the talent of Toshiro Mifune this too would be his last appearance in a Kurosawa film.The story is simple almost elementary in its convention. In early 19th century Japan the young nave doctor Yasumoto Yuzo Kayama comes to work in a free health clinic. He accepts his post grudgingly judging his surroundings to be beneath him. Through the instruction of an older doctor the wise Red Beard Mifune and exposure to human suffering around him he grows up and finds his place in the world of medicine. Although the plot seems predictable the human emotion Kurosawa discovers is not.Each episode of the movie feels alive with emotion alive with sorrow and with hope. Although the story surrounds Yasumoto with human suffering it is not about suffering but about learning step by step to find compassion. As we journey with Yasumoto through the story we are also the ones being challenged.Modern life bombards us suffering on a global scale. We read headlines from around the world know statics on poverty wars genocides and natural disasters. We see the overwhelming tide of human weakness and feel duly overwhelmed. Yet it felt so refreshing to see a film with characters who did not know the statics who only knew the hurting people in front of them. I felt challenged to know people the same way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers herein.Here we have another work by one of the the three top masters of film. It is uncomplicated and deep and highly regarded by many because of its accessibility and the high level of craft made obvious. But there is a deep problem here.One should say at the outset that even a problematic film by Kurosawa is still worth more than nearly everything else that enters the popular stream. But there was a reason Kurosawa collapsed after this. There is a reason it marks the end of an era.Kurosawa's anchor mastery is that he not only knows his way around the three disciplines of film writing dealing with actors creating a vision he knows how to fuse them. The more abstract the center of the storyvision the more complete that fusion. But as his fame grew with his value to the studio he came under greater pressure to be accessible and in this case he chose to explicitly moralize.That is where the disaster is rooted. In the past and later he was able to start with visual notions and build everything around that the story the nohcentric acting except in terms of immediacy and of course the moving frame we see. But this time he reaches further than ever into the lowest common denominator of popular life. And unfortunately for us that territory is exclusively literary. He borrows from Yamamoto and Dostoyevsky and gives us a series of episodes whose points we get but by getting them we place ourselves in a literary place in our mind not a visual one.In other words what makes him important is his ability to invest images with narrative. Go back and look at some of his early films with no sound or subtitles. You can completely get it. The words are only there to mollify our brain. Now flash forward to this. What we have is an illustrated book where all the narrative motion is in the spoken exposition. The difference in center is startling.No question that the pictures are still masterful. Still highly formal in composition and more importantly in the motion of the camera. But the pictures are now in service to the story the way more mundane directors work rather than the other way around. One still marvels at the eye especially the shot where the new doctor is engaged with the mad woman but at the same time one grieves that the Master has lost his center.What's left is a long slow journey back to the triumph of Ran' made ever so more important because of this voyage of the creative soul to recapture itself. Just as depicted in that film.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 4 Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "As good a director as he was Kurosawa sometimes let his keenness to get a point across undermine the quality of his films. This is the case with Red Beard a picture best known for being the last in a long line of collaborations with actor Toshiro Mifune.Kurosawa typically had a kind of mission statement with every film he made. During his 1960's output he appears to have become increasingly stubborn and obsessive in making a film for a reason. In the case of Red Beard he was appalled at the number of poor quality ultraviolent Samurai flicks being churned out in the wake of his own recent action pictures Yojimbo 1961 and Sanjuro 1963. As a backlash he decided to make a period picture with a peaceful nonaction theme more of a pure drama. Furthermore in an abandonment of the cynicism which had marked all his films from The Bad Sleep Well 1960 onwards he declared that Red Beard was to be a tribute to the goodness in humanity. There is nothing wrong with this is a basis for a film  it's just that Kurosawa tries too hard.Kurosawa was or at least had been a director who handled emotional moments with skill. Consider for example the terminally ill hero in Ikiru 1952 drunkenly singing in the bar or Kikuchiyo rescuing the baby in Seven Samurai 1954. Bearing these past triumphs in mind it's almost painful to see how he fails completely to achieve the same effect in Red Beard. Here the audience is practically bombarded with moments of strained poignancy. There is absolutely no subtlety as one heavyhanded sob story after another is cranked out.The problem is further compounded by the fact that Red Beard is structured as a series of short stories with the same setting as patients come and go at the hospital. It's really very difficult to share any feeling with the characters because we never really get to know them  we just hear about their past misery. Whenever characters cry which happens all the time it's difficult for the audience to connect to them. Eventually all the stories of grief and woe just start to sound ridiculous.Of course there is one overarching storyline that of the young doctor Yasumoto's transformation from being a selfish snob who resents having to treat poor people to a dedicated professional who takes satisfaction in his work. This is for me the most satisfying and engaging part of the plot. The most uplifting moment in the film is when Yasumoto wears his uniform for the first time and is immediately greeted with greater respect from both colleagues and patients.And in spite of his poor judgement with the plot Kurosawa's direction is still of good standard and there are plenty of marks of quality. He matches the warm sensitive tone of the film with a delicate approach to his shot composition and a slow and measured pace to each scene. In the first half of the film he shows Yasumoto's feelings about having to work at the clinic by shooting the interiors in such a way that they appear cramped and confining. When Yasumoto dons his uniform the spaces begin to open out and a little more light is let in. There's also a sly nod towards Kurosawa and Mifune's earlier pictures in the film's only real action sequence. It's choreographed just like the frantic armchopping scene from Yojimbo but rather than drawing a sword Mifune is instead twisting limbs and cracking bones in a completely bloodless fight.It's a pity that this was Mifune's swansong with Kurosawa not just because it's a poorer film but also because Mifune is somewhat sidelined to a secondary role in spite of being the titular character and it's not a performance where he really gets to flourish. While Mifune continued to be much in demand as an actor he only had a few memorable roles after this. Kurosawa's output slowed down considerably after Red Beard and it would be a long time before he was back on top form.".

It was that last time that his common leading man Toshiro Mifune would appear in one of his films.Mifune plays the title character Red Beard who is the head doctor in a government run clinic for the poor. One day a new intern Dr. Noboru Yasumoto Yuzo Kayama arrives at the clinic. He soon becomes angry and rebels against the rest in order to get thrown out of the clinic. He begins drinking heavily and refuses to wear his uniform. But soon he realizes from his patients himself and most importantly Red Beard what it means to become a good doctor.Red Beard is a long film that clocks over three hours but is never boring and  carries a strong message of what it means to be human. The widescreen cinematography is astounding.".

It was that last time that his common leading man Toshiro Mifune would appear in one of his films.Mifune plays the title character Red Beard who is the head doctor in a government run clinic for the poor. One day a new intern Dr. Noboru Yasumoto Yuzo Kayama arrives at the clinic. He soon becomes angry and rebels against the rest in order to get thrown out of the clinic. He begins drinking heavily and refuses to wear his uniform. But soon he realizes from his patients himself and most importantly Red Beard what it means to become a good doctor.Red Beard is a long film that clocks over three hours but is never boring and  carries a strong message of what it means to be human. The widescreen cinematography is astounding.";

	schema:reviewBody "Definitely superior to Seven Samurai RB is now my 2ndfavourite Kurosawa film narrowly behind his superb Scandal 1950 .This is the work of a director in complete control. The great script is sprawling and in the hands of a lesser mortal could have turned into a sentimental or even maudlin mess. Like many of AK's pieces starring Mifune the story is essentially an ensemble work. We are lead into patient's case histories and their life stories one of which even goes into flashback within flashback. Dr Niide aka Red Beard seems to be halfhealer half psychoanalyst as he see into men's hearts.Something no other reviewer has yet commented on is the humour. Yes this is serious drama but contain plenty of laughs. Right from the opening scene where the horrified medical graduate is taken step by depressing step into the place he has been tricked into taking and the trap which will prevent him from escape you really feel his growing anxiety and the buildup is very funny in a grim sort of way. Then there's the scene where Kurosawa does a brief Bruce Lee impression systematically breaking the limbs of a gang of toughs who try to prevent him taking a sick you girl out of a brothel. The hilarious part is what follows as RB loudly berates himself for acting in a manner not suited to one of his profession and that perhaps he went a bit too far. You've just gotta see this scene to fully appreciate it. And there are more.As we've come to expect from AK the acting is uniformly excellent. Particularly chilling was the mad woman in the short scene where she enters the young doctor's room. Slowly we are show why she was nicknamed The Mantis. And the girl who plays Otoyo is just as good and what happened to her ? IMDb records only one other film for her.Criticisms ? Only minor ones. This film could be read as a cliched triumph of the human spirit saga and the ending especially leans a bit on the syrupy side. If you lost concentration for awhile the sprawl of the story might get you a bit lost.But don't let this put you off. This is a truly great film and a definite mustsee.".

Im sure the new Wii version makes slicing zombies heads off all the more physically exertive so as to stay in physical parity with the main character who seems quite fit.Now the plot of the video game is pretty slim to none so the movie expands on this by adding SOME plot. Some backstory on the characters is good as well as a motivation to kill zombies and why of course there ARE zombies running amok. But nowhere does anyone ever bother to mention why she is always wearing a bikini and cowboy hat. Perhaps there is a vague Fistfull of DollarsGalaxy Express 999 reference here but still for those of us probing the sartorial functions of Oneechanbara's battle dress I guess we should just sit back and enjoy it without asking such pointless questions.The film action then is very much like the game action and therefore lots of fun. The fight scenes are the highlights and really shine. The pathos and drama are pretty standard but necessary. The whole picture tho is quite low budget and lacking any sort of quality acting talent. I believe the main actress was either a DVD pinup idol or a soft core porn star so we'll just say she's got a good future if the movie turns franchise. Maybe they'll explain more in a sequel. In the meantime hell she's a hot zombie killing bikini girl! Take that Milla Jovovich!".

Not that it matters really cos it's all about the bikini splatter here right? Sure the movie delivers lots of katana splatter as dozens of zombie extras in crude makeup get hacked and slashed but everything is so CGI heavy it takes some getting used to. The action scenes are reeking of video effects CGI blood gun flashes smoke fast forwards and all kinds of live action anime silly SFX. There's probably some wire work involved as well and the choreography and swordfighting is surprisingly decent.Chanbara Beauty is bursting apart in the seams but it's entertaining enough to warrant a view for exploitation hounds. If you can stomach the cheapo video SFX which are becoming a staple in Japanese flicks lately you'll probably have a good time but not without a yawn or two in the middle. It plays like a less gory less insane less actionpacked less wellmade version of The Machine Girl but if you want your fix of Japanese actionhorror exploitation this one's OK I guess.".

There are a few predictable twists and turns you can see for yourself but here's my list of what would have made this movie a little better 1. Focus on either the family drama OR the zombie killing. Directorwriter too inexperienced to handle both properly and the result is a messy concoction.2. The main character wears a skimpy outfit. And to be fair it's the main attraction of the movie. So why isn't she showing it off more? I remarked to my friend that the movie would have been lots better if it was just her doing pole dancing for 30 minutes. Maybe with zombies 3. The final showdowns are too long and simply too boring. LOTS of action to be sure but you're bored watching them. Tighter editing and pacing would have helped some but you really don't care about any of the characters due to poor development and pacing throughout the movie.4. The characters in the movie are two dimensional extremely so. Precious film time is wasted on many occasions and unfortunately that leaves less time to flesh out the leads. That includes the long winded flashback sequence that runs throughout the movie at intervals.There's more but you'll see all that for yourself if you watch it.It's shot on video. While that in itself is not a problem when everything else is amateurish it makes you feel like you're watching something hacked together in a high school film lab. There's a lack of contrast throughout the movie that makes it drab and bland to look at.There are two high points of the movie. The first is the fight scenes. When they're good they resemble something out of a violent video game. The fast action actually makes the rest of the movie pale in comparison. If only the whole movie could keep that high speed and action. The second high point is again her skimpy outfit. It fits a crazy universe but it also underlines that the rest of the movie is underdeveloped.The movie deserves a 4 for being mildly entertaining but add an extra star for the two high points.".

Similar to the game and full of zombies. The CGI effects are low but they managed to entertain the audience rather walking out or talking about the effects in the movie. The actors are good the acting was passable and the zombies. Well when did a zombie learn how to fight like kung fu warrior? Really people give it a try. It would be better if you rent this movie. If you liked it well add it in your collection. If not return it to the store. But what about me? I loved it so it deserves to be in my collection. I don't want to spoil the movie but there is some drama. Not strong a bit sad. But the important thing is that I had fun watching it. Just like The Machine Girl Wanted The Dark Knight Shamo The Battle of Red Cliff Three Kingdoms Hellboy II and Chocoate. Can't wait for Geisha vs Ninjas Tokyo Gore Police Sasori Shaolin Baba and Shaolin Girl.".

Yep this must be Japanese.Onechanbara is another entry into the quite popular ultragory shockaction genre of Japanese movies. It's overthetop in a thousand different ways and more akin to a video game which it's based on than most movies. All the violence is stylized and not the least bit realistic which fits the tone of the movie perfectly. There's lots of random slowmo and guns that never need to be reloaded and even the emotional moments and special effects are handled in a thoroughly cheesy way. There's lots of fighting and enough of a plot to string it all together. What more do you need? As for the story there's an evil scientist with a weird eye something about a search for a couple of sisters and more importantly loads o' zombies. I have no idea how closely the plot adheres to that of the games and I'm pretty sure that the people who made the movie probably don't either. If you're curious about why Aya wears a bikini and has a sword that appears to be magic or why Reiko's shotgun never runs out of ammo...well you're watching the wrong movie.

But it just didn't work out for me. Just have a look at her arm she has a rose tattoo but you can easily see that it was that kind of tattoo that's being given in a surprise egg and you have to add with water. But not only that some zombies look ridiculous you just see that they have put black makeup around there eyes. Some zombies do look fine and are doing gory stuff the one that's eating from a corpse but most effects are pure CGI even the gun shots are CGI and that was a let down for me. Of course the movie has to do it with the leading ladies and I must say they all look gorgeous and sexy leather suit and bikini's. It could have been really good but as most stories based on comics or games the fail to deliver some goods. Just have a look at the fight at the end it's too long.

Aya is seeking retribution for the heinous murder of her outnumbered father Reiko wanting vengeance for the death of her daughter and Katsuji desiring to rescue his kidnapped sister. Sisters will be on separate sides as Aya wishes to find her sibling Saki for her involvement in the death of their father. I guess you will like this movie if you are a fan of the video game because as an outsider this movie was really bonafide stupid. For some reason never explained Aya's sword emanates a glow when she swings and strikes her victims. Oh and she has this power which sends off an electrical impulse which sends zombies and her enemy sister hurling through the air. No matter the amount Aya mows through the undead with little challenge and often must assist Katsuji a bumbling coward who services the movie as a stumblingblock for our heroines needing to saved from near death multiple times. The violence is blatantly computer animated to the point that Onechanbara is little more than a video game with actors. The final showdown between Aya and Saki is polluted with these effects where both have superhuman abilities each shining with a different color as they move in the air like birds in flight when their swords meet we can see bright sparks sending off neon light. It gets so absurd either you accept it on pure comic terms or like me just roll your eyes at this nonsense. Chise Nakamura is Saki Aya's sisterly nemesis whose abilities are manufactured thanks to Dr. Sugita whose mission was to capture a pure blood Imichi so he could create the ultimate race of superior power..Sugita's ulterior motives all along were to use Saki to secure him Aya. The movie introduces a girl MariaAi Hazukias a melodrama piece for Reiko immediately attaches to her because of her previous loss of a daughter she had to kill due to zombie infection. Anytime Reiko shoots someoneor if anyone fires a weapon for that matterthe bullets are computer graphically simulated and never once look authentic..pathetic. Oh the movie gives Sugita an albino eye so he must be pure diabolical like some James Bond madman. The director pays homage to Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill including a zombie almost identically modeled after Go Go Yubari and her swinging spiked metal ball. Well you do get Otoguro in a bikini for the entire pictureeven though she's wearing a stickon tattoo of a rose on her shoulder!and she does look mighty delectable swinging a katana sword so at least this blah movie has that going for it. I imagine zombie fans will find this ultimately quite a disappointment because the flesheating is never visible or stomachchurning which is always a nono with that audience. I figure this works much better in the animated video game world where it belongs.".

	schema:reviewBody "For a low budget horror  girlbuddy road picture with two pretty girls taking on zombie hordes this could have been worse. The budget was well used and the camerawork was enthusiastic and imaginative including an effect where blood spatter would appear to land on the lens. The effects were below the standard of something like Tokyo Gore Police but good enough to convince and the massed Zombie attacks actually got more elaborate as the movie went on as if the director got more confident with his action scene staging. The actress playing the central role of the bikini wearing samurai Eri Otoguro is a cipher. She handles the action well enough but gives nothing in the way of a performance beyond the occasional stern look which frankly comes off looking more confused than anything else. The secondary lead Manami Hashimoto as a leather clad shotguntoting bad girl is an older and obviously more competent actress and she actually winds up carrying the middle part of the picture. Very watchable but like all Japanese ultraviolence this one is not for the squeamish.".

	schema:headline " Proof that even niche video games never translate well to film";
	schema:reviewBody "As a huge fan of the Oneechanbara series I was excited to hear that it was adapted to film.The film is lowbudget but then so are the games. The effects are good for what they are and for what budget the film had.It tries. But while there are elements that seem lifted directly from the games most of the film is completely unlike them. Who did they think their audience was supposed to be? The only character resembling her basis is Aya and that's generally because Otoguro Eri is never allowed to emote nor is anything done with her character other than a few flashbacks that tell us nothing we couldn't have guessed.The rest of the game characters in the film are tremendously disappointing. Saki is not the insane little bloodthirsty terror from the games she's just a dullard. Reiko is played by the only actress allowed to do anything with her part Hashimoto Manami but it's a paperthin part. While the actress is unquestionably talented the direction and the script are only a disappointment. Since Reiko is my favourite regular character in the main series it was especially sad to see her handled so poorly in the film. She doesn't even wear the glasses that the character is known for! The attempt at turning her into some sort of sympathetic tragic heroine completely fails and only manages to disturb the pace. After Reiko's part was done I was through with the film. It didn't have enough in the remaining story to make me care about the rest.So Aya and Saki are fighting...who cares? Saki is barely shown and only built up in flashbacks and incoherent inexplicable cutscenes that have no reason for existing and do nothing for her since like Otoguro Eri Nakamura Chise is never allowed to emote even slightly. There is no real resolution to anything and as it constantly diverges from the game's continuity it's a constant exercise in frustration. The games may not be brilliant but at the very least they are consistent in their own continuity. The film tries to be something different and manages to overcomplicate a fundamentally simple premise while simultaneously underdeveloping it which leads to abysmal failure.Suwa Tarou as the superfluous Dr. Sugita is suitably despicable but his part in the proceedings manages to give the impression that the scriptwriters didn't feel comfortable having a main antagonist be female. If Sugita had been omitted and Saki actually developed as the main antagonist it would have at least been a stronger story and the final confrontation more satisfying.Similarly Waki Tomohiro is generally charismatic as Katsuji but the part is terrible. He often acts completely illogically for anyone in his situation and although we are almost moved to sympathy for him at one point it quickly vanishes due to his persistent ineptitude and selfishness. That he essentially gets the only fulfilling victory of the entire film is nothing short of inexcusable this is supposed to be about Aya and the others not about a comic relief bumbler who ceases to be amusing less than halfway through the film.The zombies are well made up but they are inconsistent with the game here too. They move too quickly and too ably. In the games excepting special types they generally have speeds from 'shuffle' to 'shuffle a little more quickly'. I was especially disappointed that none of the special zombie types appeared in the film not even the iconic mud creatures that present a ubiquitous challenge.The fight choreography is fantastic and the stunts are very good. If only there were more types of the zombies! The premise also doesn't fit with the games as in the film the world has been ravaged by a sudden vast zombie plague. Amusingly this originates at the D3 Corporation which is an inside joke D3 Publishers are the game series' publisher.All in all the film is a tremendous disappointment for any fan of the series. It isn't a game series just about some random emotionless girl in a bikini and a cowboy hat but that's exactly what the film feels like people cosplaying as characters from the game who are actually nothing like them in a situation that isn't particularly similar to the game except in a superficial way. The overall tone is one of subtle yet annoying sexism I know it seems odd to say that since the games can be taken as sexist. However the games chronicle the adventures of a group of very capable strong decisive women who can save the world. They are often opposed by other powerful women. Certainly there's titillation. Games need it to sell. I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't love to see a male character or two pop up in a future Oneechanbara title or for there to be an male equivalent game but at the same time I wouldn't be buying it for the titillation...I'd be buying it knowing I'd have a great deal of fun fighting zombies with interesting colourful characters in an absorbing world.The film just did not deliver. I wanted very much to enjoy it but it didn't happen. Perhaps if it hadn't dropped the ball on all the characters and failed to develop Aya or Saki changed Reiko too much and ended up unsatisfying and added token male characters who really did nothing for the plot it would have been enjoyable. But it wasn't even watchable. It smacked of the same halfeffort that marks most gametomovie conversions superficial similarities in some ways a few references for fans and an otherwise completely incomprehensible production.With a series this much of a niche title one would think that the makers would have made it more faithful because mainly the only people seeing it were going to be the fans. Apparently they thought differently.Play the games instead. They'll entertain you for much longer.".
