But the company is running out of cash its main client is stalling and share values are falling. For Tom to maintain the firm's appearance he must find cash investors could rescue him but at a high cost of his potential wealth and company control. Tom goes to his brother for a loan.

	schema:reviewBody "August is a very finite and pointed film. It's a lowflying indie sleeper that has its points to make and it makes them quite effectively. Above all it really manages to nail a small moment in time that of the dotcom implosion.I along with many others I'm sure was part of a dot com startup similar in some respects to Landshark. It was very common in those days of overhyped speculation to bet tons of VC generated startup capital on IDEAS that looked promising when in reality much needed to happen before they could be realized. This didn't hold true for all startups but a fair majority.It's very easy to get caught up in the delusion that you're a real company when your stock is shooting up the charts and quite a glass of ice water to the face to realize all that speculated valuation can disappear overnight which it did slowly over the course of late 2000 and 2001...it was never really there to begin with.August grabs that bursting bubble in a number of effective ways. As the film progresses it becomes apparent that for all of Tom's boasting and bluster he's nothing more than a hypedup spin doctor. Watching this revelation sink his ego is entertaining if not more than a bit sad. Hartnett does an adequate job with the role.The most truetolife scene for me was the mass of staffers flocking around FkedCompany.com which was a popular barometer for the sinkage rate of companies about to go bellyup instead of lounging at their Ikea desks playing solitaire...they're not lazy they just have nothing to do...no customers no product.As a film this is a tough one to sell to an audience who doesn't have firsthand experience in the story's premise. There is a lot of businessfinancial terminologyslang thrown around that to those not knowledgeable or interested in it will seem very boring.It does what Indies do best...present a slice of life with no pat clichs or feelgood endings.

The plot in August is beset by ominious news stories preceeding fall. I thought the movie was terrific. I got it. The scene with David Bowie was SUPERB. I can't tell you enough about his character and the nose bleed he gives the protagonist  which comes down to the whole point of the movie and what's important in life. Also important is... the people you crush when rise to the top you'll see on the way down when you fall. Or however the expression goes. In other words PLAY NICE.Analysis Recommend".

	schema:reviewBody "Screened this at the Sundance 2008 Festival. This movie actually caught me by surprise it was very hip and surprisingly Josh Hartnett really brought it. The movie has a modern Wall Street type vibe the story follows Tom Hartnett who is a super confident .com entrepreneur who is in crisis mode during the downward spiral of the .com stock bust just before September 2001. Hartnet nails this role with high energy output and makes this a very watchable flick. Austin Chick the director is obviously very talented and throws just the right amount of style and cool music into the film to keep it slick and contemporary which should broaden its appeal past just the GenX group. The one downside is that the film gives the other characters so little room to make their presence felt especially David Bowies character who gets only a few minutes of face time. Other then that the movie really has a nice pace and the ending worked very well when you consider all the superficial things that Americans thought they cared about until Sept 2001 and then realized there are somethings much more important then money and stature.Film should get some nice play on the indie circuit though indie folks probably will be hard swayed to pay over for a Hartnett movie. I would reckon that Josh Hartnett will win over some who doubted him with this performance and maybe even get a little award type talk. I know its hard for me to believe either ".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly good movie and performances";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the surprise of the year so far for me.This excellent little film tells a story of two brothers and their struggling company in a timeline that just precedes 911. Several people on IMDb have commented that they don't see why the movie needed to be cheapened with a 911 theme or some such nonsense. Let's be clear this movie is not about 911 but this was historically a crucial point for the dotcom bubble.The movie does actually a wonderful job highlighting these events without spelling them out in some awkward exposition. The story focuses mostly on one of the brothers The Charismatic Tom played by Josh Hartnett who mostly handles the business aspects. Director Austin Chick does a good job immersing us in his life his lifestyle his struggles and his ambiguities. His uneasy rapports with his brother Joshua cofounder of the company Landshark who is the quiet tech guy behind the operation. With his parents. His former girlfriend. Various other persons in his life and business dealing. It's an absolutely fascinating portrait. What really helps is Hartnett's performance. Now I'm sorry to say I never was a fan of this fairly popular actor and he had failed to impress me until now... but this has changed. Hartnett is in fact the main strength of this movie makes the story come alive and shines among a very very solid cast around him. Tom's role as a confident brash young guy who must keep appearance and keep his company afloat while he knows it's going down along with his personal life required a good acting palette.It is a strength of the movie that it manages to push both the story of Tom and present an interesting portrait of this time period where economically things were crashing. What we have here is a movie that could very well have been boring to death due to its topic finances are a fairly abstract thing and usually not terribly interesting unless they're your own but instead becomes fascinating. In many ways it is reminiscent of Wall Street. Various speeches that Tom delivers and his bout of negotiations lead to several strong moments.This is a great movie. Where pretty much every scene is worthwhile and supports the overall themes that are pushed. Director Chick seems to have a purpose with every element presented and even the elements not present. Consider we never get to know what Landshark does. At all. Which might seem weird yet is terribly fitting since along with other shooting star companies of the time it was all a smoke screen anyway.Great movie probably a must buy for those who have an interest in the dotcom bubble.".

It was a strange time when the real world seemed evermore like an episode of the Twilight Zone.Though there might have been some minor glitches in the film I think overall it captured the essence of that period and its odd collection of characters surprisingly well.If there is any one film that is a portal into that culture and time and does so in an entertaining but reasonably accurate way this would be that film.

It was a strange time when the real world seemed evermore like an episode of the Twilight Zone.Though there might have been some minor glitches in the film I think overall it captured the essence of that period and its odd collection of characters surprisingly well.If there is any one film that is a portal into that culture and time and does so in an entertaining but reasonably accurate way this would be that film. It certainly deserves notice and the time it takes to watch which is a lot more than can be said for some other attempts at this genre'.";

	schema:reviewBody "Good storytelling can either tell you what happens tell you how it was or both. Most moviegoers the superficial ones watch a movie for the what happens. They want to meet a character that they like and see something good happen to them with a good in between. And so when they watch a movie they expect a story and they like it or dislike it without considering everything that the movie is trying to do. Don't make that mistake when watching August.August is a movie that tells a story a this is what happened to Tom and his company and his brother and his life but that is not the REAL of this movie. This movie does a much better job of telling the movie watcher a this is how it was than a this is what happens. So when you watch August which i think you should absorb the movie for the parts that elaborate on the environment the time place and attitudes surrounding August 2001 not just the story or the dialog or the sometimes lack thereof.It's a movie that tells the story of two brothers that started a dotcom that survived the tech bubble collapse and its story in reality does the job of representing the not so apparent futures of the people left in the dotcom world after its demise.What is even more enjoyable about the movie than its overall plot which like i said isn't the real story is Josh Hartnett's character who not only represents the image of the dotcomer CEO circa 1999 but also speaks the truly empty rhetoric of the times that feed and fueled the tech bubble for so long. Just listening to his speech and realizing that he's talking about practically nothing but making it sound like he's preaching the new age gospel the evangelical oratory of the egeneration in part produces the statement the movie is trying to make about the times.So don't watch this movie for the story or to see what happens. Watch this movie with the understanding that its a movie that tries to capture a period in time its character's and its subplotsdevices being either deeper representing somethingsomeone more generic or being empty just a way to kill time or build a character in a way that is unimportant to the deeper meaning. Enjoy the movie. Just be aware of what to look out for.".

Landshark the company he founded with his brother Joshua Adam Scott and of which he is currently CEO has a couple hundred employees on its payroll but pretty much everyone who works there is at a loss to explain just what it is the firm does or produces. Even worse the company that was once valued at well over threeandahalf million dollars is now worth just a paltry fraction of that amount the business model having apparently failed to pan out as expected.As written by Howard A.

That many of these people were making their fortunes out of little more than the cyber equivalent of chewing gum and bailing wire  while producing nothing of any real substance or value in the long run  is what eventually led to disaster for so many of them and for the economy as a whole.August does a reasonably effective job capturing the moral emptiness and emotional shallowness of the characters and the world they inhabit but when all is said and done the movie lacks the dramatic heft and focus needed to turn it into a profound and major work. The minor characters are bland and insufficiently developed and even Tom is deficient in the kind of depth and shading he would need to make him a representative tragic hero for our time. That being said the movie does offer some intriguing insights into the way the business world works these days and into which type of individual typically succeeds in the new arena.

	schema:headline " Best Yet From Josh Harnett With This Near Perfect Script";
	schema:reviewBody "Many find life like a boat with a sail billowing in the wind. Sometimes the wind is not there but for a few those that can will sail away into fortune. Josh Hartnett's character epitomizes those optimists. We catch up to this wheeler dealer just a few months before the actual huge part of the bubble finally burst starting in March 2001. There was no indication from watching this film that it had anything to do with the times other than the film was supposedly taking place and ended soon before the fateful day of 911. This apparently was not mentioned in the film however some reviewers tend to connect this film to a procession of unraveling events that seem to showcase the end of our way of thinking the dawn of a new era.There are many wonderful things that I could say about this film. Some would argue that it's just a meandering waste of time. After watching other films such as Purpose 2003 Boilerroom and WallStreet this film seemed to fit a different kind of niche in my memory. More or less that niche centered around the extreme confidence and undying drive that Hartnett portrayed playing Tom.Whereas the message pretty much comes off the same in the end a person or company hitting a socalled brick wall or the end of the track right before the train falls off into the ravine. In Promise the main theme seemed to be centered around John a software developer who becomes a billionaire overnight when he takes his company public. John unfortunately gets caught up in the fame greed and power and all the vein distractions that go along with living the new high life. Inevitably our Dotcom guy must learn what's really important in order to save his invention and company from a hostile takeover. Fundamentally John learns that love and a sense of purpose are more powerful and more valuable than money.With Tom in August you already know that this guy has a sense of purpose but can't really believe that failure is in the picture. Thus for all intents and purposes we are taken on a journey into the daily life of Tom to see how he really ticks and what he really thinks. We finally see who Tom really is and how he blames the other leeches for his unforeseen failure. Some animosity comes out when Rip Torn who plays his father pushes Tom to the limit of his own inner ego bubble when he insinuates that LandSharks the company is a company of Oreo eating lazy teenagers who do absolutely nothing. Tom views his brother's and his father's ideology foreign and corrupt from his own. That's when the partying pansy pretty passively provokes pity pugnaciously putting punches on his own face by pissing someone he knows off just for the fun of it. This behavior soon carries him to the final seen where David Bowie tells him how the cow is getting ready to eat the cabbage. Bravo performance goes to everyone including Ron Insana who plays himself Robin Tunney who plays Melanie Hanson Naomie Harris who plays the on again failed relationship Sarrah and Adam Scott who plays the brilliant yet not so businessminded brother Joshua who delivers his down to earth perspective on what's really going on. In conclusion John Hartnett makes this film totally believable and hands down should have put him in the running for an Oscar for his role except that somehow his pervasively pensive prose put people off. Too bad he could never do this again with his own brother was the last thought felt by him but that was alright!".

	schema:headline " A haunting glimpse into the alluring yet volatile Dot.com era";
	schema:reviewBody "August is a drama that chronicles the fall after the dizzying rise of a dot.com startup company in August of 2001. The plot centers around two brothers Tom and Josh Sterling and the company they costarted called Landshark. They rapidly become flush with cash and promise. What Landshark actually does is never really explained but its almost superfluous information. Dot.com companies were everywhere looking for venture capitalist market niches. Actually leaving the audience vague about what it is Landshark did lent to the authentic feel of the time in which the film is set. The stock market was full of IPO's from all these literally unknown companies that mushroomed up all over America almost overnight. Then at the end of March of 2001 the dot.com market went into a financial free fall leaving young millionaires frantic. Many were left with nothing and sold out stock shares at abysmal percentage rates just to get out alive. Tom Sterling played by Josh Hartnett is the entrepreneur of Landshark and his brother Josh Adam Scott the brain. Tom is faced with a difficult moral dilemma as the company crashes taking his world with it. Josh has a wife a newborn and a mortgage. He wasn't in this business for the highroller lifestyle but to provide for his family. Tom's meteoritic success makes him cocky and uncaring. It affects those around him. When he is faced with a defining moment of truth what he decides affects others too. There is an excellent character study here in watching Tom struggle. The film opens with a jump back a few months and works its way back to the conclusion of the story. It is well shot with attention to detail regarding the timeline of events occurring circa the second half of 2001. It includes many television coverage clips and a very relevant music soundtrack to 2001. The film aptly portrays the slick flashy immersion in hipness and money that was attributed to the dot.com minions. The values of the nouveau riche prior to 911 false feelings of invincibility an infinite Utopian existence are demonstrated by the careless lifestyle and attention to material detail. The costume and set designers did a meticulous job with this. It's evident in the overaccessorized showy offices at Landshark and the bercool wardrobe worn by Tom Sterling and his staff. The screenplay is written exceptionally well. It boasts snappy and sarcastic dialog. It also has a lot of detailed Internet and IPO related jargon. Viewers may find this difficult to relate to. I found the script accessible. The basic points needed to set the tone were concise and the remainder could be inferred from the context and circumstance. In films with a particular subject matter I don't think it a necessity to dumb things down for the audience. Oversimplifying in this case would have detracted from the film's authenticity.Josh Hartnett plays Tom Sterling extremely well. He has a weary tough look around his inky dark eyes by the time we meet him. He runs Landshark with a cavalier attitude and we see him slowly come to the realization that the bubble is bursting. You see him knowing it yet simultaneously not wanting to. He really captures the essence of the times suitably preaching about the power and future of technology which was characteristic of the era. One of the better ways to learn a lesson is through film. On a meaningful day a film is a moving tale of the human condition dressed up in lots of bells and whistles to make it more palatable. Hidden deep inside the recesses of an eventful plot favorite actors and a colorful feast for the eyes and ears nestles a message like a pearl in an oyster shell. That's what a film is supposed to do. August does just that. We experience an exhilarating rollercoaster ride from an obsolete era and watch Josh Hartnett's handsome face crinkle with a myriad of emotions as a pulsing rhythmic soundtrack filters through our ears yet we are learning something. We are learning about the value of family about selfreparation about humility.".

His partner the creative genius of the organization is Adam Scott as Joshua Josh Sterling a nervous new papa. Mr. Hartnett is optimistic even when it comes to beautiful brownskinned exgirlfriend Naomie Harris as Sarrah.Singermusician David Bowie has a cameo as wheelerdealer mogul after Hartnett's business.Unfortunately not a great film but August should put director Austin Chick and cinematographer Andrij Parekh on a watch list their greenhued New York looks rich.

One scene that is particularly funny is the one in the recording studio. This pretty much reminded me of how a lot of actresses who couldn't sing had their voices dubbed by a professional singer of course this could have been inspired by noted singer Marni Nixon who dubbed many of Hollywood's leading ladies including Audrey Hepburn and Natalie Wood.  But the funniest scene was the one in the candy store in which Morty is constantly going up and down the ladder getting jelly beans for the three kids and finally explodes when the last kid asks for them.

Because of that The Errand Boy rates right up there with the best of Jerry's work in film. Brian Donlevy plays the head of Paramutual Studios and he and the rest of the Paramutual clan hire this klutzy paperhanger to root out the inefficiency in operations at the studio which is costing them money. Again because no one would suspect Lewis of being any kind of a spy because no one would suspect of having any kind of brain. Pretty thin if you ask me.Still if it weren't for Donlevy's folly we wouldn't get this marvelous film. Some wonderful comedy bits are far too numerous to mention but some of my favorites were him taking Kathleen Freeman through the car wash and getting her properly waxed the drowning sequence in the pool his appearance as an extra in Sig Ruman's film causing Ruman the director to have a nervous breakdown. Best of all at the birthday party for star Iris Adrian Jerry opening a yard high magnum of champagne which comes out with the force of a fire hose.Because so little dialog is used The Errand Boy is probably the film that critics most often cite when they say and I agree that Jerry Lewis could have been one of the classic silent screen star right up there with Chaplin Lloyd and Keaton.

Additionally some of the bits are pretty badwith some serious overacting by Jerry Lewis. Yet despite its faults the film is pleasant and entertaining.I could describe the plot but frankly it never made sense and occupied little of the film. Suffice to say that dopey Morty Lewis is hired as an errand boy at a film studio and ends up repeatedly screwing up pretty much everything he does. And in the end there is a twista nice one at that.Very few people would notice that much of The Errand Boy was lifted from the Harold Lloyd feature Movie Crazy. Part of the reason folks won't recognize this is that it's a rather obscure filmcreated in the talking picture era when he was no longer quite the star he was during the silent days. Additionally the film has been seen quite inaccurately as a dudwhereas it's really a dandy film. Here Lewis resurrects much of this old film and into it injects lots of silliness. Some of the silliness doesn't work as was often the case the timing was a problemskits were something overdone and drawn out way too muchespecially the ones involving mispronunciations and some does. I really didn't enjoy the pathos in scenes involving puppets but must admit a few of the skits such as Jerry in the pool were quite funny. Overall a VERY mixed bag and a film much like Lewis' other plot less film The Bell Boy which I actually prefer. Worth seeing if you are a fan.By the way for classic TV buffs you'll easily recognize Howard McNear Floyd the Barber from The Andy Griffith Show. But if you look closely you'll also see Barry Livingston Ernie from My Three Sons in a skit involving jellybeans.".

True we do encounter some heavy slapstick and fartoobroad satire and there is some wistful yet rather too obvious cutesy stuff with puppets.

Some of the sketches  crowded into an elevator climbing a ladder to get jelly beans for kids  don't have any connections with a movie studio at all. In short I feel that an opportunity for some really amusing satire was lost. I regard The Patsy as more consistently amusing. That movie also had a superior support cast. Sig Ruman is glimpsed but briefly here. However Stanley Adams as the mail room chief is amusingly choleric. On the other hand Howard McNear way overdoes the sycophant while Brian Donleby delivers one of his duller stiffer performances. Iris Adrian however is always welcome. Disappointingly production values are only average A. It's a pity there were no more surprise guest stars than Lorne Greene and company. As a director Lewis uses lots of closeups but is generally efficient despite the jerky continuity. The lighting photography however is unusually dark and somber for a comedy.".

His job is to work as an errand boy and find out why the studio is spending so much money. Whilst on the job he learns about the inner workings of the movie industry and more about himself in the process. Can he survive working for such a demanding business?Love him or hate him you can't say Jerry Lewis is unoriginal. After a slow start the movie kicks into high gear when the gags begin. Besides being an entertaining film you also get a good look at the actual inner workings of a movie studio. There's even a couple of funny cameos and surprises. Personally I don't like Jerry Lewis' work with Dean Martin and his solo outings. But when he's the actorwriterdirector he's a real hoot!I have to highly recommend this movie.

Those were the days...We need to work our way through a selfcentered and self serving Jerry Lewis. As an earlier comment correctly stated Jerry Lewis didn't manage to come up with the not too bright underdog with a golden heart trying to live the American dream facing many obstacles but making it in the end  story even though this was clearly his idea of the storyline. You can call me names for my next statement Sylvester Stallone did that thing much better even though not through a comedy in his first two Rocky movies.Anyway this still is a Jerry Lewis classic with many great scenes. Undoubtedly the best being him doing a perfectlyinsync routine to Blues in Hoss Flat as usual impeccably performed by the great Count Basie big band.Some other material such as the radio that won't stop playing even when smashed to bits has been done much better in 1940s Warner Brothers cartoon shorts. The two scenes where Morty Jerry Lewis meets living puppets are rather painful and reminiscent of Charles Chaplin's later work Limelight etc. It's in the crying Clown tradition and rather out of place in this otherwise funny and inventive movie. The puppets a little clown and in a later scene a talking female ostrich magically coming to life yet obviously performed by rather average puppeteers in a comedy are the only beings who really understand our hero? I'm afraid this is very weak material.Jerry Lewis also has his serius moment in movies like Cinderfella and they are totally out of place as well. But that is a classic a comedian trying to show his or her serious side. I will be tolerant and understanding forgiving.If you are a Jerry Lewis fan The Errand boy is a must see in any case. Jerry lewis definitely was and remains a great inspiration to contemporary film comedians such as Steve Martin and Jim Carrey.".

Check out the scene in the board room where Jerry does a great mime to a Count Basie track. Unfortunately there is the usual sentiment which slows the comedy down and I personally find that boring and a bit off putting but when the comedy returns it's well worth waiting for.I would place this movie up there with The Nutty Professor and It's Only Money a film I REALLY do think is underrated.If you've never seen a Jerry Lewis film you could do a lot worse than start with this and don't let any of Jerry detractors put you off  judge for yourself.The man's an idiot but a brilliant idiot!!!".

This is one of those movies an action flick with tongue firmly placed in cheek that is very much in the vein of Con Air with its sense of humour.The plot is basically one part road movie one part 'Speed' and two parts 'The Rock' as two bluecollar losers in the shape of Skeet Ulrich and Cuba Gooding Jr find themselves in possession of a top secret military chemical weapon that will detonate and kill millions of people if its temperature exceeds 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Pursued by a renegade military General the duo set off against all odds to return the weapon to the nearest secure outpost but there's a hitch they have to cross the desert to do so.It may be more Renny Harlin than William Shakespeare in its premise but the end result is a riotous hour and thirty minutes worth of entertainment. Skeet and Cuba make for a great on screen pair their bickering providing plenty of laughs and one liners while Peter Firth is brilliant as the scenerychewing villain. What makes it even more fun is that unlike its contemporaries the two lead characters are utterly hapless. They are just a pair of ordinary guys thrust into a situation beyond their control rather than muscleclad indestructible bodybuilders or Kung Fu experts and they only really survive unscathed by bumbling through the fight scenes.You can tell the cast are having a great time and in all honesty Cuba Gooding Jr seems to be enjoying himself so much it's a surprise he doesn't grin like a cheshire cat throughout the whole movie. So get some beers in get your mates round switch your brain off and check it out its a really enjoyable film.".

A year and a half pass and what do you know this same movie comes on Cinemax ironically on my birthday. So I decided to check it out and man I was pleased with what I saw. Maybe this film might not have the greatest plot I know but it sure as heck keeps you entertained throughout the whole movie. Not many action movies can keep you entertained for the entire duration of the movie but this film succeeds in keeping you engaged the entire time. The chemistry between Cuba Gooding Jr. and Skeet Ulrich can be ultimately seen in every scene. This film had solid action and the characters are a little hokey but who cares.

I personally was rooting for the bad guys throughout which is kind of a problem in these sort of movies. But anything to shut Cuba Gooding up. Apparently they blew their budget on a few effect shots  the schtik of the movie is that the bomb has to remain cold or it'll go off and you'd think there'd be a lot of sequences playing around with that but not really and whenever it looks edgy there's always a cold mountain stream or a handy fat guy with a case of beer in a cooler to save the day. Most of it is a dull car chase around what looks like a resort town in Montana.My guess is that early versions of the script were much more of a straight up black comedy with two lunkheads saving the day for the wrong people.

	schema:reviewBody "It seems the nineties was the best decade for action films when it came to things such as Judgment Night and Speed. But here's a film that is forgotten and so under the radar you could lose it. Chill Factor's purpose is nothing but a funny quirky feelgood action film. Don't you just love those films? Some films are put on this world to entertain and that's what Chill Factor's goal is. It certainly does in parts as well. The first twentyfive minutes were looking sort of grim but the pairing of Cuba Gooding Jr. and Skeet Ulrich worked in the film's favor because the script made Cuba's character smart and funny. Rarely do I leave a movie wanting more but I actually wouldn't have mind if after the credits the film kept going.The story is a strange one and it doesn't help to just evaluate it for hours. But a bomb has been made that will explode if it reaches fifty degrees Fahrenheit. This bomb nicknamed ELVIS is now in the hands of Arlo Gooding Jr. and Tim Ulrich. The rest of the film is a cat and mouse chase between Arlo and Tim and the US Army who wants to obtain the device so they could sell it to a foreign country and get revenge on the United States.This also one of those films where its better to go along for the ride than try to evaluate it. I had fun just watching everything unfold. Sometimes I was lost and other times I was enjoying myself. I used to watch countless action movies as a kid most notably Speed and not pay any attention whatsoever to the dialog. I would just rock back and forth and enjoy the explosions fast cars and tension. If I saw Chill Factor as a kid I think I would've found my new favorite film.When compared to Cuba Gooding Jr.'s previous action film Judgment Night this is greatly inferior. When compared to current action films that have nothing more to offer than fast cars wet tshirts and six packs Chill Factor's premise may be a little bulky but it's acceptable. It isn't long. Isn't convoluted to the point of confusion amongst the audience. It fits into the box it picked.Starring Cuba Gooding Jr. and Skeet Ulrich. Directed by Hugh Johnson.".

	schema:headline " Third Rate Guy Flick";
	schema:reviewBody "This 3rd rate action adventure guy flick will probably set Cuba Gooding Jr.'s career back about 10 years.  This film is basically a variation on Speed' where instead of keeping the bus above 50 mph they had to keep the unstable chemical warfare bomb below 50 degrees.Two regular guys actually two screw ups must save the world from a group of rogue military mercenaries who are trying to steal a potent chemical weapon and sell it on the open market.  The chemical is unstable above 50 degrees Fahrenheit and will explode stripping the skin from any living creature within a hundred miles.  Our heroes must get this doomsday weapon to the nearest army base armed only with a broken down ice cream truck and a pistol with no ammo.  The half a dozen bad guys are all have elite military background the latest in electronic equipment souped up SUV's and an arsenal of advanced weaponry.  Predictably the mercenaries are no match for our screw ups.This film is one big chase scene that takes implausibility to new heights of incredulity. The dialogue between Arlo Gooding and Tim Skeet Ulrich is mindless tripe that attempts to be funny but merely makes the characters seem pathetic.  This is consistent with all the writing in this screenplay which is mostly hack.As far as I can tell this is Hugh Johnson's debut as a first line feature director having mostly done assistant and second unit direction and cinematography.  In this regard he fails to distinguish himself.  His camera work was pedestrian and scene selection was pretty much stock for the genre. The first third of the film was shot with a blue filter to get a dark look.  The odd thing was he kept the blue filter for the indoor shots and subsequent daytime shots.  This indiscriminate use of the filter rather than creating an effect just made the entire film look washed out.  Then suddenly he abandoned it entirely.  On a plus note the stunts and pyrotechnics were handled well as were the special effects when the chemical weapon test went awry at the beginning of the film.  There were some effective moments of suspense like when they tried to take the oversized ice cream truck past the narrow road on the cliff.  Cuba Gooding Jr. did his best to bring life to a very insubstantial character.   He was witty and energetic as always but there was no saving Arlo.  Skeet Ulrich was utterly bland as Tim Mason.  David Paymer was decent as the arrogant scientist who's ambition for his work exceeded the limits of prudent science.  Peter Firth was dreadful as the evil Captain Brynner leader of the rogue soldiers.  All in all this film was a loser.  I gave it a 310.  For guys who want a good beer buzz movie while the wife and kids are out of town this might be okay.  Otherwise steer clear.".

I have however always regarded this movie as the sort of turning points in their careers as it's simply a very bad genre movie with a lame concept and a story that borrows too much from much better other genre movies.It's not just its concept that makes this movie bad it's just the overall execution of it all as well. For an action movie it simply isn't a very good one not in the least because it also borrows heavily from other movies and just isn't original enough on its own to really add anything. The movie is like Speed meets Die Hard meets The Rock and than some movies thrown in the mix with it.No I didn't really enjoyed watching this movie even though the movie obviously got aimed toward it to bring some entertainment by also adding a dose of comedy to the movie. Gooding Jr. has just never really been my favorite comedy actor and Skeet Ulrich just doesn't fit this genre. The movie tries to be like a buddy flick in which two totally different mismatched persons just by chance end up with each other running from a couple of bad guys who want to have a new deadly chemical weapon that detonates when it reaches temperatures over 50 degrees. Luckilly Gooding Jr. is an ice cream truck driver. This already should provide you a troubling image of how this entire movie is being like. Seems amazing to me in the first place that they decided to turn this concept into a movie. Its concept alone was reason for people to not go and see this movie which made this movie an instant flop already far before it had been released. And why some of the actors within this movie actually agreed to be in it is perhaps an even more strange thing. The movie does have some big names in it next to Ulrich and Gooding Jr. such as David Paymer and Peter Firth.A movie that is as bad as its concept.410httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Hugh Johnson directed this flick and this is his one and only attempt and since this he's gone back to cinematography where he firmly belongs. The plot is thin obvious and not entertaining. The action sequences are poorly put together and edited so badly it hurts to watch. It's not an action picture it's definitely not a comedy but it trys to be both and fails.

Colonel Brynner is jailed for the accident he swears revenge on Dr Long.  On his release he attempts to steal the biological weapon but Long manages to escape.  He gets as far as a local restaurant where he enlists local boy Tim Mason and ice cream delivery worker Arlo to take the weapon and deliver it safely back to the Government. The only condition is that the weapon must be kept below 50 degrees Fahrenheit or else it will go off and kill everything for hundreds of miles.When I sat to watch this it was really because it had been a good few weeks since I had seen a really bad film  from the plot summary I had assumed that this would be one even with my low expectations.  In no way did I think this was a good film but it wasn't as rubbish as other reviews have suggested  rather it is simply uninspired clichd and silly.  The plot seems daft and it is  mainly because trained military special ops can't seem to catch two small time crooks driving a clapped out van in the desert. However it manages to be enjoyable as it keeps moving constantly and stops you being distracted for even a second lest you should ask questions.The action is OK but never really gets the tension up in the same way that Speed did.  The director is owed a lot of credit despite the clichs he really keeps the pace up and makes this better than it should have been.The acting is not good but is acceptable and is all that is needed for this sort of film.  Ulrich is not a leading man and Gooding Jr seems to be trying to prove that the Oscar was a oneoff but together they have an easy chemistry despite it being the usual old mismatched buddy movie banter. Firth plays a traditional bad guy and Paymer seems to have taken his misguided scientist straight from the clich text book.Overall this is a poor film.  It has no real good ideas of it's own even the keep it below 50' idea is someone else's and it is clichd all the way.  However it keeps moving with such energy that it is hard not to veg out in front of it  just don't expect a good film.  You could do worse but you could do a whole hell of a lot better.".

As if that wasn't enough slick Don Vito even  stole his girlfriend. Well you'd think Ricco has plenty of reasons to  be really angry. I'm talking Charles Bronson angry. Instead Ricco has  this I have nothing better to do this afternoon so I might as well  take on the mob attitude that makes you wonder if anyone on the set  told Mitchum exactly why he's supposed to be taking revenge.   Mitchum might not be able to emote for the life of him but at least he  has two modes smirk and stare blank. He also kisses like a fish rolls  on the ground with his sister and her boyfriend because they're too  happy to see him out of prison feigns laughter when he nearly evades  car accidents blinks in closeup when he recognizes his mother and  sister's dead bodies that's emotion for you heck he even karate  chops people in a flashback to impress his father. His karate moves are  a hoot and the movie is worth the price of admission for that scene  alone.  Don Vito is a slick Italian mafia boss type with a mustache. He owns a  soap factory says stuff like don't you know by now I hate soap... and  men that sweat and turns his own men into it when they fail him. If  you sleep with his sultry girlfriend you get castrated in graphic  detail fed your own penis then you're thrown in a tank full of acid  that's how he turns people into soap. You don't wanna go around  messing with this guy.   Now for the sleaze. It comes in the form of the drop dead gorgeous Euro  babes Barbara Bouchet regular in 70's gialli and Malisa Longo. We get  get close ups of Bouchet's ass and breasts while she walks she has a  striptease scene on the hood of a car she's lucky enough to bed Ricco  and is her all around cute self. Longo in the role of Don Vito's  girlfriend spends most of the movie scantily clad and seduces Don  Vito's underling in a very sexy scene. Refer to the previous paragraph  for what happens when you have a sex scene with her.   The first half of the movie is so delightfully cheesy that I kept  wondering where's Joe Bob Briggs when you need him. The second one is  more gritty and sadistic with a graphic castration scene and lots of  gunplay. The sleaze has a steady presence throughout and so does the  silly dialogue. The score reminded me of The Godfather. That about sums  it up I think.   Ricco is by no means a profound crime drama but it's entertaining and  schlocky enough to warrant a viewing or two. Fans of 70's Italian crime  bmovies will lap it up and ask for more.".

	schema:reviewBody "A young man Chris Mitchum gets out of prison to find that his mafia don father has been brutally murdered and that the man that who did it Arthur Kennedyhas also taken his fiance Malisa Longo. This sounds like the perfect setup for a revenge movie but this is actually a very atypical one. The young man had little respect for his gangster father and after years in prison is not all that desirous of revenge but is drawn into it by his vengeful invalid mother his father's crooked business associates his promiscuous former fiance and above all the utterly ruthless paranoia of the new don. This movie also takes the saying that if you go seeking vengeance dig two graves to whole new extremes. The hero should have dug many many graves since his vendetta gets practically everybody in the cast sympathetic or evil killed. Of course digging graves is largely unnecessary since the evil don gets rid of most of HIS victims by putting them in an acid bath and turning them into soap for his soap factory hilariously he is therefore afraid to use soap. This movie is VERY violent including graphic scenes of castration a guy getting his face caved in with a rifle butt ad infinitum. It was actually first released in the US as a horror movie called Cauldron of Death.What's interesting though without giving away the end is that the final revenge is strangely unsatisfying and the movie ends up being more a tragedy like Hamlet than a revenge flick. It's more violent than your average American revenge flick but also ironically a lot less fascist. Violence is not the answer to every problem and only begets more violence that ultimately stains the good guys as well as the bad. Also even the ruthless don is humanized a bit in that he does seem to genuinely love his faithless mistress. Although certainly not all Italian crimerevenge movies are like this I would still maintain that Italians seem to have learned something from their dark fascist past that has been lost on many Americans.But if all that's too leftwing for you here's something that should appeal to ALL crime movie fansthe women. Barbara Bouchet does a sexy striptease that'll have your tongue unspooling onto the floor but she also has an especially meaty role for a woman in one of these films as the protagonist's partner as well as his lover. Malisa Longo whose body uh of work I was previously unfamiliar with is a more the typical piece of meat she's naked in every one of her scenes but she does get to do some acting in her brief screen time. Ditto with future porn star Paola Senatore playing the protagonist's sister who spends a hilariously amount of her time in bed with her husbandI didn't even recognize her until the credits because I've never actually seen her actually ACT before. I would definitely recommend this one.".

But it's such a perfect example of EuroTrash that I felt someone had to mention it. First off it has Christopher Mitchum where else can an a major actor's son find work? In Italy of course! giving such a wooden performance that my roomate mearly rolled his eyes snickered and walked out of the room shaking his head c'mon Tony you know you did. Christopher with his Dad's droopy eyes just stares off with that same blank expression through out the entire film. Of course he must have known it was a pretty bad script so I won't fault him too much I haven't seen his other artistic efforts. But it really cracked me up that on the video box there was this drawing of him looking handsome and muscular which he definately is not. He was pretty wimpy looking and evertime he tried to give a macho pose or flex his authority I nearly laughed myself silly. Though I excuse all of this because the real reason I rented this flick was because of the wonderful and beautiful Barbara Bouchet! And this film delivers! She does this great little strip dance in front of these gangsters in a car right before Chris Rico the Mean Machine throws them into a lake! It's so funny that Italy will take any oppertunity they can to show off Barbara's attributes. Of course it gratuitous but it's just too much fun! And of course even after the big ambush Chris looks to Barbara and she's still has no clothes on. She's having a good time tackling gangsters in the nude! Well at least Barbara looks to be having fun. Another Eurobabe favourite Malisa Longo as Chris' exgirlfriendalso likes to spend her time flirting with Bodygaurds and sitting around in the buff. But unfortunately she meets with a very grizzly end and becomes the film's sacrificial lamb what else was gonna come of her character? Chris Mitchum was now with Barbara Bouchet. in a tub of Acid! This film contains all the unnecessary violence gory stuff as well nudity lots of it macho posturing Chris' Ricco is not opposed to giving a lady a smack if she's not behaving and crummy acting that 70's Italian cinema is so famous for. Would I recommend it? Hardly! Did I laugh my fool head off? Yep! After this review I'll let the reader make their own call. Barbara Bouchet is amazing!".

	schema:reviewBody "A young man named RiccoChris Mitchumgets a year off his sentence after serving two years in prison and quietly sets out to even a score against mafioso king Don VitoArthur Kennedy the man responsible for murdering his mob boss father so that he could have control over the entire city. What erupts is a blood feud where many tragic casualties innocents whose blood are shed lie in the wake of Ricco and Vito's rivalry. Ricco finds an ally in an old friend of his father's niece ScillaBarbara Bouchet..Scilla at first participates for kicks but soon finds that she's in love with Ricco and realizes that his feud with Vito will only leave a lot of innocent people dead. Once Ricco gets mixed up with a crooked partner of Vito's CyranoEduardo Fajardo once a pal of his father there's no turning back. Diamonds and collected dues of those benefactors for whom Vito protects soon play into matters as does Ricco's old squeeze RosaMalisa Longonow property of the Don. Vito cherishes Rosa and anyone who dares even attempt to touch what is his will inherit a trip into his vat of acid. The climax is a shootout at Don Vito's factory with Ricco seeking revenge when those he loves are slain in horrific gangland style fashion.Ultra violent crime thriller with Christopher Mitchum walking tall saying only what needs to be said..like his father Robert Chris doesn't overexert himself. He's quite the cool customer approaching even the most violent situations with a laidback calm staring down possible death at every turn. Kennedy inhibits the sadistic Don Vito as if born to play him..having portrayed villains in westerns with ease playing the heavy in Ricco is a piece of cake. The true star of this film besides Barbara Bouchet who always knows how to make a scene is Malisa Longo as Rosa who takes you completely away from the film immediately casting your eyes towards her. She's quite a feast to salivate over..the kind of sex kitten who would have you turning cartwheels and barking like a dog. She's to die for and one does but I certainly understand why one would risk the chance to bed her. Whether walking around in lingerie or bathing topless she's a tasty dish..no a gourmet meal. Matter of fact she's the best part of the meal..she's the desirable dessert. I found that Mitchum and Bouchet had good chemistry and that both knew the wattage they carried on screen. Mitchum carries that effortless cool and Bouchet is so damn sexy and knows it I never questioned why I liked watching them together on screen.

	onyx:emotionText "A young man named RiccoChris Mitchumgets a year off his sentence after serving two years in prison and quietly sets out to even a score against mafioso king Don VitoArthur Kennedy the man responsible for murdering his mob boss father so that he could have control over the entire city. What erupts is a blood feud where many tragic casualties innocents whose blood are shed lie in the wake of Ricco and Vito's rivalry. Ricco finds an ally in an old friend of his father's niece ScillaBarbara Bouchet..Scilla at first participates for kicks but soon finds that she's in love with Ricco and realizes that his feud with Vito will only leave a lot of innocent people dead. Once Ricco gets mixed up with a crooked partner of Vito's CyranoEduardo Fajardo once a pal of his father there's no turning back. Diamonds and collected dues of those benefactors for whom Vito protects soon play into matters as does Ricco's old squeeze RosaMalisa Longonow property of the Don. Vito cherishes Rosa and anyone who dares even attempt to touch what is his will inherit a trip into his vat of acid. The climax is a shootout at Don Vito's factory with Ricco seeking revenge when those he loves are slain in horrific gangland style fashion.Ultra violent crime thriller with Christopher Mitchum walking tall saying only what needs to be said..like his father Robert Chris doesn't overexert himself. He's quite the cool customer approaching even the most violent situations with a laidback calm staring down possible death at every turn. Kennedy inhibits the sadistic Don Vito as if born to play him..having portrayed villains in westerns with ease playing the heavy in Ricco is a piece of cake. The true star of this film besides Barbara Bouchet who always knows how to make a scene is Malisa Longo as Rosa who takes you completely away from the film immediately casting your eyes towards her. She's quite a feast to salivate over..the kind of sex kitten who would have you turning cartwheels and barking like a dog. She's to die for and one does but I certainly understand why one would risk the chance to bed her. Whether walking around in lingerie or bathing topless she's a tasty dish..no a gourmet meal. Matter of fact she's the best part of the meal..she's the desirable dessert. I found that Mitchum and Bouchet had good chemistry and that both knew the wattage they carried on screen. Mitchum carries that effortless cool and Bouchet is so damn sexy and knows it I never questioned why I liked watching them together on screen. Bouchet even performs a nice little striptease for the viewer..thanks dear for providing another memorable scene..like Bouchet hasn't provided ample memories already!I can carry away into my fantasies.Getting away from the babes I have to mention the castration scene.

	schema:reviewBody "Judging by the juicy title and exhilarating VHScover Cauldron of Death appears to be a genuinely nasty horror film but it is in fact a rough 'n tough revengethriller! It's still extremely gory and sadistic but the storyline is more reminiscent to those typical Italian Godfather ripoffs of the early 70's with relentless mob bosses violently eliminating their competitors in order to become the only reigning king of crime in a certain city. The titular cauldron refers to the favorite killingmethod of the meanest bastard in town who throws his enemies and sometimes even his loved ones into a giant bath of acid where they meet a slow and painful meltingdeath. During the outrageous opening sequences which immediately set the right violent mood we witness how the accomplices of Don Vito mercilessly execute the current crimeleader. Two years later his son returns to town from prison and plots to singlehandedly avenge his father as well as to recover his girlfriend Rosa who got claimed by Don Vito. From then on Cauldron of Blood turns into a tremendously exciting machoshowdown between the charismatic young blond hero and the sleazy old bastard with treasonous characters lurid ladies and a whole lot of bloody gunfights. Whenever Rico humiliates Don Vito or steals some of his crimemonopoly the other one responds by executing one of Rico's innocent family members like his pregnant sister or his crippled mother. Cauldron of Death is incredibly fastpaced and surprisingly enough the script dissociates itself from all the feared clichs and taboos. There are certain deaths in this film that you can't possibly see coming and even the final battle at the end of the story is shockingly unpredictable. For this reason alone I highly recommend Cauldron of Death to every fan of unusual EuroTrash cinema! Other than the convoluted structure and the highly effective plot twists this undiscovered gem of Italian smutcinema also features some of the most outrageous gore you've ever seen. In one particular sequence which clearly got edited back into the film after an initial censorship we explicitly witness how a poor guy gets castrated for messing around with Don Vito's woman and subsequently gets thrown into the acid. His extendedly depicted agony is still horrifying even though the makeup effects are cheap and very cheesy. There's also a lot of graphic nudity and sleaze or what else did you expected provided by two of Italy's most contemporary popular muses Barbara Bouchet and Malisa Longo. I don't really understand why this film is still so obscure especially with the recent revival of eurocrime cinema which put several other highlights of the sub genre on DVD like Almost Human and Rabid Dogs. Maybe it's because director Tulio Demicheli never truly belonged to the prominent circle of Italian exploitation filmmakers? So far this film is only available on VHS or bootleg DVDR and quality of both picture and sound is horrendous. Here's to hoping it gets rewarded with a fancy DVD edition any time soon!".

	schema:reviewBody "Originally when Ricco The Mean Machine came out on VHS in America it was an edited version but the 2006 DVD release put all the footage back into it that makes it a violent brutal movie. This contemporary Italian produced revenge thriller chronicles the last days of Ricco Aversi Christopher Mitchumthe son of the legendary Robert Mitchum after he gets out of prison where he served two years. He has been let out of jail a year ahead of time for good behavior. Ricco is coming home to see his married sister and invalid mother. Mom tries to thrust an automatic pistol into his palm because Mafiaso Don Vito Arthur Kennedy had his father Gaspara Aversi Luis Induni murdered. Dutybound Ricco assures his mom that he will handle things in his own way. Ricco infiltrates the gang with the help of an old friend Eduardo Fajardo of The Mercenary who turns out to be pretty treacherous and his new girlfriend Scilla Barbara Bouchet who likes to hustle guys with her cleavage when she is trying to exchange funny money for genuine green.Basically this is a violent shoot'em up crime movie with some tough gritty action. The uncut version shows a mafia soldier getting dumped naked into a tub of acid after the villains have cut off his genitalsyes you see a super hairy cock  balls slashed off and then shoved in his mouth before they tumble him into the acid bath. Rosa Malisa Longo joins him a moment later Rosa was the girlfriend of Don Vito and she was cheating on him with one of his crime lieutenant because she wanted to have sex with young meat.This nimble European actioneer opens with the ambush of Gaspara Aversi. He is ambushed trying to get the night watchman to open a gate so that he can park his car. Three men open fire on him and wound him repeatedly but the mafia chieftain guns them down. Gaspara is not as lucky when the fourth gunman delivers a coup de grace to the him and blasts away his noggin. Amoral crime drama from start to finish with its own message that revenge begets killing and more killing until there is nobody left to kill including the protagonist who dies in a duel with Don Vito. One interesting scene occurs about halfway through the movie when Ricco and Scilla rob two guys carrying protection collection money gathered by the Vito mob. Scilla walks in front of their car on a foggy bridge and stripteases. When they get out of the car to approach her Ricco surprises them from behind and sends them plunging into the river. The consequences for their illadvised behavior is not good. An unhappy Don Vito has both of them thrown unceremoniously into an acid bath. The ironic thing about the Don Vito character is that he is a mobster who makes soap! If you crave exploitation European moviemaking at its best do not miss Ricco The Mean Machine! This movie was made when it was fashionable to zoom and pan with film cameras. Christopher Mitchum studied karate too. The production lensed the action on location around Rome Italy.".

	schema:reviewBody "That sure was fun! Ricco or The Mean Machine or whatever you want to call it may not be the best most dramatic or grittiest Eurocrime film I've run across but it is one of the most entertaining I've ever seen. Ricco Christopher Mitchum is a young man out for revenge. He's just finished serving a two year prison sentence for attacking the man he holds responsible for killing his father and assuming control of his criminal organization. And now that he's been released Ricco discovers that Don Vito Arthur Kennedy has also taken his girl. Let's get this out of the way upfront  Ricco has its fair share of obvious weaknesses and problems. Chief among them is Mitchum. He may look a lot like his father but that's where the comparison ends. I'm guessing he was going for introspective and brooding but unfortunately Mitchum comes off as vacant and robotic. His fight scenes are often hysterical. Watching him go through his kungfu moves I can just imagine the director offscreen giving him stepbystep instructions. I've never seen someone move so unnaturally.But I've always said that I rate movies based on entertainment value and Ricco provides a good test of that statement. Looking past Mitchum's shortcomings Ricco is wildly entertaining. It's a trashy good time. The movie has a feel to it that I found unique for this kind of movie. It never seems to be taking itself too seriously. I may be way off on this one but to me it's as if the director Tulio Demicheli realized how absurd some of the situations were and just let everyone have fun with it. The plot is actually little more than the standard revenge theme but it held my interest throughout. There's hardly ever a dull moment. Ricco has the violence I've come to expect from this kind of movie  including one particularly nasty scene that makes something like the cutoff ear in Django look like child's play. The supporting cast is top notch. Arthur Kennedy makes for a wonderfully slimy villain complete with a ridiculous looking mustache. Ricco's old flame is played by the insanely gorgeous Malisa Longo. And genre favorite Barbara Bouchet's surreal stripper routine in the middle of the road is another of the film's highlights. What more could you ask for?".

Cauldron of Death is a little more nasty than a lot of the genre however as it features plenty of grisly murders including some unlucky victims that find themselves being thrown into a vat of acid a la our featured criminals' favourite method of dealing with people that annoy them. The story doesn't actually focus on the police like a lot of these seventies Italian crime movies and the centre of the plot is Rico a young man recently released from jail and thirsty for revenge on the man that killed his father which we see at the opening of the film. The guilty party is a mobster named Don Vito and he's certainly an adversary to be reckoned with as Rico two years since he was sentenced to jail is forced to match wits and out everything on the line to get revenge on the vicious Don Vito.The film benefits from a good female duo. I'll watch anything that features the lovely Barbara Bouchet and she doesn't disappoint here as we get treated to one of the best striptease scenes in Italian cinema! The film also features Malisa Longo who adds to the eye candy. The men aren't bad either as while Robert Mitchum's son Christopher is a little too naive looking for my liking he still plays his part well. Arthur Kennedy rounds off a good central cast as the vicious Don Vito. Director Tulio Demicheli succeeds at generating a fetid atmosphere for the film to take place in and the nasty death scenes certainly don't feel out of place considering the look and nature of the movie. The main problem with the film stems from the plotting. You'd be a fool to go into a cheapo seventies Italian thriller expecting a thoroughly well thought out plot but this one veers off course a bit too often and it can become distracting after a while. It's not a fatal problem however as Cauldron of Death is an entertaining and gritty little thriller that is well worth seeing if you can find it!".

	schema:reviewBody "Watched RICCO 1973 aka CAULDRON OF DEATH as I am on a trail of Barbara Bouchet films.You've got to admire directors like Tulio Demicheli who had the gumption to make films based on their sleaziest fantasies. I really like these Italian crime thrillers with lots of nudity plot twists and graphic violence. Ricco played by Christopher Mitchum Robert Mitchum's son is out of jail. His mother incites him to take revenge on the men who killed his father. He takes the help of his exgirlfriend's father and cousin Barbara Bouchet. Both Malisa Longo who plays Ricco's ex girlfriend and mistress of the man who killed Ricco's father and Barbara Bouchet shed their clothes regularly to keep us from falling asleep. But the film isn't that bad. The hands on action scenes are quite decent. There is a really graphic penis cutting scene.I was struck by two instances of unusual camera work. The first one when Mitchum arrives at his house next to a gas station after coming out of jail and cavorting on the gas station grounds with his sister and brother that sort of hints at an incestuous triangle. There is a close up of them rolling around and kissing each other on the ground. The second one is when Malisa Longo seduces her husband's henchman and there is a shot between her naked legsthighs at the henchman making a house of cards.The tall young and gangly mitchum reminded me of Christopher Walken. He does have a reasonably good screen presence.A couple of memorable tunes in the background score by Nando De Luca was used very well especially during a sex scene.610".

	onyx:emotionText "Watched RICCO 1973 aka CAULDRON OF DEATH as I am on a trail of Barbara Bouchet films.You've got to admire directors like Tulio Demicheli who had the gumption to make films based on their sleaziest fantasies. I really like these Italian crime thrillers with lots of nudity plot twists and graphic violence. Ricco played by Christopher Mitchum Robert Mitchum's son is out of jail. His mother incites him to take revenge on the men who killed his father. He takes the help of his exgirlfriend's father and cousin Barbara Bouchet. Both Malisa Longo who plays Ricco's ex girlfriend and mistress of the man who killed Ricco's father and Barbara Bouchet shed their clothes regularly to keep us from falling asleep. But the film isn't that bad. The hands on action scenes are quite decent. There is a really graphic penis cutting scene.I was struck by two instances of unusual camera work. The first one when Mitchum arrives at his house next to a gas station after coming out of jail and cavorting on the gas station grounds with his sister and brother that sort of hints at an incestuous triangle. There is a close up of them rolling around and kissing each other on the ground. The second one is when Malisa Longo seduces her husband's henchman and there is a shot between her naked legsthighs at the henchman making a house of cards.The tall young and gangly mitchum reminded me of Christopher Walken. He does have a reasonably good screen presence.A couple of memorable tunes in the background score by Nando De Luca was used very well especially during a sex scene.610";

One of the taglines from a poster at the time was No swords no guns no knives no weapons. Just a burning pool of acid!. No weapons? No knives? Tons of those. And...just a minor point...soap is made from an alkaline solution things like sodium hydroxide. That's the opposite of acid. So the only thing in the tagline accurate is no swords. Like I'd expect that of a '70s Italian crime film.So you can't get too deep with this one. As an over the top take on the sub genre I think it works. As much early '70s as it is Italian crime film it doesn't spare any mod visuals. Worth a go I say.".

I can't believe this guy was in 3 count them 3 John Wayne movies before this one. He is awful. He may have improved but his performance here totally killed what could have been a decent actionmobsterrevenge flick. He is not the least bit intimidating anywhere in the painful 90 minutes.

The opening scene takes place in a Sicilian mad house hundreds of years old fortified with decaying stone. It is here that we first hear Riz Ortolani's amazing theme a fuzztone guitar and a melancholy orchestra and the ranting and moans of madmen. We see Captain Bonavia Martin Balsam who did dub his own voice arrange for the release of LiPuma a psychotic criminal obsessed with cleanliness who is no sooner free than he makes an attempt on the life of a gangster named D'Ambrosio which results in the deaths of Lipuma and several of D'Ambrosio's thugs but not D'Ambrosio. It is immediately hinted that Bonavia arranged for LiPuma's release for just this reason. The mystery here isn't who did what but why he did it and who you're supposed to root for Captain Bonavia the official made cynical and allegedly irresponsible by years on the job who may or may not be motivated by graft or DA Traini Franco Nero who investigates the attempt on D'Ambrosio's life. Traini is young and idealistic and immediately suspects Bonavia's involvement. Bonavia is fifty going on a hundred and mocks Traini at every turn as he fills him in on the history of a city built literally on corpses. Damiani underlines the similarities between these two mendoes Traini embody the idealism Bonavia lost are they both just stooges of a corrupt ancient systemin subtle ways and he along with Balsam builds Bonavia's character with equal aplomb. You can watch this film repeatedly and see these subtleties equal credit for which must go to Balsam's performance which is one of his best which is saying a lot. Minor characters like LiPuma and his hunted sister Serena come across with enough depth to exacerbate the tension. Riz Ortolani's score chimes in at just the right moments to intensify the drama which is what this really is a drama that grabs you by the guts. Damiani's ability to create this kind of film angry and topical antiestablishment but so livedin it never feels forced deserves greater recognition. This one especially should be required viewing despite the fact that I've never seen it in any form other than a cheesy DVD that probably capitalized on public domain and is dubbed it should be noted that the Italians dubbed most of their films even the Italian versions and were good at it and has glitches that lead me to believe it was mastered from VHS.

Both of them face on Mafia which the fight is hopeless . However Martin Balsam steals the show as a dedicated police captain what tries to wipe out the bureaucratic corruption that is infecting his city .

	schema:reviewBody "Best known for his mafia films as well as the sublime Western A Bullet for the General 1968 Damiano Damiani doubtlessly ranks among the great directors from the golden era of Italian genrecinema. And Confessione Di Un Commissario Di Polizia Al Procuratore Della Republica aka. Confession of a Police Comissioner to the District Attorney of 1971 is doubtlessly one of the man's most remarkable achievements. Unlike the work of other greats of Italian crimepolice cinema such as Fernando Di Leo and Umberto Lenzi Damiani's mafia films do not so much rely on stylized action and gritty violence but try to explore the structures of the mafia and the corruption of legal authorities. This gem does so in a most brilliant manner.Every cultcinema fan's favorite actor Franco Nero plays a young and idealistic prosecutor who is as determined in his will to fight crime and corruption as his firm belief in the law and justice system is unbreakable. When he comes to crimestronghold Palermo he encounters the aging Police Detective Comissario Buonavia Martin Balsam a cop whose ideals and beliefs go beyond his obedience to the law... The film has many qualities one of the most obvious ones being the acting. Both leading men are nothing short of brilliance in their roles. Franco Nero is magnificent as ever in the role of the devoted man of the law and Martin Balsam truly shines as the equally idealistic roughandready cop. Both men seem to be strict followers of their ideals doing what they believe is right. Yet there is a mutual distrust between them. The great late Luciano Catenacci is sublime in the role of the slick Mafia Don. Catenacci one of the greatest regulars in Italian cultcinema blessed many great films with his presence including Mario Bava's Gothic masterpiece Operazione Paura Kill Baby... Kill! 1966 Umberto Lenzi's hardboiled Poliziottesco Milano Odia La Polizia Non Pu Sparare Almost Human 1974 and this great film. Sadly this great actor who mostly played criminals passed away far too young in 1990. Lovers of Italian cinema will always remember him for his great performances in mostly dubious or thuggish roles. Character actor Claudio Gora gives another memorable performance as the district attorney general.Confessione Di Un Commissario... is a film with a great story and the tense plot is perfectly executed. As most of Damiani's films Confessione... is a very political film that uncompromisingly depicts powerstructures corruption and the influence of organized crime on politicians and institutions. But primarily it is a very suspenseful and highly intense cinematic experience. The tension is underlined by a great visual style and insanely brilliant score by maestro Riz Ortolani. Among fans of Italian crime cinema some prefer the testosteronedriven excitement of the work of Umberto Lenzi or Enzo Castellari while others love the more intellectual thrills of Damiano Damiani's gems. Personally I can only say that I'm a huge fan of both. Confessions of a Police Comissioner... is a film that should appeal to fans of gritty cult cinema and lovers of subtle suspense alike and personally I could not come up with a single negative aspect about this film which enjoys a more than justified cultstatus. A masterpiece. For fans of Italian genrecinema missing it would be a crime.".

	schema:headline " Very well done Italian cop drama";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm a big fan of Italian cop flicks but Confessions of a Police Captain actually doesn't contain many of the things that I love this type of movie for. Damiano Damiani's film is an early example of the Polizi flick and has the rare accolade of not following on the heels of Don Siegel's masterpiece Dirty Harry. The film is a rather more sober affair than what I'm used to from this sort of film and doesn't feature the things such as car chases gun fights and fistfights that other films in this genre feature in droves but this is made up for by the fact that the director has created a stylish and interesting film that flows well throughout. The plot focuses largely on the mafia that run Italy over and above the law. Our two central characters are Commissioner Bonavia and District Attorney Traini who are investigating mafia occurrences in the city. The plot begins with an attempt on a man's life and the man later turns out to be D'Ambrosio a man high up within the mafia. The two law enforcers appear to be on the same page in fighting the crime in the city...Damiano Damiani was apparently quite a prolific crime film director in the seventies although the only film I'd seen from him prior to this one was the abysmal Amityville II. It's clear that he has a real flair for this sort of film however as Confessions of a Police Captain is perfectly pitched and very professionally done. The fact that the film doesn't feature the things that usually make these films exciting may be a hindrance for some people but in my opinion the film has more than enough going for it elsewhere. The two central performances are one of the film's strongest elements. American actor Martin Balsam is fantastic as the police commissioner but even better than him is Franco Nero as the district attorney. I've seen a lot of Franco Nero films and every time I see him I become more impressed. He's a very versatile actor who seems to be able to play just about any role and once again he gives a fantastic lead performance. The commentary on justice is well thought although I have to admit that I wasn't keen on the ambiguous ending. Overall this is at the very top of Italian cop flicks while it doesn't fit in with some of the better known examples it's hard to deny that it is a gem of a movie.".

	schema:headline " Superlative Italian crime thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "It's ironic that director Damiano Damiani is most famous today for The Amityville Horror 2 which is somewhat underrated but no one's idea of a great movie. He has actually made any number of films in many different genres including at least four superlative ones I've seen in just the last year A Bullet for the General The Most Beautiful Wife How to Kill a Judge and this one. This is a typical Italian police thriller in some ways but rather than focusing solely on shootouts and highspeed car chases it is more of a character study of two law enforcement agents trying to do the right thing while fighting massive highlevel corruption but in very different ways. Martin Balsam is a the titular police captain who is willing to bend the law to go after a corrupt industrial cartel leader. For instance he gets a sworn enemy of the man and the brother of the man's mistress released from a mental institution to allow him make an assassination attempt on the crooked industrialist. Franco Nero on the other hand plays the bythebook district attorney who's torn between fighting the corruption of the police captain and the far more pervasive highlevel corruption all around him. The two eventually form an uneasy alliance.An American film would definitely come down in favor of one man or the other most likely the vigilante police captain but this film is not afraid to leave the whole matter morally ambiguous. It is also pretty pessimistic in tone as things don't work out too well for either of them. Balsam and Nero are both great the latter was also in Damiano's How to Kill a Judge. Marilu Tolo who plays the mistress is the only other real name actor. She was kind of an enigmatic actress probably the most Sicilianlooking actress of her era it's hard to believe she and the blondehaired blueeyed Nero are from the same country. She has a much smaller role than the two men but still manages to transcend the usual nice piece mold women were usually cast in in these types of films.Unfortunately this is currently available only as a VERY crappylooking public domain flick on The Grindhouse Collection Volume 1 DVD set. The most lowrent bootlegger would be ashamed to sell a customer a DVDR of a video in as bad of shape and as badly ported as this one. Still if you think the price is right on the whole set or you find it from another source this is definitely a movie I would recommend to poliziani fans or anybody else.".

	schema:reviewBody "As was the case with L'ISTRUTTORIA E' CHIUSA DIMENTICHI 1971 this too proved different to what I had been anticipating  as Martin Balsam is the nominal policeofficer hero while lead Franco Nero is merely an investigating magistrate! When Balsam is bumped off the film follows Nero's actions but ends on an ambiguous openended note. However Balsam is excellent as the unorthodox and determined Commissioner Nero on the other hand occasionally overacts as the flustered State representative.

As usual for this sort of film Riz Ortolani's score is a notable asset.

When Balsam is bumped off the film follows Nero's actions but ends on an ambiguous openended note. However Balsam is excellent as the unorthodox and determined Commissioner Nero on the other hand occasionally overacts as the flustered State representative.

	schema:reviewBody "This Italian crime drama from director Damiano Damiani is a very well directed film throughout his long career Damiani has succeeded in making classy films with the exception of AMITYVILLE II THE POSSESSION and this one is no exception. However it isn't an action film at all so those looking for gun and fistfights should look elsewhere. Things kick off with a criminal being released from an asylum his immediate action is to go gunning for a crime boss who duped him. There's a brief expertly directed shootout and then the police procedural story of corruption and racketeering really begins.Instead of action Damiani delivers us a characterfocused drama that's presided over by the largerthanlife Martin Balsam as a corrupt police captain. Balsam makes this film work rather than being presented as a villain he's a sympathetic character and his minimalist performance really works here. Playing a totally unflappable captain  he doesn't even blanch when presented with evidence of his crimes  he really makes the viewer identify with his aims and methods and Balsam is superb throughout.The film is rather lengthy and slowpaced and it's more about acting and plot than anything else. Damiani's photography is excellent and the film has a polished veneer to it. Unusually Franco Nero is present but as a supporting role rather than a leading character he's okay but in comparison to Balsam he seems wooden overdoing it. The rest of the cast is filled by hardfaced actors playing various lowlifes and they're all very effective. The beautiful Marilu Tolo puts in a notable performance as a woman caught up in the mess.Full of some very memorable scenes  the shootout the striking builder lying in his own blood the ending in the prison  this is a genuinely good film a little slow and lacking in action for my liking but with good technical qualities and a nice score from Riz Ortolani the guy who did the music in the infamous CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. In the end though it's Martin Balsam who makes this film so good.".

The mafia boss however seemed to have got wind of this and wasn't around for the gunfight.Franco Nero then turns up as a new district attorney who is out to play by the rules and get to the bottom of what happened  Who alerted the mafia boss that the guy was out of the loony bin? Who arranged for the guy to be released in the first place? Franco the D.A doesn't trust Balsam the cop and various interviews with the mafia boss and others suggests that Franco is on the mafia payroll or Balsam was paid to release the prisoner to kill the mafia boss by rival mafia gangs.The two form a very uneasy alliance where Balsam suggest that most of the municipal staff of Palermo are on the mafia payroll and explains his reason for using unorthodox methods is because the mafia boss and himself grew up in a village years ago and the mafia boss shot a guy protesting about the terrible wages the mafia were paying quarry workers played by Giancarlo Prete in a very good cameo. Nero retorts by saying he knows Balsam withdrew two million lira from an account at the same time but will he believe that he used that to find Prete's mafia murdered body? Although this film is long and low on action it's easy to get drawn in by the acting of the two leads. It's rarer still to see Franco Nero get acted off the screen but that's what happens here. You might know Martin Balsam as the cop from Psycho or Alan Arkin's superior officer in Catch 22 but here we get the full spectrum of acting. He's hard skinned and efficient as a cop but prone to showing mercy to folk who have acted stupidly and is kind to his colleagues even those on the mafia payroll. Wherever he goes in this film he's pushed to the absolute limit so the bitter sweet smile on his face as a full room of mafia staff are laughing at him is priceless. And he oneups that scene later on. Beautiful.Only negatives are Franco Nero doesn't dub his own voice even though he speaks fluent English and Popflix present this in full screen but I'll say what I always say  best to see the film in any form rather than not at all!".

It's a longtime favorite of mine. Whereas the great Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion veers into fantasy and a gialloflavored eroticism the chain of events in this picture is very realistic when I first saw it on TV I thought that this could have happened. The interplay between Nero and Balsam is totally believable and gripping. No extraneous subplots derail the story. The Riz Ortolani score truly piles on the mood of tragedy and hopelessness in the destructive wake of uncontrollable social evils the utter impotency of the law and politicalbusiness corruption. Underrated and ignored. It's ripe for a classact DVD release since American TV has long since abandoned airing Italian films.".

No torture to animals no assaulted women almost no women at all. This is actually no more subversive than Dirty Harry or other police thrillers.There is some strange recurring theme about homosexuality in this film. A district attorney is accused of being gay and corrupting minors it is implied he touches boys. There are two guys dressed very flamboyantly chased down by state police. I am not sure what Italy's take on homosexuality was but it plays an interesting part in this film that would not be able to work if redone today.This movie is actually pretty good and one of the better films available in the Grindhouse Experience box set.

I seem to remember a Dirty Harry movie along those lines Franco Nero Camelot was fascinating as the District Attorney trying to piece together what happened after Balsam is killed in jail. He soon comes to realize that Balsam was right and that he would be ineffective in prosecuting the Mafia.This is an Italian film ostensibly filmed there but I can't verify it.

I seem to remember a Dirty Harry movie along those lines Franco Nero Camelot was fascinating as the District Attorney trying to piece together what happened after Balsam is killed in jail. He soon comes to realize that Balsam was right and that he would be ineffective in prosecuting the Mafia.This is an Italian film ostensibly filmed there but I can't verify it.

Morricone's catchy wistful longing mourning and absolutely mesmerizing score elevates this typical in a good sense French crime noir to even higher level. I first heard it couple of years ago when I bought Morricone's Once Upon A Time The Essential Ennio Morricone Film Music Collection a double disc superb collection. Even among legendary Morricone's scores the music for Le Clan des Siciliens stands alone. It created a mood that mixed suspense melancholy danger and regrets and it made me fell in love with the movie that I had not even seen. Since I heard the score for the first time I tried to find the film and finally I purchased a Region Free NTSC widescreen DVD with French English and Russian Audio tracks and English subtitles. The film looks gorgeous and I was pleased with the clean and clear DVD transfer. I have been a fan of French crimeheistnoirmystery of 19601980 films for long time and to see three of my favorite actors Alain Delon Jean Gabin and Lino Ventura who had made many classics of the beloved genres acting in the same movie added to my excitement. All three are excellent and one of the advantages of the new DVD was the chance to see the film in its original French and to hear the real voices of three screen legends. Nobody could be cooler than Delon as Roger Santet a convicted murderer ruthless violent yet irresistibly and dangerously charming a beautiful destructive angel of the dark street. Lino Ventura is reliable and convincing as a chief of detective inspectors who had vowed to hunt Santet down. Aging Jean Gabin one of the most beloved French actors with the wide acting range who could play successfully the characters as diverse as inspector Maigret and Pp le Moko is wonderful as Vittorio Manalese the father and the Godfather of the Sicilian Clan the family which is tied by blood in more ways than one.

This is not a fast speed action flick. Don't expect a lot of shooting and explosions. In my opinion that adds to the realism. Maffia criminals are professionals not lunatics. They avoid unnecessary violence because they don't want to draw attention. So Le Clan des Siciliens is a study of criminal behavior and Mafia morals. It relies heavily on character building. Thus it uses all the strong points of French cinema in the period 19601980. Gabin Delon and Ventura excel. They are so much better than say Brando Pacino and Caan.

	schema:headline " Life Imitates Art Seeing The Sicilian Clan In Queens";
	schema:reviewBody "I first saw The Sicilian Clan at the Mayfair theater in Fresh Meadows in 1970.  A Woody Allen movie was the main feature then but I went to see The Sicilian Clan a great crime movie then and now.  The Mayfair then operated by the Weinstein brothers of Miramax fame changed in 1974 from showing foreign and offbeat movies to Xrated movies movies hardcore enough to get the new theater operator sent once to Rikers Island by the Queens DA.  The Queens DA at the time John Santucci never bothered the wise guys portrayed in Goodfellas but then Santucci never went to jail like his predecessor former DA Thomas Mackell. In the glossy world of The Sicilian Clan the criminals are professionals who make money the oldfashioned way  they plan robberies.  The picture starts with members of the Manalese family arranging for the escape from custody of career criminal Roger Sartet Alain Delon.  Sartet is in big trouble having killed two policeman during his capture according to a comment later made by Lino Ventura's character a tough cop.  The escape from the police van is suspenseful as is most of this movie. The Sicilian Clan's plot has the thieves take a hijacked jet to New York. Instead of landing at an airport in Queens though the jet lands on an unfinished highway.  To show the attention to detail director Henri Verneuil took as the jet rolls over a bridge you briefly see dirt from the bridge supports fall down from the weight of the landing jet.  About eight years after I saw this movie Queens mobsters using inside information robbed the high security vault of Lufthansa airlines at JFK Airport.  That robbery and its aftermath are part of the plot of Goodfellas. In The Sicilian Clan Sartet's character has inside information on the burglar alarm installation at the Villa Borghese where a big jewelry exhibit is taking place.

	onyx:emotionText "I first saw The Sicilian Clan at the Mayfair theater in Fresh Meadows in 1970.  A Woody Allen movie was the main feature then but I went to see The Sicilian Clan a great crime movie then and now.  The Mayfair then operated by the Weinstein brothers of Miramax fame changed in 1974 from showing foreign and offbeat movies to Xrated movies movies hardcore enough to get the new theater operator sent once to Rikers Island by the Queens DA.  The Queens DA at the time John Santucci never bothered the wise guys portrayed in Goodfellas but then Santucci never went to jail like his predecessor former DA Thomas Mackell. In the glossy world of The Sicilian Clan the criminals are professionals who make money the oldfashioned way  they plan robberies.  The picture starts with members of the Manalese family arranging for the escape from custody of career criminal Roger Sartet Alain Delon.  Sartet is in big trouble having killed two policeman during his capture according to a comment later made by Lino Ventura's character a tough cop.  The escape from the police van is suspenseful as is most of this movie. The Sicilian Clan's plot has the thieves take a hijacked jet to New York. Instead of landing at an airport in Queens though the jet lands on an unfinished highway.  To show the attention to detail director Henri Verneuil took as the jet rolls over a bridge you briefly see dirt from the bridge supports fall down from the weight of the landing jet.  About eight years after I saw this movie Queens mobsters using inside information robbed the high security vault of Lufthansa airlines at JFK Airport.  That robbery and its aftermath are part of the plot of Goodfellas. In The Sicilian Clan Sartet's character has inside information on the burglar alarm installation at the Villa Borghese where a big jewelry exhibit is taking place.  He uses this information to get Jean Gabin's character the head of the family involved in the robbery.  Thinking it over Queens in the 1970s was the most appropriate place to see a crime movie  like The Sicilian Clan. A French crime movie that in part imitated what was happening in Queens.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Sicilian Clan stands out as a quality firstrate heist thriller from veteran French helmer Henri Verneuil. No stranger to urban bigtime crime sagas Verneuil directed exciting memorable films such as Any Number Can Play 1963 The Burglars 1971 and Fear Over The City 1975. This polished melodrama about the underworld and the plotting of a major heist caper stars three heavyweight dramatic Gallic thespians namely Jean Gabin of Grand Illusion 1937 Alain Delon of Red Sun 1971 and Lino Ventura of Three Tough Guys 1974. Verneuil deployed these icons of French cinema previously in Any Number Can Play and Greed in the Sun 1964. What sets this superbly lensed movie apart from earlier crime thrillers is its exploration of the traditional 'crime doesn't pay' theme. Aside from an opening escape from a police van most of the action in this complicated thriller is fairly realistic and incredibly suspenseful.A notorious cop killer Roger Sartet Alain Delon of Le Samourai convinces a Sicilian crime syndicate chieftain Vittorio Manalese Jean Gabin of Action Man to mastermind his escape from police custody in exchange for the plans to an international jewelry show that could net millions of dollars worth of ice for the clan. Vittorio's sons slip Sartet a compactsized drill as he is about to be turned over to prison authorities. During the loud noisy bus ride through congested Parisian streets to the lockup Sartet not only unlocks his handcuffs but he also cuts a hole large enough in the metal floor of the van to slip through it. He can do this because each prisoner in the van is locked up individually in a phone booth sized compartment. Vittorio's sons orchestrate a traffic jam and Sartet crawls from the prison bus to their van. Immediately a hardnosed cop L'inspecteur Le Goff Lino Ventura of The Valachi Papers warns Sartet's sister Monique Sartet Danielle Volle to contact him if Sartet calls her. He reveals to her that all of her phones are being tapped and that she is under constant surveillance. Nevertheless Vittorio arranges for Sartet to inconspicuously meet his sister despite the police surveillance. Sartet explains that he shared a cell with a disgruntled husband who killed his wife's lover after he returned from installing a complex alarm system at a jewelry show. Although Vittorio has carefully run his syndicate for years and is planning to retire to Sicily with his wife he cannot resist this enticing job. He calls up an old friend in New York City Tony Nicosia Amedeo Nazzari of Spy Today Die Tomorrow a Mafioso with connections to meet him in Rome. Together they case the jewelry display and verify everything that appeared in Sartet's plans. Moreover they discover a new alarm that prevents them from stealing the jewels. They tear up a 100 dollar bill part company and tell each other if they can figure out a way to pull off the crime that a man will show up with the other half of the Cnote. Meanwhile a confined Sartet causes no end of trouble for Vittorio because Sartet wants desperately to get laid after two years of going without sex in prison. Le Goff and his men nearly catch Sartet with his pants down in a brothel but the cop killer stages a miraculous escape. Eventually Nicosia sends the man with the other half of the Cnote and Vittorio and his sons set up the plan to steal the priceless jewels. At the same time unbeknownst to either Vittorio or his sons Sartet has a sexual liaison with Aldo Manalese's sexy wife Jeanne Irina Demick of The Longest Day one day when she is bathing and Sartet is bashing an eel to death on the rocks. Vittorio's grandson catches them in the act but Jeanne swears the child to silence. Later this infidelity comes back to haunt both of them but not before Sartet accompanies Vittorio on the daring heist scheduled to occur after the syndicate skyjacks the jetliner transporting the ice. The entire NYPD crowds Kennedy Airport and awaits the villains when the plane touches down in the Big Apple. However the mobsters have an ace up their collective sleeves.Director Henri Verneuil quietly builds up atmosphere and momentum in this oldfashioned heist caper and pays off all the narrative setups without pulling out anything that he had not foreshadowed from the outset of the story. The gifted cast is topnotch and the photography apart from the hijacked jet landing is terrific. You have to be patient and wait for the inevitable to happen in The Sicilian Clan but it is well worth the wait for all the revelations that occur in the end. Ennio Morricone who scored all of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns provides an interesting but inconspicuous score that beautifully and economically underlines the twists in the plot.SPOILER'S ALERT In The Sicilian Clan the villains successfully pull of their caper but they have an 'honor among thieves' falling out that results in their dying or getting sent to prison. Generally speaking before the 1966 James Coburn caper Dead Heat on a MerryGoRound the criminals never got away with the loot. Here the French and American criminals fool the cops entirely and get away with the booty. However the French criminals pay with their lives after the crime because of Jeanne's marital infidelity.".

	schema:headline " Quirky and compelling heist flick";
	schema:reviewBody "Lots of caper films came out in the 60's many of them quite good and this one is no exception. Delon plays a detached icecold thief who is facing jail time for two cop killings when he is rescued by Gabin and his family of larcenists. They want his expertise in helping them steal a large very expensive jewelry collection. Gabin introduces him to his sizable family of a wife two sons a daughter a soninlaw a grandchild and a daughterinlaw Demick who seems instantaneously taken with Delon. Chaplin comes on board as an assistant for the big job. As the title clan puts their plan together intrepid police inspector Ventura doggedly pursues the trail turning up bits of evidence among such folks as drug addicts and pinup photographers. Delon's sister Blanguernon also awaits word from him her feet seemingly cemented to the floor in front of the cash register she operates at a coffee shop 247! Delon aggravates Gabin with his penchant for sneaking out of their compound and potentially ruining the scheme. When Gabin's old pal from America notes how virtually impossible the original plan is Gabin opts to try an even riskier approach which involves hijacking a plane! Unfortunately even if the plan goes well a few missteps on Delon's part could wind up costing him Gabin's loyalty. There are more than a few fanciful escapades in this film not the least of which is Delon's escape from custody at the start. Still it's a staple of the genre for there to be extraordinary use of equipment and perilous close calls. The quirky nature of the script is accented by Morricone's music which features a mouth harp twanging occasionally. Gabin an important fixture of the French cinema makes an imposing and powerful patriarch. Delon is well cast as the aimless scoundrel who fails to use good judgement. Ventura another popular actor in France is appropriately lowkey and sober as he tracks down the gang while trying to avoid smoking. Demick who Darryl F. Zanuck attempted to turn into a Hollywood star is attractive and reasonably solid in her role. It's an interesting grab bag of sequences with a nice amount of action suspense and good character work. Keeping with the French style there are also a few dollops of nudity from one of Delon's bedmates and whomever doubled for Miss Demick on the beach Delon also strips down to some dinky white briefs for a scene.".

The Sicilian Clan truly deserves it and every second of the film is tightly acted and directed. We also have an absolutely magnificent soundtrack here courtesy of the Italian master composer Ennio Morricone which perfectly matches the mood and look of the film. Alain Delon in one of his best performances plays a master thief who gets hired by Jean Gabin for the occasion of pulling off a 50 million dollar jewel robbery. The jewelry is being shipped to a museum in New York by a passenger airplane and The Sicilian Clan want them all. The best way hijack the plane! There is also a very good subplot involving Delon and the wife of the one of the Clan boys that runs along the way which is ultimately responsible for the film's very very satisfying finale. Beautifully shot in Panavision the imagery is also great with lots of on location photography of the late 60's Paris. Sadly this movie is not currently available on home video. It was theatrically released in North America by the 20th Century Fox and it grossed over 1 million dollars at the time which quite respectable. I don't know who currently has the rights to it but hopefully Anchor Bay will license and release it now that they have released another great one Un Flic. Until then I'm glad that at least I have a pan  scan copy I made from the cable.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw the film's poster for the first time it was so impacting I thought for once that Gabin Ventura and Delon were allies all three members of the Sicilian clan. I was wrong but I defy anyone not to have these three legendary names pop up in their heads when they think of The Sicilian Clan Alain Delon is Roger Sartet a man sentenced to death after a failed armed robbery that cost the lives of two policemen. Lino Ventura is Le Goff the Chief of Police who takes Sartet's case personally and can't admit the way he escaped under their nose. And Jean Gabin is Vittorio Manalese the head of the 'Sicilian Clan' who wishes he could do a final job before retiring in Sicily. Delon is the dark handsome and unsympathetic antihero Ventura is the moral and solidly built law enforcer and Gabin the wise and experienced criminal patriarch sharing with Le Goff a profound contempt for Sartet. Henri Verneueil's 'The Sicilian Clan is mostly renowned for having reassembled the Holy Trinity of French Cinema maybe at the expenses of the other characters who seem underdeveloped in comparison. But it doesn't matter since the three leads fill the screen with a virile magnetism and although the The Sicilian Clan is adapted from a novel by Auguste Le Breton who wrote Bob Le Flambeur the film borrows less from Melville's existential heist films than the Western Spaghetti genre. It's all about the magical trio that elevated the film to its legendary status a sort of French The Good the Bad and the Ugly.Befittingly the film is scored by the Maestro Ennio Morricone who specialized in the late 60's and early 70's in the ultimate toughguy films from the Western to the gangster flick. The music also carries the mark of the Italian Morricone with the typical 'boing' sound and the haunting whistle a sort of 'song of death' that foresees a tragic ending coming from a final confrontation. Death itself is the omnipresent figure the unsung character of the film Sartet is a walking dead with nothing to lose Le Goff's determination is built on the death of his men and the Mannalese although criminals refuse to kill anyone in their job but we know that every rule allows a few exceptions.If the film can seem more superficial than Melville's gangster flicks it remains nonetheless a reference of the caper subgenre with a perfectionist and methodical approach. The Mannaleses help Sartet escape from the cop and the prize of his help apart from a book of expensive stamp is a plan drawn by an engineer he befriended in jail. The electronics expert set up the security system of a museum in Rome where a diamond exhibition is held. Mannalese trusts the engineer but not Sartet in one of the film's most memorable scenes he advises him to keep his brains above the belt he merely escaped from a second arrest when Le Goff found him in a hotel with a prostitute.Mannalese meets a Mafioso fellow played by a scenestealing Amedeo Zenarri. Their visit to the museum validates the plan but reveals some insightful surprises a ticking watch can be detected and the police can come one minute after the alarm. Then in a delightful scene they go to a toyshop and try to conceive the plan out of a few plane and cars models. The only way to escape from security is to rob the diamonds inside the plane that will take the diamonds to New York and hijack it. The Sicilian Clan features one of the most suspenseful heist ever featured in film and incredibly well done for a French film.Yet we're so accustomed to the genre to understand that the success of the robbery is secondary. But we follow it with a Hitchcockian suspense  one of the best parts occurs when the wife of the diamondtransfer insurer whom Sartet took the identity comes to see her husband. At that time both the viewers and the Mannaleses are caught by surprise and it's difficult to anticipate the way the situation will be handled. And Mannalese proves to be the 'man of the situation' and the brains of the group. We foresee his human aptitude during his first confrontation with Le Goff when he bluffs him enough not to raise any suspicion from the unflappable cop.Gabin is simply astonishing a few years before the image of the Mafia boss would forever be transfigured by the landmark performance of Marlon Brando in The Godfather Gabin plays in all nuance and subtlety a French 'Don'. His accent is remarkable considering how he's more associated with French popular culture and there's never one scene that feels caricature. Although the family background is not well developed it is significant to the plot by making outcasts out of the two French Sartet and Jeanne Irena Demick as Mannalese's sexy daughterinlaw. He didn't touch a woman for two year almost got himself arrested for an escapade with a prostitute and she's fascinated by this man who unlike her husbands isn't reluctant to use his gun. The flaws the mistakes to come are predictable but The Sicilian Clan is capable of surprising you even by exploiting archetypal situations. And in this catandmouse thriller one should only count on the other's flaw to lure him into his own trap. Le Goff expect one fatal mistake from Sartet and so does Mannalese who still has to prove he's got some Sicilian blood pumping his veins but Mannalese's sense of honor might lead him to another form of retirement. But that's the tragic beauty of life when even experience can be outweighed by a question of principles a sense of immanent justice that would reconcile men as different as Le Goff and Mannalese.".

But it doesn't matter since the three leads fill the screen with a virile magnetism and although the The Sicilian Clan is adapted from a novel by Auguste Le Breton who wrote Bob Le Flambeur the film borrows less from Melville's existential heist films than the Western Spaghetti genre. It's all about the magical trio that elevated the film to its legendary status a sort of French The Good the Bad and the Ugly.Befittingly the film is scored by the Maestro Ennio Morricone who specialized in the late 60's and early 70's in the ultimate toughguy films from the Western to the gangster flick. The music also carries the mark of the Italian Morricone with the typical 'boing' sound and the haunting whistle a sort of 'song of death' that foresees a tragic ending coming from a final confrontation. Death itself is the omnipresent figure the unsung character of the film Sartet is a walking dead with nothing to lose Le Goff's determination is built on the death of his men and the Mannalese although criminals refuse to kill anyone in their job but we know that every rule allows a few exceptions.If the film can seem more superficial than Melville's gangster flicks it remains nonetheless a reference of the caper subgenre with a perfectionist and methodical approach. The Mannaleses help Sartet escape from the cop and the prize of his help apart from a book of expensive stamp is a plan drawn by an engineer he befriended in jail. The electronics expert set up the security system of a museum in Rome where a diamond exhibition is held. Mannalese trusts the engineer but not Sartet in one of the film's most memorable scenes he advises him to keep his brains above the belt he merely escaped from a second arrest when Le Goff found him in a hotel with a prostitute.Mannalese meets a Mafioso fellow played by a scenestealing Amedeo Zenarri. Their visit to the museum validates the plan but reveals some insightful surprises a ticking watch can be detected and the police can come one minute after the alarm. Then in a delightful scene they go to a toyshop and try to conceive the plan out of a few plane and cars models. The only way to escape from security is to rob the diamonds inside the plane that will take the diamonds to New York and hijack it. The Sicilian Clan features one of the most suspenseful heist ever featured in film and incredibly well done for a French film.Yet we're so accustomed to the genre to understand that the success of the robbery is secondary. But we follow it with a Hitchcockian suspense  one of the best parts occurs when the wife of the diamondtransfer insurer whom Sartet took the identity comes to see her husband. At that time both the viewers and the Mannaleses are caught by surprise and it's difficult to anticipate the way the situation will be handled. And Mannalese proves to be the 'man of the situation' and the brains of the group. We foresee his human aptitude during his first confrontation with Le Goff when he bluffs him enough not to raise any suspicion from the unflappable cop.Gabin is simply astonishing a few years before the image of the Mafia boss would forever be transfigured by the landmark performance of Marlon Brando in The Godfather Gabin plays in all nuance and subtlety a French 'Don'. His accent is remarkable considering how he's more associated with French popular culture and there's never one scene that feels caricature. Although the family background is not well developed it is significant to the plot by making outcasts out of the two French Sartet and Jeanne Irena Demick as Mannalese's sexy daughterinlaw. He didn't touch a woman for two year almost got himself arrested for an escapade with a prostitute and she's fascinated by this man who unlike her husbands isn't reluctant to use his gun. The flaws the mistakes to come are predictable but The Sicilian Clan is capable of surprising you even by exploiting archetypal situations. And in this catandmouse thriller one should only count on the other's flaw to lure him into his own trap. Le Goff expect one fatal mistake from Sartet and so does Mannalese who still has to prove he's got some Sicilian blood pumping his veins but Mannalese's sense of honor might lead him to another form of retirement. But that's the tragic beauty of life when even experience can be outweighed by a question of principles a sense of immanent justice that would reconcile men as different as Le Goff and Mannalese.";

	schema:reviewBody "Traditionally speaking the influential and groundbreaking classics come from the States while the raw and exploitative imitations come from Europe more particularly Italy but this time it's sort of vice versa. A number of years before there was Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather  or any other major gangstermafia film for that matter  there was Henri Verneuil's The Sicilian Clan. This is the saga of a criminal Italian family in Paris covering up their clandestine affairs through running a business of electronic bar games. Following a very ingenious but dared and risky escape plan the family recruits the overambitious gangsterconvicted cop killer Roger Sartet even though patriarch Vittorio Manalese is reluctant to trust him and in spite of tough copper Le Goff obsessively hunting him down. Sartet suggests a jewelry theft worth more than 500 million dollars but the security precautions are insurmountable. Together with an old friend Vittorio invents a magnificently infallible plan to raid the jewels during their transportation by plane between the exhibition in Rome and another one in New York. Everything goes according to plan apart from a couple of obstructions but then Sartet breaks the code of honor by messing around with Vittorio's daughterinlaw. The Sicilian Clan literally nearly burst from all the talent that is involved in the cast with some of the greatest names of French cinema Alain Delon Jean Gabin and Lino Venturo but also in the crew with the fantastic cinematography of Henri Deca and the immortal soundtrack of Ennio Morricone. But the one thing that probably deserves the most praise and respect is the impeccable scenario with all its small but intelligent and creative details. It took no less than three gifted writers including the director to adapt Auguste Le Breton's landmark novel but the result is worth showing off with. Sartet's escape from the prison transport is a highlight and the whole plan for the jewelry heist is astoundingly wise. The suspense is present from the beginning but gradually also builds up further along the film. Verneuil terrifically plays out the cat and mouse game between Sartet and Le Goff and by extension the entire Manalese family. The story is full of headstrong and robust characters active on both sides of the law and the film undoubtedly owes a great deal of its success to the stellar acting performances. During the seventies and more specifically after the releases of The Godfather and films like Dirty Harry the policecrime thriller genre boomed in Europe and literally hundreds of excessively violent mafia thrillers got unleashed upon the market. The Sicilian Clan relies more on story and atmosphere instead of on wild action but the film nevertheless remains an important pioneer.".

Unfortunately for me dubbing detaches me from some foreign movies and for some reason they seem slower. This film was no exception. I'll also add that this film was dubbed in three languages and Gabin did his own English dubbing.Directed by Henri Verneuil Gabin is the head of a crime family that plans to hijack a plane with 50 million in jewels on board.Delon is an assassin being chased by the French police and is getting in the way of the robbery plans. My favorite by far was Lino Ventura as the police inspector who sucks lollipops while trying to quit smoking. He's wonderful. Irina Demick a Zanuck protge is absolutely beautiful as one of the Sicilian clan wives. She's very Suzy Parkerlike sexy and does a good job though I don't imagine doing a love scene with Alain Delon was all that difficult.Gabin is terrific  I'd seen so many of his old films it was a shock to see him older. Quiet belying his hard sinister attitude underneath he is grandfather father and villain. Delon is Mr. Cool isn't he always one step ahead of the police hiding behind a pair of sunglasses as deadly as Gabin but with no capacity for human relationships.For me this was a little slow getting to the point but the dubbing really took me out of the plot. Ventura's performance transcended that though. That could have been because the character was more fleshed out than some of the others.Definitely worth seeing. It's amazing that Gabin Delon and Ventura enjoyed such fame yet aren't well known to U.S. audiences for the most part.".

Meanwhile he's making googoo eyes at the wife of one of Gabin's sonsoh gee i wonder if that's gonna be important to the plot later on.Lino Ventura is on hand as the detective tracking down Delonand he has some wonderful hard bitten one liners throughout. Ventura looking here as kind of a cross between DeNiro and middle age Depardieugoes through with the motions of chasing down Delon and of coursewell you'll see what happens. Ventura by the way plays the standard issue grouchy detective character so wonderfully herehe really jumps off the screen in some casesyou wonder why he's not better known today among the more famous 60's and 70's french actors. The plot of the film isn't really all that important anywaysas most of it goes out the window by the second hour anywaysSecurity at the museum is so airtightit results in Gabin coming up with a another plan to rob those jewelsone so over the top so out there so completely ridiculousyou wonder why you've never seen something like it in a Bruckheimer film in the last 20 years. Its that kind of go for broke attitude that makes the film a lot of funbut Ennio Morricone's nearly constant theme music also helps a great deal. the music is so omnipresent its almost like its own character herei would argue that the music plays more of a character here then any of Gabin's sonsmany of whom help in the planning of the robberybut all of em are so interchangeable that you never know who's who...not that it matters since your attention is going to be on Delon anyways. I would definitely recommend this filmnot just to fans of french crime filmsbut for fans of any ridiculous action movie since it gets so ridiculous that it actually become that rare french crime film that's also fun to watch.".

I would definitely recommend this filmnot just to fans of french crime filmsbut for fans of any ridiculous action movie since it gets so ridiculous that it actually become that rare french crime film that's also fun to watch.";

Meanwhile  there takes place Mexican Revolution with two bands  Emilio Zapata's supporters and Porfirio Diaz's followers . Dakota  then  decides to help the Zapatistas .This forgotten S.W. packs thrills  action  and lots of shots and gunplay . There is plenty of action in the movie  guaranteeing shoot'em up  riding pursuits or stunts every few minutes . It deals with Dakota Joe  splendidly performed by the tall Robert Hundar  he is fine as the villainhero of the story . Starring Robert Hundar is cool as a cold killer turned into a defender  he is enjoyable as the hero of the story . Hundar is very nice  he ravages the screen he shoots  hits and runs  besides receives violent punches kicks and wounds . The story is wrapped in the aura of Mexican revolution and an event on the metamorphosis of Dakota  a gunfighter turned into a hero . However  Fernando Sancho steals the spectacle as a likable Mexican with dark secrets  being magnificently interpreted by this veteran Spanish secondary actor . Worthwhile watching for a demonstration of the confrontation  with some looks that say it all  between Robert Hundar and his rival  the cruel owner well played by Mirko Ellis  also Spaghetti's ordinary . It's an exciting SW with breathtaking showdown between the protagonist Robert Hundar and the enemy hoodlums  including a thrilling ending when happens a showdown at a saloon between Dakota Joe and a surprising contender . In addition  there appears usual secondaries of ItalianSpanish Western  including customary actors as the femme fatal Gloria Marin  Jose Canalejas  Antonio Mayans  Simon Arriaga  Raf Baldassarre  among others. There are many fine technicians and nice assistant direction and excellent production design  a magnificent scenario on the villages  ranch  and barren outdoors  dirty landscapes under a glimmer sun and fine sets filmed in Almera Andaluca  Spain . Evocative cinematography by Emilio Foriscot  showing marvelously the habitual Almeria outdoors . Angel Oliver supported by expert musician Coroliano Gori compose a vivid Spaghetti soundtrack and well conducted  including an awesome leitmotif  it's full of enjoyable sounds and rousing score . Definitely a worthy topic but well done correctly interpreted and eurowestern of the first period which although far from the postulates leonianos .This is one of the uncountable Western that the producers pioneers Jose Gutierrez Maesso  Eduardo Manzanos Brochero were joined by other Spanish producers among which the brothers Productions Balczar Balczar or IFISA Iquino Ignacio Farres who established around Barcelona Esplugues City Casteldefells and Huesca especially to shoot the exteriors a new stable center for filming westerns.

The story features the squarejawed Robert Hundar as a strapping bounty hunter who takes on a job to kill a doctor only to discover that he's helping the people of the revolution. When Hundar turns down the job with his employer chaos ensues.Everything in this film plays out as you'd expect. I didn't find Hundar very convincing at all as the lead although Fernando Sancho is much better in a typical performance as a bandit leader with a heart of gold. As there's not much in the way of plot in this one there's plenty of action a lot of it rather nonsensical as Hundar bumps off endless nonentities just to keep the pace going. It's only in the last twenty minutes or so that the film threatens to get interesting with various twists and showdowns but never once did MAN AND A COLT really entertain me.".

The story features the squarejawed Robert Hundar as a strapping bounty hunter who takes on a job to kill a doctor only to discover that he's helping the people of the revolution. When Hundar turns down the job with his employer chaos ensues.Everything in this film plays out as you'd expect. I didn't find Hundar very convincing at all as the lead although Fernando Sancho is much better in a typical performance as a bandit leader with a heart of gold. As there's not much in the way of plot in this one there's plenty of action a lot of it rather nonsensical as Hundar bumps off endless nonentities just to keep the pace going. It's only in the last twenty minutes or so that the film threatens to get interesting with various twists and showdowns but never once did MAN AND A COLT really entertain me.";

	schema:reviewBody "Warning! There are SPOILERS in this review. Warning!I was pleasantly surprised by this film.  I only bought the video because Lee Van Cleef was in it and I had expected to find that he and Donald Pleasence would be the only redeeming features of yet another bad action film.  I couldn't have been more wrong.The plot was exciting and fastpaced with the tension kept up throughout the film.  Particularly good was a scene where people keep getting shot as they try to steal a 'floppy disk' actually a CDROM.  One character goes into the room blows the safe and gets the disk only to be shot by another character who then is shot by Mason Manfred Lehmann.  Suddenly the view switches to another gun pointing in the room...Another thing about this film is that it had the feel of a Leone Spaghetti Western about it with amoral characters ready to do just about anything for money.  It didn't try to explain the characters  a mistake many bad films make  but let the actors and the action show us what manner of people they were.  The dialogue was generally good only flagging now and again particularly in the scene where Henry Carlson Donald Pleasence meets an old colleague who is investigating whether he Carlson has links to the drugs trade.  The only bits that didn't quite come off were the scene where after Ling a woman who Mason liked died in battle Mason started blindly shooting and shouting 'Murderers' and a scene where a snake bit one of the mercenaries who came with Colby.  For some reason I have never seen a film that has had a credible scene involving snakes.  Snakes can be deadly certainly but they are made out to be a bigger menace than they are.  The merc who found the snake in the back of the transport lorry should have simply stood up because he should have been wearing good boots.  He then could have dropped a box on the snake.  He could have even thrown his shirt on the snake and beat it with his rifle.  I am surprised that the merc panicked in the way he did.  Also snake venom doesn't work that quickly.The acting was generally good and as expected Lee Van Cleef and Donald Pleasence shone through as the geniuses they were.  Don't listen to those who say that Lee Van Cleef was past his prime his delivery and presence were as perfect as ever.  I was also very impressed by Lewis Collins.  He held his own with Lee Van Cleef and Donald Pleasence.  I rarely watch television and so had never seen Lewis Collins in 'The Professionals' but after seeing him in this film I will look for others in which he appears.The action scenes were also generally well done.  This film managed to capture some of the chaos of war the best laid plans being undone as soon as the battle begins.  Further there were no Hollywoodstyle scenes in which the 'hero' pulls off some impossible bit of action in battle rescuing someone or even everyone or in which someone dies 'heroically'.  All but one of the people who went with Colby died and only a few of those deaths were even vaguely heroic.  For instance Ling died because she looked down at a companion who had just been shot instead of keeping her attention on the battle.  That's exactly the sort of way one would expect to find someone dying in battle.  There were a few things that didn't come off right though.  One was the nuclear explosion I don't care that it was a 'mininuke' it still should have had more kick than that.  The other was the sound of the pistols they sounded like starting pistols.  As well the actors looked too clean after having been out in the field at least one night and having been in battle.  Go out in a muddy field for only a few hours and you won't look that clean.  This is however a common failing of films.  In low budget films it is probably easier to deal with continuity issues if the actors remain clean.The cinematography was very good it captured the atmosphere of everywhere from a drug lord's house to a jungle very nicely.  The music was just right lowkey and slightly exotic not dominating the film or being used as substitute for acting or action.All in all I would recommend this film to anyone who likes action amoral characters and good acting.  It is well worth it.".

The plot involved a group or mercenaries lots of gun shooting explosions and a top secret floppy disc. It was an entirely tiresome storyline quite honestly and a film in which you have to have a considerable interest in exploding helicopters and gun battles if you are going to get much out of it. I am somewhat ambivalent about action movies myself but I do enjoy some such as the previous instalment in this series. But this one I essentially found to be a tedious series of action and dialogue scenes. Basically I have found that all films that focus on top secret floppy discs are awful.The cast is actually not bad though. We have bmovie legends such as Lee Van Cleef and Donald Pleasence and cult favourites such as Bobby Rhodes the best cinematic pimp of all time from Demons 1985 and Demons 2 1986 and John Steiner from Dario Argento's seminal giallo Tenebrae 1982.

	schema:reviewBody "Der Commander or The Commander is a West German  Italian coproduction from 1988 almost 30 years old and this one runs for 105 minutes. According to IMDb it is a Germanlanguage film in the original but I am not too sure about this. Yes the title is German but the actors who play the main characters are not so they have been dubbed for sure. Also it is part of as trilogy and the previous film despite having German titles are no Germanlanguage films either according to IMDb. Anyway the cast is pretty good here. The title character is played by Lewis Collins and I cannot say I know who that is but other than him Donald Pleasence from James Bond and Lee Van Cleef star of epic western films have lots of screen time too. For the latter it was one of the final performances of his life and career and he has aged considerably compared to other films you may have seen him in. The director is Antonio Margheriti and the trio who wrote this are also 2 Italians and one German. The latter is Arne Elsholtz who died recently and looking at other films from him this was certainly a very different genre compared to what he usually did. It is a military film that takes place in Asia so you basically know what to expect. For male audiences they included one hot female solider an Asian actually. The story is pretty generic for a military film and sadly I was not really impressed by the acting or the plot here. Then again I may be a bit biased as military films are rarely my preferred choice. That's why I give this one a thumbs down. Only worth checking out for the biggest fans of the genre.".

In 1988 he made The Commander an action film about a commando squad that goes to Southeast Asia to attack a drug lord's stronghold. It starred Collins and Van Cleef again but no Kinski and Borgnine this time in their place there was Donald Pleasence. To further confuse matters the version of The Commander I saw was actually titled CommandoWildgeese! It took me about 10 minutes to realize that I wasn't watching the 1984 film! Anyway all you need to remember is that The Commander  CommandoWildgeese is a lowgrade action film to be avoided at all costs. A low point in the careers of Van Cleef and Pleasence all the others involved never had much of a career to begin with. The only character who piqued my interest was a beautiful female fighter but she didn't get to do much. ".

Detective Hopkins is the kind of amoral sleazeball that makes Dirty Harry seem like a little angel in comparison. He's the kind of cop that blows your date away leaves his partner to clear the mess and then asks the woman if she needs a ride home and have some fun.James Woods also coproduced with director James B. Harris long time buddy of Stanley Kubrick and producer of THE KILLING 1957 PATHS OF GLORY 1958 and LOLITA 1962 who also wrote the script for this hardedged cop thriller. I made the mistake expecting a really good film mostly based on Woods' presence the writings of James Ellroy and Kubrick sidekick James B. Harris taking the directorial helm but Harris hardly shines in that department. His direction is adequate but not much more. Best to watch this as a gritty cop flick trashy cynical and sometimes a bit silly with plenty of misguided attempts at humor on account of leading man James Woods always a plus in any film. It's a reasonably wellexecuted cop thriller but no classic. Expect an enjoyable slice of Bmovie nonsense and you probably won't be disappointed.Camera Obscura  710".

I haven't read the novel but I liked both this movie  Ellroy's L.A. Confidential. It is rare indeed to take a novel  translate it to the screen without losing something. Perhaps I'm lucky because I never read either novel before seeing the film.One of the reasons I watch this movie over  over again is that it IS funny yet disturbingly dark at times. In one scene where Woods is trying to get laid by an uptight bisexual poetess you can just see the boredom  apathy on his face as she drones on  on about her  knight in shining armor. This ties in with an opening scene when he's trying to convince his soon to be estranged wife that it's better NOT to delude their daughter with fairy tales that is just AWESOME writing. I cannot paraphrase it all but he basically says that innocence kills. The idea that some man will come along to make it perfect is what kills deluded women. Which ties into the story because he ends up on a case that turns out to be a serial killer who specializes in killing innocent women.There are some parts that are slow but over all this movie is well paced wgreat actors and great acting. This movie is just as gripping as Training Day just less well known. Either way give it a try you won't be disappointed if you like James Woods.".

The tragic tale was so woefully violent I wondered how it's stark terror and black suspense would transferred to the Big Screen. However I was pleased when I saw that James Wood would be the hero and it would be directed by James B. Harris. Woods plays detective Sgt. Lloyd Hopkins a hardasnails police officer seemly obsessed with solving an unsolved series of murders dating back years. Seemingly at a deadend he is frustrated and on the verge of giving it up when a ray of hope inspires him to continue. As he does he enlist the aid of Kathleen McCarthy Lesley Ann Warren a Feminist poet and his police mentor Dutch Peltz Charles Durning who is in line to become a police Captain. Despite his unorthodox methods Hopkins gets results even if it means stepping on toes and challenging his superiors. The movie is powerfully dark suspenseful and dotted with terrifying scenes which are not for the faint of heart. Still any Woods' fan is sure to enjoy the power and skill with the main actor and I for one look forward to this film becoming a milestone for Woods. Excellent rendition of the book and if one wants to peek under the ambulance sheet I suggest you read the novel. ".

	schema:headline " Big coincidences in gritty L.A. crime thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Cop is based on the book 'Blood and the Moon' by James Ellroy. I have not read the book that the film is based on although I am a big fan of the first three books in Ellroy's 'L.A. Quartet'. It is often said of Ellroy that his writing got better as it went along and assuming that this film is closely based on the book I would say that there's a good chance that is true as the story here is not exactly solid. The entire film hinges on one major and quite unbelievable coincidence that boggles the mind if you care to think about it. However it's the style and atmosphere that saves it and that's the main reason I loved this film! The plot focuses on your everyday hardbitten cop Lloyd Hopkins who after investigating the murder of a woman in Los Angeles comes to believe that a serial killer may be operating in the area. Naturally the police captain doesn't believe a word of it and Lloyd is forced to investigate on his own leading him to a revelation closer to home than he was expecting.Director James B. Harris creates a fabulous atmosphere for the film to take place in and ensures that L.A. seems to be every bit the gritty and sleazy location needed to facilitate a tale like this. Similarly James Woods fits the central role like a glove and is always believable in the role even when the plot is getting out of hand. The first half of the film is really rather good and plausible but then the twist hits and it really requires a suspension of disbelief from the viewer. It's not that the twist could not happen it's more the way that it does happen which comes off as silly. It's just far too convenient and the whole film is turned on its head from that point on. Still the atmosphere is retained and the story continues to be gripping which are the film's strongest elements. Certain elements of the film are rather nasty and indeed the book was originally denied by many different publishers for being too graphic! Still a lot of it focuses on dialogue and from what I know of Ellroy this part of the film is quite faithful. It all boils down to a rather hurried and coincidental ending but I really do feel that this is a film where the style of it is much more important than the plot line. For some it will no doubt be too much of a problem...but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone that enjoys a good crime thriller!".

	schema:reviewBody "Cop is directed by James B. Harris who also adapts the screenplay from the novel Blood on the Moon written by James Ellroy. It stars James Woods Lesley Ann Warren Charles Durning Charles Haid and Raymond J. Barry. Music is by Michel Colombier and cinematography by Steve Dubin.LAPD detective Lloyd Hopkins Woods is investigating the gruesome murder of a woman and comes to believe it is the work of a serial killer whose crimes stretch back for 15 years. But with his superiors troubled by his methods of working and his home life crumbling apart by the day Hopkins is short of support professionally and emotionally. Working alone as a rogue cop Hopkins will stop at nothing to prove his theory right and nail the killer in the process.All of these little girls have one thing in commondisillusionment.Met with much indifference by critics upon its release and chided by the Ellroy purists Cop is a film that may be a flawed take on the source material but none the less it's one that remains a compelling neonoir dripping with cynicism sleaze and violence. From the off we are given a clue to what lies ahead for us as a man is frantically trying to report a murder by phone he gets the runaround by the voices at the other end of the line only when he announces that he will have to use his stolen credit cards to make the call does he at last get put through to someone who needs to hear what he has to say. Enter James Woods on twitchy sardonic and intense form. Who we then quickly find at the murder scene calmly sitting at the victim's desk leafing through her literature as her shredded corpse hangs from the ceiling behind him. It's cold troubling and poignant the marker is set and Cop as a film in this respect never loses focus.Harris and Woods coproducers as well paint a decidedly muddy L.A. that harks back to noirs of yesteryear. It's not enough that our rogue cop protagonist an ultimate antihero is deviant shallow and perhaps unhinged? But the flow of support characters are seriously kinked in persona's too. Crooked kinky outthere damaged goods God bothering and simply sick. Take your pick they are all in here getting a caustic prod from Harris and Woods. There's even humour here as well some of it black but often it's a fleeting ray of warmth when between Hopkins and Dutch Durning great the only person Hopkins and the film can count on as being normalish....To say Cop is solely a star vehicle for Woods is not unfair for without him the movie would flounder on the rocks. An excellent actor who can put likability into the most compulsive of characters Woods gives the film its heart beat. With Hopkins cynical and often led by what resides in his underwear it's not hard to envisage some viewers losing sight of the fact that he is still a great cop determined to clear the streets of a scumbag killer. Yes he does indeed skirt the boundaries of good taste as he goes about topping up his libido needs and he thinks of nothing to breaking into somewhere to nab a clue but the picture sneakily asks us if this is OK as long as Hopkins gets his man? Woods revels in the role and makes Cop an essential viewing for fans of the actor.Rage in the Womb.With Woods' dominance comes the flaws elsewhere. The killer's motives are sketchy enough as it is but the perp is barely formed as a real being. Those warped support characters too are only that because we have had the smallest amounts of character morsels to feed off. That is except for Lesley Ann Warren's troubled feminist poet Kathleen McCarthy who gets much to do in the latter stages of the film but is miscast and done no favours by the makers who reduce her to being an airhead. A bastion of feminism she is not! A victim of Harris choosing to extract the feminist thump from the source material to leave a sour taste tingling the tongue. Yet if you can forgive the flaws that evidently many others can not? Then this is still a biting and potent neonoir picture. Crowned for the record magnificently without a cop out ending.810 from me but you can knock a point off of that score if you aren't as biased as me with Woods the actor. While Ellroy worshippers will most likely need to snip another point off as well.".

Kathleen is a strange bird with secrets she is not willing to share with Hopkins.What comes out during the film is the corruption in the police department something that is not new to the city of angels and something we have seen again and again. The last scenes reveal who the real serial killer has been and his motives but frankly we have had no clue about this person throughout the movie. That is a bit hard to take although in the context of the investigation it makes sense since Lloyd has been following an invisible enemy.The best reason for watching Cop is James Woods.

Charles Durning makes a good impression as Dutch the man in charge of Hopkins and his friend. Leslie Ann Warren's Kathleen is not as successful.

Charles Durning is also very good as is Lesley Ann Warren though I just wanted to slap her character a couple of times for being so stupid and whiny. The sudden no BS ending is awesomeI love it when movies end with an abrupt blackout like that and he gets a great ending line. I played the ending back a few times it was so cool and bada. This movie was actually surprisingly disturbing in parts there's a really gruesome scene where Wood's character I can't remember the cop's name it was probably Jake or Jack or something snarky like thatfinds a murder victim about 34 of the way through the film that really shocked me and gave me the creeps.

Cop's final reel a clankingly executed homage to Harry Callaghan's confrontation with Scorpio from the first Dirty Harry movie proudly nails Cop's inconsequential colors to the post cements its Bgrade cult classic status and indeed sums up the talent of the fascination with and the rebellious attraction to James Woods the actor. the good news is I am a cop. The bad news is I just got suspended.";

IN this film he delivers the best 1 liner I have ever heard in my entire life. Ever. It's ends the movie in a hurricane of laughter. Laughter in a good way. Laughing at 80's movies. This one may have been made in 90 but it still has the 'pure cop with chip on shoulder' guy. I would also recommend The Hard Way with Michael J Fox. That's also one of James Wood's best performances.Back to Cop. Watch for the violence. Watch for the great 80's Dialogue. Watch for a plot that while have some serious issues is still passable and forgivably based on the movies final line. That last line which I will not discuss her MUST WATCH THIS. Is the best ending to ANY movie I have ever scene ofcourse in the context of an 80's actionadventurecoptype movie. Enjoy!".

Maybe it's because he hasn't starred in enough 'classics' but there's something fundamentally troubling in his personality that discourages full recognition.  It's not because he usually plays villains  audiences have had great affection for the hateful throughout movie history.  Woods is too normal to be a melodramatic villain he's a tensed up selfish narcissistic arrogant jerk.  He has neither redeemable qualities nor conventional charisma.  His look compounds these drawbacks with its strangeness  it somehow seems all wrong his body is to wiry for his head and shoulders his head is reptilian and bugeyed.  And yet he charms by his total indifference to what we think of him.  He's also very funnyCop is too flawed to be great  its plot mechanics are too predictable James Ellroy having started with the daring proposition that Woods might be mad and his investigations just an extension of this is too afraid of loose ends to be truly scary serial killer plots ostensibly about the blackest modern evil are paradoxically reassuring  they suggest pattern and order and an identifiable problem which once rooted will result in restoration the visual style could be out of any dour 70s cop show except for some gorgeous Kubrickian tracking shots the music is hellish 80s synth orchestration the climactic showdown is implausible and silly although the film boasts one of the best endings in cinema.What makes this film essential is Woods and Harris' direction.  Laura Mulvey once claimed that Hollywood cinema privileged the actions of the male hero the woman was an object to be stared at and won.  Cop refutes this by having an archetypal male hero  a cop  whose actions shape the movement of the film and yet who is riveted to the screen subjected to the merciless exposure of the camera.  Woods cannot lie to us every tic flaw line of thought is laid bare.  Even though he always seems in control we are constantly aware that he is being stared at even before this becomes a narrative element that he is stuck in the frame.   Harris producer of The Killing Dr. Strangelove Lolita etc. has learned much from Kubrick in this unforgivingly formal analytic approach see also Melville.The film subverts the usual maverick cop cliches.  Unlike Dirty Harry Hopkins' concern for the cause of murdered women is undermined by his egocentric insensitivity towards the women who practically need him in his life.  There is a Freudian framework used as Hopkins' neuroses he is accused of having a fixation on murdered women are linked to his past but the final working of them out it takes place in his old school is not reassuring.  The force itself is perverted and corrupt both in obvious one sherrif is a drugdealing rentboy pimp and not so obvious most of Hopkins' superiors are 'born agains' ways.  Hopkins is  like a Kubrick hero an instrument of a corrupting social force.There are problems  the coopting and infantilising of feminism the possible homophobia like the Searchers the critique sometimes seems to become confused with what is being criticised.  But this is brave dangerous clever filmmaking that deserves to be better known.".

	schema:reviewBody "Similar in some ways to Sea Of Love with a comparably nostalgic theme Cop exudes suspense and mystery almost from the start and all the way to its final spinetingling conclusion. Though James Woods does a fine job as Lloyd Hopkins the lone ranger cop trying to solve a murder it's the story itself that held my attention not Woods.With effective logical flow in plot points the story builds from a brutal apparently isolated murder to something far more extensive. My main problem with the film is when the plot veers away from the murder investigation into a character study of Hopkins or his domestic problems at home. I didn't care at all about him personally.Film direction is quite good. There's one segment in particular that effectively conveys a sense of mystery. Sitting in a chair in a character's living room with no one else present Hopkins quietly ponders the room. The camera focuses first on one wall then another. Hopkins fixates on one of these walls in particular. But there's not much to see. The camera toggles back and forth between Hopkins' face and an evercloser shot of the wall. What does he see there? Dim light shadows and silence magnify the mystery here in preparation for a surprise.Casting is acceptable acting is better. Lesley Ann Warren especially gives a fine performance.

	onyx:emotionText "Similar in some ways to Sea Of Love with a comparably nostalgic theme Cop exudes suspense and mystery almost from the start and all the way to its final spinetingling conclusion. Though James Woods does a fine job as Lloyd Hopkins the lone ranger cop trying to solve a murder it's the story itself that held my attention not Woods.With effective logical flow in plot points the story builds from a brutal apparently isolated murder to something far more extensive. My main problem with the film is when the plot veers away from the murder investigation into a character study of Hopkins or his domestic problems at home. I didn't care at all about him personally.Film direction is quite good. There's one segment in particular that effectively conveys a sense of mystery. Sitting in a chair in a character's living room with no one else present Hopkins quietly ponders the room. The camera focuses first on one wall then another. Hopkins fixates on one of these walls in particular. But there's not much to see. The camera toggles back and forth between Hopkins' face and an evercloser shot of the wall. What does he see there? Dim light shadows and silence magnify the mystery here in preparation for a surprise.Casting is acceptable acting is better. Lesley Ann Warren especially gives a fine performance.

	schema:reviewBody "James Woods does extremely well as can be expected in this film based on a novel by James Ellroy of L.A. Confidential fame. The original title Blood on the Moon would have been a more striking choice with the title Cop suggesting a certain generic quality about this whole thing which isn't exactly far off the mark. This movie does have a large air of familiarity to it overall starting with Woods' character Lloyd Hopkins an intense and driven individual who has his own way of doing things.Lloyd is a weary man determined to teach his daughter early on that the world can be a bad and ugly place and it's Lloyds' assertion that innocence and naivety is what really kills young women  and he's proved correct in regards to a serial murder case he's stubbornly pursuing. Mostly what we get here is good solid straightforward no frills storytelling the story might be familiar but the execution is still quite competent. Woods and his director James B. Harris who'd previously worked together on 1982s' FastWalking also served as the producers here.It does help the movie that it does have that rather glum film noir style to it enhanced by Michel Colombiers' moody music score. Although the story plays out in such a way that we can sort of see where things are going it never makes things too obvious and in fact the true identity of the killer is not revealed until just before the final act. This leads to a pretty suspenseful finale in a school gym with Woods and the killer playing a game of cat and mouse  not to mention one of the most kick ass endings to a movie of this kind with a memorable quote from Woods.Very good supporting performances are another heavy asset with lovely Lesley Ann Warren as the feminist writer and would be romantic interest Charles Durning a steady presence as Woods' good friend on the force Raymond J. Barry as a ramrod straight and humourless superior Charles Haid as a crooked deputy with a disgusting past and present and Randi Brooks as the entertainer who provides Woods with some information. Woods makes for a commendably flawed yet compelling protagonist  not a gentleman who's one dimensional as he's quite tender with his daughter yet his dog with a bone mentality does get him into a great deal of trouble.A good and consistently watchable if not really remarkable movie.Seven out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a good thriller with some very shocking scenes. It boasts several interesting characters which I found pretty believable. James Woods is Lloyd Hopkins a police detective who tries to catch a serial killer whose prey are young innocent women. Hopkins has a kind of a fixation on this type of female not unlike the Russel Crowe character in L.A. confidential. He thinks they have to be cured of this innocence at the earliest possible age and accordingly tells his own little daughter the gruesomest possible bedtime stories a great scene with a great little child actress. Hopkins' wife says he is a disturbed person and one has to agree with her.In the course of the investigation Hopkins finds out that the owner of a feminist bookstore Kathleen McCarthy played by Lesley Ann Warren is in some way linked to the serial killer. Hopkins of course hates feminists but somehow for the sake of the investigation he gets into a relationship with McCarthy. This leads to a hilarious foreplay conversation with an ending that makes you rock with laughter. But real tragedy is never far away and even if the feminist character is a rather blunt caricature her actions and her reasoning are an essential and convincing part of the story.A further interesting point for me was the reference to bornagains. They are not involved in the crime of this movie but seem to dominate the higher echelons in the police hierarchy. Hopkins' partner warns him about them and tells him that he is at the top of their to retire list because of his shaky family life. Hopkin's superior is a known born again I go to church on Sunday and to prayer meetings three times a week but for the rest of the time I put God out of my mind he says something like that. It is a very good and sensible performance by Raymond J. Barry as it does not like in the case of the feminist revert to stereotype. That captain seems to be strict but correct acknowledging the talents of Hopkins and criticizing his failings in a fair if tight lipped way. He puts Hopkins on suspension which leads to a violent ending many reviewers seem to appreciate.The production values and the pacing of this movie are above average it delivers action and leaves time for introspection on different levels. I wish Al Pacino had had a look at this movie before he starred in Insomnia.".

The annoying comic relief characters appears to have graduated from the same school as JarJar Binks but less well animated. The nadir of comedy is when a minor dolphin character has a whole scene about him farting.

The apparent theme of the movie of following one's dream could not be any more trite and vapid. Daniel runs away from home and his ultimate triumph is to go SURFING in the lamest sort of anticlimax imaginable. The resolution to the conflict to the monster fish if you think about it critically makes you wonder how Daniel could even be considered a hero.This is a terrible film.

	schema:reviewBody "To sum up my absolute hate for this movie I created an IMDb account JUST to write a review on this movie. To begin the only reason I watched this is because I was doped on Tylenol with the flu and needed a movie to pass time. I cannot say enough times how much I dislike the dialog plot casting characters and overall animation.My seven year old brother and I decided that the producers probably made this movie in a weekend. The dialog doesn't match up with the way their mouths are moving and every here and there the characters would be talking OUTSIDE of the shot. It's almost more entertaining to make fun of this movie rather than actually watch it. To be honest my brother and I thought it was a rip off of Veggie Tales...only with worse musical numbers and animation. By the time the first song started playing we thought John Denver was singing. Not only that but someone obviously had to write new lyricsmusic because song writers would be ashamed to be apart of this movie. Lastly the characters were more poorly depicted than a children's picture book. For example Carl The Squid looked like he escaped from that movie Chernobyl Diaries...it's almost scary. Also the physical features of the fishdolphin aren't even anatomically correct. For one porpoise don't even sleep! And the squid's face is backwards. Overall this movie will actually decrease your child's chances of getting into a good college and most likely scare them away from the ocean. In summary if you're religious...FIND A DIFFERENT MOVIE because you will definitely be offended and ashamed you even clicked play.".

Or do dolphins really do that to stay under water longer...probably not. Overall it was not a good movie. It's not close to being a good movie. It literally hurt to watch the first 30 minutes. The rest i spent writing this review. I tried to draw out my son's opinion and all he kept saying was that it was a really long movie. I think that's 4 year olds way of saying that it stinks. One bright spot in this movie is the music. I love 80's movie music and this movie featured bad vocals and too many guitar riffs. Only watch this movie if you don't believe the bad reviews.

I thought I believed in freedom of artistic expression but all copies of this movie should be permanently destroyed so no other psyches will be harmed by viewing it.";

	schema:reviewBody "As said many times love animation to bits some of my alltime favourite films are animated and always try to be kind to any film regardless of its quality when it's deserving of that. Am not going to lie and say that every animated film or animation in general is great there are some terrible animated films out there.'The Dolphin Story of a Dreamer' is one of the biggest examples of terrible animation despite being a generous and perceptive reviewer it is very difficult to be subjective and kind when talking about one of the biggest wastes of time ever encountered. Always look for redeeming qualities to bad or less films 'The Dolphin Story of a Dreamer' has nothing to recommend it and children and adults alike will struggle to get any enjoyment out of it. Its least bad component is the animation of the water the one animation detail that has any attention to detail but it looks only okay never rising above that.It is frankly wasted by the animation in every other regard and throughout the entire film being so atrocious that it makes one feel physically ill looking at it. The colours are flat and lack any vibrancy or vividness very little attention is paid to little things let alone bigger effects the backgrounds are sparse lack fluidity and never allows one to get immersed into a potentially magical world and it has the single most ugliest and stiffest character animation for dolphins especially bad for a film full of robotic and ugly character designs for every character for any animated film set under the sea.Music is frequently discordant never fits and is likely to give younger audiences nightmares just hearing it. The script is awkward and muddled with a lot of parts being overexplanatory some parts being too complicated for younger viewers to properly understand it and a lot of other parts are incredibly juvenile that are so childish and unfunny to intelligenceinsulting degrees. The story is never engaging or worth investing in emotionally with far too much aimless exposition and a lot of stretched out scenes that go on for too long and go absolutely nowhere. Even adolescents and adults will find it difficult to comprehend what's going on.Furthermore 'The Dolphin Story of a Dreamer' is one of the worst examples of target audience issues in a family film with nothing for children and adults and with elements that will alienate people of all ages. There is a real sense that 'The Dolphin Story of a Dreamer' had no idea who it was aiming for and what it wanted to be. Adults will be insulted by the excessiveness and childishness of the often pointless potty humour while children will find the darker scenes constantly interjected with abrupt and jarring tonal shifts far too frightening and out of place. Pacing is all over the place dull.Characters are either annoying or deprived of personality with a protagonist so devoid of endearing personality or development and full of aimless motivations and illogical decision making that he's impossible to root for and not in a long time has there been more unintentionally creepy voice acting.In conclusion undersea animation at its most amateurish yes more so than 'Izzy's Way Home' and 'The Reef' dullest and most nightmarish. 110 for the okay at best animation of the water only.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Framed for a 40 million robbery of US currency Morgan Christopher George is given a chance to redeem himself and cut his sentence down from 25 to 5 years by FBI Agent Ames Ted de Corsia by being given the task to not only recover the cash but rescue this important US nuclear scientist Art Keefer Ralph Taeger who's held captive on the Caribbean island fortress of Nvevo Cudiz. With pretty FBI Agent Kim Stacy Yvette Mimieux acting as Morgan's wife he used their honeymoon as cover to rescue Keefer as well as recovering the stolen money. As it soon turned out Morgan found himself involved with a web of corruption on the island from the Governor General and Police Commissioner on down that made his task of rescuing Keefer and recovering the money far more difficult then he ever expected it to be. There's also the fact the the island is being used as a gulag like prison for political dissidents that are being kept in line and in a zombie like state by being shot up with drugs by the Commandant and his stooges running it.SPOILERS Acting as a drug dealer to gain entrance in Nvevo Cudiz Morgan guns down those in charge and starts a major prison revolt with the hundreds of junkies imprisoned there crashing out. It's during the massive jailbreak that the man who framed Morgan his former army buddy Sal Dekker Joseph Sirola who had his face altered with massive plastic surgery pops up trying to retrieve the stolen cash that Morgan recovered that he framed Morgan for.

With pretty FBI Agent Kim Stacy Yvette Mimieux acting as Morgan's wife he used their honeymoon as cover to rescue Keefer as well as recovering the stolen money. As it soon turned out Morgan found himself involved with a web of corruption on the island from the Governor General and Police Commissioner on down that made his task of rescuing Keefer and recovering the money far more difficult then he ever expected it to be. There's also the fact the the island is being used as a gulag like prison for political dissidents that are being kept in line and in a zombie like state by being shot up with drugs by the Commandant and his stooges running it.SPOILERS Acting as a drug dealer to gain entrance in Nvevo Cudiz Morgan guns down those in charge and starts a major prison revolt with the hundreds of junkies imprisoned there crashing out. It's during the massive jailbreak that the man who framed Morgan his former army buddy Sal Dekker Joseph Sirola who had his face altered with massive plastic surgery pops up trying to retrieve the stolen cash that Morgan recovered that he framed Morgan for.

I drove 300 miles to see the Premiere in Huntington two days ago and the audience actually clapped during certain scenes laughed quite a few times and there wasn't a dry eye in the house at the end. Though it was extremely poignant for us West Virginians because there were people in the audience whose family members died in that horrible plane crash in 1970 and one of my high school friends was actually there at the crash site with her father who was a State Trooper and I know other people who lost someone. However aside from all that this movie is extremely uplifting. When you are faced with such a horrendous tragedy as losing 75 people 55 of whom were members of your football team with only a handful of players left as well as the head coach and family members of the football players and other university faculty etc. it is completely devastating! I remember seeing scenes of the crash on TV and it was horrible. And then to rebuild a team from scratch when no one even wanted to coach the Thundering Herd Marshall's football team? That's totally amazing! And the way they went about it was ingenious! I didn't know a lot of the details of what happened after the crash or how hard it was to rebuild the team because I was 5 years old at the time but the directorproducer McG the writer and all the actors really give you a sense of the horrendous loss that my hometown experienced and how they really did rise from the ashes to honor their teammates who perished on November 14 1970. Even if you're not a sports fan this movie shows the indelible spirit of the human condition and what you can accomplish if you really give 110. Matthew McConauhey Anthony Mackie and Matthew Fox and the entire cast gave absolutely incredible performances and after the film ended Matt M and Matt Fox were both so choked up they could barely speak. And I guarantee that people who are not a little emotional after watching this film then those folks didn't see what I sawan OscarWinning film whether it gets nominated or not!

He displays courage and perseverance and makes sacrifices with a career move that could throw him out of his beloved profession head football coaching forever.

	schema:reviewBody "I went to watch the movie here in New York State. I absolutely loved the movie as did my entire family. I cried a lot but also laughed here and there. The movie was well done with only a few little things I noticed that were changed but overall it was very true to the story I grew up with and the facts I know.Matthew McConaughey and Matthew Fox did a wonderful job in their parts. I was quite impressed with every actor in the movie actually they all did a fantastic job. McG did a great job in bringing the story to the screen. You were there in that time and during the tragedy and felt what Huntington went through.As I left the movie I thought about the ones who died in the plane crash and cried again. For those of you who haven't seen the movie or know the story this isn't just a story about loosing a football team. The crash also claimed members of the football staff and prominent people of the town of Huntington. The other players in other sports lived in the dorms with the football players who perished. They felt the impact when returning to school and all those faces now gone from their halls. The staff was down to almost nothing. The citizens that died included doctors lawyers a car dealership owner dentista council member for Huntington and radio announcers for the herd. So you can see this impacted the town in a way most won't or don't understand. If you watch the movie you can see how it effects everyone. I would like to now take a moment to remember those who passed .................................................................. We will never forget you.In the end this movie is about moving on dealing with your grief or loss and how to live again. How as to rise above the ashes and move forward as it is said in the movie.I think people of 20 years of age and older will love this movie. I ran into several people of these age ranges that asked me questions and told of how they were going to tell their friends to go see the movie as well. I hope this movie touches and shows everyone how to rise from the ashes and move forward. In today's world of tragedies this is a movie that will touch you if you have dealt with a tragedy yourself. So I think several people will be able to relate to this movie and find it inspiring.Being a Huntington native I will always bleed green. GO HERD!!!! We Are ......................................... Marshall.".

	onyx:emotionText "I went to watch the movie here in New York State. I absolutely loved the movie as did my entire family. I cried a lot but also laughed here and there. The movie was well done with only a few little things I noticed that were changed but overall it was very true to the story I grew up with and the facts I know.Matthew McConaughey and Matthew Fox did a wonderful job in their parts. I was quite impressed with every actor in the movie actually they all did a fantastic job. McG did a great job in bringing the story to the screen. You were there in that time and during the tragedy and felt what Huntington went through.As I left the movie I thought about the ones who died in the plane crash and cried again. For those of you who haven't seen the movie or know the story this isn't just a story about loosing a football team. The crash also claimed members of the football staff and prominent people of the town of Huntington. The other players in other sports lived in the dorms with the football players who perished. They felt the impact when returning to school and all those faces now gone from their halls. The staff was down to almost nothing. The citizens that died included doctors lawyers a car dealership owner dentista council member for Huntington and radio announcers for the herd. So you can see this impacted the town in a way most won't or don't understand. If you watch the movie you can see how it effects everyone. I would like to now take a moment to remember those who passed .................................................................. We will never forget you.In the end this movie is about moving on dealing with your grief or loss and how to live again. How as to rise above the ashes and move forward as it is said in the movie.I think people of 20 years of age and older will love this movie. I ran into several people of these age ranges that asked me questions and told of how they were going to tell their friends to go see the movie as well. I hope this movie touches and shows everyone how to rise from the ashes and move forward. In today's world of tragedies this is a movie that will touch you if you have dealt with a tragedy yourself.

	schema:reviewBody "I was lucky enough to see an advanced screening of 'We Are Marshall' for audience research purposes therefore being part of the first audience in Britain to see the film.We were given a brief plot description when offered the tickets which didn't interest me to be honest I was more interested in seeing a free film! So when I went to see it I didn't know what to expect just that apparently it is supposed to be very good and quite emotional.I was pleased to see that it managed to live up to that as coming out of the cinema I felt it managed to stand by what I heard in being a very good film in fact I would go so far as to say brilliant. Staying behind for a quick discussion about the film for research purposes two people including myself rated the film as 'excellent' four rated it 'very good' and two somewhat miserable and stubborn people rated it 'good'.In my opinion the film manages to portray the death of the football team in a tasteful and respectful way showing the emotions of the characters in the way the town cared for the team. However shortly after the plane crash I felt that the film stumbled into a very slow and boring corner. Luckily about twenty minutes later the film manages to pick up very well. I found the remaining hour of the film very enjoyable and emotional with a few humorous lines from Matthew McConaughey.I was also very pleased to see how well Matthew Fox managed starring in a feature film. Being only fifteen my only knowledge of Fox is Jack form 'Lost'. I feel that he managed to play the character of Red very well  very quickly in the film the role of Jack was soon forgotten.The ending to the film is done very well and manages to keep you in suspense despite a quite predictable result. I was also quite surprised how little knowledge of the game football is needed. Being English I can't say I have ever seen a game of 'American' Football let alone understand the rules  I found myself thoroughly enjoying the action packed games despite knowing nothing of the sport.All in all in my opinion this is a very very good film which I strongly recommend. As said I found a part of the film rather dull but felt 'We Are Marshall' delivered a second half so good I soon forgot about it.Go see this film!".

	schema:reviewBody "I was taken from the moment it started crying within the first few minutes. I definitely cried more than I thought I would but I also laughed and cheered. It is truly an all inclusive movie. I have herd this story on many occasions throughout my life but I still feel that learned some things by watching the movie. I know that not all of it was historically accurate but there are always things that Hollywood has to add to make things more interesting. I did notice a few mistakes but only a couple and they were things that a movie critic at heart or someone from Huntington would notice lucky for me I am both. I was definitely impressed with the way my hometown was personified. Most films portray West Virginia as nothing but poor redneck hillbillies but this movie has made a difference. I feel they really showed Huntington for what it is. The most touching moment for me involved our favorite rival...WVU. I do not know if it actually happened but it took my breath away when I saw it. I won't tell you what it is but you'll know when you see it. I was completely consumed during this movie. I was incredibly impressed with Matthew McConaughey and Matthew Fox's performances. These men WERE our coach and asst. coach. The only thing that distracted me was the local connections to some of the extras in the film. Other than that I was completely sucked in. I don't want to give anything away because I want you to experience it for yourself but I promise to go see with all of my friends no matter how many times that takes. Most people I know have told me that I am the biggest Marshall fan they know and I hope that is true because this is my passion my pride. I hope that those of you who aren't as familiar with our history will learn some things and will be touched by the story. It is a wonderful movie. I highly recommend it to everyone. So go see it on Dec 22nd and enjoy! Don't forget to bring tissues or grab some napkins at the concession stand like we did.Kelli WE ARE MARSHALL!!! 4 ever!".

Everyone I've spoken to that is a WVU student or fan had no idea that happened nor did anyone from Huntington. Very Emotional on many levels and I thought the writers producers and director really did the town of Huntington some justice by making it as real as possible and not hollywoodville. There were some things that you could tell were thrown in there to make the story more dramatic but the story was dramatic from the very beginning. You should really waste the 7 bucks to see this one....cause its absolutely worth it.".

At that point the film shifts gears as Matthew McConaughey is brought in to rebuild the team and be its coach. A feel good movie thats more about rebuilding the cracked soul of a community than football though football is front and center this is a movie that works because of the characters we care about them so we care about the story.

We Are Marshall is an uplifting true story about how faith and courage can overcome difficult circumstances. The movie is not about some great team that wins the Big Game and overplayed sports miracles its about how a football team a university and a town experiences unimaginable tragedy and how the efforts of Coach Jack Lengyel helped the town cope with their terrible loss. McConaughey is a little over the top as Lengyel but all his performance does not detract from the story. McG actually did a very good job directing with certain scenes like the plane crash the governor's meeting and the last play and deserves some credit for a job well done for once. Many movies are often not dramatic enough or emotional enough We Are Marshall might actually be a little too dramatic and heart wrenching it is extremely difficult watching this movie for the first time to not cry at least once. Please ignore the opinions of the critics for once and give this film a chance it is absolutely worth it.".

I was surprised that Matthew McConaughey was able to play a role as important as this one. But he played as he should have the coach that would not stop and keep pushing his team to the top to give the town and school and kids something good for a change. I also thought Matthew Fox played good coming off such roles as Lost. Every scene in this movie is a good performance and gives you something to think about. And everyone plays there part as if they are the real people from that town.There is a good lesson taught in this movie to never give up no matter how bad things get you can always refurbish yourself. This is a good movie to bring your kids to it is not scary but it will be sad at how realistic they made it seem. Also it is another good sports football genre movie along side Remember The Titans and Rudy. So I recommend you to bring your family to this movie and you will not be disappointed at the least. I give this movie a 7 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " We Are Marshall Is A Fine Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Seeing We Are Marshall this past weekend in Los Angeles was a film we were anxious to attend mainly because I am from Huntington born and raised attended Marshall for 2 semesters myself and personally knew 3 people who lost their lives in the crash. I was at home watching the tube on that eventful cold November evening when the news service flashed the story. The film brought back a lot of memories and I learned quite a few things that I wasn't aware of how Marshall it's coaches and the team's resurrection of the football program.My review is unbiased and not influenced in any way because I was from the city. First off I was not actually expecting the film to be as good as I thought it would be. WB and their crew did an excellent job telling the story working in the city and highlighting the action.WAM brought out real emotion cheers and tears for us and it was very uplifting and exciting to see a brand new college freshman football team have the spirit and heart to move forward and pursue their dream to compete again rather than just give up and sit on the sidelines. I could think of no better actors for this part other than Matthew Fox or Matthew McConaughey to play the roles of the coaches. They had the coach persona down pat. Although I am more aware of McConaughey's work than Fox's I think this role was one of MM best. He had the wit the charm the positive direction and inspiration to motivate a new team to go to the top and win even though the team was basically started from scratch. He was tough but compassionate wise and street smart rational but realistic about the expectations of a totally new team who were very inexperienced and contemplating if they had a chance to even win a game.Reading many reviews from a variety of sources since the film was released I found most of them encouraging and recommendations to see the production. What amused me however were the critics less than pleased that this was just another football movie. Well of course it was a film about college football. That is certainly obvious what else could it have been? The characters were developed consistently as time and script allowed and seeing the team go through their workouts venting their frustrations and emotions was a bit enlightening for us anyway.When Marshall played Xavier in their first season I think that was the real highlight of the movie. It pushed my righton buttons to the max! There were other things that were great in the film that brought back a variety of memories about Marshall and their place in football history. Of course despite the fact that I have first hand knowledge and some personal experiences realistically related to the film you don't have to be from the town to see a very uplifting true and inspiring story.Go out and see the film for yourselves and tell us what you think. I give it 4.5 stars out of 5".

	schema:headline " Pudovkin delivers political punch with primitive sound";
	schema:reviewBody "A fascinating document of the great Pudovkin and his first sound film. Pudovkin also a great Russian montagisttheorist like Eisenstein is usually more accessible in his films. Pudovkin in his End of Saint Petersburg as well focuses on single workingman characters while Eisenstein films are usually more concerned with larger issues of class composition and space and focus on historical figures bigger than life Nevsky Ivan the Terrible.Deserter follows the trek of a German worker who decides he can't keep working after a strike is called at his shipyard to feed his family and for the continued glory of his homeland Germany. Torn between hunger and solidarity for his fellow workers he finally is sent to Russian to learn some lessons in socialism and comes back  not a deserter but a hero. He's the seed of a new Socialist unity among the workers. The two most interesting aspects of this film is that it has a German striker as the lead protagonist probably allowing Pudovkin to show his hero having doubts about the cause more easily without getting in trouble with the authorities and also the use of sound.It's very primitive with sound cutting in only when needed for dialog or sound effects for emphasis. It reminds me of the sound version of Hitchcock's Blackmail which has a similarly uncertain feel to when and how to use sound. For the record generally Hitch nails it and advanced the art tremendously. Image's DVD print has missing frames every so often and black leader is edited in to keep the soundtrack in sync an annoying tactic when black flashes pepper some scenes. Pudovkin is also flirting with waytooquick flashcuts akin to Dziga Vertov's work.Nevertheless Deserter is powerful agitprop cinema from one of the Russian masters. Its political force is driven home by following a worker truly torn by unfair circumstances to the point of abandoning his fellow workers and family. It humanizes the struggle many Russian political filmmakers and montagists tried to capture in their important work in the 20s and 30s.Until a cleanedup print or carefully trimmed and retimed one can be produced and released Russian film aficionados should not miss this film.".

The plot for one after the strike of German dock workers is broken by owners and police they decide to send a delegation to the Motherland to be taught about revolutionary practice. The camera physics most pertinently and as striking as ever the eye wrestling control of images from bourgeois reality to assemble a new world. But there is something else here for the first time.There is sound. The eye is no longer mute but singing.Now when sound was finally introduced it was enough that an extra texture gave depth to the illusion of moving images. The effort was and continues to be for realism. It was noted very early on that good sound renders the whole thing uniquely alive and vibrant which is a true and tested notion taught to aspiring filmmakers. We may not fully appreciate the effect but take away sound and it all becomes strangely unreal  dreams are soundless. Normally in films sound is employed as a ballast and good sound usually means a detailed background a rich carpet to walk on. Not so for the Soviets.The main experiment is controlled agitated hearing. Pudovkin had theorized about it in the same manner as film ought to work film sound should facilitate rhythm musicality. This means that it is no longer a natural extension that corresponds with a view but is continuously relocated realigned repurposed shifting often independent of images. As workers tirelessly pound away at the steel hull of a ship the blistering barrage of their thrusts is a little outoffocus. Disembodied voices scream at a rally as though collectively produced and facilitated by each furious cut. There are stretches of pure silence without any reassuring ambiance from surrounding sounds.As with film syntax of these guys the effort has been largely to read the radical experiment as avantgarde exercise independent of ideological fervor here presaging musique concrete. We can do better.Musique concrete just so happens to have cinematic roots in Epstein. Epstein rested on the discovery of a modern world that was only possible because the eye could float in unique ways with the advent of the camera. Internal views were possible granted by these hitherto unknown uncanny flows. The Soviets were equally radical but committed soldiers.Note what Kuleshov did in the famous effect named after him. He took for effect the most iconic face of preRevolutionary Russia and exhibited that it was in fact empty. Point being this every notion is formed in the space leading up to the eye and by gaps in perception. You need not control the flow merely the gaps. Montage was invented. So when Pudovkin is showing a young communist girl intruding with syncopated yells in the policed harmony of bourgeois narrative rendered with symphonic soft music to accompany the orderly traffic of luxurious automobiles under the austere gaze of a traffic warden and is finally arrested by police thus silenced from the soundtrack he is very cleverly pointing to the fact that conventional reality is a broadcast that you control. To usurp control away from the official channel means a struggle a bloody fight. Pudovkin's musicality  on top of the visual eye  is hence atonal dissonant disharmonic implying imperfect nature unfinished process.Oh the montage is astonishing and on par with anything Eisenstein did. But I will cherish this as one of the most important films for sound alone and I'm so stoked I will be surveying more of these early Soviet sound films. And a parting irony to further cement why these films ought not to be museum exhibits for comfortable appreciation. The film depicts German struggles in the early 30's asserting as main enemies of the revolution the Social Democrats. This was the Party line from Moscow and continues to be in most cases. German elections of '32 gave the combined Left  communist and socialdemocrat  222 seats just 8 short of Hitler. His enemies divided Hitler carried the election. Four years later he commissioned from Riefenstahl the broadcast of a new national identity.".

Sure it's pretty unbelievable but so are most movies out there.  Also the film has a solid car chase scene at the end which is a solid way to end a fine film.  The opening heist scene is also pretty good as well a good way to start the film.  Also the shootout at the grocery store is very funny as well as several other scene's.  Highly Recommended  for anyone who likes actioncomedies.  45".

The story was quite unique having a thief pretend to be a police detective determined to collect a jewel left behind from a previous heist. To make the plot better and more interesting the writers make Lawrence's character in charge of the burglary division. Wilson didn't really add to the story and seemed to fill a role of sidekick.

The diamond is stowed away in a building that is going up. Good idea and 'quick' thinking for him. Although he gets busted anyway for breaking into the jewelry store. He does two years in the pen. He gets set free. Now he is feeling fine! He goes back to check out his girl and she has gone from a size petite to Esther Role. This does not sit well with her either when he lets her know about the obvious change in girth. The rock of Gibraltar diamond that he stole in his hiding place is not quite what he remembers it to be. He is a con that is free standing in front of the new police building where his little stolen article is awaiting his return. Now complications play out bigger. He has what looks like a torette's syndrome breakdown in front of the building and some officers out on break while cars pass by and on lookers see him freaking. He has to come up with a plan to get this job done. And considering where this is all taking place it had better be brilliant. I won't give away what happens next but this is a slick well crafted comedy with the likes of Luke Wilson and William Forsythe who has been in a number of outstanding films both comedy and action and dramatic roles. There is always a bunch of stuff going on and it is a lot of crazyhalf planned out funky Martin on the loose fun.

	schema:reviewBody "BLUE STREAK 1999 Starring Martin Lawrence Luke Wilson Peter Greene David Chappelle Graham Beckel Director Les Mayfield   93 minutes    Rated PG13 for language and violence By Blake FrenchMartin Lawrence was born to star in movies like Blue Streak a film with much energy and wit both elements he has coming out of his ears. The film has no major flaw in it. There are no structural problems dialogue issues disruptive subplots characterization uncertainty or tedious nuggets found in it. The filmmakers take advantage of Lawrence being in the movie and have lots of fun with both him and the plotthings that make this comedy worthy of a minimal recommendation. The film opens with four jewel thieves Miles Logan Deacon Eddie and Tulley constructing a heist in the middle of a dark cold night attempting to steal a large diamond worth millions. Miles and Eddie sneak in the building that beholds the valuable rock from the roof using a steady rope to lure them down through the elevator shaft to their destination a security safe located a few floors down. Deacon stays above assuring Eddie and Miles' safely while Tulley stands watch below in the getaway car.Then something goes wrong. While the team of bandits do indeed succeed in breaking through the buildings security and swindle the diamond when Miles and Eddie reach Deacon on the roof however  he states that he is too greedy to spilt the value of the gem four ways thus killing Eddie and attempting to finish off Miles who is holding on to the jewel but before Deacon has the chance the police arrive and off goes Tulley in the getaway car leaving Deacon and Miles no way to escape except to flee to a construction site nearby. There Deacon manages to avoid being arrested by the cops but never gets his hand on the gem. However Miles keenly hides the jewel in the duct of this developing building and makes note of where he hides it. As he arrested by the police he vows to return for the secret treasure after his prison sentence is upwhenever that may be.Two years pass. Miles is happy to once again be a free citizen. He returns to his girlfriend who after never visiting him once in the two years he spent in jail dumps him without a second thought. Miles is not too depressed however for he still has seventeen million dollars waiting for his arrival at the old contraction site where he hid it. The problem that exact constriction site is now finished. It is a brand spanking new police headquarters! Miles tries desperately to enter the building only to be rejected by security every time. That is however until one of his old buddies manufactures a false police identification for him thus allowing him to break into the building and search for his beauty.  This is when he becomes involved with a crime bust that leads the police chief to believe that Miles is a professional experienced cop who is then partnered up with novice detective Carlson Luke Wilson to solve a criminal case. From here on out the film runs from high energy and action packed excitement to clumsy and funny stunts of Logan trying to undercover the dream he once had located in what is now his office building. Director Les Mayfield lets the film's  writers have a lot of fun with the plot. The setup is at shaky  and first a bit ridiculous but then propels the entire story following it though the problems it faces when the plot stumbles at times and forgets its purpose the Logan character still has reason to continue on the 17 million dollar jewel. The filmmakers do rely a bit much on that concept but for the most part the film stays clear from too many troubles. Just a few days ago I screened the horror thriller Stigmata and ended up not recommending it due to the fact that the film's scenes did not fit together to create a story possible to follow. While Blue Streak does fit together evenly and is distributive if the truth be know I would choose to see something with a little more depth like Stigmata than something as shallow as Blue Streak. But I feel that the majority of an audience goes to the movies for entertainment not for some deep disturbing messageif you're that kind of a moviegoer then Blue Streak is for you.Brought to you Columbia Pictures.".

Miles and Eddie sneak in the building that beholds the valuable rock from the roof using a steady rope to lure them down through the elevator shaft to their destination a security safe located a few floors down. Deacon stays above assuring Eddie and Miles' safely while Tulley stands watch below in the getaway car.Then something goes wrong. While the team of bandits do indeed succeed in breaking through the buildings security and swindle the diamond when Miles and Eddie reach Deacon on the roof however  he states that he is too greedy to spilt the value of the gem four ways thus killing Eddie and attempting to finish off Miles who is holding on to the jewel but before Deacon has the chance the police arrive and off goes Tulley in the getaway car leaving Deacon and Miles no way to escape except to flee to a construction site nearby. There Deacon manages to avoid being arrested by the cops but never gets his hand on the gem. However Miles keenly hides the jewel in the duct of this developing building and makes note of where he hides it. As he arrested by the police he vows to return for the secret treasure after his prison sentence is upwhenever that may be.Two years pass. Miles is happy to once again be a free citizen. He returns to his girlfriend who after never visiting him once in the two years he spent in jail dumps him without a second thought. Miles is not too depressed however for he still has seventeen million dollars waiting for his arrival at the old contraction site where he hid it. The problem that exact constriction site is now finished. It is a brand spanking new police headquarters! Miles tries desperately to enter the building only to be rejected by security every time. That is however until one of his old buddies manufactures a false police identification for him thus allowing him to break into the building and search for his beauty.  This is when he becomes involved with a crime bust that leads the police chief to believe that Miles is a professional experienced cop who is then partnered up with novice detective Carlson Luke Wilson to solve a criminal case. From here on out the film runs from high energy and action packed excitement to clumsy and funny stunts of Logan trying to undercover the dream he once had located in what is now his office building. Director Les Mayfield lets the film's  writers have a lot of fun with the plot. The setup is at shaky  and first a bit ridiculous but then propels the entire story following it though the problems it faces when the plot stumbles at times and forgets its purpose the Logan character still has reason to continue on the 17 million dollar jewel. The filmmakers do rely a bit much on that concept but for the most part the film stays clear from too many troubles. Just a few days ago I screened the horror thriller Stigmata and ended up not recommending it due to the fact that the film's scenes did not fit together to create a story possible to follow. While Blue Streak does fit together evenly and is distributive if the truth be know I would choose to see something with a little more depth like Stigmata than something as shallow as Blue Streak. But I feel that the majority of an audience goes to the movies for entertainment not for some deep disturbing messageif you're that kind of a moviegoer then Blue Streak is for you.Brought to you Columbia Pictures.";

Sadly I still find his clowning funny!  I can't explain it.  Here the plot is no more than an excuse for many funny scenes with all the action brought together in a dramatic' climax!  However it is funny  even if it's very straightforward.  I imagine that if you hat Lawrence then you'll hate this but if you're in the mood for a simple nobrain comedy then you can rely on Lawrence to deliver just that.He actually quite good here  even if he's the same in every film he does the same shtick. It's also good to see Luke Wilson in it  even if he's got a role that is really beneath his talents although Greene is good. Really it's Lawrence's show and he does well but if you hate him then you'll hate this no matter what.Overall if you want a silly nobrain comedy then this is worth a shot but if Lawrence annoys you then don't even bother.".

He is treated as a savior of a department which has been on the hot seat of late due to its perceived incompetence.

Unfortunately he lacks the charisma and comic timing to carry a film as he is asked to do. It's seriously doubtful whether placed in more capable hands the picture could have been a success.

He hides the diamond in the airshaft of a neighbouring building and turns himself in. After two years he gets off and does what every human being would have done. Go for the diamond. Payday has arrived! Only to realise that were once was a deserted building there's now a police building. Lawrence tries different things to get in but finally he decides to steal a security card and dress up like a cop and just steal the diamond real subtle. But when he knocks down an escaping thief in the building there's no turning back. Everybody see's him as the new cop. The new detective. The big shot he even gets promoted to lead detective.Now picture this riduculous situation and Martin Lawrence together. What you get are very hilarious scene's. The story gets a little bit shallow at the end. The complete diamondangle has gone to the background a bit too much. Now the undertone for the choices Lawrence's character has to make are in the foreground. Good or Bad? Cop or Thief. But still it remains a awesome idea worked out into a pretty decent film with a lot of hilarious scenes.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE THIEF OF BAGDAD United Artists 1924 directed by Raoul Walsh is an original Arabian Nights fantasy that remains one of the most visually stunning of all silent films with trick photography and lavish sets compliments of William Cameron Menzies taking top form over anything else. Considering the time this was made with musical score and title cards taking place over spoken dialog this gives the impression of being made decades into the future in the days of advanced film technology. Then again this is 1924 running 150 minutes depending on the projection speed and a small wonder how audiences felt watching this lavish tale during its initial premiere focusing on mythical events set in The Dream City of the East. It was quite obvious then this was something never before presented on screen making the current products of director DW Griffith seem oldfashioned and out of date. Fortunately THE THIEF OF BAGDAD doesn't fall into that category and hopefully never will.It's star attraction Douglas Fairbanks having made a reputation for himself in costume swashbucklers previously appearing as Zorro Robin Hood and the leader of The Three Musketeers assumes another challenge an Arabian Nights Fantasy. Fairbanks is cast as The Thief no actual name given in the crowded city of Bagdad. Almost immediately the Thief barechested and sporting baggy pants resembling the bottom half of a pajama lives up to his title picking pockets stealing food from the ledge of a balcony and living by his philosophy What I want I take. The movie opens and closes with a Holy Man Charles Belcher raising his arm towards the glittering stars in the heavens spelling out Happiness Must Be Earned. In between those words the moral of the story is told to a young lad how this thief earned his happiness.Lengthly with some lulls THE THIEF OF BAGDAD never ceases to amaze. Compared to the 1940 Technicolor sound adaptation starring Sabu where both versions differ the sole focus being on fantasy with highlights being the flying carpet and a nasty villain. The Fairbanks version doesn't include what many would expect to see a genie from the magic lamp granting three wishes. It doesn't really matter because the 1924 production has enough magic and visual fantasies to go around. Fairbanks excels in his role by climbing a magic rope riding a winged horse across the clouds fighting underwater sea monsters and his battle with the valley of fore. The special effects reaches its climax where the thief materializes his army of thousands possibly millions from puffs of smoke entering the castle by wrapping himself with an invisible cloak whisking by his enemies. A magical tale brilliantly told full of surprises too plentiful to mention here.THE THIEF OF BAGDAD is Douglas Fairbanks' finest hours on screen. Aside from being in a far away land Doug resumes his athletic skills as in previous films ranging from visual stunts to his trademark smile. It's unlike anything he has ever done before and something that could only be accomplished on screen once. Reportedly the first million dollar production every penny of it shows on screen. How fortunate for THE THIEF OF BAGDAD not to have ever been the victim of neglect and put on the list among many titles as a lost film? How many lavish film productions such as this will never see the light again? The Douglas Fairbanks legend lives on with films such as this.A supporting cast of not so famous performers only Anna May Wong as the Mongol Slave did make a name for herself in future films up to the sound era. Julanne Johnston possibly a screen beauty that will never be known considering she spends the entire time with her face covered by a veil. Aside from Brandon Hurst Caliph and Noble Johnson the Indian Prince Sojin stands out in his spine chilling performance as the evil Mongol Prince.THE THIEF OF BADGAD was one of 13 feature films broadcast on the PBS 13week series The Silent Years 1971 hosted by Orson Welles. Before the start of the movie Welles talks about how the movie influenced him as a boy having seen it multiple times in the theater. Though its TV presentation runs 132 minutes missing footage would be restored in later years including the underwater sequence as the Thief encounters a harem of beautiful maidens the thief's battle with a prehistoric bird as well as his encounter with a living statue with foot long fingernails. Video copies since the 1980s were distributed in various ways. Companies carrying public domain titles at bargain prices would distribute this very long movie minus any type of music soundtrack. Other distributors namely Blackhawk contained organ scoring by Gaylord Carter while others had Thames Orchestration. THE THIEF OF BAGDAD has been available at different time lengths as well with the standard being 150 minutes. There have been others as Video Yesteryear to have distributed a print as long as three hours at correct silent speed. The KINO company includes what's been missing from numerous prints over the years that being the cast listing of actors in its conclusion. Aside from the wonders of video and current DVD THE THIEF OF BAGDAD which did get some exposure on American Movie Classics 1997 and Turner Classic Movies' Silent Sunday Nights hosted by Robert Osborne with Gaylord Carter organ scoring since September 10 2013 it's been presented on TCM accompanied by Carl Davis Orchestration from the Thames Video Collection.In closing THE THIEF OF BAGDAD is worthy screen entertainment for all ages and future generations to come. The thought of this to still be available and appreciated today would have made Fairbanks proud thus the moral of the story Happiness Must Be Earned. ".

	schema:headline " Long before tigers crouched and dragons hid...";
	schema:reviewBody "...Douglas Fairbanks brought grace and poetry to physical action on the movie screen. Fairbanks essentially invented the actionadventure movie genre known in his day as swashbucklers.      Thief of Bagdad was made in 1924 when Fairbanks was half way through the heyday of that part of his career.  He already had Zorro The Three Musketeers and Robin Hood behind him.  Thief was something of a departure however for it depended less on Fairbanks ability to dance his way though physical stunts than it did on the Arabian Nights tableau it presented on the screen.  And frankly nothing like it has every been done since.  Only Griffth's Intolerance created the same kind of feel and it was gritty and warlike where as Thief was a sort of wondrous dream about what it would be like to live by your wits go off and slay dragons and eventually win the hand of a princess by saving her father's kingdom.    Fairbanks was over 40 when he made this film and yet seems so perfectly suited for it that we forget his age.  He is the embodiment of the dashing hero.   But what almost overshadows him are the sets themselves. Designed by William Cameron Menzies they are beyond spectacular.  Almost every frame of this film is a work of art and of course the amazing thing is this was not done through computer animation. So skillful are the designs and the camerawork that it is almost impossible to tell where the sets stop and the matt paintings begin.   Credit for all this must also go to Fairbankswho wrote the script and produced the film.  Raoul Walsh's direction is also great although the film is a little long in some spots and would be aided by some skillful editing.   Fairbanks acting style seems today very much of the silent era yet at the same time there is always the feel of joyous celebration to it.  He was always something of the happy rogue or perhaps a guy who realized he was getting to make a living by playing in the world's most wonderful sandbox. He was blessed with good fortune and he knew it.   Of the others Julanne Johnston who plays the princess probably comes off the worst of the main characters.  She is beautifulbut comes off as little more than window dressing.  But cudos to the incredible Anna May Wong who plays the treacherous Mongol slave girl.  Wong's great beauty and strong screen presence allow her to steal almost every scene she is in. That Wong never got the chance to play many lead roles is one of the great tragedies of Hollywood history.".

And frankly nothing like it has every been done since.  Only Griffth's Intolerance created the same kind of feel and it was gritty and warlike where as Thief was a sort of wondrous dream about what it would be like to live by your wits go off and slay dragons and eventually win the hand of a princess by saving her father's kingdom.    Fairbanks was over 40 when he made this film and yet seems so perfectly suited for it that we forget his age.  He is the embodiment of the dashing hero.

It has all the typical adventurous action and comedy elements present to make this a great swashbuckling movie. Add to that Douglas Fairbanks in good shape and you have a classic unforgettable genre movie!Douglas Fairbanks is totally great in this one. He looks acts breaths eats like a real superstar. He handles all of the athletic action in the movie really well. It's not hard to see why this man was THE swashbuckling hero of the '20's.The movie is really great looking with many grand looking sets. Really great looking stuff! though obviously all fake. Something you would normally expect to see in a D.W. Griffith movie. The movie also has some silly looking but yet great early special effects toward the ending of the movie.The story has all the ingredients needed for such a genre movie as this one an heroic main character a love interest stereotypical villains and lots of fun and action. Especially toward the ending the movie starts to become greatly adventurous after a sort of slower middle and good first part. It's of course all rather simple and formulaic but this is also what makes the genre so great. You just always know what to expect. It's good simple fun that's professionally and well made that's also beautiful to look at.Also definitely fun to see how much of this movie was later used again in Disney's Aladdin. Some mostly action sequences are obviously almost directly copied.A great fun movie from swashbucklingspecialist director Raoul Walsh.910httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

But Douglas Fairbanks is certainly worth watching if you have any real interest in film.  He has so much charm and moves so fluidly that he captivates even when the special effects are well very 1920s.  Fairbanks does not so much act as he dances the role.  The costumes and sets by William Cameron Menzies are also spectacular.  I have watched this movie in the earlier DVD version and frankly it put me to sleep.  First a great deal of it was missing and so the story was choppy and hard to follow. Second the print quality was poor.  But the new Kino Fairbanks collection is a miracle of film restoration.  There is one section on this DVD that is poor quality compared to the others.  But since this is a section that I have never seen before to see it at all is wonderful.".

His energy and believability along with the interesting sets carry the first part of the movie.  The second half when Fairbanks and his rivals are sent off on their quests is full of adventure and fascinating detail.  It's done with plenty of creativity and also many lavish special effects most of which still work well.  The excitement level is built up nicely in leading up to the actionpacked finale.It's a movie that is both enjoyable and skillfully made.

In this choice however he was out of step with the majority of his comrades. 450 American motion picture critics selected The Thief of Bagdad as the year's Best Film!I have little to add. The only person who has any valid reason to complain is Snitz Edwards. Incorrectly billed in the credits as an evil associate he's nothing of the sort! Snitz figures mightily in the introductory sequences and the modus operandi of the plot but then abruptly disappears. The lovely Anna May Wong would also get my vote for more footage but at least she runs true to form right through the movie.Some people have complained about primitive special effects. Whilst it's true the effects range from the brilliant to the amateurish and even quaint this is a movie that has an abundance of heart a quality that most computergenerated 21st century films signally lack.As for the stupendous sets by William Cameron Menzies the superb cinematography by Arthur Edeson why hasn't someone written a book about Edeson's mindboggling career? After all he photographed at least twenty of the current top cult favorites and the magical acting by the athletic Fairbanks the scheming Sojin and the entrancing Miss Wong all not only contribute richly to the film's success but each actually presents a compelling reason for making this Thief of Bagdad an absolute mustsee!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Thief of Bagdad was my first introduction to Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and as first impressions go I've not been this impressed with an oldtime film star since I watched Fairbanks' cinematic successor Errol Flynn begin creating his own legend in Captain Blood.The imagination and power of the visual design of the sets by Raoul Walsh make a nice complement for Fairbanks' script. Having read some of the original material from Sir Richard Burton's unexpurgiated translation of the Arabian Nights that is the uncensored unwatereddown version that most of the general public is familiar with I can honestly say that while this story is in none of the tales I read it would have been a perfect fit within Scherazade's many fantastic tales of moral instruction. The language the situations the magical artifacts the transformation of a callow youth into a great if still wily and underhanded hero...they all so accurately reflect the atmosphere of those wondrous tales that I have read and enjoyed.As for Fairbanks himself well...is there any redblooded American boy who HASN'T wanted to be like him? Maybe the boys of today wouldn't recognize the name but five bucks says that they would definitely recognize the attitude and the style. Charming smart irresistable to women tough enough to take on the bad guys gifted with a physique that borders on the unbelievable...he's every boy's greatest heroic fantasy come true.All that said another reason The Thief of Bagdad is important AND fun is because it really marks the starting point for the modern genre of actionadventure films. The use of humor is extensive my favorite bit being Fairbank's method of touching a particular bush helping keep things from becoming TOO serious for it's own good. Then there's the use of special effects some very hokey by today's standards but probably stateoftheart for it's time and still very impressive considering the time period this film was made. There's also the touch of romance that helps sweeten the tone. Though subsequent offerings have not had as deft a touch as this film does this would be a logical beginning to that tradition. Finally there's the final confrontation between the protagonist and antagonist but I truly doubt that anyone has ever come up with a showdown that relied more on brains than brawn as this one.Don't let the age of this film offput you. Like it's inspiration it weaves Scherazade's song with a melody that has yet to be outdone though it has been matched during subsequent decades.".

She is beautifulbut comes off as little more than window dressing. But kudos to the incredible Anna May Wong who plays the treacherous Mongol slave girl. Wong's great beauty and strong screen presence allow her to steal almost every scene she is in. That Wong never got the chance to play many lead roles is one of the great tragedies of Hollywood history.".

Wong's great beauty and strong screen presence allow her to steal almost every scene she is in. That Wong never got the chance to play many lead roles is one of the great tragedies of Hollywood history.";

	schema:reviewBody "Really a 2 million dollar extravaganza the film has amazing art direction and production design by William Cameron Menzies that keeps this film visually interesting and the viewer spellbound for well over its two hour length! But it's not just the fantastic and virtually non stop special effects that elevate this film. The verve energy and smile of Douglas Fairbanks anchor the well told fantasy and its action. This was the 20s version of a 'blockbuster' with its editing scope and scale continuous action special effects and a fine fantasy storysomething not seen comparably again until the unleashing of 'Star Wars' 1977.There are a couple of slow spots the Thief's repentance scene and his first time alone with the Princess go on a little too long but so much else happens in the film that these momentary slowdowns are easily overlooked. The Princess herself Julanne Johnston far from being the entrancing mystical vision who captivates and transforms the Thief is unfortunately almost a cypher since her face is hidden behind a veil for much of the movie and she's not staggeringly beautiful. And why does it take so long for the Thief to ride to the rescue when the Evil Mongol Prince has taken over Bagdad when he could have flown there on Pegasus the Winged Horse? To heighten the dramatic tension of course!We also get the bonus of seeing Anna May Wong in her first 'big' role so beautifully slinky as the evil Mongol slave  spy. Her major silent film was the British 'Piccadilly' 1929. Sojin Kamiyama played the Evil Mongol Prince with great menace and evil eyes. You can see him in 'Seven Samurai' 1954 and the first 'Musashi' movie 'Mushasi Miyamoto' 1954 with Toshiro Mifune.What really impresses is the ending in which the Thief uses his magic dust to create tens of thousands of soldiers out of the earth to defeat the Mongols' take over of Bagdad as he then sweeps up the Princess in his invisible cloak and flies off on the magic carpet with her to live happily ever after. This is the kind of Saturday afternoon at the movies ending that would get audiences cheering even today. Film histories note that after the end of the premiere showing of the film in New York Fairbanks as the producer writer and star leaped up on the stage to thunderous applause. Well deserved! This film passed my test of time test as my 8 and 10 year old grandchildren thoroughly enjoyed watching it. They clearly recognized its similarity to their Disney version of 'Aladdin' 1992. The great DVD KINO version has a new soundtrack with hints of 'Scheherazade' that adds to the thrills of this wonderful movie. Old silent movies are boring? Not this one! I give it an 8.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is certainly one of the best examples of the greatness of the medium now called 'silent film.' There are truly wondrous moving images here created by means of human actors stage techniques and primitive FX made to tell a very satisfying mythic story. If you could add audible dialogue to this movie it would only be a detriment. Douglas Fairbanks was the top heroic movie actor of his day and he made this at the peak of his powers. He studied ballet for some months prior to the filming and you can see the result in his leaps and other characteristic feats. There musical quality to his body movements that make the action sequences in this movie unlike anything else and it goes well with the facial pantomime of the silent cinema. I saw a restored cut of this film on PBS TV in the late 1980's with the original color tints and an orchestral soundtrack composed of rearranged bits of RimskyKorsekov's 'Scheherazade.' The Scheherazade material works perfectly with this material not only because it helps establish the magical world in which our story transpires but because it goes perfectly with Fairbanks' balletstyle action sequences. Also Scheherazade is one of my all time favorite pieces of music. Over 20 years after seeing this film Scheherazade still conjures up images from this film.The FX are not of course realistic by modern standards. But they nonetheless produce amazing and memorable moving images and have a magical or dreamlike quality that is better suited to this material than CGI. In fact the primitive FX have a handcrafted feel complimenting the physicality of Fairbanks' performance and serving as a tonic to the rubbery CGI that contaminate so many modern films. This is a good movie to see if you think you have any potential of enjoying a silent movie andor if you are fond of fantasy and the mythic. Hopefully it will inspire you to noble things.".

Melies Voyage To The Moon Frankenstein Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde Call of Cthulhu Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari Phantom Of The Opera Metropolis Ring Des Nibelungen all fantastical movies dealing with the supernatural sciencefiction horror and fantasy. In the 1920's handsome and very physical actor Douglas Fairbanks ranked among the top actors with Lon Cheney and Charlie Chaplin. Fairbanks had played the heroic adventurer in Robin Hood and Three Musketeers all roles which called for physical stamina stuntwork and charisma. In Thief of Bagdad he portrays a nameless devilmaycare thief from Bagdad during the mythical Arabian Nights days. Think Aladdin from Disney. He survives life by taking what he wants and living in the streets. Before long he becomes involved in a quest to win the hand of the beautiful princess Julanne Johnston. She favors the Thief when he has disguised himself as Prince Ahmed but there are other suitors competing for her hand in marriage among them a Mongol Prince Sojin a Persian Prince Mathilde Comont and an Indian prince Noble Johnson. The Princess sends them on a quest to find a treasure so rare and valuable that she would deign to marry he who brings it to her. It's of course our hero The ThiefPrince who marries the Princess but not after fighting intrigue baddies and experiencing a fantastical adventures in remote mythical locations among them under the sea where he is tempted by mermaids and The Citadel of the Moon. This silent film was the first of its kind not in its theme of adventure but in its stunning visuals and effects. The production and art design is by the esteemed William Cameron Menzies whose impressive career in Hollywood was long he would design production for Gone With The Wind in 1939. It's a masterpiece. Every detail brings to life this magical Arabian Nights world. This is the most colorful of any black and white silent film ever made. For night scenes the color is tinted evening blue casting shadows on palace walls and city alleys. The underwater scene is also tinted to stand for the greenishblue sea. The castle is itself amazing with huge flowery doors and walls. Audiences must have been amazed at how realistic everything appeared even how the Princes are able to fly on a magic carpet or The Thief make himself invisible or how The Princess could see through a magic globe. As for the acting it's typical of the silent era school of acting which means exaggerated facial expressions and dramatic body language and while it appears laughable and corny today it was standard acting in its day. Even so the plot is strong even if the characters are onedimensional goodevil. There is a little more to the acting though for example Asian actress Anna May Wong in the role of the Princess' traitorous slave girl. Unbeknownst to the Princess the Mongol slave girl is in league with the Mongol Prince. Obviously harboring hatred for her conquerors the people of Bagdad including the Princess herself she plots to help the Mongol Prince succeed in becoming King of Bagdad. When Plan A fails Plan B suddenly takes shape  invasion of Bagdad by the Mongol armies. Because the film is quite long and slowmoving it has the feel of an epic another popular genre in silent films The Birth Of A Nation The Ten Commandments Ring Des Nibelungen. This is a treasure of a silent film often overshadowed by more famous silent films of the 20's but it is a document in cinema of the early 20's and should be studied in film school. Douglas Fairbanks was already well into his middleage but he was still doing his own physical stuntwork and femalepleasing in his looks and charms. This is a sensational unforgettable film and a must see for devotees of silent film and fantasy films.".

	schema:reviewBody "I happened to see The Thief Of Bagdad on a VHS that had a narration by Douglas Fairbanks Jr. He said that of all the films that his father did this was the junior Fairbanks's favorite. Although the senior Fairbanks in closeups might have looked a little long in the tooth to be playing the young thief who wooed and won a princess he hadn't lost a bit of athleticism that his films were known for.The Tales of the Arabian Nights was the inspiration for this The Thief Of Bagdad and the more familiar sound version that Alexander Korda produced and shot here in the USA as well due to wartime conditions in Great Britain. Here Douglas Fairbanks essentially plays both parts of the two heroes that Sabu and John Justin play in the Korda version. Fairbanks is the professional thief who can steal just about anything big or small. When he steals a magic rope and climbs into the Caliph's Palace and beholds the sight of the princess Julanne Johnston there will be no other woman for him.But the Bagdad Caliphate is not an upwardly mobile society not for the poor but honest and not for a criminal. Still he tries to pass himself off as a prince and he's in competition with three other princes for her hand.One of them Japanese actor Rojin is the Mongol prince and if he can't woo the Caliphate in alliance he'll steal the kingdom with his army which he starts infiltrating in Bagdad. Fairbanks ultimately can't go through with the deception though he charms the princess. She sneaks him out of the palace before what happens to upwardly mobile aspirants in that society happens to Fairbanks.But holy man Charles Belcher says that Fairbanks has a future with the princess and he's put through a lot of tests before he can wed. And of course in typical bravura Fairbanks style he puts the Mongols to flight with an army created out of nowhere.By this time Fairbanks Mary Pickford Charlie Chaplin and D.W. Griffith had gotten United Artists up and running as the production company for their films which it was primarily doing in those early days. Producer Fairbanks spared no expense in creating the sets for The Thief Of Bagdad the sets look like something Cecil B. DeMille or D.W. Griffith might have done. I wouldn't be surprised if Griffith took an unofficial hand here.The sets were created of course by young William Cameron Menzies in one of his earliest films costumes by Mitchell Leisen and the director was Raoul Walsh all of them getting big boosts in their careers from Douglas Fairbanks. With all that legendary talent in its salad days no wonder The Thief Of Bagdad holds up as well as it does today.I also must comment on the orchestrations of themes of RimskyKorsakov by the London Symphony Orchestra. Theater organs are usually good for silent films but this one really calls for an orchestra so vast is the sweep of this silent classic.At two and half hours plus The Thief Of Bagdad runs longer than most silent films did by far. Still even today it casts a spell over the viewer.".

Visually it is spectacular especially in the splendid cinematography and the colourful sets. The story is still as magical as ever with the action witty and cleverly choreographed with Fairbanks doing his own stunts and doing it so energetically and the fantasy elements from the magic rope and the winged horse to the underwater sea monsters and the valley battle are enough to enchant you. True the film is lengthy and may contain a couple of lulls in the pacing but when Fairbanks the visuals and the adventure and fantasy elements of the story were so good this was hardly a problem for me. The characters could be seen as genre clichs but fun and likable ones at that as well as endearingly performed. Of the performances faring weakest was Julanne Johnston beautiful but on the bland side. The rest of the cast more than make amends with Douglas Faribanks really the epitome of dashing heroic and charmingmade even more so with his trademark smile Sojin deliciously malevolent and Anna May Wong entrancing. Overall there are a couple of debits but the great things overshadow those completely and make for a sensational film. 9.510 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a funny thing about watching silent movies in the 21st Century even silent movies that have been well restored. Especially in the case of fantasy films like The Thief of Baghdad and others like it that require special effects it is not just that the special effects look archaic compared to the CGI effects of today. There are a lot of things modern day audiences have to get used to such as the fact that spoken dialogue doesn't appear in subtitles unless it absolutely has to. If two people are arguing and no words appear on the screen you really have to make your best guess as to what they could be saying.There's also the case of timing. The Thief of Baghdad runs 2 hours and 19 minutes and it's safe to say that if the film had sound dialogue too the running time would probably be cut down by at least 20 minutes. There are also the other hangups of silent movies such as the movement of the characters being too quick and how some of the actors and actresses look very strange and out of the ordinary. The lack of color added to the overall darkness of the film due to lack of lighting also is a deterrent to watching these very very old films that were made when my grandparents were infants literally.If you are not a fan of old movies you really have to keep those things in mind when watching The Thief of Baghdad for the first time. The fact is that this film's audience was probably people who didn't go to the movies often and were still amazed by the novelty of moving pictures.Keeping in mind all I said about why most silent films have not exactly stood the test of time is The Thief of Baghdad a good movie? For many reasons yes and it should be watched by people who are fans of action and fantasy movies because this really paved the way for what CGI and other special effects sciences only made better in the years to come.The movie tells a good story although one that sputters and stalls a few times in the first 30 minutes. Douglas Fairbanks the epitome of the ultra masculine hero plays the thief here who goes by no other name. You see him steal to make a living in many clever ways. In fact the first five minutes of the film are incredibly entertaining the way he manages to pickpocket wealthy patrons and effortlessly fling his way up to a balcony with just a long rope and a donkey.The story really begins though when the thief disguises himself as a prince and attempts to woo the princess. He does successfully though he is filled with guilt about deceiving her. Long story short he is put on a quest to obtain a rare gift for the princess in competition with three other princes with whom the princess wants no company. Whereas the three actual princes rely on their servants to get them their gifts the thief goes alone on a long journey. He has help along the way as to where to go but he really does the grunt work himself.Of course the filmmakers did nothing to make Fairbanks look Arabian or Iraqi but that's just one of the ways you really have to suspend disbelief in this film. Fortunately The Thief of Baghdad didn't make the same mistake that Birth of a Nation did in portraying racist stereotypes whether or not that was a mistake really depends on the viewer. Instead of making white men and women into embarrassing stereotypes this film used actual actors of Asian African and I'm guessing middle Eastern descent. They probably had the artistic liberty to make such politically incorrect assertions about those in the Middle East but they thankfully avoided it in this film.Being a moviegoer who you could say has been spoiled by CGI special effects I actually found myself wondering how some of the special effects in this movie were pulled off. There are scenes where a boy mysteriously reappears on a rope that is hanging in mid air a giant scorpion attacks the thief as he searches for the lost treasure and a magic carpet flies over the city of Baghdad. I was amazed to find myself saying Given what the filmmakers had to work with how did they do that? How did they edit the film so that that particular effect worked? If you have that sort of wonderment out of a moviegoer who just went to see Avatar you've got a good movie.The movie was also probably shot on a studio lot but the set design is so detailed with its tall buildings and plants carefully placed in the makeshift Baghdad that there are few indications of such a location. The movie was probably a big hit at its time because so much artistic effort was put into bringing this Arabian Knights tale to life. These scenes within Baghdad made me wish more that the film was in color but I would not settle for colorization. That process would have ruined the film.So The Thief of Baghdad is a bit slow at times and some scenes require the point of view of someone who has never heard of television. Still the movie told a good story the special effects were aweinspiring considering its time period and the message of the film is something to take away Happiness Must Be Earned. These words are written in the sky as an old man is sitting in the Arabian desert presumably telling a young boy this story. This scene identical in the beginning and end of the movie go against the traditional rule of Show don't tell but the scene is still a very artistic and beautiful way to bookmark such a film.".

Unfortunately for this film though the remake starring Sabu was an even better film and was overshadowed a bit because of this.Douglas Fairbanks Sr. plays the thief. He is a real scoundrel and not particularly likable...that is until he meets the woman of his dreams the princess. He vows to straighten up his life after he introduces himself to herbeginning by telling her the awful truth about his life. Despite this the princess is headoverheels in love with himthanks to his fulfilling a prophecy made earlier in the film about the identity of her beloved. However daddy isn't pleased with the thief and has him beaten and thrown from the castle. Other less wonderful REAL princes are left to vie for hand. However she wants Douglas and comes up with a plan to send all of them on a chase to bring back the greatest treasure. Douglas decides to enter this contest as welland due to his newfound goodness is able to make himself a prince and win her lovely hand. The film fades out as they take a very spectacular magic carpet ride away from the city of Baghdad.The film strongly excels artistically. The city appears huge and grand and generally very real. The special effects are also top notch. Fairbanks is also incredible with his athletic prowess as he effortlessly climbs ropes battles silly looking monsters the only minor drawback among the many special effects and leaps about the scenery. About the only other minor negative is that occasionally Fairbanks' performance is perhaps TOO Athleticas he didn't do quite a convincing job with the love scenes and quieter moments in the film. Still it's a silent masterpiece.".

Basically in the city of Bagdad lives Ahmed The Thief Douglas Fairbanks steals anything valuable and to get him by and he has stolen a magic rope that he can summon to climb high heights and using this he can sneak into the palace of The Caliph Brandon Hurst. But his habit for thievery fades away when he sees the Caliph's daughter The Princess Julanne Johnston he is instantly infatuated but he is forced to escape when spotted by The Mongol Slave Anna May Wong. The Thief is determined to win the heart of the Princess and he hears from His Evil Associate Snitz Edwards that a princess has been stolen during the reign of a previous ruler and he gets his chance the next day when it is her birthday. She is given the fortune that whoever touches a rose bush will be the man she married she is hoping it will not be one of the three princes Prince of the Indies Noble Johnson obese Prince of Persia Mathilde Comont and the Prince of the Mongols Sjin Kamiyama they all pass and the Thief appears in stolen garments and he only touches the rose bush when his horse throws him into it. The Princess is delighted and chooses the Thief as her husband to be but he had plans to abduct her and with his great love for her confesses all to her he is arrested after being overheard by the Mongol Prince's spy he is punished with lashes and before further torture he is bribed by the Princess to be let go. She is told she must choose another man to marry therefore she tells all potential princes that they should find her a gift after seven moons and the one she will marry will be the one who has the rarest treasure the Thief feels despair but visiting The Holy Man Charles Belcher he is directed to a place that great hidden treasures lie. The Indian Prince finds a crystal ball that can show anything you want to see and the Persian Prince finds a magic flying carpet but the Mongol Prince has his own plans to take over the kingdom and use the Princess as his incentive and to help with his plan he has a slave poison the Princess and he will use a magic apple to cure her. Meanwhile the Thief has had many adventures in the mysterious land and the treasure he has found include a cloak to turn him invisible and magic powder that when he sprinkles will turn into anything he wishes he makes his way back to Bagdad as do the other princes when they hear the news of the Princess near death. Her life is saved with the magic apple the other princes besides the Mongol Prince are regarded useless but she sees the Thief Ahmed transformed into a prince in the magic crystal ball but before he arrives the Mongol Prince unleashes his army to take over the city but the Thief uses his magic powder to summon another army to make the other flee. The Mongol Prince attempts to try and kill this new prince but Ahmed saves the Princess who takes her away on the flying carpet and he uses the invisibility cloak to defeat the other characters trying to catch them and with Bagdad saved and the Princess safe the Caliph in gratitude allows his daughter to marry Ahmed. Also starring Winter Blossom as Slave of the Lute and Etta Lee as Slave of the Sand Board. Fairbanks gives one of his best performance as the often grinning and shirtless almost all the way through scoundrel thief turned brave hero Johnston looks pretty as the princess longing to find the right prince and the other supporting characters do their parts well also. I can see that this would have been one of the inspirations for ideas put into Disney cartoon Aladdin obviously it an Arabian Nights story and with elements like magic ropes flying carpets and magic powder there is great spectacle these special effect moments use terrific camera and editing tricks and the swashbuckling bits with fights and chases are great fun a splendid silent fantasy adventure. Very good!".

The Princess is delighted and chooses the Thief as her husband to be but he had plans to abduct her and with his great love for her confesses all to her he is arrested after being overheard by the Mongol Prince's spy he is punished with lashes and before further torture he is bribed by the Princess to be let go. She is told she must choose another man to marry therefore she tells all potential princes that they should find her a gift after seven moons and the one she will marry will be the one who has the rarest treasure the Thief feels despair but visiting The Holy Man Charles Belcher he is directed to a place that great hidden treasures lie. The Indian Prince finds a crystal ball that can show anything you want to see and the Persian Prince finds a magic flying carpet but the Mongol Prince has his own plans to take over the kingdom and use the Princess as his incentive and to help with his plan he has a slave poison the Princess and he will use a magic apple to cure her. Meanwhile the Thief has had many adventures in the mysterious land and the treasure he has found include a cloak to turn him invisible and magic powder that when he sprinkles will turn into anything he wishes he makes his way back to Bagdad as do the other princes when they hear the news of the Princess near death. Her life is saved with the magic apple the other princes besides the Mongol Prince are regarded useless but she sees the Thief Ahmed transformed into a prince in the magic crystal ball but before he arrives the Mongol Prince unleashes his army to take over the city but the Thief uses his magic powder to summon another army to make the other flee. The Mongol Prince attempts to try and kill this new prince but Ahmed saves the Princess who takes her away on the flying carpet and he uses the invisibility cloak to defeat the other characters trying to catch them and with Bagdad saved and the Princess safe the Caliph in gratitude allows his daughter to marry Ahmed. Also starring Winter Blossom as Slave of the Lute and Etta Lee as Slave of the Sand Board. Fairbanks gives one of his best performance as the often grinning and shirtless almost all the way through scoundrel thief turned brave hero Johnston looks pretty as the princess longing to find the right prince and the other supporting characters do their parts well also. I can see that this would have been one of the inspirations for ideas put into Disney cartoon Aladdin obviously it an Arabian Nights story and with elements like magic ropes flying carpets and magic powder there is great spectacle these special effect moments use terrific camera and editing tricks and the swashbuckling bits with fights and chases are great fun a splendid silent fantasy adventure. Very good!";

	schema:reviewBody "I've always loved this version of the ancient Arabian tale Douglas Fairbanks was at the top of his game lithe and energetic throughout the 148 minutes. There are various copies available some better than others overall in various states of decomposition but I haven't seen one better than the Thames Photoplay issue. A copy I've seen regurgitated by Elstree Hill has a whole chapter almost burnt up and a teethgrindingly awful score so if you're interested it'll probably pay to be careful.Fairbanks spends the first 20 minutes scenesetting with plenty of stealing and acrobatics then tries to steal from the Caliph of Bagdad but falls in love with his beautiful daughter instead. He then spends the remainder of the film as the Reformed Thief Of Bagdad trying to win her. In this he's up against 3 rivals and they're all tasked with finding the greatest treasure to decide which one will marry her. The main role was split into two for the 1940 remake  he was certainly more animated than John Justin! Anna May Wong plays an evil traitor but confidante to the Princess a role she reprised 10 years later in ChuChinChow the first film version of which appeared the year before this and which provided some of the story here too. Some of the special effects still look good especially the flying carpet scenes and creating the million man army but the rest for the main are primitive  however if you're unfortunate enough to see any of the laughable modern versions maybe some with eyesplitting digital cartoonery too you'll realise special effects do not make a great movie. This has a great story great sets great atmosphere is constantly inventive within the technological limitations and lives in the imagination long after it's finished. However if comparisons are possible between silent and sound films I think Korda's version was something extra special and on another level altogether.So if you care dig out a good nonbudget issue of this for a magical night's entertainment.".

I will take Dragonslayer over Harry Potter anytime.Filmed in Panavision the 2.351 anamorphic picture looks really great in most scenes but in others there is a small problem with the black levels.

It's about a young man and woman meeting challenges death redemption the death of magic and the birth of Christianity and the hypocrisy of gov't. And it's all disguised as a PG movie about a dragon which is terrorizing a hamlet of decent people in the Dark Ages.HIGHLY recommended. PG but does have one foot gnawing which today would probably give it an R or X rating given the gutlessness of parents everywhere . This is an early movie by Industrial Light and Magic or ILM as it's known nowadays and I believe was funded by Disney. Despite that it's got a gritty edge. Check it out for youths and adults".

	schema:headline " The best dragon flick yet!";
	schema:reviewBody "I was also one of those who saw this in the theaters more than once when it came out and I urged all of my friends to see it and some of them did take my advice. Story is about a village that sacrifices young maidens to a dragon that has been marauding the countryside. A group from the village travel to see a sorcerer named Ulrich Sir Ralph Richardson and ask him to slay the dragon which he accepts but is killed by the King's sheriff. Ulrich's young apprentice Galen Peter MacNicol decides to step in and agree to the task with the help from a magical amulet. The village is headed by King Casiodorus Rex Peter Eyre who has a lottery where the name of a young girl is picked for the sacrifice for the dragon but the King doesn't put his own daughters name in the drawing.SPOILER ALERTGalen is taken to the dragons lair and he causes a rock slide and he believes that this has killed the dragon but as it turns out it didn't and it comes back to wreak havoc so the King quickly starts up another lottery. Meanwhile Galen has fallen in love with Valerian Caitlin Clarke and her father has made a mighty sword that hopefully can slay the dragon. Galen and his weapon head into the dragons lair to try and kill it but he quickly finds out that this dragon is going to be harder to slay than expected.This film is directed by Matthew Robbins who never really had a great career as a director but he did have some success as a writer but he can be happy with this film because it's still considered the best dragon flick to date. Disney and Paramount got together to make this and the special effects by Industrial Light and Magic are just terrific and still stand up today even though effects have changed with CGI. The DVD transfer suffers somewhat and the studio's should definitely digitally remaster this film and rerelease it on a special edition DVD. What makes the effects stand out is that they brilliantly made sure the dragon moved like a dragon would and it crawls like a bat or a lizard and it adds greatly to the reason why this is the best of it's kind. Robbins also does the right thing by not allowing the audience to get a good look at the dragon except in glimpses and it builds the chills and excitement until we finally do see the dragon. The film looks great from the wonderful location shots in Scotland to the dirty hovels that people lived in during those times. Richardson is a joy in a role that is to small but he makes the most of it with a lot of Latin muttering and lines like Do you have anything to eat? One of the highlights in the film For me anyway is Clarke as the love interest and I was always charmed by her tough but attractive performance. She still pops up every once in a while in small roles but this was her largest role in her career and last I've heard she teaches at a college in Pennsylvania. Probably not a great film as it does lag in spots but don't let this sway you because this is a fun film and one hell of a dragon!".

The film has a good plot with some nice twists themes and turns a decent script and good characters. I will admit one or two of the supporting characters are thinly sketched compared to the wizard Ulrich and there are parts when the film suffered from pacing problems. But overall I really enjoyed Dragonslayer. I forgot to mention the acting. Peter MacNicol is a likable enough lead with his spontaneous boyish charm Caitlin Clarke and Chloe Salamon are stunning as the female leads and Ralph Richardson without a doubt steals the movie as Ulrich. Also how can I forget the dragon? Plain and simple best designed dragon in any fantasy film the movements the design the creepiness everything flawless. Even better than Draco in Dragonheart despite Sean Connery's majestic voicing. All in all a couple of minor flaws but it is most enjoyable and one of the better fantasy films out there. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " If only there were more fantasy films like this!";
	schema:reviewBody "If you are looking for a movie to entertain the kids over the weekend and you pick this off the shelf because you notice the Walt Disney logo up the top beware  this is not quite what you would expect from a Disney film. I was 9 years old when this film came out and my dad hired it from the local video store for me to watch one afternoon after school. While I wasn't overly scared by it both my father and I were very surprised that it was a Disney film as there were semigraphic depictions of young dragons feeding on a fresh kill a princess! and no real element of humour at any stage. Still we loved it and I watched it several more times before we took it back to the store. Like a lot of people in the age of DVD I have begun buying up every favourite movie and TV show I have ever had and naturally Dragon Slayer made the list. I was worried before my first viewing however that the recent Lord Of The Rings trilogy would make this childhood favourite seem dated and comical but instead I was pleasantly surprised. It appears both fresh and realistic and the special effects are not lacking in the least. On a whole it is hard to find fault with this film and it has many elements in its favour that set it apart from most other films of the genre. The casting is terrific despite the extreme weedyness of the main hero Peter MacNicol but as another reviewer on this site has pointed out  this was probably an intentional decision by the film makers and not a result of bad judgment as my father and I had originally thought. The scenery is extremely beautiful throughout my favourite scene coming half way through the film where the castle wall crumbles down and the hero leaps his horse out onto the grass while the sun is setting on the horizon  a magical moment! The dragon is fabulously depicted complete with the most menacing scowl I have ever seen on a dragon in any movie. It's size is in keeping with it's type if you are a Dungeons and Dragons fan you will know that dragons come in different sizes according to their type and it's movements are nice and fluid considering that it was made a quarter of a century ago even the walkers and creatures in The Empire Strikes Back are more jerky with their movements. What I like most of all though is the film's dark mood and menacing realism. Most films of this kind tend to get tainted by the touch of Hollywood in that they are usually subjected to fancy and unrealistic fighting maneuvers humour big name casting and modern colloquialisms. How refreshing then that Dragon Slayer goes in the opposite direction on all these levels. The characters are everything that you would expect from the period the king is portrayed as a concerned ruler who loves his daughter and his champion a tough level headed warrior bent on protecting both the king's and the people's interests and their dialogue never strays either. The film does not attempt to avoid death scenes or mass destruction and this only serves to enhance the feel of a real wizard verse dragon fantasy. Then of course there is Caitlin Clarke a woman so beautiful that young boys everywhere will be struggling to decide whether to focus on the girl or the dragon! Almost the perfect fantasy experience let Dragon Slayer stand as a reminder to modern day film makers how a Dungeons and Dragons movie should really be made! 10 stars!".

It appears both fresh and realistic and the special effects are not lacking in the least. On a whole it is hard to find fault with this film and it has many elements in its favour that set it apart from most other films of the genre. The casting is terrific despite the extreme weedyness of the main hero Peter MacNicol but as another reviewer on this site has pointed out  this was probably an intentional decision by the film makers and not a result of bad judgment as my father and I had originally thought. The scenery is extremely beautiful throughout my favourite scene coming half way through the film where the castle wall crumbles down and the hero leaps his horse out onto the grass while the sun is setting on the horizon  a magical moment! The dragon is fabulously depicted complete with the most menacing scowl I have ever seen on a dragon in any movie. It's size is in keeping with it's type if you are a Dungeons and Dragons fan you will know that dragons come in different sizes according to their type and it's movements are nice and fluid considering that it was made a quarter of a century ago even the walkers and creatures in The Empire Strikes Back are more jerky with their movements. What I like most of all though is the film's dark mood and menacing realism. Most films of this kind tend to get tainted by the touch of Hollywood in that they are usually subjected to fancy and unrealistic fighting maneuvers humour big name casting and modern colloquialisms. How refreshing then that Dragon Slayer goes in the opposite direction on all these levels. The characters are everything that you would expect from the period the king is portrayed as a concerned ruler who loves his daughter and his champion a tough level headed warrior bent on protecting both the king's and the people's interests and their dialogue never strays either. The film does not attempt to avoid death scenes or mass destruction and this only serves to enhance the feel of a real wizard verse dragon fantasy. Then of course there is Caitlin Clarke a woman so beautiful that young boys everywhere will be struggling to decide whether to focus on the girl or the dragon! Almost the perfect fantasy experience let Dragon Slayer stand as a reminder to modern day film makers how a Dungeons and Dragons movie should really be made! 10 stars!";

Fairly good performances from all nonetheless. The plot is top notch. This is not simple minded hack and slash. So if you want some mindless action flick go elsewhere preferably over a cliff. The plot moves slowly and you have to pay close attention to details or else you won't get it. In fact the the first time you watch it you may think you see some errors. They are not.

This particular film pays surprising attention to detail both in plot and in visuals note how the dragon uses its tail to balance while on the ground and in flight and actually requires that the brain be in gear in order to follow the story a welcome surprise.  To see a film in the fantasyadventure genre that ISN'T dumbed down is both unusual and gratifying.  The acting is also very good if occasionally a bit overblown. Flaws are surprisingly few and far between.The movie is very much in the tradition of such great epic novels as Ursula K. LeGuin's Earthsea trilogy within the confines of the 2hour movie format.  More of the dragon would have been welcome although Vermithrax gets a decent amount of screen time and DEFINITELY more of Sir Ralph Richardson Ulrich working some acts of great wizardry!  But I'm not complaining too loudly because Dragonslayer is a great film in its genre a classic of high fantasy.  Every time I see it I catch some new detail missed on a previous viewing.  A DVD reissue would be welcome hint hint! especially now that this overlooked gem seems to be disappearing from video stores.910".

No money has been spared! There is plenty of first rate action here from start to finish. The only unreal touch is the way our hero Hans Albers always looks so dashing he was born in 1892 and selfconfident no matter how craftily the cards are stacked against him!

Gable is the colorful Big John McMasters a Rhett Butler from Texas who lives large and romances big. Tracy is the more solid downtoearth Jonathan Sand who is Gable's moral conscience much like he was in San Francisco. The pair meet cute while heading in opposite directions on a narrow board walkway across a muddy street. Despite a damp start the two men bond and their friendship endures for years through fights jealousy and competition over business and women particularly Claudette Colbert. The mud is barely washed off their clothing when Gable unwittingly steals Colbert from Tracy and the jilted platonic lover carries a torch for his lost love throughout the film. When not womanizing or swindling Gable and Tracy make and lose several fortunes separately and together without breaking a sweat. Oil gushers well fires and fistfights the action wanders all over the MGM back lot from Texas to South America to New York.Gable anchors the film with his largerthanlife personality while Tracy underplays in deference to his more charismatic costar. Although reteaming the Oscarwinning leads of It Happened One Night must have seemed like a brilliant idea at the time Colbert unfortunately often seems out of place in Boom Town. Her manners poise and dress do not mesh with the Texas oil fields or the South American hovels. She is on firmer ground as the welldressed lady of the manor. The sight of perfectly madeup Colbert scrubbing clothes on a washboard with a big grin on her face strains the story's credibility. Although the enigmatic Hedy Lamarr has a flawless face and incomparable beauty she rarely wrinkles her professionally applied cosmetics to show any trace of an emotion. However she is certainly believable as the object of any man's lust and physically perfect as an other woman. Fortunately a fine cast of supporting players such as Frank Morgan Chill Wills and Lionel Atwill surround the leading stars and further enhance the lively proceedings.First class production values a fastmoving story and appealing stars make Boom Town a solid entertainment if not a masterpiece.".

It was an amazing love story about two men in love with the same woman. It was pure entertainment.".

They used four of their biggest stars any one of whom could have starred in their own films.Clark Gable already had an Oscar for It Happened One Night another nomination for Mutiny on the Bounty and was nominated in the 1940 Academy Awards for Gone with the Wind.Spencer Tracy a ninetime Oscar nominee already had a nomination for San Francisco a win for Captains Courageous and a win the previous year for Boy's Town.Threetime Oscar nominee Claudette Colbert already had a win for It happened One Night which she did with Gable and a nomination for Private Worlds.Frank Morgan had gotten one of his two nominations for The Affairs of Cellini.And our Star of the Month Hedy Lamarr was just beginning her career.This was a raucous film with all the excitement that you would expect in one about wildcatters in the oil business and featured barroom fights streets of mud and stories ripped from the headlines. It was an amazing love story about two men in love with the same woman. It was pure entertainment.";

Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy make the unlikely pair of men who join forces to strike it rich and they're both lively and sharp on their game. The main women in both their lives is Claudette Colbert and of course circumstances make both men fall in love with her. Guess who wins?As the men find oil then disaster then more oil and more disaster Colbert hangs on. Later in the movie Gable in New York during a successful few years and he is caught up with an urban siren played by Hedy Lamar. To an audience used to film noir we know she's a classic femme fatale wanting something she shouldn't have and using what she does have to try and get it. But this is prenoir and of course a Western in many ways. In fact it's before the U.S. entered WWII and it's slightly odd to see a sprawling tale of such important seeming events when the big events are happening in Europe. But it's sweeping and convincing in that 1940s Hollywood style that is kicking in technically flawless beautiful made in every way.Throw in four great actors as well as Frank Morgan the man who the year before played the Wizard in that Oz movie and you have a really excellent production. Gable as a youth even worked in the oil industry with his father so he knew his stuff. Tracy mad about details in his contact was unhappy on the set and didn't get along with either woman and it shows once you know it.Why isn't this a great classic with everything going for it? I think the story. It is filled with so many clichs even these actors under director Jack Conway couldn't make it fresh. The clichs are great of coursethe rivalry over the same woman the improbably rise to wealth and fall but you see them with familiarity. And the suddenness of huge turns of fate as it propels forward are a bit grand to the point of grandiose. Even the end you can see coming in the big view.Still I'd recommend this for the sheer joy of it all. Of course Colbert and Gable were famous in the 1934 It Happened One Night and it's fun to see them six years later here. But even all the oil industry scenes including a couple great disasters are very well done and exciting stuff.".

The latter is more than leery of his buddy which turns out to be prophetic as McMasters marries the woman Sands had his eyes on Elizabeth Bartlett called Besty in the film and played by Colbert. However he accepts it in a mature manner.This romance angle comes and goes just like the oil fortunes of these two men. One day they're up the next day they're broke. Lamar enters the picture to give it another melodrama twist. That's probably why I was bit letdown in the end. The romances took over from the rousing man's adventure story I thought it was going to be and looked like it was going to be in the first part of the story. However I guess they figured women might not come to the theater if there were no complicated romance issues among the tales of two man grubby oilmen. I would have preferred the grubbiness as this turned out to be a little too long and boring despite those dynamic lead actors.".

Tracy never a cheerful sort is as near to a happy camper as he can be.Jack Conway wasn't usually regarded as a director of the first rank even by his studio does a fine job of keeping things moving at a swift pace. Yet he knows how to slow things down too so that one can catch a real glimpse of a small western city or an oil field. The script by John Lee Mahin and James Edward Grant does not for a minute seriously question the motivations or morals of the main characters and this could be classified as a conservative adventure film or a Republican epic.

I also enjoyed seeing this move in black and white as it focused on the story line rather than a big color feature.

I also enjoyed seeing this move in black and white as it focused on the story line rather than a big color feature. I will definitely watch this move again as it brings home the people that risked there lives to bring a product to the people at the beginning of the industrial age with romance and a little humor. I would recommend it to anyone.";

As I kept viewing this copy it appeared the sequences were choppy  I can't believe when this film was first released it was that choppy. The question is can it be restored or is there a better copy than the one I saw.This cast of 4 heavy hitters with Tracy Gable Hedy Lamaar  Claudet Colbert is almost bigger than the screen. Add in Frank Morgan  Chill Wills and you have to wonder why all these folks were available for the same film. While this is a good film it could have been a little better.It is interesting seeing  hearing Spencer Tracy make a closing speech in court where he mentions conservation of oil years before the industry even had any programs about this. Especially being before World War 2 as because of Hitler environmentalism was scrapped for the war effort in some ways. The war did produce some of the earliest recycling programs in the US.This movie is about Wild Catting for oil and how it really was back in the early days. This is the kind of world which no longer exists. In this era nobody was too big to fail.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is MGM classic rests on the giant talents of its stars especially Tracy and Gable. The plot in lesser hands would not have been very believable and moves along at a very swift pace. This was the third and final pairing of the two great stars. In large part because Tracy got sick of playing the sidekick to Gable's hero who always got the girl. The two actors always respected each other. Gable always envious and admiring of Tracy's acting skills. And Tracy always admired Gable's confidence and swagger that made him the King of the movies. To start with the characters are wildcatters living by the seat of their pants but in the end they are after money and power no matter what the cost. Only Tracy as SquareJohn is motivated by love and his own personal moralcode. But that again is the part that Tracy always played in the three film pairings with Gable. Gable as usual is the risktaking n'erdowell living outside the vein of morality who always gets the girl. Tracy never gets the girl but is always the moral force of the story. The guy who'll do the right thing no matter what and he is the one who usually is responsible for reforming Gable. In a certain sense like most buddy films the love story is between the two guys and it never shines better than in their explosive fight scene towards the films end.Claudette Colbert does a great job with a thinly written part as the beautiful Betsy. Hedy Lamarr is really fine as Gable's other girl Karen Vanmeer. There is a scene between Hedy and Tracy late in the story that is electric and so well done. She really holds her own with the famous scenestealer.Frank Morgan Lionel Atwill and Chill Wills are among the rest of the excellent MGM company supporting cast in this film.It's too bad that this was the last film with the two great stars. They were so great together. This is a fastpaced fun film entertainment that you'll thoroughly enjoy.".

Sure the special effects are dated but i'd rather have this story and those acotrs than all the stars in an Irwin Allen production.

	schema:reviewBody "Along with Call of the Wild this is my favorite Gable filmincluding Gone with the Wind made the year before. They have the similarity that we are in a wildcatting situation looking for some treasure gold in one case oil in another. There is an air of tremendous excitement and optimism which Gable epitomizes. In the one case Gable has wisecracking Jack Oakie and later gorgeous Loretta Young as companions in the search for gold in the Yukon wilderness. In the present case Gable teams up with an enthusiastic Spencer Tracy and later with gorgeous Claudette Corbert. This is also one of the last films Gable made before the tragic death of his wife Carol Lombard and his entry in to WWII service. After that Gable seemed a changed man on screen. It is also the most autobiographical film Gable did as before his film career he joined his father as an oil man. This film as an epic about wildcatting in the early oil industry invariably invites comparison with the later film Tulsa with the same theme. Native Oklahoman Chill Wills is the only actor I am aware of that was in both films. In both cases the excitement begins with a gusher. Later there is a spectacular oil field fire that threatens to wipe out fortunes. But Tulsa lacks anyone with the sizzling chemistry between Gable and Tracy and also lacks the befuddled humor of Frank Morgan. Don't get me wrong. If you enjoyed Boomtown you should definitely check out Tulsa. Susan Hayward is the toughasnails wildcat in that story with Chill Wills as the occasional narrator. But it tends to drag in places.The initial meeting between Gable and Tracy going opposite ways on a one way plank that serves as a bridge across a muddy watersoaked road in a wildcat town reminds us of the initial meeting of Robin HoodErrol Flynn and Little JohnAlan Hale in The Adventures of Robin hood in which they try to knock each other off a log crossing a stream so that they may complete their crossing. In the present case this incident results in a draw as both dive into the mud when bullets start flying around them. Tracy's initial offense at being called Shorty by Gable is soon grudgingly accepted when they share a room for the night. But woe be to anyone who parrots Gable in calling him Shorty!Comparison with yet another Gable film Wife versus Secretary is also in order. In both films Gable acquires a knockout single woman who nearly costs him his marriage as an indispensable assistant in his business. The difference is in the personalities of the women. Harlow's character respects his marriage enough not to encourage an affair though appearances sometimes fuel rumors. Heddy Lamarr's character is a snake who admits to Tracy that she is determined to seduce and marry Gable's character. Happily Gable eventually dismisses Lamarr and wife Colbert forgives him. The ups and downs of Gable's and Tracy's oil businesses together or separate and their relationship constitutes much of the substance of the film. Tracy makes a memorable epic speech at Gable's antitrust trial which serves as the basis of a reconciliation and a hopeful finale. This speech should have been quoted in T.J. DiLorenzo's book How Capitalism Saved America in which he argues that antitrust legislation has done much more harm than good.I wonder why the color poster for the main feature on my DVD shows Gable smooching Lamarr rather than Colbert? and why the color poster for the special features shows Lamarr and Tracy togetherwhich occurred for only a few minutes in the film? Is Lamarr considered such a superior beauty that she totally outranks Colbert? Not to my mind.".

The movie is a 1940's Classic and I think it was almost as good as Gone With the Wind. This is the last of three films that Spencer Tracy and Clark Gable starred in together which included San Francisco Test Pilot and Boom Town. The Film was star packed. I instantly knew who the actors were once I heard their voices. I especially liked how it was set in a western style and a modern style for that time anyway I thought it was going to be like every other western film that I've seen in black and white but it wasn't it was more adventurous and interesting. I especially enjoyed the scenes that showed Big John and Square John fist fighting.

Is there any way not to fall in love with this lady? She is convincing without being overly sappy. She gives a much better performance than Hedy Lamarr who is not especially believable in her role. Hedy is a pretty lady she just seemed stilted in this role a siren should seem suave but she never quite comes across as the wanton woman she is supposedly portraying.The more Spencer Tracy movies I see the more I appreciate his acting ability. His subtle facial expressions and Colbert's too really make this a fun movie to watch. Gable does not seem to have the ability to be as subtle. Although enjoyable the 2 stars were Colbert and Tracy without a doubt. The characters in this movie are all drifters who never really settle down. They would not be appreciated in polite society without the oil money.My main complaint was that some of the hair and costumes looked like they were straight out of 1930s or 1940 rather than 1918 and early 20's when the story was supposed to take place. It is true that near the end of the movie we are approaching the late 20s but the costumes did not seem very authentically 20s.".

It wasn't the biggest problem though with this movie it simply underachieved all my expectations. The whole movie is so silly and dumb it's just not worth watching. It was supposed to be humorous but most of the funny elements are based on racial prejudices and cultural simplifications. Even a Leslie Nielsen movie can be considered subtle to this. Besides the racial based humor even the plot is primitive. I don't want to give any details of the story line it's just simply not worth it. The only remarkable element of the movie was the description of the UN peacekeepers who are portrayed as stupid careless and corrupt people which fact was recently reflected in a book written by former UN employees. The movie was good for one thing now I know I have to avoid movies directed by David Lister.To sum it up I would just tell you DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!".

It was supposed to be humorous but most of the funny elements are based on racial prejudices and cultural simplifications. Even a Leslie Nielsen movie can be considered subtle to this. Besides the racial based humor even the plot is primitive. I don't want to give any details of the story line it's just simply not worth it. The only remarkable element of the movie was the description of the UN peacekeepers who are portrayed as stupid careless and corrupt people which fact was recently reflected in a book written by former UN employees. The movie was good for one thing now I know I have to avoid movies directed by David Lister.To sum it up I would just tell you DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!";

She lives totally  in the here and now and sees and appreciates everything and so do we  thanks to the breathtaking color cinematography. She quietly goes  through her ordinary life giving every tiny moment all her attention  and invisibly enriching the lives of all those around her until near  the end of the picture she is given off to a family friend whom  coincidentally she has fancied since she was little. He is engaged to  another woman but one day he picks up a bust of Buddha and stares at  it with recognition realizing suddenly that the face and the smile of the  Buddha are something he has been seeing every day on Mui. He sees her  for what she is and both their lives are transformed.  Even more astounding than the richness and beauty of this film is the  feat of finding two wonderful actresses 10 years apart to play the  same very unusual girl both identically beautiful and graceful and  having the Buddha smile.

The first Vietnamese film ever nominated for an Academy Award as Best Foreign Language Film Scent of Green Papaya captures the natural beauty of prewar Vietnam even though it was filmed on a set constructed in a Paris studio. Mui personifies the innocence of a Vietnamese society where grace and harmony has not yet given way to bombs and destruction. Mui accepts her place with patience serving the meals preparing the vegetables scrubbing the floors and polishing the shoes.True to the Buddhist ideal of being in the present moment Mui studiously carries out her tasks refusing to be affected by the torments of the younger son Tin Gerard Neth upset over his father's desertion of the family. She observes her natural surroundings in great detail ants carrying a small piece of bread a frog sitting on a leaf a cricket jumping at night and the seeds of a green papaya. The mother Thi Loc Truong is distraught over the recent death of her young daughter To and looks upon Mui as her replacement perhaps even her reincarnation. In one scene the mother stands over Mui while she sleeps and weeps silently for the loss of her daughter and perhaps for a Vietnam that she knows will soon disappear.Her husband Ngoc Trun Tran is a drinker and womanizer who has run off with the family's money. The mother is stoic and we only hear about her problems through the elderly grandmother Thi Hai Vo who mourns her dead husband alone in her upstairs room. The second part of the film shifts ten years into the future. Mui Tran Nu YenKhe has become a young woman. Because of the family's financial condition she has moved to the house of Khuyen a professional musician and composer Vuong Hoa Hoi. Her leaving triggers in the mother a profound sense of loss for her daughter and a sense that the old way of life in her country is coming to a permanent end.In her new house Mui must contend with the musician's Westernized fianc who personifies the artificiality of modern society. Annoyed with the insensitivity of his fianc Khuyen sees Mui with fresh eyes and begins to realize how much she embodies the traditional values he has left behind. Though the film may try the patience of Western audiences The Scent of Green Papaya in its simplicity and awareness of the natural world reminds us of the power of cinema to reach artistic heights.".

	schema:reviewBody "If your taste runs to action blockbusters this film is not for you. The Scent of Green Papaya is the sort of film that repays patient observation and lends itself to repeated viewings. I'm not an intellectualI will admit I had to take a couple of runs at this film before I understood what I was seeing. The first time I turned it off 20 min. into it saying Nothing's happening here! That's true if you're used to Western films that are driven by action and dialog. Like many Asian films TSOGP is instead driven by interaction between characters and observation. The camera functions as an eye to show us life from the character's point of view. After seeing the entire film I became aware that it had become a part of my mental furnishings I realised I was spending quite a lot of time thinking about it in the following days. I'm told by those who live with me that the highest compliment I can give a film are the words I need to see it again. And I doI need to buy a copy and see it several more times.Ten year old Miu is sent from her home village to Saigon to work as a servant in a cloth merchant's household. She is fascinated by their beautiful home and its furnishings the papaya tree in the courtyard and how very different their lifestyle is to what she has known. The youngest son of the family sees her arrival as a golden opportunityat last someone is lower on the family totempole than himself and he tries to bully Miu in various ways. However his attempts fall flat as he never gets much of a reaction in her innocence Miu accepts events as they come never trying to assign blame or tell on him. If a jar gets broken she accepts it is her fault if a pail of dirty water gets upended or someone pees all over a clean floor she cleans it up without a word. Her employer's wife soon sees her as a surrogate daughter someone to fill the void of her own daughter's death and her own loveless marriage to a spendthrift husband who abandons the family for weeks at a time and comes home empty handed.Ten years later Miu is sent to work for a family friend a young man she has long admired. His relationship with a spoiled girl of his own class flickers out as he becomes more aware of Miu's quiet presence in his life. All of the action of the film is crammed into the last 30 min as we see the results of his growing awareness and its transforming effect. The film is stunning to look at as usual in much of Asian cinema. If I had one complaint it was the soundtrack not the traditional Vietnamese music played by father and son at the beginning of the story but the tortuous contemporary Western music in the second half including a dreadful rendition of Debussy's Claire de Luneas if an alley cat were trying to play the violin on its own catguts. The caterwauling added nothing to the film and only served as an irritating distraction. This is what caused me to lower my rating of this otherwise fine film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Scent of Green Papaya is one of those films that is easy to enjoy no matter where you're from. A visually striking film that utilizes setting and cinematography over dialogue it's easy to see why it did so well internationally. I can't think of many films that can totally relax me and clear my mind something that is only possible when I'm completely engulfed and not bothered by massive amounts of dialogue. Since the visuals tell most of the story we're left with a very deep film that isn't tedious or overbearing so that we can focus without trying to read lots of subtitles or follow ten different things on screen at once. The simple but elaborate set style adds to the film as a universal feeling that I got while watching it. Focusing on one thing in Papaya is rather hard as it really works well as a sum of its parts. Without the incredible cinematography the story would probably be lost on most audiences. Without the beautiful sets that the actors mesh with so well you'd be pulled out of the reality of the film. Without the great acting especially by the actresses that play Mui the film falls flat on its face. It's one of those movies that seems to and this happens at least once or twice a year for me completely reshape my idea of what a film can and can't be. It's kind of like pot for the eyes. It seems that most movies these days and this is a broad generalization are just glorified plays. If you could find someone that would sit through this as a play for 90 minutes well they're just stupid. Maybe that's a little bit harsh but at the least they'd have to be pretty patient people. I have a hard time believing that it could work.Very Mild Spoilers In the Third Paragraph To me the best films are ones that are deep enough that they require multiple viewings to truly understand but not so deep that I feel lost and turned off from see Goodbye South Goodbye. The first thing I noticed about Papaya was the wonderful use of background noise. I originally thought it was a bit annoying but as the film pushed on the cricket in a cage theme fleshed out as a major part of the story. When Mui opens the door on the little cage right before she leaves the house she spent half her life in and the cricket sticks to the door I saw the connection to her life. It's wholly depressing that the mother is in fact losing her surrogate daughter and Mui seems very uncertain about what her future holds when she leaves. She is the caged cricket that is scared to leave its home. The transformation she makes in her new surroundings is only possible because she took that step she leaves the nest. Also the background noise plays an important part in what is going in the film but only in that it's never discussed. The jets flying over the house in the second part of the film adds to the setting even more because there is no need to mention it we are too caught up in Mui's transformation into a woman to care about wars and such. Not resorting to explanatory dialogue when most filmmakers would is something that makes Tran Anh Hung an exciting and original filmmaker. He's the anti Godard in a sense no way can I actually back up that statement as I've only seen a couple of Godard's older movies but from what I know this seems like a logical jump.The Scent of Green Papaya isn't necessarily one of the best movies I've ever seen but it sure is one of the most original. I think that pretty much anyone could make at least a decent film with the proper training but films like Papaya are a testament to true vision and talent. You give this script to anyone else and you'd end up with a vastly different film. If that's not voice I don't know what is.".

She is tenyearold Mi played with grace and a kind of magical innocence by Man San Lu who bestows her beatific little smile on all the little wonders of the world she sees around her. She learns her job quickly and works hard always with a positive attitude. She loves all living things including insects and frogs. She tolerates the boorish behavior of the youngest son of the household who directs some indelicate gestures in her direction. Like a Taoist monk she just observes judges not and says nothing.Well we know somebody is going to take notice of this splendid jeune fille some wise young man and when she comes of age marry her and elevate her station in life. Meanwhile the head of household squanders the family's funds and ten years pass. Now the family is almost broke and Mi is sent to be the housekeeper and cook for Khuyen played attractively by Hoa Hoi Vuong. She is now played by Tran Nu YnKh who falls in love with the young man who is a classical pianist. Unfortunately he has a girl friend a stylish woman of the city from a welltofamily. Finally we have a bit of tension!This then is an 'art house' movie in which director Anh Hung Tran tells the story primarily with images and symbolism and that he does very well. But the disjunction of the two very slight plots is never overcome and the startling lack of any tension until near the end is disappointing. The central image of the film the green papaya with the immature seeds inside representing the potential of the little girl is however not to be forgotten.What carries this slowmoving extended vignette of antebellum Saigon and saves us from abject boredom are the beautiful sets nestled in greenery with the Buddhist artwork the wooden Venetianslotted doors the partitions the lattice work the vases the statues the charming music both eastern and western the intensively focused cinematography and the charm of tenyearold Man San Lu. Many viewers however charmed will not stay for the finale which will be too bad because it is in the later stages of the film that the fairytale quality of the film is fully realized. Mi of course has come of age and the developing love affair is revealed purely through camera work without any dialogue.Incidentally I was somewhat surprised to learn that this beautifully rendered film was shot not on locale in Saigon Vietnam where the action takes place but in a Paris studio! This makes me imagine that the trees especially the papaya tree in the central courtyard and the little animals the frogs and geckos were shipped in. It also makes me realize that the ants that the one boy drips hot candle wax on the ants that Mi admires and her cricket in a cage are most likely Parisians.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the purest films ever made this movie captures a sense of utter peace and spirituality drawn from the main character's constant sense of wonder awareness of her surroundings and the pleasure she is able to take in simple daily tasks.  It is also an expression of the true nature of the medium since there is no forced tension or plot points and the camera explores its world in perfect freedom and with perfect curiosity to suit the main character who is filled with curiosity for the world around her often taking time to simply stare at the objects around her as an ideal camera should. Some say that the problem with this film is that it lacks tension which to me seems to be an odd attitudewhy should a movie require forced dilemmas in order to be considered good? particularly when film is such a good medium for expressing both everyday reality AND for expressing states of mindin this case the filmaker wanted to express a sense of quietude which is perfectly legitimate very real and is well suited to the medium. In fact if this film has a tiny fault it is in the few moments where there does exists some tension which take away from the pure sense of personal peace and wholeness that the film so perfectly expresses.  And it goes without saying that this is a perfectly constructed poem paying tribute a particular feeling and state of being a state of being which is tied to the true nature of the camera medium and that its plot is not the focus nor should it be in a film attempting to simply portray reality and express ideasemotions in a way that is suited to the medium.  Also needless to say every shot is beautiful carefully framed and the flow of the movie in editing acting and music is natural expressive musical and in a word perfect.We should all seek to be more like this main character and this camera in our awareness of the world around us and our ability to find peace with the reality of everyday life.  One of the greatest things film can do for us is to make us reconsider the basic nature of the reality that surrounds us and allow us to consider different ways of viewing it allow us appreciate its inherent texture.  This film does this.It is a shame that there are so few films made with this puritythat most films attempt to force meaningless tension and artificial dilemmas on us for no greater purpose than to distract our minds and in the process they clash against the medium's natural tendencies and potentials. note I'm not claiming that tension is inherently bad or that great films can't be made that way but in most films the tension and dilemmas are forced and in most films they goes against the camera's natural state of being and in many films this tension has no artistic purpose even in films that are actually trying to say or express something.Regarding this filmaker's other film The vertical ray of the sun visually it is even more beautiful than this film and in parts it expresses an even purer sense of peace... however it does contain some overly strong moments of tension and dilemma that seem totally out of place within its calm style also although I have downplayed story and character in the above discussion Green Papaya does have a well drawn and beautiful story that even has some mythic resonance or more importantly the main character has these things.  vertical ray on the other hand does not have such resonant characters or plot points though admitedly it is more beautiful in some ways. However i have seen each film only once so I may change my mind about vertical rayand regardless of any slight misgivings I have currently I do recommend it as an important film experience.".

Now what makes the difference is the quality of the picture and colours unforgettable. This movie is not just about Mui's work experience as a maid in a wealthy house nor about her feelings for her new Master ten years later a tenyear gap in the story neither about Vietnam itself. The movie looks like it's taken slices of Mui's personal story so that people would have a private look at a few events that marked her life a form of autobiography as the ending demonstrated by Mui talking directly to the viewer. Does the movie need action? I think not. Does it need to demonstrate something? I don't think so. Finally I highly recommend watching this movie but mainly when you're in the mood for some quiet time to yourself. It's not your usual Friday night screening.".

Ultimately I think the film is just slightly too subdued for it's own good and threatens to disappear into it's own poetic reverie.

It is an enthralling story and even though it is subtitled in English you will not spend all your time reading since most of the story is visual. The pace moves along nicely.This is the 1st Vietnamese film ever released in the USA.";

	schema:reviewBody "The community in this film for the most part is civil and respectful. It is a calm and quiet environment where the servants are treated with just as much esteem as are the landowners and their children. It is not a place of dread as might be expected concerning the lives of servants but is a place of learning and growth. Despite the occasional feuds between Mui and the master's younger son the director establishes a tranquil atmosphere through the use of jungle ambiance soothing riffs from citars and flutes misenscene and transcendence from the ordinary things of life.The predominant community established and focused on is of servanthood. The tutorials between the young apprentice Mui and her elderly instructor To give the viewer insights to their daily chores and lifestyle. The life of a servant consists of cooking preparation cleaning passion and appreciation for the ordinary. In particular a great emphasis is honed in on the importance of cleanliness and preparation. Multiple scenes reveal the delicate care the servants take in preparing the food they create for their masters. Cleanliness always precedes these acts of creation. Beautiful closeups and slow motioned effects show Mui washing her hands and face in a rather spiritually ritualistic way. The director establishes their works more like an art than like a service. However the life of a servant by definition is still one of entrapment.The camera itself acts like a trapped servant for the majority of the film. It always seems to be peering upon the characters through obstructed walls screens doors and windows yet never reveals them entirely. It's as if the camera is trying to break free from the clutter that fills the screen by constantly moving proportionately to the way the characters move. The screen is always filled in various layersthe foreground will usually be filled with a variety of set dcor the middle ground is the characters space and the background is for extras and the mood of the atmosphere. The community presented is also one that has a deep appreciation for the ordinary things in life.Immaculate closeups of bugs frogs lizards and plants all help illustrate the love the people and more particularly the director have for the beauties in nature. An interesting use of misenscene is paralleled between Mui and the insects she feeds inside the cage. Mui an entrapped servant inside her own cage called home feeds a cluster of crickets entrapped inside their cage in order to sustain their lives. It is a reflection of her own nourishing she receives from the masters inside the cage she lives in. It is her way of giving back to nature what nature has given to her. A tender scene is shown between the friendship of Mui and her crickets when she is told she will be leaving to serve in another home. As she opens the door to the cage to let the crickets go free they cling to its surfaceunwilling to move. That the crickets are scared to break free and venture outside beyond the confines of their cage is a reflection of Mui's life to venture beyond the home cage she was essentially raised in. The community then is shown as being one that represents the effects of being institutionalized over a given period of time. The characters in the story whether human or insect are ones that adapt to their environment quickly and make the best of their given situation. Uncomfortable feelings are the natural result of those who are told to divorce themselves from the norm. In short the community presented is the metaphysical expression of the human development from being to change to becoming.".

Check them out if you really want to see a REAL Vietnamese movie. Being a 100 Vietnamese born  raised in Vietnam I have to say that this movie has so many li'l details that do not represent Vietnam at all. If you've ever lived in VN you probably know what I mean. Here's the most obvious one even if you don't speak VNese you probably notice the sudden quiet of the main character at the beginning of the 2nd part. She was a very cute girl during the 1st part and all in sudden the music jumped in and replace all her talking as if she became mute or something. I started to feel uncomfortable from that point on. Not until the scene when she learns how to read that I realized why. Simply she can't speak VNese. You can tell that even though she tried her very very best her accent was so obvious. She was an opposite of the 10 yo girl who fits so well into the character even the way she walks. Should I also mention the ending is kind of a rush? The whole story moves in a snail speed and I couldn't wait until it ended so that I can go back to my reading. And then just like that it ended unexpected. Although it is a happy ending it's nothing like other REAL VNese movies which always bring some sort of happiness warmth sense of hope afterward.I do admit that the movie is beautifully. I actually love all the washing shot because I think it's one of the rare things in this movie that looks and feels like VN. For those who wonder why there were so much washing well it simply a way to say that the girl is pure. But other than that I kept being distracted and looking at the clock half way through the movie. What should I say? I don't think I would recommend this movie or maybe you should only watch the 1st part...".

Mui is an intelligent person yet quite content to fit in with her appointed lot in life. An older servant serves as her mentor and teaches her many practical things about housework.As a child Mui takes in stride the childish antics of her master's two young sons who seem to have a propensity for urinating outside a toilet or dragging her washing onto the ground. She is fascinated by the natural world and when she is not working spends what little time she has free to dabble or explore there. She keeps a cricket as a pet and is not afraid of frogs or toads and washes them benevolently.The master's wife confesses when Mui is about to leave the household what a comfort it has been to have her around as she has been a surrogate daughter. Her real daughter who would have been the same age died many years ago of disease.About two thirds of the way through the movie Mui's life jumps abruptly 10 years into the future. Mui has become a beautiful young woman still very much the servant but with the strong curiosity that comes naturally with a developing intelligence. She is now the servant of a young musician engaged to a rather flippant it would seem young woman. Somewhat predictably Mui turns out to be a homewrecker and the musician sketches her face and teaches her to read  his fianc trashes his music room and returns the ring. There is no sex  the most sensual scenes in the film have to do with Mui bathing herself with a facecloth and a bowl of water she is clothed though her shoulders are bare.The film is beautifully filmed though virtually all of the scenes are indoor  there are no wide open spaces or cityscapes here. I found the music offputting no grand symphony orchestras just prominent bird or insect sounds or rather discordant single or few instrument jumbles. The musician's classic piano pieces were a welcome relief. In at least two scenes loud jet engine noises are heard but not explained.I was not expecting car chases or explosions in a movie like this but I would have like to see a much stronger and more interesting humaninterest story  at least something out of the ordinary my life is dull enough and I look to escape to the movies. It makes a point of concentrating on the ordinary and on simplicity and deliberately avoids Hollywood's sophisticated complexity and richness. The Beautiful Country a film also centring around Vietnamese characters and one which I imagined would be rather boring contrasted sharply in style and substance with this one but was engrossing and enjoyable.No doubt a film which will polarise opinion  depends on what you are looking for and the type of person you are. Some especially those who choose to comment here will rave over it. I didn't find it dead boring but it was a disappointment. 510".

The next day Sledge leaves town to meet with the rest of his gang in the hills. He notices the old man from the saloon following him on horseback some distance away.

	schema:reviewBody "In the Old West a gunfighting outlaw called SledgeJames Garner connives his way into a prison in hopes of getting his hands a cache of gold on stored there . Sledge join forces with a varied bunch of bandits John Marley  Dennis Weaver  Claude Akins  Bruno Corazzari  among others attempting to take a large shipment of gold into a prison fort . The misfit group of outlaws wind up battling each over a cache of gold . A quintet of unlikely partners match wills and wits and fight enemies and each other .Entertaining Spaghetti Western with shootouts  action violence and amusement . It is a mainstream Western amusement with a lot of surprises  thrills and including a love story between James Garner and a whore played by gorgeous Laura Antonelli . This film realized in Spaghetti style contains actionWestern  gunplay  fistplay and is pretty bemusing . Vic Morrow's spaghetti western probably won't be making too many top ten lists but its an agreeable flick . It's an exciting western that scrutinizes the greed and paranoia that afflicts a misfit group  including breathtaking showdown between protagonists and the enemies . The film blends violence  thrills  high bodycount and it's fast moving and exciting . There is plenty of action in the movie  guaranteeing shootouts or stunts every few minutes  including a spectacular final confrontation . Although by many to be director Vic Morrow's finest film  this is a tale of fear  greed and murder  as some partners fall out over the gold they have robbed from an impenetrable safe . It also has probably the most brutal prison escape ever put on film . Underrrated by some reviewers  but till interesting to watch . It above all things mostly also remains a real characters movie in which the five main roles are the essentials . Their dynamic together is also great and is what mostly keeps this movie going. They are five totally different characters which is the foremost reason why they work out so great together on film . This theme about confrontation among mean people for a cache of gold has been treated in various Spaghetti such as Ruthless four by Giorgo Capitani with Van Heflin  Gilbert Roland  George Hilton  and A reason to live  a reason to die by Tonino Valeri with James Coburn  Jose Suarez and Bud Spencer . Here James Garner is superbly believable and gives a nice portrait of an increasingly unhinged thief . James Garner enthusiasts might be surprised to see the star play a villain . Furthermore  John Marley is very good as a cunning old man and remaining support cast is pretty well . There appears Spaghetti's ordinary actors such as Ken Clark  Wayde Preston  Steffen Zacharias  Fausto Tozzi  Bruno Corazzari  Angelo Infanti  Luciano Rossi  Barta Barry  among others.The musician Gianni Ferrio composes a vibrant soundtrack and well conducted  including a catching leitmotif and considered to be one of the best . In addition  a marvelous song at the beginning titled Other men's gold  with lyrics by Bill Martin and Phil Coulter  sung by Stefan Grossman . Atmospheric scenario with barren outdoors  dirty landscapes under sunny exteriors and a shimmer sun and fine sets by production designer Mario Chiari with striking cinematography by Luigi Kuiveiller . The picture resulted to be shot entirely on location in Almeria  Spain  where in the 60s and 70s had been shot innumerable RavioliPaella Westerns  and interiors in Dino De Laurentiis Cinematographica S.A.  Rome . The motion picture was well written by Frank Kowalski ad Vic Morrow who also directed . While Morrow was filming Twilight zone  the movie  he was unfortunately killed on the early morning hours of July 23 1982 in a tragic freak accident on the set while filming a scene involving a helicopter which crashed right on top of him and two young children . Rating  6'5  acceptable Spaghetti with good lead from James Garner .".

	schema:reviewBody "A Man Called Sledge is unique among the spaghetti westerns I have seen so far because it is the only one directed by an American. Vic Morrow must have been a big fan of spaghetti westerns himself because he really got it right. It must have been a lot of fun for an American director to go to Spain and Italy to shoot an authentic spaghetti western back when the genre was still being pumped out.I wasn't expecting much spaghetti style from this film because I knew it was by an American director with mainly American actors but the movie really surprised me. It's nowhere near the very top of the spaghetti meter but on the other hand you would never mistake this one for a Hollywood western. It's got Italian written all over it. The music score by Gianni Ferrio is quite good. A couple of parts sound a little too much like jazz for me but most of it is wellsuited for the genre especially the tunes with vocals and overthetop cheesy lyrics.Don't let the fact that this movie is one of the laterera spaghetti westerns and has James Garner in it fool you into thinking it's one of those goofy comedy type of Eurowesterns. There are a couple of funny lines in the film but overall it's very serious and tragic with plenty of violence and action. This is not a happy film at all which is definitely a good thing in this case.The production values and acting are aboveaverage for a Eurowestern. James Garner and Dennis Weaver both of whom have usually portrayed happyfunny dogooders in American films and television shows do an excellent job here in their roles as seriously bad people. Casting them for those parts was probably done for effect. It reminds me of how Leone used Henry Fonda as the evil character in Once Upon a Time in the West.This is one that is definitely worth seeing if you are into Eurowesterns.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must confess to umming and ahhing a fair bit as to whether I really wanted to see this film. I've got nothing against James Garner but he just didn't say spaghetti western protagonist to me. He doesn't have that certain kill look in his eye think Eastwood Nero Gemma Steffen et el. However having always respected Howard Hughes' Essentials book this was one of the few films that he had covered so far that I had not seen  and his recommendations had generally not disappointed. I am really glad that I did dispel these initial reservations because Man Called Sledge makes great viewing from beginning to end.Luther Sledge Garner is introduced to us as he enters a bar with one of his cohorts. Leaving his colleague to participate in an illfated card game Sledge reunites himself with his lover Ria Laura Antonelli. After a night of passion lucky man! he is woken by the sound of a gunshot. He returns to the bar to find his partner dead and forced to defend himself against the killers. An old timer witness John Marley confirms that Sledge has merely defended himself.Sledge and the old timer soon cross paths again with the former assuming that he is being tracked due to the price on his head. However it soon transpires that the old man has been spying on a delivery of gold. This gold is transported by a posse of armed guards and stored in a top security prison overnight. The old man recounts how he spent time in the jail with his cell sitting side by side to the safe.The lure of the gold is too much for Sledge and he is soon devising a scheme to get his hands on the horde and allow him to settle down and lead an honest life with Ria. And what better way to get access to the treasure than to find ones self imprisoned in the jail......A simple yet highly enjoyable idea for a story with double crossing aplenty and a cracking soundtrack. If truth be told I am still not completely sold on Messrs Garner and Weaver in the spaghetti genre but the film itself more than makes up for such minor grumbles. There are some great scenes with Sledge's wilful imprisonment with some very shady characters forming his prison mates a particular highlight.Highlighly recommended and grasping at a possible must view berth.".

	schema:headline " A Terrific Spaghetti Western with James Garner and Dennis Weaver!";
	schema:reviewBody "Many American leading men trailed Clint Eastwood to Europe during the heyday of the Spaghetti western in the 1960s and 1970s. Reportedly not only did Lee Van Cleef achieve superstar status on the continent but he also surpassed Eastwood's popularity in westerns. Burt Reynolds took top billing in Sergio Corbucci's Navajo Joe about a vengeful redskin. Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson tangled in Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time in the West. James Coburn and Eli Wallach anted up for a couple of oaters. Most American stars were either solidly established or whose careers were riding the rails to the big sundown such as Guy Madison Rod Cameron Stewart Granger John Ireland Yul Brynner etc. Surprisingly lightweight leading man James Garner crossed the Atlantic for War  Peace producer Dino De Laurentiis to star in a savage western A Man Called Sledge with former Combat star Vic Morrow at the helm. Fellow Combat alumnus Frank Kowlaski coscripted A Man Called Sledge with Morrow. This formulaic shoot'em up saga qualifies as James Garner's most unusual role. The Maverick star shunned his affable image to play against type as a noholds barred outlaw who is clearly on the wrong side of the law. Dennis Weaver of Gunsmoke Claude Akins of Return of the Seven and Colt .45 star Wade Preston fleshed out the Sledge cast along with fellow Americans Ken Clark and Tony Young. Shot on location by seasoned lenser Luigi Kuveiller against the sheer raw beauty of Spain this frontier western adventure told a tale about greed and revenge. Essentially Sledge emerged as an impossible heist western similar to director Don Taylor's The 5Man Army 1969 with Peter Graves and James Daly.A Man Called Sledge opensin Sergio Corbucci countrywith Luther Sledge James Garner and Mallory Tony Young of Taggart robbing a stagecoach on a snowy mountain trail. During the holdup the shotgun guard chucks his weapon. Incredibly a freak accidentthat neither Sledge nor Mallory anticipatedoccurs. The shotgun discharges and kills the driver. Talk about coincidence! Sledge and Mallory make off with the loot to a secluded saloon known as 'the 3 Ws. They feel awful about the accidental death of the driver. Sledge has come to meet his girlfriend Ria Laura Antonelli of Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs and he joins her upstairs in a room. Overconfident Mallory decides to play poker. You're the worse poker player I ever saw Sledge reminds Mallory. Ironically Mallory wins hand after hand. Triumphantly as he gathers his fortune Mallory observes I just made a killing and evil Floyd Ken Clark of Attack of the Giant Leeches shoots him in the back. Sledge stumbles down the stairs and finds Mallory dead on the floor. Floyd and his cohorts ridicule Sledge. Sledge whips out Mallory's pistol and guns them both down. An old man John Marley of Love Story witnesses the gunfight. Later Sledge intercepts him in Rockville and suspects him for being a bounty hunter. The old man goes berserk after Sledge trusses him up so he cannot watch an escort of 40armed riders take a gold payroll into a nearly prison for safekeeping. He explains that the riders lock up the goldusually about 300thousand worthin the prison vault overnight before they continue to the clear house.The old man recounts his prison days. I never could sleep when that gold was next to me. You know gold gives off a scent. It's like an animal or a man. Paper money don't throw off a scent. Paper money don't whisper to you like gold does through six inches of steel. Sledge decides to steal the gold but Ward Dennis Weaver and Hooker Claude Atkins are leery about the heist. Similarly Sledge reveals a lot about himself when he says I ain't kidding myself that it is the last. I'm gonna finish my life with a white picket fence and the little woman making biscuits. Me sprouting gray like a tree in the fall. I wanna go out with a bullet in my head or a rope around my neck. I want a little taste of living before I go. Sledge and company follow the gold from mine to prison but find no flaw in the security precautions. They ride into Rockville for supplies and the Old Man poses as a head of a westbound family and an arsenal of weapons. I feel like one of those Eastern war profiteers Sims confides in Rockville Sheriff Ripley Wade Preston that the Old Man bought enough firepower to save Custer. When Ripley enters the store Sledge pokes a gun in his back. Another gunfight erupts and a Sledge man dies in a murderous crossfire. After the death of one of their own Ward and Hooker are really reluctant about the gold shipment robbery until Sledge devises a daring plan. Since they cannot take it from the outside Sledge proposes to take it in the prison. Ward poses as Deputy Marshall and gains entrance to the prison because he has Sledge in his custody. They put Sledge in solitary with the rest of the other loonies and Sledge breaks out with Ward's help. Morrow generates considerable suspense in solitary with their breakout. The way that Sledge gets out of being taken by Ripley to the Rockville City Jail is clever too.Thematically A Man Called Sledge concerns greed and the song 'The Curse that Follows Other Men's Gold' summarizes the storyline. Everybody is after somebody else's gold and greed consumes them to the point that nothing else matters. This western boasts some irony so that the action contains greater depth. Mallory wins at cards but loses his life. Audaciously Sledge engineers a way into the worst prison in the Southwest where the authorities would dearly love to incarcerate him. Later he lashes a crucifix to his hand so he can fire his gun. A Man Called Sledge qualifies a gritty but entertaining Italian western!".

Dennis Weaver of Gunsmoke Claude Akins of Return of the Seven and Colt .45 star Wade Preston fleshed out the Sledge cast along with fellow Americans Ken Clark and Tony Young. Shot on location by seasoned lenser Luigi Kuveiller against the sheer raw beauty of Spain this frontier western adventure told a tale about greed and revenge. Essentially Sledge emerged as an impossible heist western similar to director Don Taylor's The 5Man Army 1969 with Peter Graves and James Daly.A Man Called Sledge opensin Sergio Corbucci countrywith Luther Sledge James Garner and Mallory Tony Young of Taggart robbing a stagecoach on a snowy mountain trail. During the holdup the shotgun guard chucks his weapon. Incredibly a freak accidentthat neither Sledge nor Mallory anticipatedoccurs. The shotgun discharges and kills the driver. Talk about coincidence! Sledge and Mallory make off with the loot to a secluded saloon known as 'the 3 Ws. They feel awful about the accidental death of the driver. Sledge has come to meet his girlfriend Ria Laura Antonelli of Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs and he joins her upstairs in a room. Overconfident Mallory decides to play poker. You're the worse poker player I ever saw Sledge reminds Mallory. Ironically Mallory wins hand after hand. Triumphantly as he gathers his fortune Mallory observes I just made a killing and evil Floyd Ken Clark of Attack of the Giant Leeches shoots him in the back. Sledge stumbles down the stairs and finds Mallory dead on the floor. Floyd and his cohorts ridicule Sledge. Sledge whips out Mallory's pistol and guns them both down. An old man John Marley of Love Story witnesses the gunfight. Later Sledge intercepts him in Rockville and suspects him for being a bounty hunter. The old man goes berserk after Sledge trusses him up so he cannot watch an escort of 40armed riders take a gold payroll into a nearly prison for safekeeping. He explains that the riders lock up the goldusually about 300thousand worthin the prison vault overnight before they continue to the clear house.The old man recounts his prison days. I never could sleep when that gold was next to me. You know gold gives off a scent. It's like an animal or a man. Paper money don't throw off a scent. Paper money don't whisper to you like gold does through six inches of steel. Sledge decides to steal the gold but Ward Dennis Weaver and Hooker Claude Atkins are leery about the heist. Similarly Sledge reveals a lot about himself when he says I ain't kidding myself that it is the last. I'm gonna finish my life with a white picket fence and the little woman making biscuits. Me sprouting gray like a tree in the fall. I wanna go out with a bullet in my head or a rope around my neck. I want a little taste of living before I go. Sledge and company follow the gold from mine to prison but find no flaw in the security precautions. They ride into Rockville for supplies and the Old Man poses as a head of a westbound family and an arsenal of weapons. I feel like one of those Eastern war profiteers Sims confides in Rockville Sheriff Ripley Wade Preston that the Old Man bought enough firepower to save Custer. When Ripley enters the store Sledge pokes a gun in his back. Another gunfight erupts and a Sledge man dies in a murderous crossfire. After the death of one of their own Ward and Hooker are really reluctant about the gold shipment robbery until Sledge devises a daring plan. Since they cannot take it from the outside Sledge proposes to take it in the prison. Ward poses as Deputy Marshall and gains entrance to the prison because he has Sledge in his custody. They put Sledge in solitary with the rest of the other loonies and Sledge breaks out with Ward's help. Morrow generates considerable suspense in solitary with their breakout. The way that Sledge gets out of being taken by Ripley to the Rockville City Jail is clever too.Thematically A Man Called Sledge concerns greed and the song 'The Curse that Follows Other Men's Gold' summarizes the storyline. Everybody is after somebody else's gold and greed consumes them to the point that nothing else matters. This western boasts some irony so that the action contains greater depth. Mallory wins at cards but loses his life. Audaciously Sledge engineers a way into the worst prison in the Southwest where the authorities would dearly love to incarcerate him. Later he lashes a crucifix to his hand so he can fire his gun. A Man Called Sledge qualifies a gritty but entertaining Italian western!";

Imprisoning yourself to steal the gold and then playing a winner take all poker game to leave one man standing with everything then the losers hunting him down. Sounds bloody great but it isn't at all. I quite disliked James Garner as the lead thought he was quite bland. Dennis Weaver should have been cast as Sledge he would have brought intensity to the role. Imprisoning themselves at a high security prison relying on the fact that Sledge won't be searched and be stuck locked up for ever seems too heavy a risk. They kept showing who was winning and losing in the poker and their expressions and outbursts but never actually showing the poker or discussing it. It's like the script says poker scene and it's basically a blank page such a shame. Then you have the old man who seems to all of a sudden be in charge of this group once Sledge is gone why are they trying to go up against their gun slinging leader with this stranger he didn't do them wrong at all and they know they can't beat him.".

How do the boys and their gear get up on the roof of the bank building? Rocket assisted grappling hook mortars firing mountain lines and Jumar ascenders from the parking lot. You won't see that scene anymore either. Man I miss the Corned Beefs at the Belden Deli on Clark where Frank hands the stones to Gags. Long gone. But if you are in Chicago stop in early at the Green Mill and you might be able to have a drink in that big round wood booth  still there. Great gun  car flick. Frank's .45 looks like a Bomar Svenson custom combat tremendous. Watch for the High Standard 12 guage stakeout special at the end  very rare. Take a drive up north on Western Avenue to check out all the used car lots  still there. Great locations. Yup the creme was ALWAYS cottage cheese at the old Oasis restuarants. Yuch! You know  Tuesday Weld actually even ACTS a little in this movie amazing. Man that was a gorgeous house in my old neighborhood and yes they blew it up. Notice when they are snuggling on the outdoor patio  it had a twosided fireplace  indoor and outdoor. Probably the best Chicago movie ever. The phone book and trash can  time honored tools of the early 80's. When I saw it opening night the theater was filled with every crook and detective on the north side with their wives. And everybody just nodded to each other on the way out. Those days are gone but not forgotten. Great great flick. Cool TD soundtrack album too. Also probably the best metallurgical movie ever.

	schema:headline " Michael Mann's best movie with James Caan' best performance. 'Thief' is a hardboiled crime classic not to be missed!";
	schema:reviewBody "'Thief' is one of the most underrated movies of the 1980s if not of all time. Made in the early 80s by TV veteran Michael Mann and coproduced by the future king of action blockbusters Jerry Bruckheimer this movie can almost be seen as the transition from 1970s character based crime DRAMA to 1980s flashy but brainless 1980s crime ACTION. In that sense 'Thief' is the last great 1970s movie of the 1980s. Mann made at least two great movies after this 'Manhunter' and 'Heat' but I still think it is is his best and most satisfying work. James Caan believes that the movie contains his finest performance and I'm inclined to agree with him. Caan is dynamite throughout. He oozes charisma and is impossible to take your eyes off but also gives a subtle and complex performance. The film works both as an exciting caper movie and as a human drama. In many ways it is the best crime film to pull that off since Dassin's 'Rififi' in the mid 1950s. Cann is helped by a superb supporting cast who on the surface may seem a motley bunch but all are very good  Tuesday Weld 'Who'll Stop The Rain' Jim Belushi his movie debut a memorable cameo from country legend Willie Nelson and especially a fantastic turn from Robert Prosky. Prosky is probably best known to most viewers as the kindly fatherfigure he played in 'Hill Street Blues'. His turn here as a ruthless gangster is a complete eye opener! Prosky delivers one of the most vicious lines ever heard in a movie which is a bit too extreme for me to quote here but believe me you will never forget it when you hear it! Many people seem to find Tangerine Dream's dated synth score to be extremely irritating but I actually enjoyed it and thought it helped build the mood. 'Thief' is a hardboiled crime classic and is highly recommended to any fan of the genre especially those made in the 1970s. It is wildly underrated and deserves to be rediscovered by a larger audience. 'Thief' is simply one of THE great lost classics of the last thirty years.".

James Caan said once that this was the film he was in that he was proudest of next to The Godfather. I remember that Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel said this was one of the finest films of 1981. Caan is wonderful in a role that he was born to play a tough guy with his heart on his sleeve. Everything about this film is wonderful from the musical score by Tangerine Dream to the dark lighting effects to the authentic detail about the life of a thief  I read that Michael Mann actually used real life thieves as technical advisors to this film!. Even though Caan's character is an antihero you have to feel sorry for him because he is caught in a situation where there is no way out! The best scene in the film is where he tells Tuesday Weld about his prison experiences and shows here the picture cut out that he has made of his American dream. Jimmy Caan is truly awesome he is the only actor that ever made me cry in Brian's Song I also wanted to mention another great character actor who is in the film. His name is Robert Prosky and he plays the mob boss who uses Caan. This was his film debut after many years as a stage actor and he is terrific. Watch the scene in the acid plant where he threatens Caan. He is really chilling! Michael Mann created Crime Story and Miami Vice and he also directed Manhunter but lets not forget this film as well.".

All the locations are really there or were at one time and the settings didn't have to be faked up.

Of course some of the techniques to steal are dated but I loved the glossy yet gritty atmosphere of the film. Tuesday Weld was also quite good as Caan's love interest. It has an amazing ending as well.The film is Waaaaaaay ahead of its time. And I was genuinely impressed with James Caans performance. This film is an underrated gem and should be viewed by Mann fans who liked Heat and Collateral.810".

	schema:headline " Movie Review Thief 1981";
	schema:reviewBody "Thief made way back in 1981 was Michael Mann's directorial debut and it is a fascinating heist film that has a lot more to it than you might think. Sure it is a movie about a professional jewel thief and there are extended sequences throughout the film depicting his expertise however I think the core of this movie is about relationships. It's about the type of relationships a person needs to have in order to live a rewarding life.James Caan stars as the expert thief named Frank. Caan gives a remarkable performance in the title role creating a multilayered character that is rarely seen in these types of movies. The movie shows us just how good Frank is at his job in the opening scene by showing him cracking a safe with tremendous ease. However after he finishes the job we see that there is more to Frank than just a jewel thief. He owns a car dealership and a restaurant and he also makes a promise to break his mentor and father figure Okla Willie Nelson out of prison. But to complete the picture Frank needs a woman. In the memorable diner sequence Frank opens his heart to a virtual stranger Tuesday Weld and they eventually get married.Frank needs these relationships to be able to move on from his passion for theft and live a controlled settleddown life style. In order to be able to retire much sooner Frank sets up one more job with a powerful crime boss named Leo Robert Prosky. Leo appears to be nice on the outside and tries to take Frank under his wing but when Frank stays true to his desire of getting in and getting out things take a turn for the worse. This is a rare thriller film that has a lot of character development and also retains a fast pace throughout. From the great performances to the breathtaking score by Tangerine Dream this is a film that is full of Mann trademarks from start to finish. It is one of his best works to date that is even good enough to draw inevitable comparisons to his future films such as Heat Manhunter and Public Enemies. The only thing that disappointed me in this film was the ending. While I applaud the film for not choosing to travel the happily ever after route I still don't think the movie ended on quite the right note. Even though the final sequence is a heartpounding sequence of cat and mouse I'm not sure it did justice to the relationships and the development that Frank's character made and experienced throughout the film. This is a film that was not initially successful in commercial terms but as Mann's name has turned into one that is synonymous with crime sagas the film's popularity has increased since its initial theatrical release. A lot of that is due to the performance of James Caan which is as good as anything he has ever done. He creates in my opinion one of the best characters ever to be featured in a Mann film. The movie is so smart and professionally made that it is definitely a film that anyone would enjoy. Ranking among Mann's best alltime work Thief is a mesmerizing entry in the crime genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie that started his career and what a way to start. Realism is played out to the hilt and nothing is left to chance with this brilliant book to movie adaptation. James Caan is at the top of his game and wows you. Caan is Frank a professional safecracker who is successful and single. After pulling a heist he finds himself in a unique position. A powerful boss offers Frank phenomenal jobs and a huge cut of the action if he will work for him and for him exclusively. Frank is impressed by his stature and agrees. However the local crooked cops turn up the heat on Frank and want in. And Frank's new crime family wants more than his services. So Frank is forced to fight back and prove he is not only the best thief but the toughest crook in Chicago. The supporting cast was hand picked and it's easy to tell. I never thought I would hear myself say this but Willie Nelson does a fine job acting at least in this. Same goes of course to Jim Belushi. I have surprised myself twice in two sentences. James Caan really convinces you he is the real deal and it's the role of a lifetime. His acting is second to none and perhaps the best of the three signature Michael Mann antiheroes. What surprised me the most about this movie was not just the realism of it but that the love interest side of the story was convincing as well. That came as quite a shock to this viewer. He does love and care for his wife and she loves him without reservation. It makes the ending all the more tragic. This film needs to be viewed by anyone who enjoys crime films mob films or Mann films. My favorite movie of 1981.".

He's working his way out to a normal life but after being lured to a big job for the mob he finds plans on both sides severely altered.For his first full length theatrical feature Michael Mann announced himself to the film world with some distinction and in the process showed everyone what style of film making makes him tick. Thief is a film of stylised grit visually thematically and narratively. Set and filmed in Chicago Mann aided by Thorin shoots the story through pure neonoir filters.At nighttime it is all a beautifully neon drenched haze where the streets shimmer with dampness a dampness brought about by the rain and god knows what else! By day there's a sweaty hue a feeling that the heat is well and truly on that even in daylight Frank isn't safe his dreams may be a touch too far to reach. And no matter what the scene or scenario Tangerine Dream are laying over the top a throbbing pulse beat it's like The Warriors trying to get back to Coney Island the music has a sense of dread about it that danger is at every corner.This part of Chicago stinks it's a vile and corrupt place. Dirty cops everywhere underworld criminals ruling the roost  Hell! You can even buy a baby if you want one. Is it any wonder that Frank just wants to settle down with a wife and child to walk barefooted in the sea to have domesticity? But Frank as smart tough and savvy as he is seems to thrive on the edge of things with Mann giving him earthy and honest dialogue to engage us with marking him out as an identifiable every man protagonist who just happens to be an exceptional thief.Mann's attention to detail is on show straight away none more so than with the two key safe cracking jobs that are undertaken. Using genuine jewel thieves as technical advisers on the film these sequences ooze realism from the tools used the preplanning and the execution of the takes it smacks of reality and does justice to the genuine feel of the characterisations brought alive by the superb cast. And finally Mann delivers a finale of ambiguity a noir shaded piece of abruptness an ending that perfectly fits the whole production. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "I came across this movie because of my boyfriend he swore that this ending was one of the best endings in a movie he had ever seen. But being the ultimate film buff and being a fan of James Caan I wanted to see the whole movie so we watched it together. This is a tight and suspenseful thriller that is like a little gem of 1981. James Caan is such a terrific actor so I was interested in seeing him in a lead role to see if he could carry a movie by himself and he did do an excellent job. Michael Mann this is one of his first movies so it's really cool to see where he has come from and even back in 1981 he had this definite talent that has taken him so far. The story may be a bit basic the rise and fall of someone who has hit the top but once they want to pull away it starts to crumble. But if told in the right way we can get a terrific film and Thief proves itself to be a good thriller.Frank is an expert jewel thief and hardboiled exconvict with a set structure to his life. With a pair of successful Chicago businesses as fronts for his very lucrative criminal enterprise Frank sets out to fulfill the missing part of his dream a family beginning with Jessie. After taking down a major score Frank's fence is murdered. He finds out that the man responsible is a Mr. Attaglia a shady plating company executive for whom the fence was working. Attaglia is in possession of money that belongs to Frank who demands it back. This leads to a facetoface meeting with Attaglia's employer Leo a highlevel fence and crime boss who wants Frank to work for him offering him boxcar profits. Frank is reluctant at first but wanting to make his dream come to fruition faster he agrees to do just one job. But after the job is done Frank soon realizes that Leo is not so easy to let him go.The only complaint is pretty minor I was a little stumped by the movie's soundtrack it did throw me off a bit. But I think that's all part of the 80's films genre very odd music in the background. It's all good we have a terrific supporting cast with Robert Prosky James Belushi and Tuesday Weld even Willie Nelson pulls in a good strong supporting role. The whole atmosphere and the strong direction by Mann pulls this movie together very well. I'd say one of the strongest scenes is the face off between Frank and Leo when Frank is excited that he's completed his last assignment and Frank wants to just mainstream into a normal life but Leo is not going to let him go the tension was so high and created so well by the actors. It's a very dark and suspenseful film that I have to admit that I enjoyed over all I would recommend it.910".

	schema:headline " Michael Mann's cool crisp film debut";
	schema:reviewBody "Thief is a sadly overlooked and underrated feature from the superb Michael Mann. Released in 1981 it quickly came and went at cinemas. A sad fate for such a fantastic crime caper. Even at the beginning of his career Michael Mann shows his natural talent for matching the right actors to his source material creating a rich and throbbing atmosphere and utilising excellent direction to create a very successful package.Thief is not like many crime capers. Why this one has such resonance is because it's inhabited by people you really feel you'd meet in real life. And James Caan is the emotional centre. Caan has never been better and this must rank as the best performance of his career Misery is second.Thief introduces Caan's character Frank in a truly superb opening scene. A robbery rich in intensity and atmosphere. Frank is an expert safecracker pulling off a diamond heist. Its a great opener. We watch Frank crack open a safe and what surprises is how realistic it looks. It all appears as a carefully planned operation. It takes us through the paces of an actual robbery. We see Frank use an acetylene torch and acts like he actually knows how to use one. Its helped no end by the throbbing musical score by Tangerine Dream.What separates Michael Mann's crime thrillers from your standard run of the mill cops and robbers show is he knows how to sketch plausible characters. And Frank is one of Mann's most well defined and truest.Frank may be a thief but he is a real person. And one of the most touching aspects of his character is his desire to live a normal life. He's a good thief and fronts his criminal dealings with legit businesses like a car dealership and a bar. But burning within him is an urge to kiss off this life and start a new one.We learn about this desire in one of Thief's most memorable moments. A ten minute scene where he opens up to Jessie Tuesday Weld a waitress in a diner. Mann crafts some thoughtful and haunting dialogue in this film and especially in this scene it really resonates. Mann is known for his talky thrillers and in this one scene Mann allows the camera to just stay fixed on these people and let them share confidences.Frank may hide behind a cynical front. Its whats allowed him to survive in this game. But his cynicism hides a more vulnerable side. Frank has spent time in prison and while he was there he befriended Okla Willie Nelson a fellow thief. Okla took Frank under his wing and the two men became lifelong friends. They both made a vow that once they got out they would turn their lives around. Frank shows Jessie a collage of a home a family and a job. Incongruous images that Frank somehow believes he can make a reality. He shares all of this with Jessie hoping that she will be a part of that dream.Although Frank wants to quit his life of crime he understands he may have to dabble in it to leave it behind. He believes he's found his chance when Leo expertly played by Robert Prosky a Mafia kingpin hires his services for a diamond heist. Leo seems a genial friendly even paternal boss. And as an added bonus he helps Frank to achieve his ambitions. He provides him with a nice house an adopted child since Jessie can't conceive and Frank's status as an excon prohibits him from acquiring one legally as well as a job. What more could he ask?But there are complications. The police are monitoring Frank's movements. His phone is bugged. Its as if the whole world suddenly knows who he is. But he persists with the job. And it comes off without a hitch. Then payday comes. And the beginning of Frank's new life. Only it doesn't happen.Leo makes it clear he has no intention of letting Frank go. He's a valuable commodity. He's a part of the family business now. And family members don't walk out. Leo's made sure of that. He provided Frank with his wonderful new life. He can take it away just as easily. And if it means Jessie and their son have to die in the process so be it.Robert Prosky is a total revelation in this scene. Every film I've seen him in he's played kind warm grandfatherly types. And for the first half of Thief that's the way he seems. But when Frank wants to leave Prosky carefully modulates his performance. Mann shoots the scene from Frank's POV with Leo towering over him in an upsidedown angle. The warm smile is gone.

Truthfully Frank has to get them as far away from him and Leo as possible.Frank burns his bridges in the end and it all culminates in a grand final showdown between he and Leo. A last desperate bid to gain his freedom. Its quite a sad ending really. Especially because we wanted everything to work out for Frank. But Mann pulls no punches. That's what keeps him ahead of the game compared to most filmmakers.Thief is a truly excellent film. Compelling saddening and very exciting. James Caan has every right to be proud of this film.

	onyx:emotionText "Thief is a sadly overlooked and underrated feature from the superb Michael Mann. Released in 1981 it quickly came and went at cinemas. A sad fate for such a fantastic crime caper. Even at the beginning of his career Michael Mann shows his natural talent for matching the right actors to his source material creating a rich and throbbing atmosphere and utilising excellent direction to create a very successful package.Thief is not like many crime capers. Why this one has such resonance is because it's inhabited by people you really feel you'd meet in real life. And James Caan is the emotional centre. Caan has never been better and this must rank as the best performance of his career Misery is second.Thief introduces Caan's character Frank in a truly superb opening scene. A robbery rich in intensity and atmosphere. Frank is an expert safecracker pulling off a diamond heist. Its a great opener. We watch Frank crack open a safe and what surprises is how realistic it looks. It all appears as a carefully planned operation. It takes us through the paces of an actual robbery. We see Frank use an acetylene torch and acts like he actually knows how to use one. Its helped no end by the throbbing musical score by Tangerine Dream.What separates Michael Mann's crime thrillers from your standard run of the mill cops and robbers show is he knows how to sketch plausible characters. And Frank is one of Mann's most well defined and truest.Frank may be a thief but he is a real person. And one of the most touching aspects of his character is his desire to live a normal life. He's a good thief and fronts his criminal dealings with legit businesses like a car dealership and a bar. But burning within him is an urge to kiss off this life and start a new one.We learn about this desire in one of Thief's most memorable moments. A ten minute scene where he opens up to Jessie Tuesday Weld a waitress in a diner. Mann crafts some thoughtful and haunting dialogue in this film and especially in this scene it really resonates. Mann is known for his talky thrillers and in this one scene Mann allows the camera to just stay fixed on these people and let them share confidences.Frank may hide behind a cynical front. Its whats allowed him to survive in this game. But his cynicism hides a more vulnerable side. Frank has spent time in prison and while he was there he befriended Okla Willie Nelson a fellow thief. Okla took Frank under his wing and the two men became lifelong friends. They both made a vow that once they got out they would turn their lives around. Frank shows Jessie a collage of a home a family and a job. Incongruous images that Frank somehow believes he can make a reality. He shares all of this with Jessie hoping that she will be a part of that dream.Although Frank wants to quit his life of crime he understands he may have to dabble in it to leave it behind. He believes he's found his chance when Leo expertly played by Robert Prosky a Mafia kingpin hires his services for a diamond heist. Leo seems a genial friendly even paternal boss. And as an added bonus he helps Frank to achieve his ambitions. He provides him with a nice house an adopted child since Jessie can't conceive and Frank's status as an excon prohibits him from acquiring one legally as well as a job. What more could he ask?But there are complications. The police are monitoring Frank's movements. His phone is bugged. Its as if the whole world suddenly knows who he is. But he persists with the job. And it comes off without a hitch. Then payday comes. And the beginning of Frank's new life. Only it doesn't happen.Leo makes it clear he has no intention of letting Frank go. He's a valuable commodity. He's a part of the family business now. And family members don't walk out. Leo's made sure of that. He provided Frank with his wonderful new life. He can take it away just as easily. And if it means Jessie and their son have to die in the process so be it.Robert Prosky is a total revelation in this scene. Every film I've seen him in he's played kind warm grandfatherly types. And for the first half of Thief that's the way he seems. But when Frank wants to leave Prosky carefully modulates his performance. Mann shoots the scene from Frank's POV with Leo towering over him in an upsidedown angle. The warm smile is gone. Replaced by a cold steelyeyed implacability. Its at this point you realise what a monster Leo really is.The ending is quite a powderkeg of conflicting emotions and lost hopes and dreams. Frank has to effectively cut himself off from all ties to life. He sends Jessie and their son packing under the false pretence of not wanting them around anymore. Truthfully Frank has to get them as far away from him and Leo as possible.Frank burns his bridges in the end and it all culminates in a grand final showdown between he and Leo.

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Mann is one of my favorite directors and James Caan has always impressed me with his acting. So going in to see this one way back in 1981 I was ready for a good time. I wasn't disappointed and today I still feel the same way this is definitely one of the best stories about gangsters I've seen. Only Goodfellas 1990 comes to mind for comparison but only from the perspective of authenticity of content.Although this is a story with gangsters and cops  all bad  it's not a story about them per se. And although this is a story with two safecracking heists it's not a story about how or why they rob and steal or even how clever they are to do what they do. And they are clever as you will see...No  this really is a story about loyalty trust and rugged individualism  themes that have been entrenched within the American psyche since the Revolution.Michael Mann is very clever he's taken a prosaic look at how an excon has made his American dream while keeping his finger in the illicit honey pot doing more than very well to get by totally independent as befitting a tough gogetter and unwilling to bend to anybody else's whims or fancies. As Frank James Caan is the epitome of the goodbad tough guy who robs the rich to keep himself  and his small band of thieves  from going poor in a society that values independence above all.Transposed to another time and Frank was Butch Cassidy robbing trains and banks to keep his HoleintheWall gang gungho while making bank managers and train barons cry.Enter the Mob they want Frank to work for Them. He agrees finally but stipulates conditions. The job is done and done well it's a big score and Frank surpasses expectations. His reward equity in the Firm  which Frank despises  and a pittance in real cash. Result chaos...as Frank goes on a rampage to end Their lives and in doing so end his own again something that he'd already done many times in his head already.You see  it's Frank's psychology that They don't get because he's like an ancient Japanese ronin  ready to die at a moment's notice without any thought in order to keep his sacred independence. So what They get instead is a steady diet of lead as Frank literally wipes the floor with them or at least one of them leaving Frank to wander away from his carnage and just maybe a new beginning.Throughout all of this grand almosttragedy the score by Tangerine Dream suffuses the body and the mind pulsating rhythmic demanding unrelenting  an auditory extravaganza that matches the action perfectly. Add the Mann touch to cinematography and the Chicago miseenscene and you have a film that is a joy to watch.Mention must be made of the supporting cast Tuesday Weld is a knockout newcomers Robert Prosky is suitably avuncular yet menacing and James Belushi is the sharp electronics whiz for Frank's work. Other newcomers were Dennis Farina and William Petersen in a small role as a bar bouncer. And the technical consultants were real excops and real exthieves. What more could you want for a movie  real bullets?Parents might not like some of the gruesome action and tough language. Otherwise it's an exceptional adult crime drama the like of which doesn't come along very often especially in today's cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Thief is a pretty interesting project. The Chicago locale is smoky and covered in blue hues the characters all seem lonely or isolated from one another and a sense of betrayal lies around every corner and plot twist. Michael Mann gives a preview of what would come in his later directed works Miami Vice and Heat and sets the stage for later stylized crimeromance flicks.Basically the plot has been done to death by now but back in the early '80s it wasn't so clich. Frank Caan is a successful professional thief who makes his living with a small loyal crew and operates under the front of a used car dealership. When a client is killed and some of his money is stolen Frank goes out to find the perpetrators and finds himself involved in a deep underworld ring connecting mobsters and the police. As per usual Frank is willing to do one last job in order to make enough money to retire with his sweetheart but there's always a catch when making deals with serious highlevel criminal organizations. Still it's pulled off pretty well. There are not specific twists so much as wellplaced acts and interesting thematic choices for instance the big score or hit or whathaveyou is given pretty minimal coverage when it happens. The cast is effective. James Caan is as angry as he ever gets Tuesday Weld is downkey and melancholy Robert Prosky plays an unusually vulgar crime boss Willie Nelson looks like he's about to cry every time you see him and Jim Belushi comes across as a dopey likable manchild. Of course plotwise James Caan's character Frank functions as the hub around which all of their fates revolve.There are a few weird moments. The conversation between Frank and Jessie Caan and Tuesday Weld at the coffee shop at night goes on for much longer than it needs to. Frank's scrapbook picture is a little bit... hokey or overly sentimental but who knows maybe badass thieves and killers have cheesy soft artistic expressions? and the soundtrack at times seems out of place. Don't get me wrong  the soundtrack is fantastic. It's by the German electronica group Tangerine Dream. I generally love Tangerine Dream but there are moments here when the music doesn't quite fit thematically i.e. during the big safe job. It does not bother me but folks who don't dig the extreme '80s synthtechno aesthetic might be irritated. As a standalone the soundtrack rules but with the film it can get a little overthetop. But the appearance of the Beach Theme is truly awesome haha This movie is interesting for doing a number of things that seemed ahead of its time. At moments I was reminded of a darker version of the Peckinpah film The Killer Elite also with James Caan and obviously some of the sad desperate themes from Mann's big '90s achievement Heat. Also in line with Heat are the blue hues the electronic music the heartbroken romance which here has equal elements of DePalma's Carlito's Way and the Tarantinopenned True Romance and a good look at the criminal underworld.Another DePalma movie Scarface also explores themes initially found here. Like Tony Montana after him Caan's Frank is a lone wolf in the underworld. He has equally violent and kindhearted streaks yet his destructive emotions tend to betray his best interests. Thus Frank like Montana is complex because he is both unlikable and angry and yet a far better person than his criminal counterparts in the underworld.Thief is certainly recommended for any fans of James Caan Michael Mann underworld crimethrillers or any of the films mentioned above.".

There are a few other firsts tied to this film. The score by electronica mavens Tangerine Dream set a standard for film scores to follow with their sleek throbbing beats and incessant thematic melodies running just below the surface of each scene.

Frank has invested fairly well putting his money into several businesses including a used car lot and a nightclub Chicago's famous The Green Mill.As Jessie Tuesday Weld's character seems carved from her role in Who'll Stop The Rain or perhaps is an extension of that role. She was involved with a man who bought drugs from the Colombians and when a deal went bad and he was killed she found herself on the streets of Bogota. Now living a quiet unassuming life of drudgery in Chicago she has convinced herself she is happy. When Frank comes along she resists involvement until he spells out his plan for a new life with family and freedom. Unfortunately she does not know what she is getting herself into even though Caan is being as honest with her has he can.If Michael Mann's storytelling approach seems a bit cool it is an approach intended to be as distinctive and effective as any Forties or Fifties noir and Caan's performance ranks among his very best making Thief a crime movie worth viewing.".

Frank has invested fairly well putting his money into several businesses including a used car lot and a nightclub Chicago's famous The Green Mill.As Jessie Tuesday Weld's character seems carved from her role in Who'll Stop The Rain or perhaps is an extension of that role. She was involved with a man who bought drugs from the Colombians and when a deal went bad and he was killed she found herself on the streets of Bogota. Now living a quiet unassuming life of drudgery in Chicago she has convinced herself she is happy. When Frank comes along she resists involvement until he spells out his plan for a new life with family and freedom. Unfortunately she does not know what she is getting herself into even though Caan is being as honest with her has he can.If Michael Mann's storytelling approach seems a bit cool it is an approach intended to be as distinctive and effective as any Forties or Fifties noir and Caan's performance ranks among his very best making Thief a crime movie worth viewing.";

	schema:headline " The Best Jim Belushi movie of all time610";
	schema:reviewBody "Sarcasm aside this may actually be the best Jim Belushi film of all time but most importantly this is not the 'best James Caan film of all time'. Though it is through no fault of the performance by James Caan that this movie suffers. His performance is very good but simply stated James Caan cannot carry a movie all by himself. For example in the tearjerker 'Brian's Song' he had Billie Dee Williams and an amazing musical score to help carry the weight in 'Misery' he could only sit watch and grimace as Kathy Bates plowed through each scene stealing scene after scene. Even in 'Rollerball' I would say that the futuristic costumes and cutting edge violence in the film made the film a popular hit in its day not by any great performance by Caan. Unfortunately in 'Thief' James Caan has Jim Belushi and a soundtrack by Tangerine Dream.Why did Michael Mann cast the 'Belush'? Did he think that Jim's star was on the rise? Or was he hoping that Jim could channel some of the John's magic? In any case these are the two main points of how 'Thief' fails to deliver. 1 Having Jim Belushi as a principal star in the movie and 2 using Tangerine Dream for its soundtrack a soundtrack that is so loud and domineering that it all but drowns out almost every scene it's used in. The music by itself is fine I guess. It just feels terribly inappropriate for the movie. The jewel heist that Frank James Caan and Barry The Belush carry out for Leo Robert Prosky could have been as great as the heists pulled off in 'Rififi' or 'Le Cercle Rouge' but nooooooooo they had to use KORG synthesizers!!!!Caan does receive some help from a good yet underused supporting cast most notably from his wife Jessie Tuesday Weld and best friend Okla Willie Nelson who is terribly underused and from Leo the mob boss Robert Prosky.One of the standout scenes in the film occurs when Frank brings Jessie to a diner and spills to her the secret of his profession. Once Frank sees that Jessie doesn't back away from this information he then proposes they get married. When Jessie seems unsure of the proposal Frank puts his proposal into perspective What are you doing in your life that is so terrific. Another good scene takes place in an adoption agency where Frank and Jessie are turned down in their bid for a baby. Not only are they denied the chance for a baby but also the adoption agent makes the mistake of talking down to Frank. Frank becomes verbally abusive back to the agent in spades. By the end of the scene Frank has let everyone in the agency hear about his dissatisfaction with the adoption process and its people and eventually goes so far as to get in the face of the security guard who escorts him out. Willie Nelson's performance as Franks best friend Okla was underused and should have been in the movie more. When Frank visits Okla at the prison Okla pleads to Frank to get him an early release. Okla understands that with his 'Angina or something' he will die in prison and that isn't the way he wants to go. This scene although no longer than a couple of minutes is the most touching scene in the movie. I was blown away by Willie Nelson's performance. The scene left me hoping for more from Willie. Unfortunately Willie only had one more scene in the movie and that scene is a lame deathbed scene. Too bad.Leo the mob boss was good although it was hard for me to believe he was as tough and respected as his character seemed to be. He just looked kind of creepy like the guy who hangs out at the library everyday reading all of the newspapers. But I liked his character because he was responsible for killing Jim Belushi's character.But overall this movie is just a disappointing variation on a typical heist movie sprinkled with many good moments by its chief performers before succumbing to your standard 'guns a blazing' clichd ending. This cheap ending also denigrates from the overall potential of the film I really did want it to be better. By the end of it all Frank takes a little bit of lead but in the process he gets to blow up his house a bar his used car lot but most important of all he also gets to kill off anyone except the adoption agency who has wronged him in the movie. In fact the last image we see is of Frank walking away along an empty street where the bloody massacre has just taken place. As the credits start to roll we may think to ourselves is Frank on his way to the adoption agency to settle one more score? Or we may wonder how is it possible that with so many shots fired and so many dead bodies lying in the street and on the neatly cut lawns of the neighbors next door that no police have yet to show up no dogs are barking in fact not one neighbor has even peeped a look out to see from a window? With all of those loud gunshots they most certainly would have heard it. Well perhaps not the Tangerine Dream soundtrack was pretty loud.610.Clark Richards".

Schweiger has come a long way since DER BEWEGTE MANN Maybe Maybe Not and in the process has singlehandedly brought German cinema back to the masses after a half century of domination by the high brow author directors Herzog Fassbinder Wenders who made German cinema synonymous with boredom and inaccessibility with the masses. Since 1994 Schweiger starrers have broken German Box Office Records consistently. Here though this film did not break the Box Office Records of the others including MAENNERPENSION and KNOCKIN' ON HEAVEN'S DOORS he shows us in more dimensions why he has been the phenomenon of popular German cinema this past decade and probably beyond 2000.

Due to that I did not have any high expectations it is true that this movie tries a little too hard to become a cult classic and that some jokes do not really work out as the phone ringing a couple of times when the hitman is just about to kill some fellow but on the other hand there are some brilliant scenes. The burger robbery for an example is one of the moments in which the movie's concept really works out. Schwaiger's performance is not over the edge but he does a good Job. Ralf Richter is brilliant as always. The story has some weaknesses but somehow one does not really care as it is not the aim of the movie to tell the backgrounds of the story. I reckon it's quite a good movie and if you don't go to see this with the expectation of watching another Bang Boom Bang you won't be disappointed.".

	schema:headline " Talent is there execution is solid sometimes flawed";
	schema:reviewBody "Der Eisbr is a German 85minute movie from 1998 so this one is already almost 20 years old. The writer and director is Granz Henman and his codirector is Til Schweiger. For both it is the first effort in their respective positions here but Schweiger was of course also an established actor at this point already and it should be no surprise to anybody that he landed the lead role. For Henman it is still a contender for his most known work almost two decades later. But now let us take a look at this one here. At times it reminded me of an inferior version of Reservoir Dogs and I would not be surprised if it inspired that project. As for this one here Schweiger is fairly decent and works nicely for the main character. But there are weaknesses too. For such a relatively short film it has too many entirely forgettable scenes or scenes that even did not fit in well when it comes to realism authenticity or just convincing character development. The script could have been better on many occasions and it fits somehow looking at Henman's other famous films.But there are also good moments. Many actors in here are familiar faces in this film I won't list the names just check the cast list and these add something through their talent or charisma. I personally liked seeing Leonard Lansink Wilsberg as a pretty silent barkeeper here and the scene at the bar was indeed really fun maybe when this film was at its best. As for the ending however I was not convinced. Not only could it have been better but it also felt as if the filmmakers sacrificed realism and quality here to make it look as showy and spectacular as possibly. It may only be subjective perception and opinion but I don't like this approach at all I must say and there were enough decent moments that made me think that the film deserves a better ending for sure. And you actually even learn something in here about female sexuality and male anatomy maybe the most crucial moment of the film. Anyway this film is proof that Schweiger also can give somewhat decent performances if he wants to and it is certainly one of his better career performances maybe also because it is better than most of the stuff he has appeared in recently. The story here is so different and it is pretty bold at times. If you go bold you go wrong sometimes too but I can accept that. Just don't expect a truly epic outcome and you may have a time watching this one at least as good as I did. 6 of 10 may be a bit on the generous side but I recommend watching it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story makes no sense at all. A hired gun has to get stopped from his contract to kill a snitch with a bag of money. He misses his call gets his job done and for whatever reason he and his agent should be killed now. There is another plot involving wiring up a gangster boss car to bomb him but the car gets stolen. It even has a tracking device installed but instead of phoning home and asking for the location the beautiful assassin decides to go into a nearby bar and get drunk where she meets the hitman who instead of warning his partner that assassins will come for him soon also decides to get heavily drunk in the same bar. That is it. In fact nothing of importance is happening all the time. The car jackers subplot involves driving to a diner to steal hamburgers and is interrupted by their infantile humor. You will see many famous faces of German television who will in the end meet up in a shootout including several minutes of angry shouting at each other. The hitman gets wounded but is still able to walk away with the girl he just met. Instead of getting to a doctor and survive they get the money that is still next to the dead snitch and decide to bleed to death on a nameless state road.The obvious comparison is Pulp Fiction. While the original focuses on absurd humor and violent shootouts with great cinematography this is like the version for 14 year olds joking about penis sizes on the school yard smoking their mild tasting cigarettes. Oops I just spoilered half of the jokes the actors will narrate. The overacting and the slow pace of the movie make it really annoying to watch. You will see a bar that looks like everywhere else with a group of xenophobic regulars the rapid transit system of cologne and a noname diner. This is no way near Tarantino even though it reenacts parts of other movies all the time. Not even the Mexican standoff in the end is in any way impressive.Instead of watching this garbage I should have played a mission of Grand Theft Auto. It's storyline would have made much more sense and be way more entertaining. Luckily the protagonists died so there won't be a sequel.".

This film would have looked quite different had it been shot in 1968 or 1969 by which time the country had long since shed any illusions about the nation's role in the world. In some ways this provides a kind of still photo of the United States just prior to the Kennedy assassination and the tumultuous sequence of events that unfolded afterward.

It has a king ruling with a prime minister with the habit of employing a lot of his relatives in positions of authority.What makes it a bit different from Vietnam where we were getting drawn in bit by bit is that Sarkan also has a charismatic leader who retired DeGaulle like after Sarkan won its independence from Japanese occupation. He's the key to solving the country's problems for better or worse.Because of a past relationship with Eiji Okada who plays the Sarkanese DeGaulle Marlon Brando has been appointed ambassador to Sarkan. Back during World War II Brando and Okada worked well together doing damage to the Japanese occupiers.Problem now is that the Sarkanese see the Americans as occupiers and the Communists are exploiting the situation to the fullest. A road called Freedom Road that the USA is constructing has become a flashpoint of resentment.It all ends as badly here as it did for America in Vietnam though I certainly won't go into details. Brando delineates a very good interpretation of a Cold Warrior diplomat. We and the Russians fought for global primacy with competing ideologies for over 40 years. Neither superpower was particularly cognizant of the wishes of the countries that blood was spilled over.Eiji Okada was a major star in Japanese cinema and this was his only English language film. He's an impassioned Sarkanese patriot who's exploited by some evil forces and only realizes it too late.Smartest guy in the room and in the film is Pat Hingle who is the boss constructing the road. His wife played by Jocelyn Brando runs a hospital for the natives and is beloved. He offers the only real solution to winning the hearts and minds of the Sarkanese. Build a hospital somewhere where you want your bloody road to run and the Sarkanese will fall all over themselves building a road themselves to it. Too bad no one listens.Brando and Okada make a fine pair of former friends and now dueling adversaries. Hopefully one day we might get an administration who is more concerned with winning hearts and minds all over the world. We might even realize some cheap oil in the bargain.The Ugly American is still a fine film with some lessons for today's diplomats and military men.".

There's the shouting and the strutting but there are also some very eerily quiet contrasting moments when he simply lets the frustration of his character all hang out. As his former best friend and now rebel leader of the fictional Sarkan to which Brando's Ambassador White has been posted Ejii Okada is every bit Brando's equal. Their sharp exchanges are riveting as is so much of the dialogue in this film dialogueheavy moments that I do not personally find boring because what they are discussing strikes me as being as important today as in 1963 when this film was first released.I do recognize that some reviewers were terribly disappointed maybe even offended that the film was not a recapitulation of an apparently well written highly complex novel which I haven't read yet but intend to if I can find a copy. However no matter how great the book shouldn't a film be judged as a film because it is not a book? For one thing movies don't have the luxury of an endless running time a constraint not put upon the number of pages needed to tell a print story. Also is not the punctuation grammar and syntax of image quite different than that of print? Finally as others have said it is too bad a The Ugly American has been mostly forgotten if it has ever been heard of and b the powerful message that ends this picture is still as relevant today as it was in 1963.

While this nation was founded as a haven for revolutionaries by the time the film was made the policies were generally reactionarybolstering up ANY government that was seen as keeping the status quo so long as they weren't communists. Yet like in the case of this fictional land many revolutions had nothing to do with communism and SHOULD have been welcomed by the US but weren't.This film begins with Marlon Brando playing a new ambassador to the tiny nation of Sarkan. Some of the senators at his confirmation hearing were not impressedBrand's character appeared to be a political liberal and looked favorably upon the nationalistic movement growing withing Sarkan. After all the leader was his old and dear friend. However after assuming the post both the friend and Brando behave quite stupidly. They should have been friends but very soon become bitter enemies. Brando brands the exfriend a communist and the friend rushes to the communist camp for assistance.My biggest problem with the film was its pacing. Brando goes from close friend to bitter enemy VERY quicklytoo quickly. Things escalate wildly out of control in an interesting manner but it's all just too rushed to be realistic. But aside from this the acting is decent and the story quite compellingespecially the film's commentary on the apathetic American public. Clever and insightful this one probably looks a lot better today in hindsight then it did back in 1963 before the Cold War in Southeast Asia really heated up significantly.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sorry this review is aimed at a more academic influenced audience.Like few political thrillers since or before The Ugly American embodies allegorically the struggle of international politics and its oftenconcomitant sociocultural impasses quite effectively. I further argue that the allegory in this film is so sophisticated complex that even the informed citizen will wrestle with its multiple meanings upon first view. I suggest that viewers learn more about the early history of the Vietnam War either before or immediately after watching this film. The characters in this film fictitiously represent a handful of actual major figures during the early period of American's last major war a whopping failure mind you. Disturbing to say the least are the film's quite accurate prognostication of the Vietnam War and the growing consensus view of the developing world its often justifiable antipathy towards American imperialism and aggression.For those reviewers that have diminished the perpetual value of this film with less than 7 stars you're naive and clearly fastidious. Let's not forget that this film was made in 1963 with the aim of striking mass culture. This mass appeal is clearly suggested in the awful and oriental theatrical trailer located under the extras menu of the DVD. By the way the trailer is the lone major blemish of this enduring underrated classic. Thus expectations for this film to sincerely honor the acclaimed Lederer Burkin novel of the same name are simply not realistic nor considerate when considering the release year and target audience. Even in the present I would argue that mainstream Hollywood is reluctant to release a film on par with the political analysis of this novel without assigning the indie tag along with requisite watereddown editing. So please refrain from critiquing this film along 2007 lines where independent films have a stronger influence than 1963 America. Also bear in mind that the Cold War and many of the globe's havenots were in the first stage of postcolonial disintegration a worldwide phenomenon hardly critiqued known beyond minority opinion. Further postcolonial disintegration was mired in stubborn arrogance manicdriven  closeminded policies brutal wars often proxy and select special interests that favored the elites of toptier nationstates especially the Eagle and the Bear. Fairly stated most Americans were detached from world issues at the time but these same folks would soon lose their innocence and become more active even revolutionary in the immediate years that followed The Ugly American.Quite simply The Ugly American presages the multiple diseases that have constricted American foreign policy the past 45 years. Our hubris paranoia Red Scare complex connivingcummeddlesome ways via the omniscient omnipotent Military Industrial Complex severe disregard for greater cultural understanding consciousunconscious i.e. our choice to become apathetic denial and detached general public are all on fine display throughout this film. Each time I view The Ugly American several times now I can't help but wonder why subsequent Presidents and their administrations educators in general and claimed foreign policy experts rarely cite this film as a model of Do's and Don'ts in foreign policy.The Ugly American may be the only movie where Brando's knack for scenestealing is quite challenged perhaps outperformed by his Asian costars Eiji Okada who plays revolutionary icon Deong and Kukrit Pramoj who plays Prime Minister Kwen Jsai. You will notice my claim in four scenes two between Brando and Okada and the other two between Brando and Pramoj. The polemics in these particular scenes are dramatic impassioned and seemingly reveal personal philosophy that can only be internally debated at one time or another during one's longterm personal struggles with politics and major social issues. You really get the sense that each character firmly believes their high stake positions. Also the harumscarum climates throughout The Ugly American reflect how most Americans felt about the the war in Vietnam and Vietnamese culture in general both then and now  matter of fact. As for the allegory noted above the unforgettable scene that closes the Ugly American is just damning against the American mainstream  its sense of detachment from world affairs. Sadly the lessons from this scene firmly remain in the present.".

	schema:headline " Butchers the book Brando hams it up";
	schema:reviewBody "Years ago I loved reading The Ugly American so when I saw this film at the video store I had high hopes. Unfortunately there is little similar between Lederer and Burdick's work and this cinematic dreck.The book is a story of the complexity of diplomacy and of the multiple ways some people get it right and some people get it wrong set it a fictional IndoChinese country.The total sum of the movie's attempt to represent complexity are people with different opinions about the state of affairs in the country. And in the end we find out exactly how they were all along. This is not complexity this is not the ambiguity present in the wonderful book. The screenwriters have taken a plot about fundamental errors in approach empathy and understanding and made it into a movie about people who have minor disagreements on the facts and eventually are shown the 'correct' interpretation.The book follows a multitude of characters. The movie follows one character a very hammy Brando and barely even references anybody else as being significant.The ugly engineer from the book has a total of about 5 minutes screenplay in the movie! The sleazy foolish newspaper man the same! These were CRITICAL and CRUCIAL characters in the book and they are given barely a mention in the movie! The title of the bookmovie was in part referring to these characters as well! It is a bad sign when a movie practically eliminates the title characters from the book it is based on.The book was a tremendous statement about the difficulties of diplomacy and the errors made in IndoChina just before the outbreak of the Vietnam war. The movie is an hour and a half of barely watchable crap. This is perhaps one of Brando's worst performances  he is practically a parody of himself with eyebrow raised head titled musings and statements about the lessons his characters learns.The book was complicated subtle and had incredible depth. The movie is simple base and shallow. If you liked the book you'll hate it. If you haven't read the book you'll still get nothing out of it. There are far too many better films out there on this topic to waste time with this one.".

	schema:headline " The ugliness of being so underrated ...";
	schema:reviewBody "Like such cinematic oddities as A Face in the Crowd or Johnny Guitar The Ugly American invites for several questionings. Why didn't the film get much more recognition? Why did it fail to reach the same status as a lesser movie like The Sound of Music? Why even those who pretend to be movie fans tend to overlook it or didn't even hear about the title? Is it because it's a Marlon Brando picture that is not from the 50's or the 70's? Is it the title? The unknown director who ever heard of George Englund anyway? The exotic setting that makes it look like another mindless escapist movie?In fact the only reasonable answer I could come up with is that the film was ahead of its time which is not even meant as a compliment since the film is not irreproachable. Released in 1963 a year more remembered for its political happenings than its movies' releases it's prophetic in the sense that it's the closest depiction of the Vietnam War's Eve and it's brilliant in the way it delivers a sort of anticipated mea culpa from the American perspective by depicting the implication of America in the Vietnam territory at the pinnacle of the Cold War. Naturally the names are changed Vietnam becomes a fictionalized country named Sarkhan but the rest of the film is too explicit to fool us.The film opens in a construction site where a 'Freedom Road' is built to ensure the transport of products for the Sarkhanese. More than a road it's the symbol of American inference against Communism salutary from one side unbearable from another. The film opens when an American truck driver who sympathized with a local worker by teaching him a few words of English is brutally murdered and his mouth filled of scotch. His assassins leave the truck tumbling falling on the other workers for one of the most spectacular stunts you'll ever see even more impressive for the 60's and coming from a film of little action. The scene tends to contradict the title because although the American were undesirable we're still waiting for the character that'd define the titular 'ugliness'.If one thing the opening invites us to feel sympathy toward the American victim who's no more politically engaged than any other schmuck he's just doing his job. His case resembles of Jocelyn Brando and Pat Hingle's couple he's a chief engineer who opened a nursery with his wife and their lives will be spared thanks to the interference of the villagers. The film takes place during the Cold War but it shows that the core of the conflict was ideological in the emptiest sense of the word. It's a bunch of artificial meanings when you confront them to reality. It's almost funny how the American insist that the national hero Deong Eiji Okada is or is not a Communist as if it was an insult. Later it's revealed that he was from an independent Nationalist movement for the people's sovereignty but happened to be toyed by the Communists. Still the general consensus which seems to end the film is that Americans are not better allies because they forgot that these nonaligned movements are motivated by the same revolutionary impulses that gave its independence the USA. And that made me wonder maybe people weren't ready for such explicit criticism and that explains why the film was overlooked. Or maybe am I being too indulgent and the film does have some flaws. I wish they could let Eiji Okada the actor who played Deong speak with his own accent the guy seemed to struggle at each goddamn syllabus it wasn't acting it was pure line's recitation. I even wondered if Brando's desperate look wasn't genuine. I also noticed some dialogs in English while it was spoken between Sarkhanese and it sort of killed off the intended realism. However the rest of the film is surprisingly good and entertaining with some nice performances from Judson Pratt as the obnoxious Joe Bing Sandra Church as the comprehensive wife and the scenestealing performance of the primeminister Kwen Sai who had the best lines of the film almost stealing the show from Brando. Naturally it's Marlon Brando's performance that elevates the film to its greatness he's not only absolutely convincing as the ambassador fittingly named Mac White who exudes both charisma sophistication and authority.MacWhite's introductory scene is perhaps one of the best tributes to Marlon Brando's natural talent and the kind of which I would watch and rewatch just for the pleasure to listen to the lines. The film has the script the acting the directing from George Englund yet it didn't get any Oscar nomination and till now the film is vaguely remembered maybe by a fistful of people. Yet the film is extraordinarily educational about one of the most shameful pages of American history. To understand the Vietnam War through conflict many movies are must see but this one would be on the top of the list. If not the best it's the best start.The film also offers an extrapolation of conflicts to come through the obsessive involvement of America in foreign conflicts in the name of ideals while it's more about profits than ideology. 10 years after The Ugly American Richard Nixon would prove all the final words of the Ambassador that's how prophetic the film is and I didn't even mention George W. Bush and the Iraqi conflict. The Ugly American has the intelligence of an Oliver Stone film and although it's hard not to notice some minor flaws it's a film that many should see and that deserve more and more recognition it's daring intelligent thoughtprovoking and prophetic.I guess this is the kind of film for which the word underrated' was invented.".

	schema:headline " A gem of a movie just gets better with age";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie tells the story of the cost of failed foreign policy decisions in countries that were contested during the Cold War. Filmed in 1963 it predicts what eventually happened not only in Southeast Asia but in Central America and the Middle East. This movie used to be shown to classes at the US Army's JFK Center for Unconventional Warfare as late as the mid1990s as an example of the country team operating in a country under siege.In 2003 a remastered and restored version of this movie opened the movie festival at Port Townsend WA with both the director and screenwriter in attendance. The director stated that both he and Marlon Brando had considered making a movie about American diplomacy since the mid1950s but never got any concepts off the ground until the novel was published in 1958. Even then there were still issues to contend with to include the lack of support from the State Department and the Government of Thailand. It took JFK's personal intervention to get the movie made. JFK allegedly sent a copy of the book to every member of the Senate.This movie portrays the continuing mistake we made and continue to make when dealing with insurgencies. During the Cold War we considered any movement against an allied or friendly country as a communist inspired movement rather than a nationalistic one or one motivated by a need for justice. We ended up protecting and supporting unjust and oppressive regimes simply because they were combating a communist movement. The US Ambassador played by Marlon Brando makes this same mistake. The movie also illustrates accurately how the Communists operated to stir up trouble and strife by creating and celebrating martyrs and casting American good intentions as evil and selfserving. The movie demonstrates how they hijacked and dominated these movements by first offering support then insidious infiltration of and displacing the genuine nationalist leaders with communist or socialistic ones.Several scenes in this movie are so vivid they are unforgettable. The airport demonstration that turns into a riot is unusually realistic for a movie of this period. I should know I've seen more than my fair share of riots in Asia and Central America. The attack on the opening ceremony of the Freedom Road is also realistically played out. The eerie silence right after the attack is suddenly interrupted by wailing from the wounded. As the Ambassador's wife tries to tend to one of the casualties a relief worker walks by and casually tells her Don't bother she's dead. The chaos at the besieged embassy near the end of the movie opens with the face of a bewildered and frightened child as US nationals scramble in the background to leave a country descending into hell.I believe Marlon Brando's performance as the American Ambassador is one his best portrayals. The scene when he realizes that he misjudged the whole situation with his friend Deong is gut wrenching. In the presence of his embassy subordinate and the Sarkhan Prime Minster not only does he realize that he was wrong but his diplomatic failure has committed his country to a needless avoidable war. But Mr. Brando is almost up staged by his Asian costars. The articulate Thai actor Kukrit Pramoj who plays the Prime Minister of Sarkhan and who later became the real Prime Minister of Thailand after the military junta was tossed out in 1975. The scene where he out maneuvers the American Ambassador and directs his attention to the gentleman with the lump on his head is priceless. And Japanese actor Eiji Okada who plays the Ambassador's comrade in arms from their OSS days who now leads the revolution against the government the United States is supporting.The movie ends in a scene that captures the typical mood of the American people when it comes to all things dealing with foreign policy. In the decades since the end of World War II thousands of American diplomats servicemen and women aid workers and missionaries have died anonymous deaths trying to bring democracy and a higher standard of living to jerkwater countries around the world. Yet the American people seemed to be indifferent to these sacrifices. Instead all we seem to care about is the next episode of American Idol or the newest hitech gadgets or the latest news about the rich and famous. The ending scene of this movie made over 50 years ago is still relevant and true to this day.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie tells the story of the cost of failed foreign policy decisions in countries that were contested during the Cold War. Filmed in 1963 it predicts what eventually happened not only in Southeast Asia but in Central America and the Middle East. This movie used to be shown to classes at the US Army's JFK Center for Unconventional Warfare as late as the mid1990s as an example of the country team operating in a country under siege.In 2003 a remastered and restored version of this movie opened the movie festival at Port Townsend WA with both the director and screenwriter in attendance. The director stated that both he and Marlon Brando had considered making a movie about American diplomacy since the mid1950s but never got any concepts off the ground until the novel was published in 1958. Even then there were still issues to contend with to include the lack of support from the State Department and the Government of Thailand. It took JFK's personal intervention to get the movie made. JFK allegedly sent a copy of the book to every member of the Senate.This movie portrays the continuing mistake we made and continue to make when dealing with insurgencies.

	schema:headline " I like the humbled Brando roles the best.";
	schema:reviewBody "Brando appeared a bit over the top in films like The Wild Ones On The Waterfront The Godfather and Apocalypse Now. Having just seen this film for the first time I compare this role to The Chase 1966 where Brando plays a sheriff in a Texas town humbled by his duties. In The Ugly American based upon the 1958 novel Brando plays an LBJ like journalist who becomes ambassador to the fictitious southeast Asia country of Sarkan but very clearly really Vietnam.  The film was made while JFK was President but there are great similarities to Brando's Ambassador MacWhite and LBJ. Brando plays a moderate to liberal Democrat who faces an uphill confirmation hearing due to the skepticism of hawkish Senator Brenner Judson Laire. Laire is a virulent anti communist who is both wrongly and rightly concerned that a journalist who just fought the Japanese in WWII in Sarkan has any experience to be the ambassador of the country of Sarkan in the late 1950s. The main argument MacWhite makes is that he is good friends with Deung Eiji Okada the powerful nationalist opposition leader in Sarkan. MacWhite is confirmed but he is nearly killed by a mob that greets him at the airport. MacWhite may be liberal leaning politically but he is still 100 a former military man. MacWhite naively believes that it is all about America being the good force for progress against Communism. MacWhite meets his old friend Deong but then foolishly starts an argument over the value of building the freedom road to the north border of the country which MacWhite sees as progress and Deong with wide popular support sees as American imperialism. MacWhite denounces Deong as a communist and they become enemies. MacWhite insists on continuing the building of the freedom road to the border with the communist neighbors despite several people telling him that it will just provoke the paranoia of the communists and be seen by the majority of Sarkans will resist it as cultural and economic imperialism. Eventually his stubbornness and persistence results in a civil war. Prime Minister Sai Kukrit Pramo demonstrates that he is a very wise leader in contract to MacWhite's foolhardy arrogance. Prime Minister Sai finally convinces MacWhite that Deong is not a communist Deong himself will be betrayed by the communists and that Sarkan may fall to the Communists unless the U.S. military intervenes. I really liked this movie because Brando's character does realize albeit probably too late the errors of his thinking. MacWhite saw everything in black and white and failed to see what was truly going on in Sarkan. MacWhite tries too late to warn the American people to go back to the principles of our own revolution and show the World that we are for these principles not lecturing other cultures about how to live.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been cheated. The film's title the name of Marlon Brando  as the star who refused the Oscar for the way the red Indians were portrayed in Hollywood   and as a film about how America was treating the Asian nations during the cold war all of that fooled me perfectly giving me false hope to watch an objective work. Because after all it's just a piece of propaganda from the 1960s.It tried to be a story about the friendship of 2 good men with 2 different points of view in an ocean of big problems. It tried a bit to display that the American hero isn't all flawless. But it ended up as a Hollywood film about the goodness of America and the evilness or the stupidity of the rest! Let's simply review what it did say  the American is a peaceloving man America got no military greed whatsoever in Asia HA HAA HAAA ! the eastern bloc is bad just bad and doesn't want anything but to kill and seize the Asian developing country's public leader is so deluded knowing nothing about America's kindhearted face thinking wrongly that they cared about his country just as a new playground for the cold war ??? Actually he isn't an idiot but maybe the writer of this film is !.The first half is so powerful with 3 great scenes the congress's open session for interrogating Mac the nominee ambassador the first meeting of this new ambassador with his staff and surely the master scene of that bullfight of a squabble between him and his good old friendthe public leader Deong over America's real aims.After that things grew less solid. I totally couldn't accept the agreement between the eastern bloc and Deong. The approval of the last was fast and forced. I don't believe for a second that this man who rejects truthfully and publicly that his country turns into a grass for the east or the west can be incredibly dumb to hand his very country over a full gang of communist nations so easily !?? Let alone that the absence of Munsang the local communist leader out of the drama weakened Deong's character and darkened his change.Then the adolescent reaction from the American ambassador which pushed things to explosion I felt it extremely unwise for his character to think like this. And it was strange that the Asian president approved it as well. Anyway not the monologue of what happened to us that the lead tells his friend by the end could set things right. With fabricated nearly incomprehensible moments like executing the poor local farmer by the hands of the communists in front of his wife and kids it became clear what kind of loud propaganda we're watching 25 years later watch the capitalists do the same crime with the same people while nearly the same days however in Oliver Stone's movies about the filthy American war in Vietnam!. And it can't get any clearer when the dying public leader says to his people and us after murdering him by the hands of his closest right hands not any other ! that Mansang is the enemy not the American ambassador as if it's The eastern bloc is bad. America is good !!!Maybe this kind of movies was bearable at the days of Kennedy even the lead's wife is so similar to Kennedy's where the noble aims weren't killed in the daylight yet. But after Vietnam then Iraq and during the cold war itself they're nothing but big colorful and so polished lies. It's electrifying to listen to the speech of Deong about America that makes the tyrants then overthrows them not for the pure profit of their people but for America's one. I believe after 50 years hearing hot lines like Wall street that sells tanks or your democracy is a fraud became so bitter. It took some years and couple of wars to make the American real aims that Deong talked about naked and true. So naked and true to an extent uncovers how Brando's character is very naive ! Hence while the finale's harangue that Brando gives completes the work's basic mission as ideal liberal advertisement it didn't hold a candle to the image that we saw for the nonAmericans in the film and the American we know out of the film the real ugly one !Artistically it's watchable and classy. I loved the most the scene in which Brando's character discovers that his wartime buddy isn't and wasn't a communist the big cadre embodied the enormity of his surprise shockingly part of my love comes from the fact that this kind of cadres has become no fashion in Hollywood nowadays. And despite how terrible the English of Eiji Okada as Deong was sometimes but he was utterly believable and his enthusiasm along with his rage were untouched. I only thought that Brando did his best at the first half then did the opposite at the second he stopped talking from his heart anymore and began speaking from his throat as if he wasn't satisfied with the material he does. If I assumed honesty in it then it was another time with utopian spirit. And accordingly its only value that could stay over the years would be its theoretical bona fide. Otherwise I have been cheated. And after ages of these movies  and nothing else them  so the rest of the world. It's hard to see America treating the developing nations this nice since experiencing it with these nations in reality assured how treat and tread are almost the same thing. In all cases they should have called it The Very Beautiful American the one we don't see unless in films !".

I don't believe for a second that this man who rejects truthfully and publicly that his country turns into a grass for the east or the west can be incredibly dumb to hand his very country over a full gang of communist nations so easily !?? Let alone that the absence of Munsang the local communist leader out of the drama weakened Deong's character and darkened his change.Then the adolescent reaction from the American ambassador which pushed things to explosion I felt it extremely unwise for his character to think like this. And it was strange that the Asian president approved it as well. Anyway not the monologue of what happened to us that the lead tells his friend by the end could set things right. With fabricated nearly incomprehensible moments like executing the poor local farmer by the hands of the communists in front of his wife and kids it became clear what kind of loud propaganda we're watching 25 years later watch the capitalists do the same crime with the same people while nearly the same days however in Oliver Stone's movies about the filthy American war in Vietnam!. And it can't get any clearer when the dying public leader says to his people and us after murdering him by the hands of his closest right hands not any other ! that Mansang is the enemy not the American ambassador as if it's The eastern bloc is bad. America is good !!!Maybe this kind of movies was bearable at the days of Kennedy even the lead's wife is so similar to Kennedy's where the noble aims weren't killed in the daylight yet. But after Vietnam then Iraq and during the cold war itself they're nothing but big colorful and so polished lies. It's electrifying to listen to the speech of Deong about America that makes the tyrants then overthrows them not for the pure profit of their people but for America's one. I believe after 50 years hearing hot lines like Wall street that sells tanks or your democracy is a fraud became so bitter. It took some years and couple of wars to make the American real aims that Deong talked about naked and true. So naked and true to an extent uncovers how Brando's character is very naive ! Hence while the finale's harangue that Brando gives completes the work's basic mission as ideal liberal advertisement it didn't hold a candle to the image that we saw for the nonAmericans in the film and the American we know out of the film the real ugly one !Artistically it's watchable and classy. I loved the most the scene in which Brando's character discovers that his wartime buddy isn't and wasn't a communist the big cadre embodied the enormity of his surprise shockingly part of my love comes from the fact that this kind of cadres has become no fashion in Hollywood nowadays. And despite how terrible the English of Eiji Okada as Deong was sometimes but he was utterly believable and his enthusiasm along with his rage were untouched. I only thought that Brando did his best at the first half then did the opposite at the second he stopped talking from his heart anymore and began speaking from his throat as if he wasn't satisfied with the material he does. If I assumed honesty in it then it was another time with utopian spirit. And accordingly its only value that could stay over the years would be its theoretical bona fide. Otherwise I have been cheated. And after ages of these movies  and nothing else them  so the rest of the world. It's hard to see America treating the developing nations this nice since experiencing it with these nations in reality assured how treat and tread are almost the same thing. In all cases they should have called it The Very Beautiful American the one we don't see unless in films !";

	schema:reviewBody "The difference between adolescence and adulthood can be defined in terms of years or age but when it comes right down to it the only real difference is in the experiences the added years provide.  As we mature we are at some point confronted with the realization some sooner some later that age and experience do not necessarily equate to satisfaction and personal identity in our lives the two things we are all though perhaps subconsciously striving to attain.  But it's an elusive butterfly we're chasing and at a certain age the lack of fulfillment in one's life may be dismissed outofhand by some as a midlife crisis in a feeble attempt to justify certain actions or attitudes.  Attaching such a label to it however is merely simplifying a state of being that seems to be perpetually misunderstood and we resort to using psychological ploys on ourselves in order to rationalize away behavior that is often unacceptable in the cold light of reason and morality.  This of course is not a unique situation but an inevitable step one takes upon reaching an age at which the awareness of mortality begins to set in which is something we all have to deal with in our own way in our own time.  And it's an issue that lies allegorically at the heart of director Ang Lee's pensive insightful drama The Ice Storm' in which we discover that more often than not the adult we become is nothing more than an extension of the adolescent we may shed the skin of youth but the awkward confusion and uncertainty remains albeit manifested in different ways to which for awhile we may respond in opposition even to our own conscience creating a double standard in our lives which only serves to exacerbate the confusion and unhappiness leaving us alone to face the cold and frozen landscapes of our own soul.Working from an insightful and intelligent screenplay by James Schamus who also wrote Lee's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' and Eat Drink Man Woman' among others Lee has crafted and delivered a lyrical and poetic though somewhat dark film that tells the story of two neighboring families living in Connecticut in the early 70s  Ben and Elena Hood Kevin Kline and Joan Allen and their children Paul Tobey Maguire and Wendy Christina Ricci and Jim and Janey Carver Jamey Sheridan and Sigourney Weaver and their children Mikey Elijah Wood and Sandy Adam HannByrd.  And it's a story to which many will be able to relate on a very personal individual level as it reflects an issue common to us all that of trying to make a tangible connection with someone or something in our life that we can hold on to and take comfort in.  Ben and Elena have grown apart she has distanced herself emotionally and sexually from Ben and unfulfilled she longs again for the freedom of her spent youth while Ben seeks solace in an emotionally vapid but physically satisfying relationship with another woman.  Jim who spends much of his time on the road has become completely disconnected from his entire family his children are apathetic to his very presence and Janey exists in a constant state of promiscuous numbness yet cold and indifferent to her own husband.  The Hood and Carver children meanwhile are suffering the pains of adolescence and trying to figure out the world in which they live exploring their feelings with and for one another and attempting to understand the whys and wherefores of it all.  And to whom can they turn for guidance in an era that's giving them Nixon and Watergate new age spiritualism and selfabsorbed parents who teach one thing and do another? The story unfolds through the eyes of sixteenyearold Paul whose meditations on the literal and figurative ice storm that descends upon the two families over a long Thanksgiving weekend forms the narrative of the film.  And it's through Paul's observations that Lee so subtly and effectively presents his metaphor in which he captures the beauty as well as the ugliness that inexplicably coexists within and which surrounds the turbulence and turmoil of the Hood's and Carver's world which is ultimately visited by tragedy as their drama proceeds to it's inevitable climax.  It's sensitive material that will undoubtedly touch a nerve with many in the audience and Lee takes great care to present it accordingly with a studied finesse that makes it an emotionally involving and thoroughly engrossing drama.Lee also knows how to get the best out of his actors and there are a number of outstanding and memorable performances in this film beginning with that of Kevin Kline.  Kline does comedy well but he does drama even better as he proves here with his portrayal of Ben.  The final scene of the film in fact belongs to Kline as it is here that we discover the true nature of the man he is in his heart of hearts.  It's a superb piece of acting and one of the real strengths of the film.Joan Allen also turns in a strong performance through which she reveals the insufferable inner conflict that so affects Elena's life and especially her relationship with Ben.  And it's in Allen's character more than any of the others that we see how fine the line is between the adult and the adolescent.  It is not unusual to find a bit of the mother in the daughter but Allen shows us through Elena just how much of the daughter is actually in the mother which underscores one of the basic tenets of the film.  It's a performance that should've earned Allen an Oscar nomination at the very least.Also turning in performances that demand special attention are Maguire Ricci Wood and especially Jamey Sheridan whose portrayal of Jim is one of his best it's believable and totally honest.  Penetrating and incisive The Ice Storm' is remarkably poignant and absorbing without question it's one of Lee's finest films.  1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see this film with one of my friends in a cinema I had never been to before. It was one of those rare and delightful experiences where you are the only people in the theatre. No one around to distract you. No kids munching on crisps or couples  quietly muttering sweet nothings or idiots trying to tell the characters what to do.  It was great.The film was just brilliant. It really nearly broke my heart. Every performance is perfect. The direction by Ang Lee is deliberate and painful as he slices into you with the lives of those he makes you watch. It looks amazing in a beautifully bleak way. It is also one the most compelling and painful movies that I have ever come across. The family life portrayed is messed up and all the relationships that are displayed are disfunctional on some level or other. But still I was forced to care for them  all of them. Such is the brilliance of the acting and the script writing.I own this film but I can't watch it alot. Once a year is just enough. It's to traumatic and beautiful to watch more than that.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am deeply touched. I can not believe it took me 7 years to get to see this movie. It goes straight into my top ten.The movie is based on Rick Moody's 1994 novel about the life of two suburban families in New Canaan Connecticut during the time of the Watergate scandal A time of sexual liberation and of disintegration of existing social norms and of the nuclear family. The characters may stand as symbols of the kind of people that are created out of a society with decreasing social norms. They are ordinary people who live in material welfare bored unhappy confused scared of conflicts and constantly seeking something else than they already have.Instead of being examples to their children the parents are constantly trying to run away from their own emotional confusion for instance by seeking casual sex and thereby hurting each other. In the meantime the children are left to their own upbringing watching bad TV shows emptying their parents' drinks blowing up toys on the balcony shoplifting experimenting with sex and drugs. The communication between parents and children is terrible or should I say nonexisting. They all live in their separate worlds all the time more disconnected until a tragedy caused by a natural disaster finally calls them back to life and hopefully makes them look beyond themselves and see how valuable and fragile life is. May this provoke back the belief in what the family as a unit can do for each other if they stand together?The movie is both uncomfortable and at the same time enormously satisfying to watch  perhaps because the theme is presented in such a human and recognizable manner. The dialogue is great and there are even very funny scenes at times. These people seem so real and so fragile like you and me. It is as if we can see right through their souls and their pain.The cast is brilliant except for that irritating Katie Holmes with her cheap Hollywood teenage series look. I have never seen a movie plenty of child actors acted out as professionally and convincing as this one. Christina Ricci is the best and Elijah Wood is also excellent much more enjoyable than in LOTR making me wish they were young again so they could have more roles in movies like this.The atmosphere caused by the weather gives a kind of somber mood stressed by the dimmed colors and the mystical music score.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Ice Storm' is an incredibly bleak and dark film set in the 70s about two connected families during the holiday break of Thanksgiving. The first family consists of Ben Kevin Kline and Elena Joan Allen and their two kids  16yearold Paul Tobey Maguire just home from boarding school and 14yearold Wendy Christina Ricci a wannabe antiwarantiNixon elitist who is coming to terms with her own sexuality. The second family consists of Janey Sigourney Weaver whom Ben is having an affair with her husband Jim Jamey Sheridan and their two boys  the neurotic introvert Mikey Elijah Wood and his younger shy pyromaniac brother Sandy AdamN Hann Byrd. The film takes place during Thanksgiving day and the day after in the lives of these people  including Ben and Elena's marriage being put to the test at a swinger's party with Janey and Jim Paul's love conquest in New York City with a girl from boarding school named Libbets Katie Holmes and Wendy's sexual misadventures with Mikey and Sandy both.'The Ice Storm' is an incredibly powerful and relevant ensemble piece about the complexity of family and relationships both sexual and nonsexual. Ang Lee once again proves he is a director of great skill and exquisite understanding of human emotions and James Schamus provides a harrowing and painfully realistic screenplay. Kevin Kline delivers yet another nearflawless dramatic performance while Sigourney Weaver is great in her interesting yet limited role. The children of the ensemble cast Maguire Byrd Wood Ricci Holmes Krumholtz are all excellent especially Christina Ricci who owns her role. However the real scenestealer in my eyes is the marvelous Joan Allen who plays her role with such intensity and elegance that I'm shocked she didn't receive a Best Actress Oscar Nomination.In conclusion 'The Ice Storm' is a powerful little movie that's interesting yet not exciting. It isn't groundbreaking by any standards but it's incredibly wellmade. 'The Ice Storm' was totally ignored at the '98 Oscar Ceremony but that comes to no enormous surprise. It was competing in the same year 'L.A. Confidential' 'Boogie Nights' 'Amistad' 'The Sweet Hereafter' 'As Good as It Gets' and the dreadfully overrated 'Titanic' were. A small little character study like 'The Ice Storm' didn't stand a chance. If you can appreciate a movie like this I highly recommend this oldie I just got around to seeing. Grade A".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers herein.I was in my late teens in the early 70s and this film took me right back there not just in the details of the music clothes cars etc. but especially the popularity of the swinging lifestyle with lots of drinking drugs and casual sex. Books such as The Sensuous Woman The Hite Report and Open Marriage were best sellers then wife swapping parties were in vogue and sex in general was touted as the road to happiness. I wouldn't go so far as to say that casual sex destroyed families although in some cases it did but I think there were many unhappy families broken up by divorce and infidelity who in earlier decades would have remained together in secret misery quiet desperation behind the smiling traditional family facade. The early and mid 70s were a miserable time in America for many reasons the energy crisis economic recession horrible winter weather in the northeast anyway and loss of faith in the government in the wake of the Vietnam war Watergate and the Nixon administration. The basement sex play scene between Ricci and Wood is the ultimate metaphor for that time sexual experimentation between young teenagers is a normal part of life something most kids do and they might even have had fun but Ricci throws a bizarre twist into it when she puts on the Nixon mask. Note Wood's confused and almost frightened expression as he approaches her. The act itself becomes purely mechanical lacking any warmth or joy because of the physical barrier preventing eye contact. The mask is the perfect symbol of people hiding behind facades of society's distrust of the oppressive and duplicitous Presidency you might even say Nixon screwed us and of the lack of warmth and human intimacy that went along with casual sex at a time when people were trying to find any means possible to feel better or even just feel good. The ice storm itself symbolizes not only the unhappy cold and dangerously slippery lives these people were frozen inside but also in a larger sense it is a metaphor of a very unsure and uncomfortable era.".

THE ICE STORM is a much more literal evocation of that theme. It follows a pair of Boomer couples living with their children in the '70s that infamous shadow of their own social awakening.In the aftermath of the sexual revolution we find the occupants of the film bored out of their minds with one another and life itself recalling an assertion by MAD magazine about revolutions taking all the fun out of sex. Kevin Kline in particular appears to be turning into something we infer he must have hated at one time. Joan Allen playing his wife and brilliant as usual is clawing at the universe trying desperately for some kind of escape. Sigourney Weaver his mistress is THE GRADUATE's Mrs. Robinson and therefore its Benjamin Braddock by extension  bored wise and lost all at the same time. Their kids are being neglected and haunted by the distance that has developed between them and their families they are forced into a kind of growth for which their parents never bothered to prepare them and worse yet they know it.The couples' idea of liberation has led to their decadence but it's important to note that THE ICE STORM is not a preachy moralistic movie. Its insistence is not that sexual awareness and honesty are bad but simply that the real life that inevitably comes knocking cannot be ignored. The world is ripped away because no one has been paying attention and superficial ideas of need have replaced genuine purpose. At the end Kevin Kline cries tears not necessarily of desperation or loss  though these ingredients undoubtedly contribute  but of joy because he has realized and it isn't too late.Brilliant performances all around from a nowallstar cast. Of special note is Christina Ricci this may be her best work as she projects not just her usual cool candor but also a naivet that warms the blood of her character. Tobey Maguire is also outstanding.While this has become one of my favorites of the last ten years it is a difficult movie in some ways and it may take a while to appreciate but don't miss it and try and tell me you don't feel the cold air at the finale.".

Although Toby Maguire gives his usual staringintospace deerinheadlights stupidhalfsmile whatamIsupposedtobedoingagain? performance I thought the rest of the cast did their best with the material  i.e. it wasn't the actors' fault!";

	schema:reviewBody "The summary statement I write I mean as a compliment. In short this film will keep you up thinking about the characters the whole swarm of tragedy sewn into these characters as it is a true look at American familial dysfunction. It's also the Chinesedirected cousin of American Beauty in some ways just as compelling if maybe a little more heavy on the metaphors and by the end of it however down and drained the film made me feel I knew I'd seen my favorite Ang Lee film thus far. He takes the subject matter the script by James Schamus and the nuanced performances and makes it so that we feel for these people however trapped into their uppermiddle class walks of life. The ice theme does work for a good lot of the film and even when it gets hammered down to the line I was still moved by how these families intertwined the bleakness but also the little bits of light coming through.In fact the film shares a good deal with American Beauty two families both fairly screwed up with infidelity drugs procrastination young lust and a certain pining for the old days going steadily down the tubes. One family are the Hooods Kevin Kline Joan Allen Christina Ricci and Tobey MaGuire the other are the Carvers Sigourney Weaver Elijah Wood Henry Czerny and Adam HannByrd. Either side has their share of dilemmas psychological cramps and just total aimlessness. The performances from all are unique and quiet desperate and at least a few in tune with the 'ice' theme in particular Weaver Wood and Allen are numbed. Basically there isn't as much story as there is attention to the fates and parallels of the characters.Among the lot though Kline has some of his best work to date with his controlling demeanor masking something very insecure HannByrd and Wood are totally complimentary so to speak in that they work well at being brothers of the same weird seed Allen not much more to say that hasn't been said by others and even smaller roles filled by Katie Holmes and David Krumholtz are worth the time. There stories all lead up to the big chunk of the story ala the 'day you die' stuff in American Beauty and at times it's painful cringeinducing darkly amusing and at the end hitting notes that had me eyes go wide. And the ending when it comes is sentimental but never unrealistic. This is the kind of tone that Lee would also use for Brokeback Mountain but here it contains even more depth and intrigue into the dysfunction ironically in only the span of a few days vs. the span of twenty years in Brokeback.You may whether you like the film or not will want to talk about it once it is over. It of course can be argued and I would argue it that the 'ice' motif is pushed to as far as it can go and then some then again it IS called the Ice Storm. But in contrast another minor theme is handled superbly involving the Fantastic Four comic book that Maguire's character gives some narration about. By looking through an abstract of a comic book there's some extra meaning that can be put into the film the power that can be taken away from superheroes as well as the enclosed New Canaan citizens. Along with some great 70's era period use the NixonWatergate stuff adding another layer to the frustration leading up to a truly disturbing moment involving a Nixon mask including music creates a very impressive atmosphere. Maybe I'll check out the film again when it's not past midnight though even after hours the film packs a small wallop. 9.510".

	schema:reviewBody "THE ICE STORM  1997 Starring Kevin Kline Joan Allen Sigourney Weaver Tobey Maguire Christina Ricci Elijah Wood and Katie Holmes Director Ang Lee   113 minutes  Rated R for strong sexual content and for drug use  languageBy Blake French Ang Lee's The Ice Storm is such a provocative and unsettling experience that it made Gene Siskel's top movie of 1997. Since then Siskel has recently passed away. But Being an avid film reviewer and buff I thought that it would be appropriate for me to screen The Ice Storm for a second time this time in full awareness of Siskel's thoughts on the film. After careful inspection I think that I agree with my favorite movie critic's opinion and feel obligated to post a review explaining why.Watching The Ice Storm is a unique occurrence. Movie's don't get this powerful every time one visits a local multiplex.  The story is basically a series of sins and involvement's that dig the characters deeper and deeper into an emotional crater. The time period is about thirty to forty years ago. Kevin Kline and Joan Allen are Ben and Elena Hood. They have a son whose 16 Paul and a sexually confused 14 year old daughter named Wendy. This is not a happy family and the film never pretends otherwise. Ben is having an adulterous affair with his neighbor's wife Janey Carver. Her husband Jim is pretty much unsuspecting but Ben's wife is dubious of her mysteriously acting spouse. The Carvers also have teenage children named Mikey and Sandy. Mickey is ready to explore a sexual underworld with Wendy and she is prepared to experiment with whoever comes down her path first.Elena is caught stealing from a local party store one day and that triggers an effect that causes her to react openly to her husband about his involvement's with Janey Carver. When Ben and Elena visit a wife swapping party where the guests put their keys in a dish to see who an individual will sleep with things become even more adulterous with the Carvers.The film is propelled by unique one of a kind performances by all the actors in the cast. Sigourney Weaver receiving a best supporting actress nomination for her performance is superb in a slutty whorish kind of a way. Joan Allen is also perfection delivering a sense of egresses and desire without ever speaking that much. Tobey Maguire Christina Ricci Elijah Wood and Adam HannByrd all act well as the teens. Basically all the one screen appeal of The Ice Storm is top class. But there is something more than just the on screen appeal with this movie. Something that allows the audience to experience a feeling of confusion along with the characters. We can become so involved in the story because all the story consists of is a pile of heavy sins. We feel the character's needs. Relate to the issues. Things happen that struck me so profoundly that I find myself listing the film on my list of top 100 movies of all time. In the last scene of  The Ice Storm a key character brakes down and cries like a baby with his family next to his side. We look back at all the wrongdoing he has done at all the sins he has committed and all the reasons he has to cry and we fell his painand somewhere deep down we try to forgive him.".

Two years later ChineseAmerican director Ang Lee adapted the novel into a film 'The Ice Storm'. However the film remained quite marginal and hardly noticed it was a major box office flop yet critics seemed to love the film I'm in the with critics once again. It is nice to see now that with Ang Lee's Oscar winning hit what many even consider a masterpiece Brokeback Mountain everyone wants to check out his other films this being no exception what so ever.Many of the people in Ang Lee's films are on the verge of somekind of breakdown or are learning more about themselves and their sexuality as is a case in this film. Almost everyone gets caught doing something associated with a taboo or something they shouldn't be doing in this film. Set just before and on Thanksgiving that most depressing and overwrought of Hallmarkdriven holidays perhaps especially in New England where the whole hypocritical business originated the film is cold. It's filled with images of visible breath puffs frozen ground and ice delicately dark gray or crystal clear  mementos of existential paybacks and endless cycles of pain. The moral design is a familiar one in movies and novels in which carelessness malice and guilt always come with extravagant emotional price tags.The ice is almost everywhere. At times it has a metaphorical meaning which is overstatedthese characters are frozen in harsh fragile existences and don't you forget it they are stuck. But it's also greatlooking and adds beauty to the film and the mess the characters are in it clicks in the wind on tree branches and those chimes favored by people with porches breaks open in those metal ice trays makes driving treacherous cracks when people walk over it and glitters in sunlight. Elena and Ben like most everyone else in the film might be understood to be living under ice inside it too close to its transparent surface. The two families are the highly dysfunctional and anti social Hoods and the Carvers neighbors who need compete with and resent each other. They're all afraid to be found out as unhappy or underresourcedto be forced to imagine alternatives. Their affluence is devastating.Elena Hood is finding it hard to confront her husband Ben Hood on his affair with Janey Carver a cold and distant woman who doesn't like her real husband. The kids especially the promiscuous Wendy Hood are all discovering more about their sex lives and soon experimenting with it however a majority of it is shown because that's just the way it should be it's style over substance remember that one. Wendy Hood connects almost all of the kids together as she has relationships with almost all of them.Everyone in The Ice Storm is either uptight on the verge of breakdown shrill and too aware of their various audiences. The film captures this sense of vergeness perfectly. For all its aesthetic and thematic chilliness it's about melting and depressing too. And that's how you're left by the surprisingly dramatic but admirably underplayed finale feeling just a bit melted. The performances are amazing and it was Christina Ricci's first mature role and I must say she handled it fantastically. Among the rest of the talented cast is Kevin Kline Joan Allen Sigourney Weaver Toby McGuire and Elijah Wood. The direction is also fantastic which easily makes Ang Lee one of the most talented active directors today.Overall the Ice Storm is disturbingly bleak and depressing however all of that is totally relevant with its plot and all. It is an almost flawless film making its way into the list of one of my favourite films an unforgettable experience is what this film gave me.1010 See It If You Liked American Beauty Blue Velvet and Brokeback Mountain Luke Rowe".

	schema:headline " Three drift out of consciousness";
	schema:reviewBody "This is meant to offer a soft contrast as flow between external life with people family members gathered for Thanksgiving anxiously pulled in disparate orbits and the inner life of unfathomable urges and emotion that gives rise to the firstappearances versus true self rooted in relationships and attempting connection. Set in 1970's America with Nixon lying on TV the broader commentary is that the world is organized on deceit misplaced faith. There is contextual talk of people as intertwined molecules of inner life as inverted space where the invisible becomes visible. So here's the cinematic gambit how to make visible a part of that inner life? It's what every filmmaker worth anything has puzzled about in his work insight into human soul no small challenge for Lee though the film may otherwise seem typical.There are three connected story lines to that effect each one culminating in a ritual of seduction as betrayal. Each storyline climaxes with a loved one drifting out of consciousness in some way drunk husband Libbets the son. This only emphasizes what we've been seeing for the whole film people drifting apart heedless of one another. It all plays in the latter stages against the backdrop of a coming ice storm it can't be helped there's some inevitable unhappiness ahead of us.The overall point? In each case as loved ones momentarily or not go out of life those left behind are suddenly surrounded with that negative space of absence and in that space pour their inner self and effect human connection.It may all seem a little cloying in the finale. But the best part is getting there the protracted sequence with crosscutting between the three stories of betrayed seduction. So how to make visible what in life eludes us the fabric of feelings as cinematic fabric? This was very likely Lee's interest in the project as well as more broadly the idea of dislocation.I was happy to see a cinematic solution that was nowhere in multithreaded films like Crash or Cloud Atlas. The idea seems to be show each new scene from a point on as extension as insight or meditation on previous ones as though a single soul is dreaming.So this is nice. The film is the empty space as we think dull dayto day life to be. The characters as molecules drifting in the air often apart. The loss of consciousness not simply as loss but as meaningful awakening to that empty space where we as molecules do not aimlessly drift but by virtue of being there hold each other into place giving shape to life. Lee as usual has compromised enough to deliver a movie with some broad appeal. The overall wrap is a bit too fabricated for my taste. But see how gentle are the contrasts between hard sorrow and soft inner life where the very similar Melancholia eats at you this soothes. It's all here natural to Lee who as a Chinese knows this stuff in meditation and tai chi.".

The impressive cast manages to overcome some of the shortcomings of the script but it all seems so heavyhanded. As a couple whose marriage has fizzled Kline and Allen come off the best.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a masterpiece. It is an ambitious work the scope of which is breathtaking. A web of adults and children in which the dysfunctions of the adults are reflected in the tender probings of their kids. Larger contexts include suburbia the NixonVietnam political era and the natural world of the ice storm. The movie unfolds with a beautiful tempo like a sunrise or an unexpected flower. It is nearly impossible to predict which story line will be handled when but the intoxicating rush of understated revelatory moments paralyzes any interest in suspense. The acting is superb. Kevin Kline's minimalist nervous breakdown and the melting of Joan Allen's spiritual deepfreeze are enormously pleasurable to watch. The young actors in the movie are almost eerily spectacular. Their acting especially that of the two brothers and of Ricci has a luminosity that is as transcendent as any performances I've ever viewed. Lee's direction is sensuous understated and loving. An entire world is being portrayed. A small door opened into a universe. While watching it I was struck by its similarity to American Beauty. Both movies explore the myth of the American Family in decay in a suburban context and both show the reflections of the parental narcissism in their children's' despair. But there is something about Ice Storm that makes it much more powerful than American Beauty. Perhaps it's the depth of the acting although the acting in Beauty was hardly secondrate. Maybe its the distance of the era  an added touch of nostalgia for the 70's that adds an extra layer to the movie that is absent to the contemporaryminded American Beauty. I think what it is is a matter of the social context. American Beauty although wonderful is relatively clich. We are familiar with its suburban ennui with an older man's crush on a cheerleader even with the wise child and his troubled father next door. There's something about the dysfunction in American Beauty that isn't earned the way it is in Ice Storm. Of course this comes back to Rick Moody the author of the novel the movie is based on. There is something of the novelist's eye to the Ice Storm. Some Shakespearian sense of intergenerational awe and of the cycles of the natural and social worlds. American Beauty lacks that. It's more of a comic book more of a script brought to life by a stagesavvy director and some clever acting. Ice Storm is deeper. Much deeper. It's this gravity I think that holds the actors in its pull and allows them to transcend themselves. In my opinion truly one of the greatest American movies of the late 20th century.".

Joan Allen playing a straight laced uptight character  what a stretch. Signourney is distant aloof Kevin Kline clueless and emasculated as always.There is nothing ground breaking here. Everyone is shown with all of the wrinkles flaws and foibles of everyday people. No heroes in this movie. Great movie if you want to see life as it is but why not just look out the window? It's all there everyday and this flick does nothing to shed light on our lives. Hey did you know that unsupervised teens will experiment with sex and drugs?".

	schema:reviewBody "It's easy to compare The Ice Storm to American Beauty and Happiness both of which also dealt with disillusionment and the disintegration of the American Dream and the traditional family cell in the suburbs and to a lesser extent The Sweet Hereafter which explored some similar themes in small town Canada. The Ice Storm is as cynical as those other films but it's much more subtle in masking its sardonicism and has aged much better than American Beauty which had the appearance of a masterpiece at its release but looks flat and shallow now. The people in The Ice Storm feel more real and more human than the ones in American Beauty and Happiness and the film walks that fine line between characterbased sliceoflife storytelling and metaphorical satire which works only because the viewer cares for the characters and their fates while also absorbing the bigger issues under the surface.That would not work without a strong ensemble cast the actors in The Ice Storm are not among my favorites yet they all outdo themselves and produce sympathetic powerful convincing performances  Kevin Kline Joan Allen and Sigourney Weaver are all at their very best and the younger actors Elijah Wood Tobey Maguire Christina Ricci Adam HannByrd and  amazingly  even Katie Holmes all deliver too. In contrast with the intentionally despicable characters in Happiness and American Beauty these actors form a group of very average people that the viewer relates to and cares about  but the dysfunction and sickness is right there beneath the surface waiting for the right catastrophe to explode.There's an undefinable something that stops The Ice Storm short of becoming one of my favorites. The ending fits the mood of the rest of the film but doesn't offer the catharsis that is needed and it left me with a bitter taste. In the end I found myself wishing that the film said more and left more of a mark the fact that it isn't often recognized as one of the best films of the 90's is simply because there's something not quite memorable about it. It's incredibly engaging throughout though and is definitely one of the strongest dramas of its time beautifully shot and a gem that's well worth discovering.".

The people in The Ice Storm feel more real and more human than the ones in American Beauty and Happiness and the film walks that fine line between characterbased sliceoflife storytelling and metaphorical satire which works only because the viewer cares for the characters and their fates while also absorbing the bigger issues under the surface.That would not work without a strong ensemble cast the actors in The Ice Storm are not among my favorites yet they all outdo themselves and produce sympathetic powerful convincing performances  Kevin Kline Joan Allen and Sigourney Weaver are all at their very best and the younger actors Elijah Wood Tobey Maguire Christina Ricci Adam HannByrd and  amazingly  even Katie Holmes all deliver too. In contrast with the intentionally despicable characters in Happiness and American Beauty these actors form a group of very average people that the viewer relates to and cares about  but the dysfunction and sickness is right there beneath the surface waiting for the right catastrophe to explode.There's an undefinable something that stops The Ice Storm short of becoming one of my favorites. The ending fits the mood of the rest of the film but doesn't offer the catharsis that is needed and it left me with a bitter taste. In the end I found myself wishing that the film said more and left more of a mark the fact that it isn't often recognized as one of the best films of the 90's is simply because there's something not quite memorable about it. It's incredibly engaging throughout though and is definitely one of the strongest dramas of its time beautifully shot and a gem that's well worth discovering.";

	schema:headline " Insightful PostWar Gem about Changes Within People and Periods";
	schema:reviewBody "From springs to autumns from youthful enthusiasm to disillusions... the reality where the beginnings mark the inevitable ends and the ends mark new unknown beginnings such a prefabricated circle of life. Yet some of the stories on the screen where we empathize with their protagonists might occur exceptionally vibrant involving and timeless. Such is the case with DER ENGEL MIT DER POSAUNE one of the quintessential productions a milestone of Austrian postwar cinema.Based on the novel by Ernst Lothar 18901974 a writer and a friend of Max Reinhardt the movie relies on its unique sagalike content challenging depiction of the long time span in the Austrian history and the true elite cast of different backgrounds. But foremost it works as a conscience of historical moment when the tragic WWII ended and there was a cry for a fresh breath free from Nazi propaganda. The storyline marks the period of more than half a century and practically highlights CHANGES in both the political situation of the country and the story of the Alt Family piano manufacturers notable in Vienna for generations.1888 Franz Alt Attila Hoerbiger marries Henriette Paula Wessely a daughter of a Jewish professor. She easily wins the respect of other people even the crown prince Rudolf who trusts her more than he could ever trust the closest members of his imperial family. He is the love of her life...yet she makes a practical decision and marries Franz Alt. Lost chance or sheer destiny? Intense emotions step in at the wedding party  the mournful bells proclaim the tidings about Rudolf's death. Yet life must go on... and the newly married couple start to live on the fourth floor of Viennese house a major setting of the story a unique house marked by family's tradition and decorated by something special beyond its front door  A LITTLE ANGEL WITH A TRUMPET a title character of the movie a conscience of the times who sees everything from his own perspective. By becoming the narrator in the film he helps the viewers become the heartfelt and objective observers with some sympathies some joys some sorrows and reflections but a little distance too. The angel is the representation of the supernatural presence in human stories and manifests the redemptive nature of music. He leads us closer and closer through the dramatically changing times to the unpredictable finale when everything seems to be destroyed in the ruins of war all the beloved ones are gone yet in the midst of destruction a new hope is born...When referring to the idealistic lines and aspects of the plot it is important to note certain characteristics of the movie. They purely rely on the post war spirit when cinema was aimed at restoring hope in viewers hope in building a new reality from the disappointing history. Therefore even those dramatic moments those ruins where all seems to be lost are constantly accompanied by ever present CHANGE for better. That is best resembled in the unforgettable open to interpretations closeup of Hermann Alt Oskar Werner at the last 'meeting' with his motherone of the most powerful moments ever grace the screen.And this spirit is beautifully evoked in the performances from the cast. And here the main credit must be granted to Paula Wessely who gives a triumphant performance of her career as Henriette. That is acting with full commitment. She is absorbing as a halfJewish character who suffers the difficulties of various times she rivets us all in different stages of life that she portrays from an inexperienced enthusiastic young Frauelein maid to an elderly mother who has her memories as well as her sorrows for the future of her children. Ms Wessely is marvelous and truly unforgettable in her scenes that carry meaning and heart. Her sort of 'similar soul' is Maria Schell in the role of Selma Rosner a pianist who marries Hans one of Henriette's two sons. She gives a comforting performance particularly at the famous scene when she is introduced to the Alts at the dawn of WWI in 1914. The pairing of the real life couple Paula Wessely and Attila Hoerbiger occurs most convincing later in the film as they are old and Franz writes a touching note to his wife Forgive me that I have married you... Among the supporting cast worth special attention are Curd Juergens as illusive deceptive decadent aristocrat  count Poldo Traun Helene Thimig as a strict and heartlessly conventional Gretel and Paul Hoerbiger as Otto Franz's brother in love with the classical ideas in music and life. But the true contrast and insightful performance emerges from Hans Holt and Oskar Werner two brothers that considerably differ from each other one believes in true loyalty the other is influenced by propaganda where 'For God Emperor Homeland' soon turns into 'Heil Hitler'. They are given some detailed moments that psychologically manifest their psyches. Although their roads differ they meet....The film can also boast of nice photography by Guenther Anders in particular the nice camerawork at juxtaposing images of newspapers tidings about WWI some romantic shots including a dreamlike moment of Henriette and Rudolf on a balcony moving camerawork that draws parallels to viewers' perceptions highlighting the emotionally significant moments consider Henriette's visit at the emperor Franz Josef and the shot of his office first while we hear his voice and after a few minutes see his face. The aesthetic merit of the film reaches its climax at the final moments that prompt reflections and impatience to burst into the overwhelming finale. The lovely piece by Beethoven's Op. 48 from The Glory of God in Nature that Selma plays loudly proclaims the angel's song and represents the true ideals being recaptured in new generations.This film is a true gem of the Austrian cinema that does not escape to cheap sentimentalism nor to the kitschy clichs but can still touch and delight various viewers even those discriminating ones.".

Such is the case with DER ENGEL MIT DER POSAUNE one of the quintessential productions a milestone of Austrian postwar cinema.Based on the novel by Ernst Lothar 18901974 a writer and a friend of Max Reinhardt the movie relies on its unique sagalike content challenging depiction of the long time span in the Austrian history and the true elite cast of different backgrounds. But foremost it works as a conscience of historical moment when the tragic WWII ended and there was a cry for a fresh breath free from Nazi propaganda. The storyline marks the period of more than half a century and practically highlights CHANGES in both the political situation of the country and the story of the Alt Family piano manufacturers notable in Vienna for generations.1888 Franz Alt Attila Hoerbiger marries Henriette Paula Wessely a daughter of a Jewish professor. She easily wins the respect of other people even the crown prince Rudolf who trusts her more than he could ever trust the closest members of his imperial family. He is the love of her life...yet she makes a practical decision and marries Franz Alt. Lost chance or sheer destiny? Intense emotions step in at the wedding party  the mournful bells proclaim the tidings about Rudolf's death. Yet life must go on... and the newly married couple start to live on the fourth floor of Viennese house a major setting of the story a unique house marked by family's tradition and decorated by something special beyond its front door  A LITTLE ANGEL WITH A TRUMPET a title character of the movie a conscience of the times who sees everything from his own perspective. By becoming the narrator in the film he helps the viewers become the heartfelt and objective observers with some sympathies some joys some sorrows and reflections but a little distance too. The angel is the representation of the supernatural presence in human stories and manifests the redemptive nature of music. He leads us closer and closer through the dramatically changing times to the unpredictable finale when everything seems to be destroyed in the ruins of war all the beloved ones are gone yet in the midst of destruction a new hope is born...When referring to the idealistic lines and aspects of the plot it is important to note certain characteristics of the movie. They purely rely on the post war spirit when cinema was aimed at restoring hope in viewers hope in building a new reality from the disappointing history. Therefore even those dramatic moments those ruins where all seems to be lost are constantly accompanied by ever present CHANGE for better. That is best resembled in the unforgettable open to interpretations closeup of Hermann Alt Oskar Werner at the last 'meeting' with his motherone of the most powerful moments ever grace the screen.And this spirit is beautifully evoked in the performances from the cast. And here the main credit must be granted to Paula Wessely who gives a triumphant performance of her career as Henriette. That is acting with full commitment. She is absorbing as a halfJewish character who suffers the difficulties of various times she rivets us all in different stages of life that she portrays from an inexperienced enthusiastic young Frauelein maid to an elderly mother who has her memories as well as her sorrows for the future of her children. Ms Wessely is marvelous and truly unforgettable in her scenes that carry meaning and heart. Her sort of 'similar soul' is Maria Schell in the role of Selma Rosner a pianist who marries Hans one of Henriette's two sons. She gives a comforting performance particularly at the famous scene when she is introduced to the Alts at the dawn of WWI in 1914. The pairing of the real life couple Paula Wessely and Attila Hoerbiger occurs most convincing later in the film as they are old and Franz writes a touching note to his wife Forgive me that I have married you... Among the supporting cast worth special attention are Curd Juergens as illusive deceptive decadent aristocrat  count Poldo Traun Helene Thimig as a strict and heartlessly conventional Gretel and Paul Hoerbiger as Otto Franz's brother in love with the classical ideas in music and life. But the true contrast and insightful performance emerges from Hans Holt and Oskar Werner two brothers that considerably differ from each other one believes in true loyalty the other is influenced by propaganda where 'For God Emperor Homeland' soon turns into 'Heil Hitler'. They are given some detailed moments that psychologically manifest their psyches. Although their roads differ they meet....The film can also boast of nice photography by Guenther Anders in particular the nice camerawork at juxtaposing images of newspapers tidings about WWI some romantic shots including a dreamlike moment of Henriette and Rudolf on a balcony moving camerawork that draws parallels to viewers' perceptions highlighting the emotionally significant moments consider Henriette's visit at the emperor Franz Josef and the shot of his office first while we hear his voice and after a few minutes see his face. The aesthetic merit of the film reaches its climax at the final moments that prompt reflections and impatience to burst into the overwhelming finale. The lovely piece by Beethoven's Op. 48 from The Glory of God in Nature that Selma plays loudly proclaims the angel's song and represents the true ideals being recaptured in new generations.This film is a true gem of the Austrian cinema that does not escape to cheap sentimentalism nor to the kitschy clichs but can still touch and delight various viewers even those discriminating ones.";

The Mongols then go on to Urgaa Chinesea town ruled by the powerful Wang Khan Thomas Gomez. The mighty ruler welcomes his guests and entertains them at a banquet... Bortai attends and is seated next to him... She suddenly decides to dance for the Khan and taking two swords starts her exotic dance... At the end having discarded one of the swords she aims the other one at Temujin...As Genghis Khan the 12th Century Mongol warrior whose coming changed the face of the world John Wayne won't disappoint his ardent followers...The highlight of the film is the sensational veil and swords dance Susan Hayward performs... Hayward looked radiant in her wrath...Agnes Moorehead nearly manages to steal the show as her imitation of a talking prune is absolutely extraordinary... Two of Wayne's sons had bit parts as warriors...";

The costuming direction cinematography and choreography are all quite well done and it is surprisingly true to history. Most people can't get beyond the fact that John Wayne plays the title role of Genghis Khan and I admit that it is difficult but the greatest problem is his accent not his acting.  He delivers his lines exactly as if he were in one of his Western classics and does not attempt a Mongolian accent. The dialogue is contrary to the previous comments not inappropriate but when delivered by Wayne with his western twang its does often sound comical. I suggest that the audience try to think of this film as just another cowboy movie and try not to take it so seriously.  In the end it is a thoroughly enjoyable film and that is what matters.  The lack of Asian actors is regrettable but consistent for the era in which is was made.".

Coming from a country in neighbourhood of China I have some knowledge of Oriental customs so when I compare this movie to the Genghis Khan Omar Sharif's I am forced to call this movie outstanding. The script is restricted to the early life of Chengez till his rise to power begins. This is good as by focussing on a limited time span there is only little mutilation of history. Decent coverage of his full life would have required three hours. Therefore sensibly the most adventurous part has been covered thereby avoiding boredom for the audience. Story line is fine and not loose. The movie remains thrilling throughout. Stunts are quite good and battle scenes credible. Although unfortunately there is no notable oriental actor yet make up is quite satisfactory as are the costumes. I wish some work had been done on the accent of the actors.  John Wayne fits well in his role. He has a good military physique and a commanding presence. Susan Hayward however is too tall for an oriental women and lacked suitable makeup and costumes. Dialogues are short and focussed. The music is satisfactory. Shooting location is satisfactory though some scenes should have been shot in snowy locations to remind people of bitter Mongolian winter. Perhaps some more focuss on Mongolian customs should also have attracted the attention of the public. Overall this is not at all a time waster but still shows that thorough research is needed for producing good historical movies especially when it comes to  cultures unfamiliar to the West.".

	schema:headline " I am Temujin the Conqueror. No prison can hold me no army defeat me";
	schema:reviewBody "Of course everyone knows the story of this one. The original plan from the brain trust at RKO was to borrow Marlon Brando from 20th Century Fox and have him star in this one. When Fox refused to cooperate Howard Hughes apparently remembered that John Wayne still had one more picture left on the RKO contract he signed back in 1939. And so one of the most dubious casting decisions in Hollywood history was made. It deserved its spot in the 50 Worst Films of All Time list. This one is for Wayne completests and diehard bad film junkies only.This is the one film John Wayne made that is truly terrible. All the others even the lesser ones at least have something to recommend them. But the thing that sets The Conqueror apart from all the rest is how extremely pedestrian everything is. Let's start with the script which is the overriding problem throughout the whole film. It's written in a sort of mockShakespearian lingo and is filled with dialogue that anyone on earth would have a hard time saying with a straight face.Next we have the casting. John Wayne and Susan Hayward both at their career peak were cast in this one. Neither one looks the least bit Asian Hayward doesn't even try to. You get the feeling throughout that both of them know this thing is a joke and they are both just trying to make it through. Wayne drawls his way through the role of Genghis Khan while Hayward is alternately dumbboring as Bortai his redheaded wife. Even the lower billed actors look uncomfortable in gaudy costumes that look like they were borrowed from a high school play.Of course we can't forget the music. Victor Young The Quiet Man wrote some of the greatest scores in Hollywood history but this one certainly ranks as one of his worst. Here he seems to be repeating the same few bars of the melodramatic theme over and over again throughout the film with little to no variation.Next we come to the cinematography. This was the one thing that could have made the film worthwhile. It didn't. While the onlocation battle scenes were wellsuited to the CinemaScope photography too much of the film took place inside tents and palaces i.e. on soundstages giving it a cluster phobic look at times. Most of the action takes place in the middle of the frame the director doesn't even come close to tapping the full potential of the widescreen technology he was working with. Other Wayne films from around the same time The High and the Mighty The Sea Chase Blood Alley made much better use of CinemaScope photography.Last we have the direction by Dick Powell. This was just the second film Powell directed the first was Split Second a 1953 noir film also for RKO that starred Stephen McNally and Jan Sterling and it showed. In all fairness he was saddled with a impossible script and a meddling boss Hughes. Powell would later go on to direct some good war movies over at Fox with Robert Mitchum The Enemy Below The Hunters. I guess Powell learned his lesson with this one and stuck to twentiethcentury wars after this leaving the ancient history alone! Of course there were other problems during shooting Sue's erratic and irrational affection for Duke and the cancer cases that occurred later were an unintentional tragedy of this film. Hughes personally bought back the rights to this film along with Jet Pilot when he sold RKO in the late 50's. Legend has it that in his last days he watched this film over and over while in bed. Maybe his strange behavior before his death was the result of seeing a little too much of the The Conqueror. Viewers Beware!!!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "When I paid top dollar actually 1.25 to see John Wayne's newest picture first run at Washington DC's fine RKO Keith's Theater I had no clue I was watching the murder of America's all time favorite actor as well as the murder of Dick Powell Susan Hayward and altogether 88 others who worked on this picture. Lurking in a low population area of Utah was enough nuclear radiation to kill all these fine people. The story was well reported much later and you can search it on Google. The final chapter was when the last survivors  each dying horrible deaths from terminal cancer  sued the Feds for damages. Our government decided that by filing a series of delaymotions they could wait it out until the survivors were dead. The nuclear radiation had drifted from the Nevada Nuclear Test Site about 150 to 200 miles west. John Wayne never criticized the US Government for this  as the threats from Russia and Red China made testing necessary.It isn't fair however to misjudge and besmirch the work of director Dick Powell or John Wayne or the other fine people who worked on this movie. THE CONQUERER is definitely NOT one of the worst of all time or even close to it.THE CONQUERER was not a serious historic movie but rather a romantic action drama combining lots of action scenes with romance scenes wherein much commotion and bloodletting let alone handwringing about who gets Susan Hayward. The picture was stunningly photographed well directed and acted with a fine and later imitated musical score by Victor Young. There isn't really a dull moment and if any of the dialog seems silly who really knows how people talked in 12th Century China? Anyway it's similar in dialog to any of a hundred movies of this genre. Having seen the recent Discovery Channel documentary we rented CONQUERER at Video Vault and watched it again. It stands up well compared to 2007 films but then it's tough to be worse than Warner's trashing of J K Rowling in HP5. The Conquerer and Plan 9 from Outer Space have nothing in common. Rent this fine film and respect the memory of the 91 who later died from making it.I've been to the extreme low population areas of eastern Nevada and nearby Utah over a dozen times it's beautiful and peaceful and draws a person back to the natural beauty and solitude. Until today I never gave the radiation a thought not even in the lunch spot in Alamo Flats NV. But they haven't tested here in decades.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the film  there is epic  mammoth spectacle  hokey historical events  a love story  camp dialog to spare  wonderful landscapes and results to be a failed as well a little boring film . At the time  1956  surpassed anything ever filmed before  including allstarcast who were later stricken by cancer . Set during the 13th century in which the brutal warrior Mongol chief Temujin conquers most of Asia  Europe and the MiddleEast . As Temujin John Wayne  considered to be the silliest character of his long career battles against Tartar armies led by Kumlek and for the love of the Tartar princess Bortai Susan Hayward . Temujin was taken prisoner by the rival warlord  a fearless leader called Kumlek Ted De Corsia and as punishment was forced to wear a large round wooden stock that severely restricted his movements but with the help of Bortai he manages to getaway . He overcomes all of his hardships to become one of the greatest conquerors the world has ever known and now starts his quest to unify all of the Mongol tribes . Gengis gets big hits  but his old nemesis keeps appearing at various times in his life leader to a final battle between the two . As Genghis Khan ruthless leader of the Mongols and sovereign over the vastest empire ever ruled by a single man was both god and devil  not just in the Middle Ages  but for centuries to come . Temujin becomes the emperor of Mongols  the great Gengis Khan .This expensive epic film in familiar drawling fashion contains clichd barbarian dialogue  noisy action  great production design  impressive battles and a cast of thousands . It was filmed near a nuclear test site and the set was contaminated by nuclear fallout  in the Yucca Flats area . Over the next 20 years many actors and crew members developed cancer . By the time 91 of the 220 cast and crew members had developed cancer . Fortysix had died including John Wayne Susan Hayward Pedro Armendriz  Agnes Moorehead John Hoyt and director Dick Powell . The count did not include several hundred local Native Americans who played extras  or relatives of the cast and crew who visited the set including John Wayne's son Michael Wayne . Many of the Mongol extras were played by local Navajo Indians  they did not wear any makeup . Miscasting by John Wayne and the results are unintentionally hilarious . But John Wayne took his role very seriously went on a crash diet  however he regretted playing Temujin so much that he visibly shuddered whenever anyone mentioned the film's name as he once remarked that the moral of the film was not to make an ass of yourself trying to play parts you're not suited for . Colorful cinematography by four of the best Hollywood cameramen  Joseph LaShelle  William E. Snyder  Leo Tover and Harry J. Wild . Although the movie takes place in Asia photography in Cinemascope was shot in California Snow Canyon Utah Hurricane St. George Utah USA Escalante Desert St. George Utah . This sweeping oriental drama was backed by financially eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes and regularly directed by former movie star Dick Powell . However  the box office failure of this movie was believed to be ultimately responsible for the demise of RKO Pictures studios . Dick Powell directed a few films such as  1953 Split Second  1956 You Can't Run Away from It  1958 The hunters and his best film was  The enemy below . This was one of the final theatrically released movies of director Dick Powell who soon after worked exclusively in television such as Woman on the Run TV 1959 . Other films dealing with this historical figure are the followings  Genghis Khan 1965 by Henry Levin with Omar Shariff  Stephen Boyd  Telly Savallas  James Mason  Gengis Khan 2005 by Edward Bazalgette and the best  Mongol2007 by Sergey Bodrov".

As Genghis Khan ruthless leader of the Mongols and sovereign over the vastest empire ever ruled by a single man was both god and devil  not just in the Middle Ages  but for centuries to come . Temujin becomes the emperor of Mongols  the great Gengis Khan .This expensive epic film in familiar drawling fashion contains clichd barbarian dialogue  noisy action  great production design  impressive battles and a cast of thousands . It was filmed near a nuclear test site and the set was contaminated by nuclear fallout  in the Yucca Flats area . Over the next 20 years many actors and crew members developed cancer . By the time 91 of the 220 cast and crew members had developed cancer . Fortysix had died including John Wayne Susan Hayward Pedro Armendriz  Agnes Moorehead John Hoyt and director Dick Powell . The count did not include several hundred local Native Americans who played extras  or relatives of the cast and crew who visited the set including John Wayne's son Michael Wayne . Many of the Mongol extras were played by local Navajo Indians  they did not wear any makeup . Miscasting by John Wayne and the results are unintentionally hilarious . But John Wayne took his role very seriously went on a crash diet  however he regretted playing Temujin so much that he visibly shuddered whenever anyone mentioned the film's name as he once remarked that the moral of the film was not to make an ass of yourself trying to play parts you're not suited for . Colorful cinematography by four of the best Hollywood cameramen  Joseph LaShelle  William E. Snyder  Leo Tover and Harry J. Wild . Although the movie takes place in Asia photography in Cinemascope was shot in California Snow Canyon Utah Hurricane St. George Utah USA Escalante Desert St. George Utah . This sweeping oriental drama was backed by financially eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes and regularly directed by former movie star Dick Powell . However  the box office failure of this movie was believed to be ultimately responsible for the demise of RKO Pictures studios . Dick Powell directed a few films such as  1953 Split Second  1956 You Can't Run Away from It  1958 The hunters and his best film was  The enemy below . This was one of the final theatrically released movies of director Dick Powell who soon after worked exclusively in television such as Woman on the Run TV 1959 . Other films dealing with this historical figure are the followings  Genghis Khan 1965 by Henry Levin with Omar Shariff  Stephen Boyd  Telly Savallas  James Mason  Gengis Khan 2005 by Edward Bazalgette and the best  Mongol2007 by Sergey Bodrov";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm probably not part of the majority here but I think this is a good movie. A lot of people are probably knocking it before they've even seen it because John Wayne plays Temujin.As the story goes John Wayne wanted the role and he was very serious about it. He found the script in Dick Powell's office. I'm sure Powell had his reasons for wanting to throw the script out but it can't be that it was that horrible of a script. The script is actually pretty decent. I can't complain about the makeup either because I think that was very well done too. John Wayne between the makeup and his hair really looks Asian in this.People that criticize this movie keep pointing out the nationalities of everyone involved. If you are going to do that then you are just nitpicking. Yes John Wayne is a white man playing a Mongol. But you couldn't have expected them to cast a real Mongol in the role. Whites played Orientals and Native Americans all the time back then. Anthony Quinn who is of Mexican and Irish descent played Attila the Hun once. Omar Sharif once played Genghis Khan. Stephen Boyd played Kahn's blood brother Jamuga. That Sharif and Boyd movie was horrible by the way. The Conqueror is way better than that. The Conqueror is more accurate too. You're probably going to wonder Why John Wayne? I said the same exact thing and I thought the movie was silly at first. But I actually sat down and watched it and I thought it was good.The Conqueror's opening is great. It opens with Temujin riding through the dessert with his Mongol army. The scenes of the army riding are great. They are shot so well. The action scenes of the Mongols fighting enemy armies were great too. If you want action this has plenty of it. Another nice touch was the love story between Temujin and Bortai. Bortai is played by Susan Hayward. She was pretty decent in her role. I enjoyed her scenes with John Wayne. I also enjoyed Pedro Armendariz in his scenes with John Wayne. Armendariz was also decent in his role as Jamuga Temujin's blood brother. A previous reviewer said that John Wayne and Pedro Armendariz are not believable as brothers. Keep in mind the movie never says they are brothers but they keep stressing blood brothers.Overall I think The Conqueror was a pretty good movie. It pushed all of the right buttons for me. I enjoyed it very much. The Conqueror is a well made movie with good performances great directing great cinematography decent writing great costumes and great makeup. I thought the score by Victor Young was great too. I especially loved the Romantic theme that Young uses throughout the movie. That was very memorable.If you ever get a chance see this movie. If you are interested in the subject matter check it out. If you are a fan of the old time classics or those Hollywood epics check it out. If you are a fan of John Wayne and you want to see him in a different role for a change check it out. John Wayne won't disappoint you. The Conqueror and John Wayne are not bad at all. Don't knock this movie until you've seen it. People were way too harsh when they placed their votes on IMDb. I'll bet that some people gave this movie a 1 without even seeing it. All they saw was John Wayne's name in the credits.".

He decided it would be a good part for him and when Duke Wayne says he wants to make this movie no one says no a la Tom Cruise today. The fact that this role was totally not him no matter how good an actor he was did not faze him. The rest is er history. Unfortunately so were many of the actors and crew who eventually died from radiation poisoning as a result of being on location in Utah not too far from nuclear test sites. When Howard Hughes sold RKO soon after his only request was that he keep the rights to two movies Jet Pilot and this epic. Legend has it that he kept playing them over and over again in his room. If he got as tetched as they say he did in his later years you can blame his malady in part on the adverse effects of seeing The Conqueror one too many times.For further review see the Medved Brothers' book Golden Turkey Awards which has a lot of additional information about this movie that is rightfully included within its pages.

She relates that Mitchell moaned and groaned throughout the shoot that this film would ruin him as an actor and why did he ever sign for it. On the other hand Walter Huston's attitude was to laugh uproariously at the awful dialog he had to spout and said since Howard's check cleared the bank he'd say any words in the script.Hopefully Howard's check cleared the bank for all concerned because a decent pay day is the only reason for everyone from John Wayne and Susan Hayward on down to have stuck it out.What everyone doesn't get about The Conqueror is that it has a very gay subtext. It's obvious that Pedro Armendariz is crushing out big time on the Duke. They may have even gotten a little physical. But that all changes for Wayne the second his Mongol made up eyes set sight of red headed Tartar princess Susan Hayward. It's girls for him now especially this one.Viewers might disagree but I swear it's the only explanation for what happens in the rest of the film. Armendariz alternately betrays Wayne and rescues him for no discernible reason throughout the rest of the story. When Wayne finally takes care of all his enemies Armendariz who won't share Wayne with Hayward or anybody asks to be put to death. So help me that's the plot of The Conqueror. Everyone from Wayne on down looks as trapped as Thomas Mitchell was in The Outlaw. But they all must have gotten the money up front.Fortunately John Ford would rescue Wayne with two back to back classics in succeeding years The Searchers in 1956 and Wings of Eagles in 1957. Now those are really good John Wayne films.What more can I say the acting is terrible the story is awful even the technical aspects of this film leave a lot to be desired. It only gets as high a rating as it does because of the quality of the cast maybe the most shameful waste of talent players in the history of cinema in every sense of the word.".

As I watched it I could not stop laughing upon hearing the Duke utter such lines as Dance! Dance for me Tartar woman! So in a sort of way I do recommend seeing it but only for hilarity's sake.";

	schema:reviewBody "John Wayne as Ganghis Khan and lots of white people playing Asians and making no effort to look and sound Asian. The Duke was a great actor but a 6'4 white man with blue eyes doesn't make a convincing Asian. Give him a much shorter Mexican brother Jamuga played by Pedro Armendariz and a barely 5 foot mother who was only 7 years older than the Duke Hunlun played by Agnes Moorehead and you have The Conqueror one of the grossest examples of miscasting in Hollywood history. The other big fup is the semi Biblical English dialog. If you just have to see this movie and it is worthwhile for laughs if nothing else get the DVD and turn the captions on. Otherwise you won't have clue what anyone is saying.The basic plot is actually pretty good. The stunts and battle scenes are good too. If it had been cast correctly and if the Biblical dialog had been eliminated it could have been a good movie.Although never intended to be a comedy it comes across as one largely due to the ridiculous dialog and costumes especially head gear. Agnes Moorhead's costume is especially hilarious wrapped up like a mummy in green with only here face visible and huge multicolor beads dangling from each side of her head. Susan Hayward who plays Bortai Temujin's love interest looks like a modern prostitute in a succession of low cut dresses and modern high heels. Also included is a Las Vegas dance revue of scantily clad white women who have these things on there heads that look like pink doggiedoo. During the opening credits and later during the first battle John Wayne is seen charging into battle on horseback waving his sword in the air and screaming like a Commanche with an expression of shear insanity on his face that had me busting at the seams. William Conrad plays Kasar Temujins immensely strong but retarded brother and plays it HORRIBLY. John Hoyt plays the Shaman dressed in a white and yellow Merlin costume the character is the stereotypical Japanese from WWII movies.Much is made about the fact this movie was filmed in SW Utah about 100 miles or so from the Nevada Test Site which lead to the cast and crew being radiated and dying from cancer. I my opinion this is grossly exaggerated. The facts are a lot of people die from cancer actors included and cancer has many causes. Also many of the deaths occurred decades after this movie was made and most of the actors lived into old age. This movie was filmed in 1954 but John Wayne didn't die until 1979. Several of the players survived him including John Hoyt William Conrad Peter Mammokos who is still living 50 years later Chuck Roberson stuntman no screen role in this film and the Duke's son Pat Wayne who still lives. Las Vegas is about 100 miles from the Nevada Test Site it hasn't died off from cancer. Several small Nevada towns Tonopah Goldfield Beatty Indian Springs and Pioche are literally next door to the Nevada Test Site and they haven't died off from cancer either.This is generally regarded as the Duke's worst movie. Although this is definitely a bad movie at least it is entertaining. The Fighting Kentuckian the Fighting Seebees and The Green Berets are all much worse they are unwatchable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Media Mongol Howard Hughes meet his match. It wasn't the Great Wall of China that stop him but this movie! Indeed Howard Hughes felt guilty about his decisions regarding the film's production and how the movie bomb at the box office that he stop making movies sold his production company RKO to General Tire and conquer all by buying every print of the film for 12 million and kept it out of circulation for many years until Universal Pictures purchased the film from his estate in 1979. It was indeed that bad! The Conqueror got the better of the cast  crew that made the film due to the fact that most of the film was filmed near a nuclear test site. It's not like they didn't know that. They opening joke about it and choice to ignore the warnings because they thought they were in a safe area from the nuclear test site. Since the set was contaminated by nuclear fallout most of the crew and cast end up dying from later stages of cancer. Some people believe that nuclear fallout was the leading cause of John Wayne's death. Indeed the movie was curse. Many had died to terminal cancer including John Wayne Susan Hayward Pedro Armendriz who shot himself soon after learning he had terminal cancer Agnes Moorehead John Hoyt and director Dick Powell. What a shame. I really don't think this was a movie 1950's America was going to watch anyways. The film deals with Mongols Merkits and Tartars struggling for survival in a harsh and arid land that most Americans have no clue nor care about. Most Americans at the time were into European Medieval Epics SciFiction or Westerns. Honestly in a deep conservative time in America a movie about rape and plunder wouldn't get to pack the movie houses. The movie is about Mongol chief Temujin AKA Genghis Khan John Wayne who kidnapped start war and 'rapes' Bortai Susan Hayward of the Tartar clan. Yes that's the hero everybody. Enjoy that. I hate the tagline for this movie 'They conquered each other and then the world'. Yeah that sounds like an epic romantic love story with Bortai trying to decapitate him behind Temujin's back! That's what 1959's Ben Hur was missing. Rape love subplot! Yeah that would bring people into seeing your film. Forced romance. While the romantic music by Victor Young is beautiful it seem to not match what is happening on screen with the Stockholm syndrome love affair. The music also repeated way too much. The dialogue is so awful pseudoOld English wordy and dodgy. Some sentences don't even make any sense. Everybody sounds stiff. Honestly I give some credit to John Wayne. He took his role very seriously and even diet to get fit but gees. He's so miscast. Seriously Hollywood if you going to make a movie about an Asian person. You might as well cast an Asian actor or at less support your character with some oriental actors as supporting characters. There were no notable oriental actor in this film at all. John Wayne looks and sounds the same as if he was delivery a Western. Instead of a Western movie set he went to Chinatown trade in his cowboy hat and gun for a Fu Manchu moustache and sword. Then he walk into this film. He looks plain silly. At less the movie wasn't too offended with the Asian stereotypes. John Wayne sounds like he's reading off cue cards at a high school play with a Western twang. I don't think the movie original choice Marlon Brando could do this movie any better. Susan Hayward was indeed sexy but she's clearly not Asian enough. I don't think I know a lot of ancient Orientals having red hair during that time. Her acting was just as bad as John Wayne. Why the hell is she always looking offscreen with a blank stare? Is she reading cue cards? Is she bored? Is that all she can do to keep herself from laughing at Wayne's horrible acting? I don't know. The supporting cast was such a bored as well. Look for a Lee Van Cleef in a cameo in this film. While the movie is indeed fiction it did had some historical inaccuracies regarding the people places and tribes involved. I don't think the movie needed to have opening text mentioning it fiction. It kinda ruin the whole epic history feel. The costuming direction cinematography and choreography are all quite well done. I do like the battle scenes. I do hate the day for night editing. The audio track sounds a little bit off as if some of the actors were speaking on a loud speaker. This indeed is a real Manchurian Candidate for one of the worst movies ever made. Legend has it that in Howard Hughes's last days he watched this film over and over when his Obsessivecompulsive disorder was at its worst. Overall In my opinion it's not the worst movie. I watch this movie just because of my interest of Genghis Khan and how much I love the Duke's movies. Still I find it watchable but pretty bad. Genghis Khan 2004 TV series is far greater a film. I think I'll eat Mongolian BBQ now just to fill my upset stomach after watching this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film starts in England March 1943  when nonconformist Private Harry Frigg Paul Newman escapes from the guard house but he is detained again  previously he had escaped from prison dozens of times. Tunisia  April 1943  allied generals are captured  it is a propaganda nightmare for the Allies. The generals are all one star and refuse to take orders from each other in order to scheme a getaway. Northern Italy  May 1943  the group of American and European generals in prison at a luxurious Italian mansion . London August 1943  Major General James Gregory assigns Harry Frigg a dangerous mission as part a scheme . He is promoted to two stars Major General and ordered to get the generals out once he is trapped. Harry is parachuted to Northern Italy and imprisoned at the lush palace where are the generals . Harry is willing to escape but then he meets a gorgeous countess Sylva Koscina and falls in love with her . At the beginning the generals suspect Harry Frigg of being a spy in their midst .This is a warlike comedy with funny moments  bemusing situations and quite entertaining . Likable performance of Paul Newman as silly Private promoted general to help escape other generals from the custody of the Germans. Agreeable screenplay by Peter Stone  also producer . The screenwriter dabbles a comic battle of sexes between an illiterate Newman and a highclass countess . Wonderful Sylva Koscina as cultured countess who establishes a lovely and enjoyable relationship with Paul Newman .

Harry is willing to escape but then he meets a gorgeous countess Sylva Koscina and falls in love with her . At the beginning the generals suspect Harry Frigg of being a spy in their midst .This is a warlike comedy with funny moments  bemusing situations and quite entertaining . Likable performance of Paul Newman as silly Private promoted general to help escape other generals from the custody of the Germans. Agreeable screenplay by Peter Stone  also producer . The screenwriter dabbles a comic battle of sexes between an illiterate Newman and a highclass countess . Wonderful Sylva Koscina as cultured countess who establishes a lovely and enjoyable relationship with Paul Newman .

	schema:reviewBody "Paul Newman as Harry Frigg is a goldbricking screwup of a soldier who has one undeniable talent. Busting out of stockade. Seems as though the man cannot stand confinement.That talent is put to good use by General James Gregory to affect the escape of five Allied Brigadier Generals who were captured in a Turkish bath in Tunis. Two British two American and one Free French general. The biggest Italian victory since the seizure of Albania.Since these five guys seem willing to sit out the war in an Italian prison camp and being of equal rank can't get together on a plan of action the idea Gregory has is to send in an escape specialist the best the United States Army has with the rank of a two star general and get an escape organized. Of course it's Paul Newman.Of course when Newman is dropped into Italy and put in that prison camp for generals only he finds it quite unlike any stockade he's ever been in. Prison as run by Colonel Vito Scotti a former hotel manager in Genoa. All the luxury of a Club Med vacation and for Newman the attraction of Countess Sylva Koscina whose palace is being used for this prison camp for generals.During the course of the film the Allies have taken Sicily and land in Salerno and Italy switches sides. The Nazis come and prove to be a gang of real party poopers.The Secret War of Harry Frigg is a mildly amusing comedy. Paul Newman does the best he can with it though he's not really cast well in this part. The premise is unusual however and my favorite performance is here is that of Vito Scotti. Man really knew how to be a good jailer.Curiously enough some of the same premise involving Italy's deposing Mussolini and switching sides was the basis for another film about allied prisoners Von Ryan's Escape. Of course that one involved far more prisoners and had a lot less laughs.Paul Newman never really had a big comedy triumph until he made Slapshot. But this one while not great is droll and amusing in its own way.".

	schema:headline " It is barely much of a secret that despite the lead's performance Harry Frigg's secret war against the classes and a certain woman's heart is not one for the long run.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Secret War of Harry Frigg is a daft at best war comedy a film I have little doubt exists for any other reason other than The Great Escape was made a few years previously and was somewhat successful itself a piece with an outlandish romping sensibility that distilled the harsh realities of life as a prisoner of war under German command through a filter of the somewhat upbeat and cheery. The characters had fun trying to escape and we were invited to equate as such whilst watching them do so in their bid to get out and foil those dastardly Huns in the process. To some degree Jack Smight's film of Harry Frigg is actually about the polar opposites in that it features the fooling of the Italians along with the desire to stay inside of certain prisoner of war parameters but is concurrently similar in overall ideology the whole thing like The Great Escape falling apart in its final act as the shifts in tone perturb what sporadically enjoyable content preceded it and a real sense of anguish and peril is suddenly inserted into proceedings.The titular Harry Frigg is played by that of Paul Newman Newman bringing a certain boyish charm to proceedings a certain roguish charisma that sees him mean well in spite of the circumstances and yet is played with enough of what it is that makes certain higherups get as angry at him as they do. The performance is crucial to the proceedings and Newman proves if anything that he is above such things by doing as well as he does. Frigg is a deserter a guy wanting to avoid military service as best he can and attempts to do so by any means possible  a bid for freedom during an organised game of American Football the latest coup seeing him grab the ball in play and charge for an endzone located somewhere up beyond those nearby trees on that slope and about a hundred miles away there on in. The authorities try in vain to stop him the firing of live ammunition towards the guy not enough to force him into pulling up and if they were shooting to kill you'd have thought their aim might be a bit better by now given how often it's established he's tried such stunts.His involvement to proceedings becomes more prominent when a world away in Tunisia on the African front of World War Two a cluster of Generals of varying Allied nations are swiped by Axis powers and taken to an Italian castle to be held prisoner. These Generals are a stuffy bunch a mixture of the predominant Allied forces involved in said war in the form of American British and French nationalities. They cannot work together out of pride in their attempts to break free thus force those at Allied HQ to hit upon the idea of sending our Frigg into the warzone so as to get captured and then hopefully tunnel each of them out given his expertise in escaping.Following Frigg's deliberate capture we are granted a tour of the facilities the Italian guards reiterating how difficult it is to escape from such a place the place being a large elegant mansion of a few storeys with acres to spare and woodland in mostly all directions beyond the gates. Concept established it is then revealed that there is a bit of an issue involving Frigg and those of a more distinct nature within the Army from time's past specifically his disgruntlement at never having been promoted beyond that of a lowly private and he abuses his fauxrank once in there to exploit the existing situations with the officials thus acting as a further source of mirth. Thrown into proceedings is that of the mansion's Countess and owner a certain Francesca De Montefiore Koscina whom Harry comes to be quite fond of and thus holds up the excavation process. The good Countess had a husband die in the war already but the idea of being in a state of grieving appears to elude the girl as she intermingles and comes to enjoy Frigg's company.The film is total fluff from beginning to end Frigg's constant clashes with that of the existing Generals cute in its premise but not entirely funny while Frigg's shot at redemption in getting them all out of the place so as to prove his worth to the Army as a decent standalone grunt gives way to wanting to stay there and woo Francesca as quickly as possible and is not engaging nor humorous enough to act as the crux of the thing keeping it afloat. An example of the film's flat commonplace humour is evident during a sequence depicting an evening meal in which each of the captured Generals speak of their favourite dishes and restaurants of around the world. We sit there listening to extravagant meals at equally extravagantly sounding places anticipating Frigg's answer knowing he is not whom he claims to be and as a result cannot muster much of a chuckle when he reels off the best bar 'n' grill diner that he can think of located in his backwater town.The film is somewhat crass in its apparent disneyfication of POW conditions without necessarily being terribly ugly we don't dislike the lead and enjoy the idea the film carries that good teamwork regardless of class rank or background wins out in the end teamwork as opposed to petty squabbling and not being able to get beyond one's ego or sense of 'self'. The film has no right to go to the harder darker places it ventures toward come the final twenty minutes while the idea of five guys wanting 'out' under the illgotten control of one guy with a grudge wanting to stay 'in' wears a little thin. Mostly unremarkable and terribly paced at times this is one concept comedy that barely gets out of the traps.".

	schema:headline " Yet another awful Asylum mockbuster";
	schema:reviewBody "The Asylum. Just saying the words is enough to send chills up the spine  bile up the esophagus. For years the socalled filmmakers at this trash factory have been doing little more than churning out some of the worst movies in anyone's memories. From their sobad they'recompletely awful SyFy originals like 'Mega Piranha vs. Who Gives a Damn' to their appalling 'mockbusters' like 'Transmorphers' The Asylum has been able to set a new bar for just how low one can go in the film industry. And yet no matter how deep they dig into the septic systems of their imaginations somehow these scam artists manage to just keep on going. This time their target is the exorcist subgenre especially the recent success 'The Last Exorcism.' With 'Anneliese The Exorcist Tapes' director Jude Gerard Prest which is more likely than not a pseudonym since no one would want to put their real name to a film like this and his team of misfits flat out lie telling the world well the small damned percentage of the world that is unfortunate to witness this disaster that what this film is actually real. Yeah real garbage. From almost the first frame 'Anneliese' tries to be simply a compilation of what made other exorcist movies work but they just assemble their own moronic versions of those elements.

Add this to the eyeraping cinematography and 'Anneliese' is about as enjoyable to look at Alex DeLarge's forced theatre trip in 'A Clockwork Orange.' Luckily most viewers will probably spend more time watching the clock waiting for the movie to end thanks to the excruciatingly grueling pace of the writer's amateurish script which was probably the only thing worse about this movie than the directing editing and cinematography.Final Verdict 110.AP3".

	onyx:emotionText "The Asylum. Just saying the words is enough to send chills up the spine  bile up the esophagus. For years the socalled filmmakers at this trash factory have been doing little more than churning out some of the worst movies in anyone's memories. From their sobad they'recompletely awful SyFy originals like 'Mega Piranha vs. Who Gives a Damn' to their appalling 'mockbusters' like 'Transmorphers' The Asylum has been able to set a new bar for just how low one can go in the film industry. And yet no matter how deep they dig into the septic systems of their imaginations somehow these scam artists manage to just keep on going. This time their target is the exorcist subgenre especially the recent success 'The Last Exorcism.' With 'Anneliese The Exorcist Tapes' director Jude Gerard Prest which is more likely than not a pseudonym since no one would want to put their real name to a film like this and his team of misfits flat out lie telling the world well the small damned percentage of the world that is unfortunate to witness this disaster that what this film is actually real. Yeah real garbage. From almost the first frame 'Anneliese' tries to be simply a compilation of what made other exorcist movies work but they just assemble their own moronic versions of those elements. Even the opening cloned almost completely a scene from William Friedkin's 'The Exorcist.'

The characters are stock you learn nothing about them and you don't care at all for them as a result while the writing is embarrassingly trite and you have to look very closely to notice if there is a story at all there probably was one but was so thin and dull that it is not worth your time. The acting apart from Muller who deserved so much better is next to nonexistent. On the whole I shudder even thinking of the badness of Anneliese The Exorcist Tapes.

	schema:reviewBody "I never came across a DVD called Anneliese The Exorcist Tapes. But I do came across Paranormal Entity 3. And let that be the same flick. Pure commercially chosen that title but be advised. It had nothing to do with paranormal entities. It is in fact a pure possession flick. It was based on the story of Anneliese Michel.Anneliese Michel 21 September 1952  1 July 1976 was a German Catholic woman who was said to be possessed by demons and subsequently underwent an exorcism. The case has been labelled as a misidentification of mental illness negligence abuse and religious hysteria. When she was sixteen she suffered a severe convulsion and was diagnosed as having epilepsy. Soon she began hallucinating while praying. In 1973 she suffered from depression and began to hear voices telling her that she was damned and would rot in hell. On 1 July 1976 Anneliese died in her sleep. The autopsy report stated the cause of death as malnutrition and dehydration from almost a year of semistarvation while the rites of exorcism were performed. She weighed 68 pounds 30.91 kilograms. Three motion pictures The Exorcism of Emily Rose 2005 Requiem 2006 and the Asylum film Anneliese The Exorcist Tapes are loosely based on Michel's story.Horror buffs will have noticed one word The Asylum. Again Asylum films tried to pick in on the success of a blockbuster. sadly they failed. The flick has nothing to offer. The first second I laughed out loud already by seeing a socalled German. What a clich that was. Not only that they tried to let English actors to speak English with a German accent. It sounded like inspector Clouseau...Further we have a lot of priests just talking and stating in front of the camera about Anneliese. Anneliese herself didn't look possessed. She looked like a girl waking up with her eye makeup still on. Nobody really was convincing. What was interesting was the use of real audio footage of Anneliese but sadly they edited it 3 times into the flick. A very annoying turkey maybe if you watch it pssed and proud you do will have a laugh. The only thing that it had in common with the paranormal entity franchise was the nudity boobs in it. And they do distract you from the story. Maybe her juggs were possessed?Gore 05 Nudity 055 Effects 05 Story 15 Comedy 25".

	schema:reviewBody "Anneliese The Exorcist Tapes 2011 12 out of 4 The Asylum's attempt to cash in on countless exorcism films including THE LAST EXORCISM which this is a mockbuster of. Not only that but the studio tries to claim that the true case of Anneliese Michel a German girl who was believed to have been possessed by the devil is featured in this found footage horror movie. In the film we see Anneliese Nikki Muller as she goes through various physical and psychological situations and the locals priests feels she's possessed while the doctors from the hospital thinks she's just mentally troubled. The footage will let the truth be known. ANNELIESE THE EXORCIST TAPES is an extremely bad movie that lacks any real imagination and in the end its 90minutes just go by so slowly that you'll wish you were the one possessed by the devil. I think a lot of the blame has to go towards the actual story which simply gives us nothing new or interesting. We never really get to know any of the characters. We never care about any of the characters and there's not a single second where any of them don't come off more annoying than anything else. It also doesn't help that the director filmed everything so bland that there's just never anything that pulls you into the film. The lack of any real suspense or drama is just the death nail. Even worse is that there's not a single frame where you feel as if you're watching some sort of found footage as it's clear what we're seeing isn't real for one but it's clearly also not shot in 1976 which is the date it takes place. There are two things that kept me from giving this a BOMB rating and one is the performance as Muller. I thought she actually did a pretty good job in the part but it's just a shame her talents were in such a worthless movie. The second thing that worked is that the film thankfully got so bad to where I got a couple big laughs. One came from the horrendous German accents and the other came from a scene where the possessed girl tries to sexually assault one of the priests.".

That didn't change until things got totally out of control with too many defenseless lawmen getting killed.Margaret Lindsay also stars in this movie and that's a good thing. The more I see of her the more I like her.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1935 people paid to watch the physical strutting smartmouthed James Cagney and even in this film about FBI agents in the production code era of the 1930's Cagney gives them that. This time though Cagney is one of the guys trying to apprehend gangsters like Tom Powers of The Public Enemy rather than playing one.Cagney is Brick Davis a guy who came up from the slums of New York a man whose personal benefactor is in the rackets himself but he never wanted anything for or from Brick other than for him to make good. The opening scene shows Cagney giving a legal summation  something about a poor man fighting the big corporations. As the camera pans back we see that there is no jury and in fact Brick is getting nowhere with his law practice.An old friend now a GMan himself visits Brick and suggests he join the FBI. After that old friend is shot in the line of duty by a gangster Brick does just that. This film is pretty much a conventional paintbynumbers cops and robbers picture made exceptional by exceptional performers. Robert Armstrong who comes across as more of a mug than Cagney is supervising agent Jeff McCord who doesn't like Cagney from the start for really no good reason that I could surmise. Ann Dvorak is the tarnished angel  a chorus girl without a chorus who does what she has to do to survive but also wants to do the right thing and seems to harbor a bit of a thing for Cagney's character. Margaret Lindsay is Jeff's sister a nurse no less who doesn't like Brick either  at first. Then there are a host of bad guys the worst of which is Barton McLane in the kind of so mean he's terrific role at which he excelled in the 1930's and beyond.For people who love Cagney in action with lots of shoot outs and fighting an uphill battle to get the girl of his dreams this one fits the bill.One thing that you may find puzzling if you watch the DVD release of this film which is actually from a 1949 rerelease is the presence of a prologue. That prologue has Warner Brothers contract player David Brian playing an FBI instructor talking to a class of FBI men about the history of the agency and how it was before the agents could even carry guns. Apparently the FBI offered no cooperation in the making of G Men in 1935 but by 1949 the agency really liked this picture and so this prologue was tacked on. Just don't get too confused about the time warp.".

Cagneys performance is one of his best and it's not just cagney that shines Robert Armstrong is brilliant as Cagney's tough talking FBI boss. and Regis Toomey's good but brief appearance as Cagney's doomed friend is equally pleasing.I love everything about this Movie the guns the Cars the suits the music. The only thing I don't like is that every version you find of this great film these days has the annoying and rather pointless prologue added in 1949 showing a group of 'FBI Men' or actors as I like to call them having a training session where the instructor tells this fledgling officers that Gangsters are scum and and that law and order will prevail. WHY????????The 1930's were Warner Bros's glory days and their gangster films were rightly regarded as the best crime movies ever until supplanted by the brilliant Godfather movies. However the new makes way for the old and Pacino De Niro Brando as good as they are could NEVER replace the cockiness of Cagney the ruthlessness of Raftand the barbarity of Bogiethough sadly neither Bogart or Raft appear in this picture I'm afraid. Maybe that's where the film could have been better with Barton McClanes lacklustre performance as Cagney's gangster nemesis being replaced by either George Raft or Humphrey Bogart. I'm not going to spoil the plot as this movies a treat for all fans of BW gangster films. this is a MUST SEE".

According to Pawley his role in GMen was based upon the notorious reallife gangster John Dillinger. This was Pawley's defining role as a bad guy in the movies and it served him well in his future movies in which he primarily played the bad guy. He played bad guy roles not only in gangster films but also in horror western and comedy films as well. He once stated that he played so many bad guy roles during his 10year stint in Hollywood that policemen often eyed him with suspicion whenever he walked down the street. They couldn't decide whether they had seen him in the movies on in the lineup! After deciding to leave Hollywood in 1942 he moved back to New York and replaced Edward G. Robinson in the role of Steve Wilson on radio's very popular Big Town drama series. He finally got to play the good guy!".

A prologue featuring David Brian showing the film to a group of new recruits was added.A word about the DVD commentary by film historian Richard Jewell.

This time James Cagney is fighting against the gangsters. At first it sounded weird but it works quite well.The movie tells the story of Brick Davis a lawyer related to the mafia that decides to join the FBI force known as 'GMen' after his friend also a 'GMen' is killed.As usual James Cagney gives a fine performance as Brick Davis regardless his better works like in 'White Heat' and 'Public Enemy'. The other members of the cast do a normal job just like William Keighley's direction. A supporting member of the cast that did a great job was Barton MacLane as the villain.The movie sounds more like a propaganda to the FBI force but this isn't a bad thing. For 1935's the movie has great action scenes with car chases shooting kidnapping robbery etc and they are all very well filmed for its period. Even though I prefer the action sequences in 'Scarface' they are great here also.In resume another great gangster movie from the 1930's.8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really like this movie from the early days of the Hays Code. In this early period of the Hays Office the standards for movies were still moderately loose and quite a few movies in the 30s featured graphic scenes of violence that would not have been allowed just a few years later. But as a nod to the Hays Office instead of the film being a typical gangster film which the office was trying to reduce or eliminate since they glorified criminalsbut the violence level was still very high and this would not change for another couple years. These films by and large are pretty interesting and have so pretty sordid and fantastic scenes. Unlike the later Cagney films for Warner Brothers this one had scenes such as a closeup of a lady being killed in a phone booth and cars flying off the road in a hail of bullets and exploding! This movie is DEFINITELY would you would call an Action Picture and the film is both fascinating and briskly paced.Jimmy Cagney plays a lawyer who hasn't got any clients. And his friend from law school a GMan an FBI agent is murdered while in the line of duty. Cagney decides that since his life isn't going anywhere he too will join the newly created FBI. But in the early days of the Bureau they have few enforcement powers and cannot legally carry guns. But with a serious crime wave spreading throughout the country the Congress grants them more powers and the right to bear arms. And following this the action definitely heats upwith battles involving shotguns machine guns and .45s! Cagney grew up in the Bronx and actually knew many of the most wanted men who were all members of the same gang. With Cagney's bravery and resolve the gang is eventually smashed and Jimmy gets the girl.While the story is fictional the background information about the bureau and the way they conducted business had a strong degree of realism that was unusual for films at that time. Great action scenes combined with excellent acting make this one of the very best Warner films of the crime genre.By the way the version I saw was from a 1949 rerelease. It differed because it featured a very brief prologue praising the FBI before the actual film began.".

Once arriving in Washington for training Brick is given a hard time by McCord the officer in charge but McCord thinks Brick has the makings of a great agent even though McCord uncovers the fact that Brick's education was paid for by McKay a racketeer who now wants to get out of the rackets. Leggett who was one of the people McKay sold his interests to is now Public Enemy number one following a mob shootout with the GMen. The agency gets Congress to pass laws that allow the FBI to cross state lines carry ammunition make kidnapping and bank robbery federal crimes and others to strengthen the agency. Leggett is captured and the FBI next goes after Collins who is hiding out at McKay's hotel in Wisconsin. A shootout ensues McKay and several of Collins' gang is killed but the head gangster gets away. Can Brick and McCord apprehend Collins before he kills his wife a former flame of Brick and the person who gave away Collins' location to the police and also kills McCord's sister Kay who Brick is sweet on? Good film from Warner Bros. trying to sanitize Cagney's character from his earlier gangster pictures. Keighley's direction makes good use of all the shootouts which spare little and do paint a decent picture of the FBI's problems during its infancy. Cagney still manages to play the tough guy very well even though this time he's on the side of law and order. Dvorak is sympathetic as Jean. Lindsay is OK but she is not given much time to establish much character and when she does she becomes the stereotypical love interest for Cagney. Much of the last halfhour of the film does seem rushed as compared to the first hour. Rating 7.".

These films were so much fun filled with action and drama with a heaping dose of social commentary on the side. Despite the criminals usually dying in the end of these movies WB was accused by some of glorifying hoodlums. So in answer to that they made this little gem that was designed to glorify the good guys instead. How did they do that? They took their main tough guy star James Cagney and made him a fed or GMan. In this movie Cagney plays a lawyer who joins the Department of Justice after his federal agent friend is killed.This is a firstrate gangster picture directed by William Keighley and written by Seton I. Miller. No matter which side of the law he's on Cagney is his usual charismatic self not too far removed from his other gangster roles. He's still the tough runt who would sooner break your jaw or plug you with his gat before he would place you under arrest but he's got a badge this time and he does follow the rules...for the most part. Fantastic cast backing Cagney up. William Harrigan is a scene stealer as the softhearted gangster who helps Jimmy out and pays for it in the end. Perennial heavy Barton MacLane gets plenty of scenery to chew as the main villain. Robert Armstrong is the agent that rides Cagney hard but eventually decides he's a good egg. Margaret Lindsay is Armstrong's sister and one of two dames that fall for Jimmy in this picture. The other being the lovely Ann Dvorak who shines as she almost always did. She is really one of the more underrated actresses of her time. Despite her appealing performance though her first scene is a bit cringeworthy as she's badly lipsyncing and awkwardly dancing around like a wounded chicken. She was a fine dramatic actress but not a great singer or dancer. Others rounding out the cast include Lloyd Nolan Regis Toomey Harold Huber Jonathan Hale and Edward Pawley as a vicious hood named Leggett.It's a beautifullooking picture courtesy of cinematographer Sol Polito. The big shootout between the feds and the gangsters is one of the film's highlights. The scene where Cagney gets a jujitsu lesson is also a real treat. There's an amusing FBI 'crime does not pay' type of prologue that was tacked on for the 1949 rerelease that is present on most prints today. Definitely a mustsee for fans of Cagney and WB gangster movies. If you aren't one of those already you should be.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was fast paced and depicted brutal scenes. Lots of the machine gunning by the FBI against the crooks reminded me of the Bonnie and Clyde movie of the 1960s. I could just see Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway being shot full of holes while in their car.I love Cagney in Yankee Doodle Dandy. In real life Cagney was a Master Tap Dancer which is a very high honor for a tap dancer to achieve. The year GMen was made he played Bottom in Midsummer Night's Dream. He is famous for the grapefruit in the face routine. He was in all those gangster movies playing the bad guy but in GMen he is actually on the good side of the law. This is a nice switch.I was hoping he would throw the guy in the wrestling scene or whatever sport that was but I did not see that happen. He did at least get enough training to go out after the bad guys considering he had spent some time in a law office as a deskpotato lol.Cagney was a very talented and versatile performer and is always inspiring.".

Cagney was such a great actor he would always help elevate others performances in his films and he does so very much in this one. This film is well done for it's time though it looks a little flawed with age now.The story is actually based upon a real FBI case in the early 30's. It stretches the truth after a while in order to fit the task. The gun fight sequence towards the end is amazingly violent yet most of the what seems to be thousands of shots fired seem to miss everything.This is one of many films that established Warner Brothers as Gangster Films Inc during the 30's  40's. It is a strong entry which was well produced for a 1935 early film. It treats it's subject pretty well. If you like Cagney this is a film you must see to understand how far he had already developed his acting skills in 1935.".

Instead of placing Cagney as a public enemy he gets the opportunity working on the side of the law rather than against it. Unlike latter imitations produced in the 1940s or television's popular series THE UNTOUCHABLES 'G' MEN does not detail its story though flashbacks off screen narration not documentary style though quite a novel idea for 1935 but provides an exciting story with scenes suggested on actual occurrences namely the famous Wisconsin lodge massacre car chases kidnappings and giving audiences the run for their money with Cagney along with the G Men violently shooting it out with many Hollywood gangster types.The story introduces James Brick Davis James Cagney as an honest lawyer with no prospects of ever getting clients. He proves his honesty by refusing a bribe from the corrupt Joseph Krantz Edwin Maxwell to defend a guilty client. As for his background the script reveals Brick as a tough street kid guided to the right direction by a father figure named McKay William Harrigan a crime boss who not only gave him a decent upbringing but put him through law school. Because Eddie Buchanan Regis Toomey his college pal now working for the Department of Justice had been gunned down by mobster Brad Collins Barton MacLane  in excellent portrayal during an arrest of notorious gangster Danny Leggett Edward Pawley Brick avenges his friend's death by closing his office and join forces against crime as a G Man for the F.B.I in Washington D.C. While going through the training process along fellow rookie Hugh Farrell Lloyd Nolan in film debut Brick nearly loses his chance with the bureau when Jeff McCord Robert Armstrong his superior who never liked Brick very much receives a report disclosing his association with McKay and other mobsters but through his knowledge and effort to give out their identities Brick shows how much of an asset he could be to the bureau.For his female costars Cagney is supported by capable Warners stock players Margaret Lindsay and Ann Dvorak. Lindsay plays Kay a night nurse by profession. As with her brother Jeff she takes an immediate dislike towards Brick because of his wiseacre personality. Ann Dvorak appears as Jean Morgan singer and dancer at McKay's night club. Although a very close friend of Brick's her association with the underworld thickens with her marriage to the homicidal Brad Collins. Although her part is actually small she's most beneficial to the story highlighted by her noteworthy telephone booth scene.Aside from the usual plot development process leading to an exciting second half of the story GMEN includes musical numbers in a night club with Ann Dvorak vocalizing You Bother Me An Awful Lot by Sammy and Irving Kahl followed by popular tunes of the day originally introduced in other Warner Brothers productions as Al Dubin and Harry Warren's Lullaby of Broadway vocalist unknown instrumental background score of I'm Going Shipping With You from GOLD DIGGERS OF 1935 and instrumental dance number Go Into Your Dance with Ann Dvorak and chorus girlslifted from GO INTO YOUR DANCE 1935.G MEN is one for the time capsule and worth looking back at the use of many outdated technology machinery used in capturing criminals especially the fingerprinting lab process for example indicating how the technology has prospered over the years. In spite of its age G MEN occasionally presented on Turner Classic Movies and available either on video or DVD formats still delivers as great entertainment especially during its second half. While G MEN was generally responsible for starting a cycle of FBI films followed by SPECIAL AGENT 1935 with George Brent BULLETS OR BALLOTS 1936 with Edward G.

Brick is acquainted with the culprit because he'd grown up in a rough New York neighborhood with Collins and some other hooligans before crime boss 'Mac' McKay William Harrigan had taken Brick under his wing and paid for his college education to give him opportunities he'd never had which allows Brick to go straight.Unwilling to become a mouthpiece for other gangsters when Buchanan is murdered Brick signs up with the Dept. of Justice and is assigned to work for Jeff McCord Robert Armstrong a tough taskmaster who refuses to admit that Brick has what it takes to succeed in the bureau and is suspicious of the lawyer's earlier associations.

Harrigan incidentally was not a prolific actor and had last appeared on screen two years prior in The Invisible Man.This is classic Cagney. It may not be anything like what the real FBI was like in the 1930s or 1920s as the case may be. But it has Cagney being his punchy little self this time on the side of the good guys. Apparently Cagney wanted to be a polished gentleman but the studio wanted him to be a mug more like his role in Public Enemy and this was probably wise on the studio's part.Professor Richard Jewell provides commentary on the DVD. He may not be the most eloquent speaker but he is quite informed and knowledgeable in general. He could be more informed about the Kansas City Massacre though.".

Apparently Cagney wanted to be a polished gentleman but the studio wanted him to be a mug more like his role in Public Enemy and this was probably wise on the studio's part.Professor Richard Jewell provides commentary on the DVD. He may not be the most eloquent speaker but he is quite informed and knowledgeable in general. He could be more informed about the Kansas City Massacre though.";

He does just that and learns a great deal plus rubbing his boss Robert Armstrong up the wrong way. Margaret Lindsay plays the mandatory love interest but her and Cagney don't have very good onscreen chemistry in my opinion. Joan Blondell would have been FAR better. The action scenes are absolutely brilliant and are more polished than in previous Warner Bros films. The dialogue is good and the story is tight. Cagney is very good but his acting ability wouldn't be stretched for a few more years. Barton MacLane makes for a great villain. It was funny in the gymnasium scene when Cagney is put through his paces in selfdefence! Robert Armstrong can't stop laughing at this. A great film overall.".

Thus we usually get very good clean and sharp copies of films almost 100 years old. The series is truly amazing and the Asta Nielsen disk is one of the best. The four features on one disk are Livets storme Afrgrunden Den sorte drm and Mod Lyset. I had only seen Asta Nielsen's later films such as Hamlet before therefore I was astounded to see that she was a rather beautiful actress in her youth with a figure of a Barbie doll which she isn't afraid to show. The films are remarkably good as well. In Afgrunden we see Miss Nielsen as a shy piano teacher who abandons her fiance in order to elope with a circus artist who turns her into a harlot and a murderess in Livets storme she is a dancer whose beauty brings along the ruin of her and of men in Den sorte drom she is a circus star who does everything for the man she loves and in Mod Lyset a reckless countess who has to destroy the lives of several men as well as her own before she learns the true values of life. The last tale is a bit moralizing for modern tastes but the first three from 19101911 are true gems. These films are naturalistic strong portraits of life before the WW I. Miss Nielsen is a very good actress indeed as well as a gorgeous clothes horse wearing the trendiest models of the day around her nonexistent waist. The prints are very sharp even though the first film shows some decomposition. They should have been released colour tinted and with somewhat more interesting musical accompaniment than the constantly meditating piano but who cares? These films still were eye openers. When you thought the film wasn't a true art form back in 1910 think again moving camera panning camera closeups parallel editing fluent narrative  it's all there and years before these techniques became accepted in UK US or Italy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Asta Nielsen was an ethereally beautiful silentfilm actress who made only one sound film then went into a long Garbolike retirement. There are some strong parallels between Nielsen and Garbo including some roles they both played notably 'Mata Hari'. It's intriguing that Nielsen and Sarah Bernhardt both played the male title role in 'Hamlet'. Bernhardt played the role as a man when she was too old to play Ophelia whilst Nielsen astonishingly beautiful in male costume played the role as a young woman who had been raised as a male. Most of Nielsen's career was in German films 'Mod Lyset' a German coproduction is one of only four films she made in her native Denmark. Nielsen is less beautiful and more matronly than usual here in some shots she looks distressingly like Carol Channing.SPOILERS AHEAD. I viewed an excellent print of 'Mod Lyset' 'Towards the Light' from the Danish Film Museum. Not to be confused with the betterknown Danish Film Institute. Interestingly the print begins with Nielsen via dissolves in three different costumes hairstyles and makeups as the haughty countess as the same woman in more humble garments and with plenty of backlighting as an angelic saint. In a later reel this print oddly deletes the shot of Countess Ysabel flinging her wedding veil into her fireplace and the closeup of the veil burning I've seen these shots in another print.Nielsen plays the wealthy Countess Ysabel who flaunts her atheism. I found this unlikely in 1919 most upperclass Europeans  especially the peerage  were either sincerely religious or found it politic to affect to be so. She is however respectful of religion in others so she attends a service held by the handsome priest Elias Renato. Afterward Ysabel claims to have been genuinely moved. Father Renato wants to set up a religious colony on a small coastal island. Amazingly for Denmark in 1919 the priest's religious mission is racially integrated I spotted two Negroes and a Chinese man in this film. A ragman named Peter is played by Charles Willumsen an actor who looks astonishingly like Sam Fuller.Ysabel and her mother the dowager countess have no time for religion she is betrothed to Sandro Grec a handsome baron. Here begins a sequence which proves my point about religiosity in 1919 Ysabel observes all the traditional rituals of a wedding bridal gown veil coach to the wedding site yet we never see precisely how nor where the wedding takes place surely it would be held in a church with the marriage consecrated by a priest ... yet this would contradict the countess's atheism. We do see the wedding feast afterward with a vicar presiding.Anyroad Ysabel and the baron are on their way back from wherever they got married when some tophatted cops intervene and haul the baron away in handcuffs. He's an Italian impostor! Does nobody check these things? This is such a shock and scandal it kills Ysabel's mother. Ysabel burns her trousseau and goes off to Father Renato's island mostly to escape public ridicule but also to be with the handsome priest.On two separate occasions characters in this film tell the countess 'What a man sows he shall also reap.' The Danish intertitles clearly use male nouns and pronouns here even though the words clearly refer to Ysabel.A subplot concerns a waif named Wenka who is brutalised by her drunken father in a manner which reminded me of 'Broken Blossoms' ... except that the Danish intertitles are careful to tell us that he's merely her 'stiffader' stepfather. This irrelevant detail feels suspiciously like something inserted to mollify the censors the abuse is somehow more acceptable if he isn't her biological parent. Interestingly Wenka's plight is shown in flashback. Throughout the film director HolgerMadsen uses dissolves and iris shots to strive for arty effects some of these work better than others. During the sequence when the phony baron is courting Ysabel we know he's no good because HolgerMadsen inserts a symbolic shot of a spider trapping a fly. Elsewhere there's one beautiful exterior long shot in a deep focus setup that even Gregg Toland might envy.At the film's climax the buildings of the priest's colony catch fire. This sequence is expertly photographed and excitingly edited but we can clearly see that the burning buildings are actually miniatures. A subplot between two first cousins who are in love goes nowhere. Or is there a scene missing? It's very obvious that Ysabel will find religion and marry the handsome priest then join him in his mission. The film ends unexpectedly with a Nativity tableau. 'Towards the Light' is a wellmade and ambitious film on a subject which frankly didn't interest me and I'll rate it 7 out of 10.".

There are some strong parallels between Nielsen and Garbo including some roles they both played notably 'Mata Hari'. It's intriguing that Nielsen and Sarah Bernhardt both played the male title role in 'Hamlet'. Bernhardt played the role as a man when she was too old to play Ophelia whilst Nielsen astonishingly beautiful in male costume played the role as a young woman who had been raised as a male. Most of Nielsen's career was in German films 'Mod Lyset' a German coproduction is one of only four films she made in her native Denmark.

	schema:headline " Problems with the Evangelical Picture";
	schema:reviewBody "In viewing many silent films I've come across a few religious pictures and many of them seem to have similar problemssome specific to the silent screen. A vast number of films include a religious conversion and other religious elements of course but I'm here referring to films that are in their entirety about the religious usually evangelical experience. William S. Hart's Westerns are a good and somewhat well known example. This film Towards the Light is another such picture but more so.In his films Hart played a bad man who became good only after a religious conversion. Hart's Westerns however were simple and nave and there was never the pretence of them being otherwise. Towards the Light is more similar to a film such as The World and the Woman 1916 which is another pertinent example of the common problems of these type of movies.In Towards the Light Asta Nielsen plays a countess who's a selfish and not coincidently atheist. Initially her attraction towards religion is actually a desire for the preacher although she supposedly gets both in the end. The preacher won't have anything romantic to do with her until she converts either. And aside from the countess who converts after romantic tragedies and her mother lying on her deathbed those without God are apparently suicidal. Thus the film is insulting to nonbelievers.Furthermore it seems to nearly castigate the poor and homeless despite the film being about a preacher who is helping them. Representing the poor and homeless in the picture are the rowdylooking characters and the abusive father. The preacher establishes a work program but it's at the Island of the Homeless. Concentrated there they build their village which eventually burns to the ground. The World and the Woman had a similar problem it bordered on prejudice against the physically disabled.The story of Towards the Light is rubbish and it doesn't reflect well upon the beliefs it's supposedly advocating. I suppose some of the already converted might look upon it kindly but this sort of preaching film or message film is to my mind completely ineffective and often contradictory to its purpose. There are good religious films but this is not one of them.I also find this and another Danish film by HolgerMadsen The Evangelist Preacher Evangeliemandens liv 1915 interesting because they come after a period in Danish cinema of sensational films which were generally lurid and sexual by the standards of the 1910s. Ironically it was a genre Neilsen helped invent. And Denmark has been one of the least religious counties in general. Towards the Light and The Evangelist Preacher are thus reactionary pictures as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Denmark strictly geographically doesn't belong to Scandinavia but only to Northern Europe. However the language the history the culture the mentality of people and so many other things are so similar to Norwegians and Swedes that many of us simply ignore Kattegat and Skagerrak who divide Denmark and Sweden and include the former in Scandinavian group of countries as well as Finland what is also wrong.And as for the movies there hasn't been a great difference which of these countries they came from. Many directors and actors haven't been limited to their own cinematography. Coproductions were and still are usual common way of making movies. And their movies no matter which country was main in production have always been recognizable different from the rest of Europe let alone America. Usually this different was equal to better especially in some genres like dramas particularly social and political ones or family movies. Russian Czech or French authors when inspired could reach them in movies about children but Scandinavian movies always kept high standards.However about a decade ago Danish movies started to change. Their northern neighbors kept their originality style quality courage and still make movies like Ikke naken Misa mi Fre stormen but Danish directors seem to turn their eyes to west across the Atlantic. It looks as if they make movies for American market hoping for a call to follow Lasse Halstrm. Klatretosen was a typical example an adventure being far beyond believable children making successfully things that adults don't even try to do everything so clean to pass American censorship speed of the action being the most important content in making the plot... As if made by authors of Goonies Spy Kids etc. Some other modern Danish movies accept modern American culture and attitudes as their own or show kids who adore American heroes Drommen.Fakiren fra Bilbao goes even further. The place is unrecognizable haunted castle reminds on England though and all the character names are English or at least sound that way except if their nationality is important to the plot. As if this would make the movie even more acceptable to Academy nominating comitee. But weird the movie isn't dubbed the European market got the Danish language version and I wouldn't mind listening to English in such hollywoodised movie I watched some other Scandinavian movies that were typically local  like Ronja Sofia's verden etc  in English or German versions.Usually Scandinavian movies are either very realistic most of them or fairy tales. Fakiren fra Bilbao authors couldn't decide the basic plot is very realistic until a new character magician Lombardo is introduced after some one third of the movie. And this is not a SF premise like the one in Eternal Sunshine partial memory erasing but some magic stuff with explanations too unconvincing ever for preschool kids. But maybe believable to target population  Hollywood products consumers.This movie is not so bad as my comment might seem to be. The camera work is great and the mood that is developed in many scenes can much better than many rich respectable productions for adults achieved. Julie Zangenberg looks and acts similar to Klatretosen what is good but she shouldn't repeat herself for too long. Aksel Leth acts as if he comes from Malcolm in the Middle or some other American sitcom but this wooden acting suits the character. Adult actors especially Ole Thestrup push movie from adventure to comedy what abates flaws in the plot.Conclusion you can watch it your kids can watch it but neither of you will lose anything if you don't. And I can only dream that Dannish movie makers wake up and return to days of KreighJakobsen Larsen Methling and other oldstyle geniuses.l".

Russian Czech or French authors when inspired could reach them in movies about children but Scandinavian movies always kept high standards.However about a decade ago Danish movies started to change. Their northern neighbors kept their originality style quality courage and still make movies like Ikke naken Misa mi Fre stormen but Danish directors seem to turn their eyes to west across the Atlantic. It looks as if they make movies for American market hoping for a call to follow Lasse Halstrm. Klatretosen was a typical example an adventure being far beyond believable children making successfully things that adults don't even try to do everything so clean to pass American censorship speed of the action being the most important content in making the plot... As if made by authors of Goonies Spy Kids etc. Some other modern Danish movies accept modern American culture and attitudes as their own or show kids who adore American heroes Drommen.Fakiren fra Bilbao goes even further. The place is unrecognizable haunted castle reminds on England though and all the character names are English or at least sound that way except if their nationality is important to the plot. As if this would make the movie even more acceptable to Academy nominating comitee. But weird the movie isn't dubbed the European market got the Danish language version and I wouldn't mind listening to English in such hollywoodised movie I watched some other Scandinavian movies that were typically local  like Ronja Sofia's verden etc  in English or German versions.Usually Scandinavian movies are either very realistic most of them or fairy tales. Fakiren fra Bilbao authors couldn't decide the basic plot is very realistic until a new character magician Lombardo is introduced after some one third of the movie. And this is not a SF premise like the one in Eternal Sunshine partial memory erasing but some magic stuff with explanations too unconvincing ever for preschool kids. But maybe believable to target population  Hollywood products consumers.This movie is not so bad as my comment might seem to be. The camera work is great and the mood that is developed in many scenes can much better than many rich respectable productions for adults achieved. Julie Zangenberg looks and acts similar to Klatretosen what is good but she shouldn't repeat herself for too long. Aksel Leth acts as if he comes from Malcolm in the Middle or some other American sitcom but this wooden acting suits the character. Adult actors especially Ole Thestrup push movie from adventure to comedy what abates flaws in the plot.Conclusion you can watch it your kids can watch it but neither of you will lose anything if you don't. And I can only dream that Dannish movie makers wake up and return to days of KreighJakobsen Larsen Methling and other oldstyle geniuses.l";

Boyce Hutton is a former alter boy and intellectual trying to find an occupation that can support and entertain him. His FBI father is able to pull some strings and get his idealist son a job working in the defense department. Boyce has few responsibilities and seems to be complacent drinking and goofing around with his coworkers. However as time goes on Boyce starts to learn top secret information that causes him to doubt the morality of his government. The idealist Boyce soon sees the illegal operations that the CIA is carrying out in above all places Australia. Boyce eventually decides that he will leak some of the top secret info he is privy to to the KGB. Of course Boyce's mistake is the assumption that because the USA is doing bad things the USSR is the good guy. Over time Boyce and his drugdealing buddy Lee Penn start to sell their top secret information to the KGB. What was once idealism turns into capitalism and espionage. The strength of this movie is the incredible performances by Hutton and Penn. Although one of them starts off with the best intentions they will both soon find themselves in an unending downward spiral. Great direction music everything. Not only a great film but one of my alltime favorites.".

His old friend Daulton Lee is a ratty cock drugdealer and gets caught in a setup and must choose between becoming a narc or facing a long stint in prison. When up on bail he jumps and heads to Mexico City. Chris offers Lee in a partnership to be his messenger to sell secret papers to the Soviet Union embassy in Mexico City because of the disgrace he feels about the US Government's control over weaker countries to their own gain. But over time the two begin to clash with their motivations and find themselves in something bigger then they had originally intended.Director John Schlesinger has spun out such films like the respectable Midnight Cowboy Marathon Man Sunday Bloody Sunday and Day of The Locust. While The Falcon and the Snowman might not be held up that high there's no question that this sombre espionage drama inspired by a true incident is an unjustly overlooked character portrait. Everything about it is quite a subdued affair with no real grandeur qualities hitting a massive mark. The driving factor of the film has got to be the admirably versatile lead performances of Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn as the two ambitious young lads Chris and Daulton. Penn is especially good with his uneasy intensity which works well off Hutton's superbly coolandcollected turn. What starts off as easy we watch the situation gradually crumble as the two amateurs find themselves really out of their league. The strongly detailed and symbolic predatory behaviour plot mainly centres on the pair's relationship and that of their reasoning's for their actions which eventually shows us the knotty developments that led to their downfall. The plan opens up like a wound to never properly heal due to Daulton's drug addiction which really makes him go off the rails and leaves Chris to pick up all the slack. The searing political aspect is there but it focus on the themes of idealism Boyce and greed Lee to get its point across. Both don't mix and results show. Suspense is justified through its stimulating potboiling script and character interactions then that of any visual gimmicks. Action is very little but still there's a pressure induced style to Schlesinger's assured and realistically dark 'n' gritty direction. Pacing is mostly well handled although some sequences do seem to wallow on for too long but however it grips you as it plays on its authentically paranoid tone to slowly build up to an exploding tight latter end. Adeptly fleshed into the technical production is an airily harrowing music score and professionally poignant cinematography. The supporting cast are exceptionally fine with Pat Hingle Lori Singer David Suchet Boris Leskin Jerry Hardin and Joyce Van Patten. Also look out for Michael Ironside in a tiny part as a FBI agent.A mostly outstanding spyfilm that benefits largely from talented lead performances and by not playing the usual stakes. It's more an emotional ride then a complex one of twists. Recommended.".

The Falcon is shocked to learn the United States is using the CIA to block the Communist threat and decides to become a traitor to his own country.In too many films today the writer loves one side and hates the other so you get a dishonest film. In this film the writer doesn't portray any of the characters as anything other than humans with their own beliefs goals and foibles.

After quitting TRW Christopher Boyce AKA the Falcon planned to learn Russian and earning a political major and then returning to espionage for the Russians the movie says the opposite. It makes you wonder how far he would have gotten and how many other Christopher Boyce's there were during the cold war. In real life Boyce and his lawyer tried to blame everything on the Andrew Lee the Snowman even saying Lee forced him into it. The Falcon escaped prison for an 18 month period before being recaptured. He was released from prison in 2003. Andrew Lee was paroled in 1998.".

In fact it shows how both young men miscalculate in their attempt to fool the CIA and the Soviet Union. These two in a way were so naive in thinking they could pull something that bigger and better equipped people couldn't even imagine could be done.Chris' motivation is legitimate as he feels outraged in discovering the underhanded role of the agency for which he works in dealing with other nations in this case Australia something he finds by sheer coincidence. When he involves Daulton we know the whole thing is doomed because no one into drugs as he is will ever amount to anything. In fact Chris and Daulton had no conception of the scope of what they are trying to do or its consequences.Timothy Hutton was at this period of his career an actor that was going places. He had proved he had talent with his work in other films so it was a natural choice for Mr. Schlesinger to select him a choice that pays off well. Sean Penn also was a young actor who showed an intensity like one hadn't seen before. In fact at times Mr. Penn reminded us of a young Robert Mitchum in the making. Both actors' contribution to the film is incredible.

	schema:reviewBody "I think some critic somewhere said this film fell short of being a great film but was a very good one. That's accurate you are left wanting to know more. The best performance comes from David Suchet as a sardonic and frequently supercilious Russian. The film commendably avoids trying to make us empaphise with traitors and even manages some humour in all the madness. In one blink or you'll miss it scene Daulton infiltrates an embassy function where he speaks to a foreign diplomat. Is this the usual garb of your countrymen? He asks. Yes it's garbage the man replies.The film appears open minded about whether Boyce is an idealist or an opportunist who fails to realise the significance of his actions. His confession of having received payment from the Soviets and his cynical dismissing of money as 'never being very important to me' suggests a more amoral stance but his other remarks perhaps reveal a more complex and sincere character. Boyce seems to be suggesting that any leap forward in technology must also go hand in hand with an equal quantitative one in morality. But I think it was Einstien who said that the bomb has changed everything except the way man thinks. This suggests that Boyce's weary indifference while being interviewed was due to his realisation that this moral leap was beyond man and therefore there was no hope we are doomed to extinction. All political and religious life had been rendered meaningless to him due to the impermanence of man in the face of supertechnology. This may account for his reluctance to recite the 'valley of death' speech to his father as he knew full well that it's message was also meaningless in the context of modern warfare. Noone not even the generals would be left standing. Boyce then was possibly suffering a certain existential despair as he stated America was the first country to use nuclear weapons. His concern that his betrayal meant little because we are already in jeopardy is even more pertinent today with more and more countries either acquiring or seeking to acquire nuclear technology. It's rather like a group of toddlers playing with a grenade passing it around. Say you were to add more grenades would you then  increase the likelihood of an accident such as the pulling out of a pin?This rare political film asks a more broad and philosophical question perhaps. If Boyce says he knows something about predatory behaviour and the film is full of big fish eating little fish motifs and left the church because he has decided that man is not divine and just another animal where does that leave man if he cannot ultimately change his nature? The film does not leave you with an answer merely the fear on the faces of uncomprehending parents and the unseen spectre of a mushroom cloud.".

	schema:reviewBody "Set in the years of the NixonFord administration The Falcon And The Snowman is the story of a young man who wildly went off the track in his idealism and winds up a traitor. The idealist is the falcon part of the title and the young man who works for the Central Intelligence Agency and discovers that were doing some dirty tricks in the countries that are supposed to be allies is played by Timothy Hutton.Hutton is as shocked as Claude Rains was to discover that gambling was going on at Rick's. After all it was father Pat Hingle who got him the job at CIA through his connections with the FBI. That he had no inkling that anything like this was going on is a bit much. But Hutton is actually shown the proper path. Do a Daniel Ellsberg and get it to the media. Instead he turns traitor and decides to sell secrets to the Soviet Union.But this genius decides to go into partnership with an old childhood friend who's become a drug dealer to support his high living lifestyle no pun intended. That's the snowman of the title and when he's on the screen Sean Penn dominates the film. Hutton needs someone who knows the criminal ways tutoring in those ways and subterfuge if needed. Of course Penn knows that but anyone with a brain has to realize that Penn's cocaine habit would sink them. The ironic thing is that this is a true story otherwise no one would believe it. And then Hutton goes through another Rains like moment when he discovers the Russians can be as dirty as us dirtier. The second best performance in the film is the BBC's Hercule Poirot David Suchet. In playing Poirot for the BBC series Suchet has reached the culmination of a career like J. Carrol Naish back in the days of the studio system playing an incredible variety of ethnic types. He even more reminds of another man who did the same Herbert Lom. Had this been made 20 years earlier I could have seen Lom very easily in the role of the exasperated Russian agent who is really losing his patience dealing with fools.The Falcon And The Snowman boasts some really good performances but in the end the general unlikeability of the leads makes you really want to hit these two upside the head with two by four.".

Ironically this is a true story. Of course since this is a movie some things were probably changed for the dramatic purposes  yet the main core of the story is true.The main problem is with the unlikable heroes. I'm sorry  but Hutton's decision seems to be made from stupidity. Was he really that naive ? Didn't he understood that politics is a dirty game where everyone is spying and manipulating the others ? Never was and never will be fair game ? That not only USA  but other countries aren't saints in any way ? That he was betraying his own country ? If he wanted to make change he should go to press. His intentions maybe were good  but in the end he only endangered his own country. And asking for help someone as irresponsible as a drug addict He should know that this would end really bad.The movie sticks to the vision of Hutton's character being a really idealistic crusader and Penn being an sympathetic moron. I did care about them when things started to go really bad for them  the paranoia attacks  the fear  the sense of hopeless  the danger of losing your life. Schlesinger does show a great directing skills from time to time. The scene where gun appears on the table and the doors are locked  searching for the bugs inside the bird  the brutal interrogation in Mexico  the sad end for both of our heroes. There are also some funny scenes here  mostly involving Penn's character . The scene when he proposes a drug deal to Russians really tells you how fed up he is.The music by Pat Metheny is good  even if it's mostly one and the same theme appearing through the whole movie. The song This is not America by David Bowie and Pat Metheny is great and was quite a hit back in the 80's.Sean Penn is great as the drug addict . He really acts like drugs are the only thing he thinks about. His whiny voice  loose attitude and big mouth make him a memorable character. The Oscar nominee would do him justice. He dominates the screen.Timothy Hutton is great too  giving a depth to his character. He's lost  noble and honest character who lost his way. When he tells near the end of the movie why he did it I really believed him. Disliked him but still believed him. He was able to make an clich character real.There is a solid support by veteran actor Pat Hingle Batman as Hutton's father  Lori Singer Footloose as Hutton's girlfriend and especially from David Suchet TV series Poirot as the Russian spy.The Falcon and snowman is long 2 hours  yet never boring movie . It's an interesting document about real life story with some nice moments in it. It's not a great movie by any way  because it's too shallow and one sided drama  yet it's entertaining enough to give it a chance. I give it 610.".

	schema:headline " An brilliant overlooked film from the 1980s";
	schema:reviewBody "THE FALCON AND THE SNOWMAN is a superb example of an anti80s film. While many other films of the decade in general lacked substance this film is pure substance. There's nothing stylish or fake or superfluous about it. It boasts two superb performances Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn as lifelong friends Christopher Boyce and Daulton Lee respectively. Hutton Penn and Tom Cruise were a triumvirate of early 80s actors who all looked headed to much bigger and better things all 3 starred in TAPS. While Penn and Cruise's popularity soared Hutton has been largely forgotten about and that's a shame. Actually Hutton is the first of the 3 to win an Oscar for supporting role in ORDINARY PEOPLE in 1980 but I think his performance in this movie is even more outstanding.Hutton really captures the postVietnam war rebelliousness in his character Chris Boyce. A failed seminary school student Chris has a lovehate relationship with his father well played by the great character actor Pat Hingle. The scene where Chris quotes the poem his father thought he'd long forgotten is a particularly powerful one.Chris gets job at Dept. of Defense and uses his hatred of U.S. gov't and its foreign policy to sell seemingly useless plans of old projects to the Soviets. He gets his buddy Daulton a hyper drugdealing selfserver in on it to be the courier of the project plans on microfilm. While Chris is doing it based on his beliefs Daulton is doing it strictly for the money. The Soviet liaison is excellently played by David Suchet. Penn and Suchet have a real quirky chemistry and it's a kind of funny set of exchanges between them. But make no mistake this film is anything but that. It is a serious character study about pessimism malaise paranoia and mistrust.Again the leads make this film. Hutton delivers a brilliantly understated performance as Chris a rather smart young man who had so much potential. Penn as usual does a tremendous characterization as Daulton a pathetic loser who acts before he thinks and most of the time doesn't think at all. The ending of this factbased film is very saddening on several levels. A truly powerful character study.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the true story about Christopher Boyce Hutton and Daulton Lee Penn and their involvement in selling American secret Government documents to the Soviets during the 1970s. Boyce works for the Government and his job is to guard these particular documents which ultimately disillusions him about his Country's affairs and practices. He then enlists his drugdealer friend Daulton Lee who has become a wanted man to be the courier for these sensitive documents. Lee infiltrates the Russian Embassy in Mexico and makes contact with Alex Suchet and they both begin to play the espionage game.Lee's interest is purely about money whilst Boyce is acting out of anger towards the system he is involved in. Alex believes Lee to be the inside man in the American government. Things start to become array when Lee's drug addiction and reckless behaviour in handling the courier position offsets both Alex and Boyce. Lee becomes more paranoid and the initial espionage game becomes more deadly and consequential for everyone involved.This is a true spy thriller without the cheesy action. The character motives and analysis of reallife subjects is sympathetic but very well written and the film cleverly interweaves the reallife events with underlying political themes about human predatory behaviour. Where a bigger nation uses their political power to control the smaller nations. Well directed and intense in parts especially where the protagonists become immensely in over their heads in the spy game. Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn give amazingly riveting performances in a film that questions authority and yet there is no simple answer to the political message or the complexity of that system. The plight of the protagonists becomes the underlying message within 'The Falcon and the Snowman' and makes it a clever political thriller with a poignant element about society human relationships and the American system. Great film!12 out of !".

Sean Penn plays his drugdealing pal Daulton Lee who makes himself Boyce's courier delivering secret files to the Soviet embassy in Mexico City. An offbeat synthjazz score lack of sympathy or emotional attachment for anyone and lots of scenes of guys getting angry in rooms all combine to deaden what could have a decent moraldilemma thriller.It's really Penn's movie despite the second billing his character gets to talk turkey with the Russians while Hutton plays with his pet falcon. Hutton looks like they woke him up five minutes before they called action. With Penn it's a crapshoot whether you get a brilliant performance or an overthetop one. Here it's a bit of both but more the latter especially in the second half when Lee switches from coke to heroin. He screeches. He snorts. He crashes Russian embassy parties. He gets pummeled with telephone books. He spits at himself in a mirror a big goober he must have been saving for a paparazzi. I don't know who my friends are anymore! he cries out. It's exhausting to just watch him.Penn seems to have modeled Lee somewhat on Dustin Hoffman's Ratso Rizzo from Midnight Cowboy complete with overly nasal line readings and constant eye shifting. John Schlesinger directed this film as well as Midnight Cowboy but he seems to have had another Hoffman film in mind The Graduate throwing up scene after scene of Boyce and Lee poolside trying to decide how to live their lives in their gilded cage. Too bad no one suggested plastics.From the opening shots news footage of American decline juxtaposed with Boyce and his bird Falcon makes clear it is a message movie though the message itself is far from clear probably because the characters never come into focus. Is Boyce supposed to be an idealist? Or is he just a mercenary? Hutton and Schlesinger don't seem to know which makes it harder for us. Meanwhile opportunities to establish some suspense like Boyce stealing documents from the top secret Black Vault where he works or Lee playing games with the Russians are interrupted by jump cuts to scenes of the pair with their families and friends. It's the normalcy of the story that Schlesinger finds interesting but it's the least interesting aspect for us.Good stuff It's interesting to see a film that works the 1970s vibe so early as this one referencing Maria Muldaur and Tang. Dorian Harewood memorable in Full Metal Jacket has a nice turn as Boyce's paranoid colleague Gene who shows Boyce how to make margaritas with a shredder but has some serious 'Nam issues beneath his partying exterior. Macon McCalman is also fine in a totally different way as the nononsense boss who gives Boyce his highsecurity job. David Suchet as the Russian embassy official who deals with Lee makes for a fascinating blend of menace and amiability.But Falcon And The Snowman stands or falls on the the question of the two title characters and neither the actors nor Schlesinger are able to mine much in the way of answers. Worse after more than two hours in their alternately feral and catatonic company you don't really want answers. You just want those credits to roll.".

Hollywood probably would have made a sympathetic movie about Julius and Ethel Rosenberg is they thought they could make a buck. Seems like most of their antiAmerican movies were made when Ronald Reagan was in the White House. Guess they considered him a turncoat for not being socialistcommunist like them. Sorry to seem so angry but when antiAmerican movies like Avitar ripoff of John Carter are considered great make me think that there is little hope for the greatest country ever. If your into the antiAmerican and conspiracy stuff you will probably like this movie.

Quickly found guilty the oligarch was sentenced to nine years in prison later extended to twelve. From prison Khodorkovsky has waged a campaign in Western media to raise awareness of the injustice of his incarceration and the corruption of the Russian political system that permitted such a turn of events.Cyril Tuschi's 'Khodorkovsky' is partbiopic partcriminal investigation seeking to uncover against substantial odds both who the real Khodorkovsky was and whether his wellpublicised trial was political posturing on the behest of Putin or an accurate reflection of the murky dealings of the Russian oil industry  an industry borne out of the questionable auctions of the Yeltsin government in the 1990s. Khodorkovsky in a manner similar to his fellow oligarchs acquired Yukos in 1995 at one such state auction paying well below the market value. Soon acquiring a reputation for being a perennial corporate governance abuser Yukos and its billionaire owner underwent a volte face at the turn of the millennium. As it's transparency began to encourage immediate investment. the share price saw a swift upward turn. Simultaneously on the advice of an American PR firm Khodorkovsky launched Open Russia' investing 100 million in Russian education projects. By 2002 Khodorkovsky was both the world's richest man under 40 and the symbol for sound civic governance in a Russia still blighted by corruption and inequality.Though rich and powerful enough to brush shoulders with the oil magnates of the world Khodorkovsky's mistake was to take that attitude that perceived arrogance and impose it upon a Russian political elite not yet ready to accept their subservience to the new business elite. Specifically Khodorkovsky butted heads with Putin ignoring the President's plea for the select group of oil oligarchs to stay out of state politics entirely associating himself closely with the opposition to Putin's ironfisted rule Khodorkovsky emerged as a powerful motor to the campaign offering a increasingly popular alternative. His days were numbered.Though no saint himself Khodorkovsky's arrest and incarceration emerge as a representation of everything still wrong with Russian politics. The cronyism expected of the Russian oligarchs in return for ease of operation betray the long road left to transparency for which Putin remains a sturdy barrier. For as long as he remains behind bars and Putin remains in power Khodorkovsky may question his decision to return to Russia many others sought exile around the same time but there is hope that he will use the experience to justify a run for office once released.

	schema:headline " awful film with an awful myopic message";
	schema:reviewBody "This piece of Michael Mooreesque propaganda with the same kind of whiny sentimental voiceover is an absolute load of nonsense.Most Russians know Khodorkovsky as a crook a bandit and a criminal who made billions from stealing natural resources from the country during the chaos and lawlessness of the 80s and 90s in Russia. Cyril Tuschi's attempts to portray him as a martyr for freedom and democracy in Russia is disgusting. The nods towards a more balanced account are distinctly feeble quoting Khodorkovsky talking about breaking 'ethical standards from today's point of view' no st the former Yukos lawyer talking about Khodorkovsky helping create the very system that condemned him relating his possible connection to the killing of the mayor quickly dismissed by the next interviewee 'I hope. I am almost certain that he wasn't involved in this. I have serious doubts about some other Russian oligarchs'. Why does he hope and what makes him almost certain? What's his evidence that one of the most successful oligarchs wasn't while many others were? The film never interrogates this point. Khodorkovsky paid just 309 million for Yukos  in an auction held by his own bank  by 2003 it was worth 45 billion. This was hardly down to Khodorkovsky's management genius. No one got that far in that period in Russia and in so short a space of time without doing the worst possible things to get there. If practically everyone was doing it how did one of those who was most successful in that era stay largely clear? Just so you are under no illusions as to Tuschi's agendaviewpoint in this film I'll give you a few quotes from an interview that he did with Spiegel Online. In it Tuschi asserts that 'I am an artist not a judge' who is merely 'presenting an interesting film about a unique person' but in response to the very next question says that 'he has an almost transcendental supernatural aura. It is the aura of a martyr'. This film is clearly the portrayal of a hero albeit a flawed one as the best heroes are!  just look at the moment when Tuschi finally meets Khodorkovsky and shakes his hand in awe and the suggestion earlier in the film that Khodorkovsky's earliest thinking and his core was and is influenced by the populist ideals of 'Pavel Korchagin' fighting for the good of the people 'for the people's liberation'. To compare Khodorkovsky to the fictional Korchagin as Tuschi is clearly doing is a laughable disgrace. Khodorkovsky cares nothing for the wellbeing of the Russian people. Until he had political ambitions again for personal gain for which he was imprisoned and his assets seized when did he give two cents about the Russian people or democracy? All of those years of raking in money at the people's expense. He was a crook amongst crooks who lost out in the power struggle nothing more. The attempts by people like Tuschi or The Guardian in the UK to turn him into a martyr in Russia's struggle for freedom is pathetic. The film is too busy fawning over Khodorkovsky to provide any insight at all into the nuance and detail and context of what is going on. Tuschi came and went with the same lazy preconceptions about Khodorkovsky and his role in Russian society and he expects us to do the same. He seems to blindly accept what his interview subjects say subjects who are almost exclusively former and current associates of Khodorkovsky. He also employs Michael Moore's patented technique of bursting in on officials unannounced demanding they answer difficult questions on the spot then instantly interpreting their refusal as them evading him because they have something to hide.Here are a few particularly egregious snapshots of how idiotic this film getsin a weird and creepy black and white animation he has Khodorkovsky swimming across a swimming pool of gold coins towards a sign that says 'Open Russia'.in an interview Leonid Nevzlin a multimillionaire if not billionaire former Yukos executive in exile who poor guy complains of all the sunshine in Israel has the cheek to say 'We need some money. We need compensation. Not because we don't have money fortunately we saved some money but because they stole a lot of money our part of Yukos oil company. So why we should forgive them for this? They should pay.' The film makes no mention of the irony of this. The Russian government's seizing of assets is repeatedly commented on and yet no mention is made of how and in what context the Yukos managers made their money in the first place.the melancholic footage and voiceover of the now largely empty 'Yukos Compound' with its massive walls and mansions. 'Five of seven manager's houses are empty. Otherwise only the employees remain who keep the park and pool in order heating the empty houses and sweeping a garage for 50 vehicles that now stands empty too'. Need I add anything to his own words? Is Tuschi listening to what he's saying here? What exactly is he mourning for god's sake? Yukos' former lawyer complaining about the state 'tricking the oligarchsthe oligarchs  they got no rights.' Lets all weep for the injustices suffered by the poor billionaires when the Russian government reasserted its authority after they had made so much money by opportunistically grabbing at a cutprice any industries that were lying around after the collapse of the Soviet Union. You know who had no rights? The ordinary people who were left with a disintegrating state plundered by bandits whose savings and pensions were repeatedly wiped out who lived in abject poverty and chaos while people from the Yukos cartel amongst several others drove by them in their black Mercedes with tinted windows and appropriated police sirens.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the movie the writerproducer fails to point out that the sale of YUKOS OIL's assets and other assets sold to the oligarchs was a move by Yeltsin to protect the Russian economy from being owned by business outside Russia. If the assets placed in the auction had been offered for their true value only large corporations outside of Russia would have been able to afford them. In order to have them owned by Russian businesses they were offered for rock bottom prices. Only a few business people in Russia had the assets to acquire businesses such as Yukos. Whether it was stealing from the Russian people is a moral question that is difficult to answer since the practical reason for the sales was so complex. Prior to the sale the government owned all the assets so did the government steal from the people by controlling all the assets? Did the government provide its citizens the benefits of those resources or did government officials plunder the assets too. According to continuing reports from analysts who study Russian politics Putin has amassed a fortune estimated at 60 billion during his terms in office. Did he acquire those assets through corruption or legitimate means? At least when business people own assets the people they employ benefit by receiving a salary. In the U.S. the discrepancy between what CEOs earn and what the average worker earns represents a gap of about 475. Some people in the U.S. view CEOs as stealing from the shareholders. If the documentary had presented some of these facts so viewers could see that this is not a black and white issue the movie would have provided a more substantive explanation of what happened during the 90s and how Russia and Khordorkvsky changed  from a country that had begun to move toward democracy to one with an ironfisted leader who appears to be as corrupt as most Russians view Khordorkvsky. As a documentarian myself I know it is difficult to present this complex subject in a brief and interesting film. I do think the writerproducer tried because the movie talks about Khordorkvsky's taking advantage of the system which at the time was totally legal when he bought Yukos to the Khordorkvsky who was supporting the opposition movement. Whether he was doing it for political gain wanting to be president I doubt. Recent events show that was not the case. His public statement that the president needed to do something about corruption viewed as the catalyst for his arrest indicates that he was attempting to present his newfound capitalistic business approach as a better way for Russian to operate  to attract foreign investment. Whether it was arrogant of him to speak publicly to the president is an open question but in the U.S. people challenge the president constantly to fix what's wrong with the country. One has to decide  was Khordorkvsky being arrogant or was he operating under the assumption that government can affect changes in problems facing the country as is expected in a democratic country?".

We watch lowly valet Diello Mason use nothing but wits and guts to outmaneuver both the British and the Germans. He's not a sympathetic lead character always unusual for a Hollywood production TCF. But you can't help admiring his ability to outwit the professionals even if he is completely selfcentered. I get the feeling Diello sees himself as a natural born aristocrat denied that position by the fortunes of birth. So by golly he's going to use those talents to get the wealth and position he deserves but which European society has denied him.Mason is simply superb in a tailormade part. He projects both the icy intelligence and curt politeness that the role requires. I sweated a bucket load when the cleaning lady rummages around the closet while Diello photographs embassy secrets. If she finds the power switch he's toast. Great scene. Note too how there're no obvious good guysbad guys also unusual for a WWII drama. The British are slightly favored but at least the Germans aren't caricatured. It's more like one opportunist Diello is exploiting both sides impartially and they're both after him.Then too what guy wouldn't lose his head over the delectable Darrieux even a guy as calculating as Diello. All of which makes the ending one of the most ironically satisfying in movie annals. I'm betting this was one of the best films to come out of that spare movie year of 1952.

	schema:reviewBody "This forgotten film brilliantly directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz is one of the best spy films we have seen in recent memory. The film holds the viewer in suspense up the last frame. Mr. Mankiewicz was working on the fine screen play written by Michael Wilson based on a real incident told by L. C. Moyzisch a German officer who is a key player in the story.The film opens in Ankara Turkey's capital during WWII. The place is swarming with spies and intrigues. We are taken to a reception where we encounter Countess Anna a beautiful woman of uncertain age who is living below her means in the country. Anna asks for monetary help to a German officer who she has met before. At this point we meet Diello a valet to the English ambassador to Turkey. Diello has a proposal for Moyzisch a German connected to the embassy. He proposes a deal where he will cooperate in spying for the Germans in exchange of heavy amounts of money.Since Diello needs a front Countess Anna becomes the a desirable object for this man's plans in how to conduct the business. Thus the impoverished countess agrees to the plan. Countess Anna becomes a hostess who gathers in her new elegant surroundings the cream of the diplomatic society. The countess goes along with the scheme but at the same time she deeply resents the idea of having Diello a man that is not from her circle and background be treated as her equal.The film works because what we see is what really happened. This being a real story is not something that came out of some writer's imagination. On the contrary we are completely astounded in the way this Diello was able to fool his superiors at the embassy. We watch as Diello goes about the business of spying right at the ambassador's office without being caught.There are two ironic twists to the story that come as complete surprises to us. In a way because one is not expecting the first one is the betrayal to Diello by the heartless countess and the second one is at the conclusion of the film. This last one is something that keeps us laughing along with Diello and in turn to the woman who double crossed him.James Mason is excellent as Diello. Mr. Mason was an actor that always delivered. In his English films as well as some of his Hollywood movies this actor projected such a powerful figure. His method of working always amazes because his performances always build up to unexpected results. The film belongs to Mr. Mason who is terrific and charismatic.Danielle Darrieux one of the best French film actresses of all times makes a delightful appearance as Countess Anna. She transforms herself from a the woman trying to eke out a living to the sophisticated lady of a society she felt comfortable with because she was born into it.The supporting roles are quite good. The surprise was Herbert Berghof one of the most famous acting teachers of all times making a rare appearance.5 Fingers has a great black and white cinematography by Norman Brodine who captures some of those Turkish locales in all their splendor. The film score by Bernard Herrmann adds another dimension to the film. Thanks to Mr. Mankiewicz this is a film that will please his admirers.".

Michael Rennie is brought in to see if he can discover the source of the leak.Joseph Mankiewicz directed the film and it's done in partial documentary style with narration. It's based on a true story though the Darrieux character was invented for the film.This is a highly entertaining film with some wonderful suspenseful moments a neat twist at the end and the highly atmospheric Turkish scenery.

You root for this spy to double cross everybody all the way even though it might mean the allies losing WWII etc. And the ending is wonderfully ambiguous and evily hilarious with Mason laughing his head off and not caring that he's personally in a very tight spot but thoroughly amused that the Contessa who tried to doublecross him had 'gotten hers.'

His role as Diello in 5 Fingers the Albanian spy for profit is apparently what Hitchcock saw before casting his film.The setting of this is Ankara capital of neutral Turkey in World War II. Mason is the valet of the British ambassador there and an Albanian national. He's hit upon a scheme to enrich himself with a little espionage. Mason hits the jackpot with the secret plans for Overlord the location and operation of the Allied invasion of Europe. He pulls off the caper of all time but things go quite awry after that. Former employer Countess Danielle Darrieux does him wrong in a very big way. Michael Rennie is fine as the intrepid British counter intelligence agent and the other outstanding performance is John Weingraf as Franz Von Papen the German Ambassador to Turkey at the time. He wasn't called the Fox for nothing.If you enjoyed James Mason in that Hitchcock classic you will not want to miss 5 Fingers.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER WARNING SPOILER WARNING...when the countess doublecrossed James Mason? She would spy on the Germans she would help Mason's valet character Diello spy on the British. Like Diello said money was like electric light to her. She gave no thought to the source until it was shut off. And in their last conversation it was obvious to her that Diello considered the money he made from spying to be his money not theirs. Diello's big mistake during all of this is an underlying belief that there is any honor among thieves and not realizing this is not a business venture as far as any of the parties are concerned.The film is about a valet at the British embassy in neutral Turkey using the lack of any strong security measures at that embassy to steal Allied secrets and sell them to the Germans amassing a large fortune in just a couple of months. It is true he wants a life of leisure in a peaceful place but he is also in love with the now impoverished Countess Anna Staviska. And he knows she has a mercenary soul and though she might have been attracted to him when he was her late husband's valet she would never give herself to any man unless he had wealth.Postwar thrillers about WWII were usually much better than anything made during the war because they could be honest about the mercenary people who had no patriotism. Such people always exist. However I did note that the movie made a point of Diello saying that he was actually born in Albania not England. This was supposedly based on a true story so I do not know if that was the truth or just added to keep the British from looking bad.Mason and the countess get the best lines of the film but the Germans get a bunch too as they are shown  at least at the embassy  thinking more for themselves than you would give them credit.This is full of twists and turns and do watch this to the very end because the final irony is enough even to find Diello's funny bone.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the period between 1918  1939 most of the countries in Eastern Europe were notable for the strongman dictatorships that had arisen out of the ashes of the First World War. Except for Czechoslovakia and the doomed Baltic trio of states and Finland and Austria for awhile Poland Hungary Italy and the Balkan states all became dictatorships. One might on the surface have added the former Ottoman Empire now Turkey. Certainly Turkey had some black marks against it the Armenian massacres in the World War and the brutal massacre of Greeks at Smyrna in 1922. But aside from those Turkey surprised everyone. It's strongman leader Mustapha Kemal a.k.a. Kemal Attaturk was determined to make Turkey a strong western country. To this day the military from which Kemal came out of has remained proWestern and been pushing despite difficulties with Armenia Greece the Kurds and Muslim fundamentalists to keep modernizing Turkey. His Kemal's was the only positive spin on a dictatorship from Eastern Europe in that period. Kemal was lucky that he had a keen lieutenant and successor named Ismet Inonu. Ismet was as determined to continue Kemal's goals after his friend's death in 1938. One goal that both of them had discussed and agreed upon was that Turkey was not going to be pulled into any further nonsense that it could not afford to get involved in. This meant that if there was any major war hitting Europe again and both Kemal and Ismet fully knew one was on the way after 1933 Turkey was going to be neutral. This was on the surface surprising and disappointing to the Axis when war came in 1939  1940. Hitler figured that as Turkey had been allied to Germany in World War I it would be allied again in World War II. Actually Kemal and Ismet were less than enchanted by such an idea. Kemal made his reputation as a great military hero by his leadership against the British at Gallipoli. While the German commander Liman Von Sanders took kudos for much of the triumph there Kemal fumed at this  he knew that Von Sanders made several severe blunders that cost Turkish lives and that he looked at the Turks as cannon fodder. Kemal was determined that no Turk would die for Germany again. Ismet swore the same thing.It is for this reason that Turkey is neutral from 1939 to 1945 as De Velera's Eire was also neutral. This meant that the embassies of all the major powers were active in Ankara during the war and that much spy activity was going on there as a result. Hollywood did take notice of it twice as far as I can recall  in 1943 when Warner Brothers made a film of Eric Ambler's 1940 novel BACKGROUND TO DANGER about a German plot to force Turkey into the war as an Axis ally Sidney Greenstreet as the Nazi agent against George Raft as the American one and the 1942 film JOURNEY INTO FEAR where German agents are after an American engineer Joseph Cotton who has been arming Turkish ships. That too was from an Eric Ambler novel.With this as the background you can suddenly understand the story of Operation Cicero. Ulysses Diello James Mason in the film his real name was Bazna is personal valet to the British Ambassador to Turkey Walter Hampden. But he is gifted spy and has proof of it which he takes to the German embassy's espionage chief Moyzisch Oskar Karlweis. Actually the information by itself would not unduly impress Moyzisch it could be a plant for all that but Diello opens the embassy safe while Moyzisch is out of the room. He knows that in Germany since 1933 Hitler's birthday or his date of coming to power are the universal combinations favored in government organizations for their safes.The pieces of information that Cicero the code name for Mason checks out  although there is always a lingering sense of doubt by Moyzisch's higher ups in German intelligence. They continue paying Mason in British pounds he may give them the information but Mason has little faith the Germans are going to win the war. In the meantime the leak has been noticed by British intelligence which sends Michael Rennie to investigate. Soon he begins to concentrate on Mason. Mason feels he still can carry on his espionage business. However Mason has started romancing a Countess Danielle Darrieux whom he once knew as a servant. She may be playing him for a sucker  but even if she is he is determined to carry off the greatest espionage coup of all time. He is aware of some large scale Allied invasion being planned  and a copy of the plans is at the British embassy.The film shows what actually happened. He did get the information regarding Operation Overlord and sold it to the Germans. And their subsequent use of this masterstroke demonstrated again how smart Cicero was in judging German intelligence. It is an exciting spy thriller and on the whole factual. Mason Rennie Darrieux Hampden give pretty good accounts for themselves in this film and Joseph Mankiewicz' script and direction are excellent. A highly worthy film to be seen.".

An added attraction is that it is based on the true story of Albanian Elyesa Bazna code name Cicero who served as valet to the British Ambassadaor in Turkey Sir Hughe Montgomery KnatchbullHugessen if you must know and funneled secret allied documents to the Germans.It's based on the book Operation Cicero by L.C.Moyzisch who was Cicero's German contact. Mason in a superb performance plays Cicero and Danielle Darriex plays Countess Staviska Cicero's treacherous partner. Mason does a wonderful job of making us almost root for the suavely brash spy. Veteran character actor John Wengraf does a great job as Count von Papen and Michael Rennie is Colin Travers the British security agent who is sent in to uncover Cicero. Fine writing and acting all around with a great director Joseph Mankiewicz and the distinctive sounds of Bernard Herrmann's score. There is a wonderful plot twist at the end that is well worth waiting for. Don't miss this underrated gem.".

The rest of the cast are workmanlike rather than outstanding but this merely moves the story along without irrelevant distractions. It is exceptionally slickly told and very exciting.Thirdly the underlying theme is remarkably subtle and multifacetted in its ambiguities. It is not surprising that the scriptwriter was blacklisted his political sympathies are detectable. Like High Noon from the same year it is anything but simple and straightforward in its utterly fascinating and intriguing subtext.The whole point of the liaison between Mason and his prewar employer is that it is motivated by a classridden hatred and desire for revenge on Mason's part resulting in a bitter sense of humiliation experienced by Darrieux. There is no love of any kind lost between them in spite of their mutually fake and passionless kisses. Both characters are completely amoral but Mason is partly redeemed by his scintillating wit and sense of humour. Knowing the length and thickness of the rope is of little use to the man about to be hanged. Marvellous line.Sometimes the reviews of others make me weep. Mason is Albanian not British and Michael Rennie is British not American. Granted his accent is a little odd. Ten stars.".

Also fascinating is the way he shirks off responsibility for his actions at one point one Nazi questions why Mason is helping them to win the war to which he without hesitation comments I can't sell you the ability to make proper use of the documents he really genuinely believes his actions are neutral. Mason's performance only intensifies after an unexpected betrayal in the second half and the final scene makes for a very memorable finish. Also of interest are scattered scenes in which the Nazis question the validity of Mason's information his desire for a better life is touching but at the same time he always seems like he has something to hide.

With all this going on the Germans need all the help that they can get and they get it in the form of the valet to the Briitish ambassador to Turkey an ambitious civil servant in His Majesty's service Ulyesses Diello James Mason. Diello has had it with his life that was going nowhere and wanted to make it big and then check out to South America in Rio De Janeiro and live like a king but the only way he can pull that off is by spying for the Germans and getting his hands on top secret information. Diello plans to get this secret information from his boss the British ambassador Sir Frederic Walter Hampden when he was outside of his office which seems like all the time attending as well as entertaining parties and state dinners.Getting in touch with the attach of the German ambassador to Turkey Count Von Papan John Wengraf a guy named L.C Moyzisch played by Oskar Karlweis Diello later given the code name by Ambassador Von Papan Cicero. Diallo Impresses the German diplomat so much that Van Papan get's in touch with Berlin so he can get the go ahead to do business with him but at a price 20000 in British Pound Sterling. Deillo's plan at first works flawlessly with him getting his hands on every piece of information that always top secret that's sent to the British ambassador. Photographing the documents and after getting paid by the German government Diello then sends it on to his contactMoyzisch in the German embassy.Despite his ability to be secretive Deillo foolishly gets involved with the stateless and almost destitute the Germans confiscated all her property money and holdings back in Poland Polish Countess Anna Staviska Danielle Darrieux. Deillo had the hots for Anna since he met her back in London before the war as her late husbands valet. Being a bit too trustworthy in a business spyingwhere trust is a dirty word Diello lets his both pants and guard down and gets it where it hurts him the most both in his wallet and bank account. Diello gets zinged not only by scheming and doublecrossing Countess Staviska but the German Government as wellin the end which will like it did Diello completely blow you away.Tense filled and exciting movie about spying that has going for it the fact that it was based on a true story where more then anything else we see just how true the saying Truth is stranger then fiction really is. Diello has nerves of steel in his nervewrecking attempts to get a hold of British Military secrets that if caught can have him take a long walk and short drop at the end of a rope. Manipulating both sides the German  British in keeping him alive and free in order to find out whom his contacts are and how much he actually received and sold to both warring parties the British and Germans has Deillo playing for high stakes in both money as well as his life.Even though Diello screwed a lot of people in the movie he got the royal screwing in the end with his lover the twotiming Countess Staviska checking out on him and going to neutral Switzerland with all his cash 130000 Pound Sterling just when he was about to check out together with her to South America. Diello gets in touch with his contact Moyzisch whom he'd since discarded for one last deal in getting him and his German boss' for a cool 100000 Pound Sterling the plan to invade Europe by the allies Operation Overlord and open up a second front against Germany later that spring.By sticking his neck out in getting the information from the British ambassador's office safe that was rigged with an alarm Diello blew his cover and was now a marked man by both his former employer the British Government as well as his collaborators The Germans. The two were tricked by the sneaky Countess Staviska into thinking that Diello was working either for the British or Germans as a doubleagent giving both sides bogus information. This miscalculation on the Germans part had them throw away the actual plan by the British and US to invade France in June 1944 which if they believed and acted on it the Germans may well have prevented the allies from invading and conquering Western Europe. At the same time with a second front no longer a reality The Germans would have been able to defeat the Red Army and thus win the second World War.One of the best spy films ever made not only because of the superior acting especially by James Mason as DielloCicero editing and directing. The very fact that it really happened shows just how close Hitler's Germany was in winning the Second World War even as late as the spring of 1944 when most people in the allies camp  both in government and the military thought that the war was just about over and that Nazi Germany would be defeated by Christmas 1944 at the latest. Nazi Germany in fact held out together with it's Fhurer Adolph Hitler for five more long brutal and bloody months with just the Western Allies alone the British  Americans suffering well over 300000 casualties in the desperateby the defending Germans and no holds bar by both sides battle of Western Germany until the war finally ended in Germanys total defeat in the spring of 1945.".

Manipulating both sides the German  British in keeping him alive and free in order to find out whom his contacts are and how much he actually received and sold to both warring parties the British and Germans has Deillo playing for high stakes in both money as well as his life.Even though Diello screwed a lot of people in the movie he got the royal screwing in the end with his lover the twotiming Countess Staviska checking out on him and going to neutral Switzerland with all his cash 130000 Pound Sterling just when he was about to check out together with her to South America. Diello gets in touch with his contact Moyzisch whom he'd since discarded for one last deal in getting him and his German boss' for a cool 100000 Pound Sterling the plan to invade Europe by the allies Operation Overlord and open up a second front against Germany later that spring.By sticking his neck out in getting the information from the British ambassador's office safe that was rigged with an alarm Diello blew his cover and was now a marked man by both his former employer the British Government as well as his collaborators The Germans. The two were tricked by the sneaky Countess Staviska into thinking that Diello was working either for the British or Germans as a doubleagent giving both sides bogus information. This miscalculation on the Germans part had them throw away the actual plan by the British and US to invade France in June 1944 which if they believed and acted on it the Germans may well have prevented the allies from invading and conquering Western Europe. At the same time with a second front no longer a reality The Germans would have been able to defeat the Red Army and thus win the second World War.One of the best spy films ever made not only because of the superior acting especially by James Mason as DielloCicero editing and directing. The very fact that it really happened shows just how close Hitler's Germany was in winning the Second World War even as late as the spring of 1944 when most people in the allies camp  both in government and the military thought that the war was just about over and that Nazi Germany would be defeated by Christmas 1944 at the latest. Nazi Germany in fact held out together with it's Fhurer Adolph Hitler for five more long brutal and bloody months with just the Western Allies alone the British  Americans suffering well over 300000 casualties in the desperateby the defending Germans and no holds bar by both sides battle of Western Germany until the war finally ended in Germanys total defeat in the spring of 1945.";

As far as acting goes there seem to be too many clichs and exaggerations to contribute drama to a historically dramatic event. If anything it appears that weak acting makes the history less dramatic thereby earning a rating of 2. Except for the staightline scenes there seems to be little upon which to measure the production sets probably because many of the scenes are period newsreels even to the extent of employing what appears to be something akin to an autobahn promo another rating of 2. The plot rates a 1 mostly because the end is known and not much else can be done. Character development appears weakened by the stereotypical characters some of whom seem exaggerated beyond reason. With so many forgettable characters a rating of 2 seems fair. Artistry gets the highest rank of 4 based almost entirely on the ironic use of music. Continuity also rates a 4 since the docudrama tone is maintained with occasional weak spots like the soldiers singing on a supply train as it speed through a crossing. This movie was produced in 1961 in the same period as very good films DR. STRANGELOVE and THE LORD OF THE FLIES two movies that stunned audiences with their powerful drama. In my opinion this film does not measure up to those. In fact it seems much like the last feature of a three movie night at the local drivein. Just turn off the sound cuddle up and have a real excuse for getting home late. The best the Left Elbow Index can give is a 3.14. Pass the popcorn.".

It is about the backgrounds and manipulative tactics Hitler used in order to justify his invasion of Poland. This is he very general summary and I do believe that it could have been the basis for a very intriguing movie. Sadly this is not what this film by Klein and Kohlhaase still very known today here in Germany turned out to be. It is tough to say what the problem is. it is certainly not the runtime as it stays extremely short at only 70 minutes so it should have been extremely essential. Nonetheless it feels as if the movies loses itself in its script on several occasions and never manages to build a realistically convincing plot around its protagonists. I ended up not caring at all who these people were or what they did. And that's basically the worst that could happen to a film. I find it really disappointing as the subject offered so much more that what the outcome finally achieved. I don't thinks this film is worth watching. Not recommended.".

In years to come I believe it will be seen as the same genre as The Good Girl  an attempt to bring very ordinary people to life without apologizing for their ordinariness.  In A Good Girl Jennifer Aniston works very hard to portray an ordinary poorlyeducated young woman in a deadend job. She has to really work hard to suppress the natural intelligence of a very bright mind and make her ordinary girl sufficiently dumb. But she does it beautifully. In Drowning Mona  portraying Bobby Calzone Casey Affleck has a similar challenge. I think he creates his character brilliantly. I am so shocked to find higher up this page that Casey is ashamed of his work on this movie. Can this be true? It seems quite possible  on my DVD package he is the only major castmember who doesn't give an interview. Casey is handsome and delightful but he manages to leave an impression of terminal dumbness. All the guy wants is to make a reasonable living fixing gardens but his problems seem insurmountable and it's getting to him. I get the feeling that none of the cast were stirred or excited with Drowning Mona  you need to see the onset interviews to judge this. Nevertheless it is a successful little film in its own terms and has a lot of gentle humor in it. Affleck deVito Midler Lee Curtis do a very professional ensemble piece as you would expect. As a former copywriter I find the landscaping company slogan hysterically funny J  B Landscaping  Yeah we can do that'. I get the impression the whole cast read through a rather 'thin' script and said exactly that.".

It starts with a prologue stating how Verplanck New York was the location where they decided to launch the Yugo line of cars in America. As a result everyone in town including the police drives a Yugo car and they all have catchy license plates like UGOMONA ELLEEE and OH RONE.As the title suggests this black little whodunit concerns who opted to rid the small town of Verplanck of its nastiest inhabitant the matriarchal hag Mona Dearly Midler who chews up every inch of the screen in her Rashomonesque flashback scenes. Police Chief Wyatt Rash Danny DeVito playing against type as the straight man is determined to find out even if nobody else cares to help. It's come at a bad time because he's trying to help his daughter Ellie Neve Campbell plan her big wedding to mildmannered landscaper Bobby Calzone Casey Affleck who has just ended up shorthanded after his beerguzzling partner Jeff Dearly Marcus Thomas the epitome of slackerdom takes a leave of absence. Bobby also seems unnaturally concerned with the the death of a woman who meant only bad things for him.The characters while bordering on cartoons are played tongueincheek and you know the actors had fun doing it. There's the chainsmoking waitress Rhona Mace Jamie Lee Curtis who's having an affair with the deceased's husband Phil William Fichtner who walks away with the movie as a complete scumbag and Bobby's overbearing brother Murph Mark Pellegrino. The cops are just as zany with Peter Coyote as the dogooder lieutenant and Paul BenVictor and Paul Schulze Ryan Chapelle from 24 as a couple of bumbling idiots who seem to be good for one thing looking out for Numbers One. There's Katherine Wilhoite as Lucinda the lesbian folksinger mechanic and the great Tracey Walter is on board as the local fisherman who nobody really knows much about. Add in a foulmouthed alcoholic priest and a funeral director who's also an amateur pornographer Will Ferrell before he became huge and it's a feast for those with a twisted sense of humor.".

Will Ferrell absolutely steals the movie with his part as the creepy funeral director who laughs inappropiately has trouble with the right way to make eye contact and is constantly having sexual trysts during the viewing. If you're looking for an offbeat comedy give this a try. But don't rush out and kill yourself to see it.";

The tremendous word play goofy yet well developed characters as well as character relationships even though the characters were mostly small town and moronic they were intertwinedinterwoven in such a smart and believable way to me it is a tragedy this film is not known to most movie lovers for it is high up on my list of all time favorite funny movies. Although thanks to your website I have at least come to find out that this film has been characterized as having a cult following which makes me feel more at ease. The all star cast delivers one liners after one liners that all add up to such a hilarious finish not only does it get better with age like a great bottle of red wine or single malt but I always come away noticing somethingalbeit small new. Spending time growing up both in a Pennsylvanian small town and the Bay Area I love the small town feel of this movie yet I find the characters intellect to be closer to those of big city even though they're relationships are more small town. Anyway I love this movie and never do things like this but just had to give props to the creators writer and cast for such a spectacular piece of art big up's!".

Then something happens Mona dies in a car accident and town sheriff Wyatt Rash Danny DeVito found out that Mona was murdered and who would kill her.  The problem is that there is a long list of suspects. DROWNING MONA is a film that is a good example of the term black comedy a film where the viewer would laugh at something that they wouldn't normally laugh at.  But unlike some other black comedies i.e. the most recent IDLE HANDS this film isn't as cruel and does work.     The small town where DROWNING MONA takes place is a intresting town.  In the late 1980's the entire town received test cars from the Yugo car company.  And what's funny is that everyone in the town drives a Yugo.  Town sheriff Wyatt goes around his town looking for the person who would tamper with the Yugo that Mona was driving and send her to her watery death.  There's Mona's husband Phil William Fichtner who is having a affair with Rona Jamie Lee Curtis who is also a suspect.  There's Bobby Calzone Casey Affleck a young and ambitious young man who is engaged to the sheriff's daughter Ellen Neve Campbell.  Then there is Bobby's partner in their business Mona's son Jeff Marcus Thomas who is very dim and mean. This is a enjoyable film but it's not the best black comedy of all time.  It does work at times and at other times it fall flat on it's face.  There are some very funny scenes involved with Mona's son Jeff on how he might have lost his right hand.  And the town's loony mortician Will Ferrel does have some good scenes but not enough.  The acting from the cast is good though.  Danny DeVito is good as the man who is investigating the crime of Mona's death.  Jamie Lee Curtis is also good as the woman who could care less about Mona and move on with her life.  Neve Campbell does o.k. with what little role that she has.  William Fichtner Casey Affleck and Marcus Thomas are all also good but nothing outstanding.  It seems that the person who gets to steal all of the scenes belong to Bette.  She does another role that she is good at a role that is similar to her role in RUTHLESS PEOPLE. But overall DROWNING MONA isn't as funny or as witty as RUTHLESS since both films have characters that are rather ruthless.  But director Nick Gomez HBO's THE SOPRANO'S  OZ does a respectable first time job for a big feature film. MONA isn't great but it's worth watching at least once.  But if you want to see DeVito and Midler act more funnier and vicious watch RUTHLESS PEOPLE.  12 out of five".

One day she dies victim of a sabotage. Everyone becomes a suspect. Everyone is also eccentric. There is a marriage coming up and the police chief must find the killer before that. As you can see the story is banal but would be pretty interesting if it had fallen in the hands of the Coen brothers. Unfortunately it didn't.I may say at once that DROWNING MONA is not an awful movie. It is pretty bad but somehow watchable if you have nothing else to do. However it could have been much much better if they had good director and writer to turn the banal story into one delightful film. Nick Gomez WHO???????????? the director tries to make something odd and hilarious but he never gets above the shamefully mediocre. Oh well! There is a very decent cast here. I usually don't like Bette Midler's kind of humor but I can stand her at times. In DROWNING MONA she is in the screen for not much time but she repeats everything she uses to do. I said decent cast didn't I? Neve Campbell was never great because she always acts the same way but she is nice and truly convinces. Danny DeVitto is always above the average and he is the best here. Jamie Lee Curtis is keeping on with her failed career no we still didn't forget VIRUS she is surprisingly good here. There are other good supporting actors but one delivers one of the worst performances of the year Casey Affleck Neve's fianc. If DROWNING MONA can't be great it has everything to be an average film. There are some good moments contrasting to very bad ones. The pacing is uneven the soundtrack is peculiar not in a great way the characters are bland but interesting some situations are funny. It is average watchable matinee film right? No because of the conclusion. It is so bad so uninteresting so idiotic that makes the film even worse. The identity of the killer is so obvious arbitrary stupid that we can't believe. I still thought there would be something else but there wasn't. If the hits and misses are there the end threw away all the mystery.The final result of DROWNING MONA is not very positive. I'm being generous of giving it 2 stars so maybe some day I change my rating. It went straight to video here in Brazil because of the box office flop in the US. If I had seen it on the movies it would have been a disastrous experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "from a review by Jon BastianDrowning Mona is a lot like watching an episode of Wheel of Fortune if you're a fan. You may root and cheer and laugh while the game is on but half an hour later you won't remember the solution to the big money puzzle. It's a shame because the film is full of great actors playing incredibly well defined and minutely observed characters. By the final credits though the plot twists and character bits fall a few turns short of being satisfying.First a few words on what Drowning Mona is not ad campaigns to the contrary. It is not a Bette Midler star vehicle. In fact despite Ms. M. playing the titular drownee she isn't in the film nearly enough. In the far too few scenes in which we see her play a shrill nasty zaftig white trash harridan she steals the show  and it's no stretch at all to imagine why anyone or everyone would want to kill her  which brings me to the second point. Much is made in the film's advertising that the entire population of the small town of Verplanck New York wants to Mona dead. In reality there are far too few suspects and that is the main point on which the movie falls down. The solution to the mystery is rather obvious despite a big fat red herring planted about midway and so the resolution feels unfulfilling. It's kind of like going to Verplanck's only diner expecting the heart attack special and only getting the vegetarian plate.".

	onyx:emotionText "from a review by Jon BastianDrowning Mona is a lot like watching an episode of Wheel of Fortune if you're a fan. You may root and cheer and laugh while the game is on but half an hour later you won't remember the solution to the big money puzzle. It's a shame because the film is full of great actors playing incredibly well defined and minutely observed characters. By the final credits though the plot twists and character bits fall a few turns short of being satisfying.First a few words on what Drowning Mona is not ad campaigns to the contrary. It is not a Bette Midler star vehicle. In fact despite Ms. M. playing the titular drownee she isn't in the film nearly enough.

There are so many loose ends that you wonder if 30 minutes of the movie was cut out.In addition to the movie being poorly written it was poorly directed. I stopped counting the visible boom microphones after 15. You see it in the picture inside outside everywhere but in the car. I can't believe the director missed it so many times. It's not a once in a while thing it's very present and noticeable throughout the movie. There are other continuity errors but this was the worst.Overall the acting is bad. Danny DeVito does well with a bland character and William Fichtner Phil is very good in his role. The rest of the cast made little to no effort. Casey Affleck mumbles and whines his lines. While this is part of the character it gets annoying and it is hard to understand him at times.".

Such an attitude can indeed result in a meaningful and witty work if placed in the hands of an artist but no one involved in the making of this film seems to have even the foggiest notion what he or she was attempting to do.

Danny De Vito costars as the upstate New York sheriff who spends the movie trying to eliminate each of the suspects one by one.  The movie's innumerable pitfalls begin with Mona herself who is we assume intended to be hilariously outrageous but who just comes across as grating irritating and obnoxious.

Although the script dishes up an abundance of inane plot mechanics for the director Nick Gomez to fall back on the author Peter Steinfeld has provided not a single line of humorous dialogue to go along with them.  As a result Gomez more often than not is forced to throw his characters into a frenzy of hyper kinetic activity in a futile attempt to keep the film moving forward.   And of course the film loses what little nerve it has at the end by letting the ostensibly guilty' person off the hook.The problem with Drowning Mona' is that the film really perishes in the river right along with her in the brief opening scene  and as a result the rest of the movie is really the cinematic equivalent of watching a stiff lifeless and rotting corpse.".
