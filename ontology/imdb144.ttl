The films had become excessively formal they said squeezing out character comedy and narrative the sexual daring had stepped over the line and become gratuitous and nasty  there is one sequence here in which a rape is treated as comic becomes enjoyable for the victim and produces a redemptive conception.  With films like this and 'Kika' Almodovar was accused of believing his own hype of taking the grand claims of auteurism too seriously and forgetting about the things that had made him precious in the first place the audacity the iconoclasm the fun.Now we can appreciate 'HIgh Heels' as a dry run for his masterpiece 'All About My Mother' with which it shares some startling similarities  the daring colours the rich compositions the masterly camerawork the central parentchild relationship Marisa Parades as a performer the themes of identity and imitation.  But while hugely flawed 'Heels' is also an entertaining film in its own right full of naturally astounding acting perverse plotting and a gloriously full melodramatic score.What hampers the film is its reliance on genre.  Although ostensibly a typical Almodovar melodrama visualising the emotional and sexual lives of his female characters the plot is underpinned by a murder mystery.  His remarkable 'Live Flesh' shows how genre can be used for complex nongeneric ends but he hasn't quite got there with 'Heels'.  The crime story is useful as a springboard offsetting and bringing various crises and themes together but just as the film is about to hit an emotional crescendo it is weighed down by the need to tie up loose plot ends so that a climax that should be moving and cathartic ends up in a grotesque haggling over guns and fingerprints.None of this is thematically irrelevant  the characters are as emotionally trapped as they are by generic circumstances Paredes claiming Abril's murder her transferring her fingerprints on the murder weapon her dying for her daughter's sin in a religious parody explicitely revealed in the final composition framed and coloured like a sacred painting all form part of the film's variations on family the past and present tradition and individuality responsibility antiOedipal struggles and especially imitation this latter embodied in the figure of the Judge a man representing a monolithic institution run by men while the women languish in prison who is in fact three or more people his very existence a rejection of dogmatism of the stable certain repressive  in the end he will marry and unwittingly? shield a murderer.  His imitation of Paredes mirrors negatively her daughter's feelings of inferiority that she is a bad pastiche can't even imitate her as well as a drag queen.This theme of artifice visualised in the sets and colours in the mirrors and reflecting glass that splits characters into multiple versions of themselves does not suggest the world is fake but that people have so many complex often contradictory emotions and desires that they cannot possibly be contained in one whole identity single identity is here equated with death in the case of macho reactionary hypocrite Manuel.  Truth even manages to subvert the fabrications of the media with Abril's onair confession although its status as truth is automatically made suspect anything said on telly couldn't possibly be true could it?.The film is full of wonderful flourishes in particular the musical sequences a thrilling dance scene in the prison heartbreaking torch songs at moments of dramaoverspilling crisis.  In each individual scene Almodovar's control of all his technical tools is faultless.  Put together though and the thing doesn't seem to cohere.  It must have been the script.".

	schema:reviewBody "I like the films made by director Pedro Almodvar and 'Tacones Lejanos' 'High Heels' is no exception. Even his lesser film 'Kika' have something to enjoy most of all because they are so very different from other films you have seen. Like a Tarantinofilm an Almodvarfilm is sort of like a genre on itself. Although Almodvar reached greatness with 'Todo Sobre Mi Madre' and especially 'Hable Con Ella' his earlier films like 'Mujeres al Borde de un Ataque de Nervios' and this one are a lot of fun. He mixes so many genres here uses symbolism in such an effective way the least thing it does is being original. I guess there is nothing wrong with that.The story involves a daughter Rebeca Victoria Abril her famous mother Becky Marisa Paredes who returns to Spain after fifteen tears a murder that could have been committed by Rebeca Becky and a third suspect Judge Domnguez Miguel Bos who is on the case and a lot of colorful supporting characters. I could tell you more but the plot is not really the issue here. Although this films sounds like a drama maybe a detective or a thriller even it is closer to a comedy because of the way Almodvar handles the absurd situations. There is a scene where Rebeca an anchorwoman tells something about the murder where she herself is one of the suspects. Next to her sits a woman who does the news in sign language. The whole scene which is dramatic in what it tells us is one of the best moments of comedy I have seen.Of course the themes here are really dramatic. Not only we have the murder we also have Rebeca who has wanted to impress her mother her entire life. It is just that Almodvar creates a world that reminds you of a soap opera that can bring comedy out of every dramatic event. That his film is more serious than you might think is proved by the symbolism he uses. Scenes where Rebeca is temporarily in prison show her in a symbolic way how she feels. In another beautiful scene we see Rebeca driving her car but it is the wall on the background that draws her attention. It is like her entire life is written on the wall. Almodvar who loves to use bright colors finds an effective way here to use them representing the state the character is in. It is not only effective it is quite beautiful to look at as well.".

The movie doesn't have the magic of Almodovar's best works perhaps because the performances as a whole aren't that impressive.

	schema:headline " Lana's Heels";
	schema:reviewBody "Generally considered lesser Almodovar by many writercritics Tacones Lejanos is in fact one of the director's most stunning works. This film's true themesmotif pays tribute to Golden Age Hollywood and it's mythic lore. Aldomovar deliberately crafted this film as homage to Douglas Sirk's Imitation Of Life and more importantly it's star Lana Turner.Douglas Sirk's celebrated maternal melodrama Imitation Of Life also begins with a child lost at a holiday location... And the multiple parallels between the two plots are clear both focus on the life of a motherperformer on maternal neglect motherdaughter strife and incestuous rivalry over a man in Tacones Lejanos Rebeca will marry Becky's exlover. And in the murder of a male lover shared by two women Almodovar may also be drawing on press accounts of Turner's reallife drama which famously and ambiguously fed into one of her most commercially successful screen roles. When Almodovar has Rebeca tell Becky stop acting mother! he is signaling a quite explicit reference to Imitation Of Life.When Victoria Abril's Rebeca opens her handbag Almodovar cuts to a loving closeup of its Chanel label. Englishlanguage critics have used this attention to costume and detail to attack the supposed triviality of Tacones Lejanos obsessed as it would appear to be with accessories. Almodovar is paying homage here to a Hollywood tradition. The production notes for Imitation Of Life also stress the importance of Lana Turner's gowns and jewels valued at over a million dollars.At first sight however Almodovar seems merely to have retained and intensified Sirk's formalism while jettisoning his broader concerns but... Aldomovar is insistent on the lack of irony in Sirk's films curiously so when Sirk himself and most modern critics take ironic distance to be his most characteristic response to the melodramatic material he handled so skilfully. From Critical Studies in Latin American and Iberian Cultures Desire Unlimited The Cinema of Pedro Almodovar La Lana Turner was many things to many people but here's the selfreferencial in Madame's Trash Yourself oeuvre that Almodovar pays tribute to LANA TURNER The Lady  The Legend She started in Andy Hardy kid's stuff but soon dazzled audiences in films like Ziegfeld Girl  Johnny Eager. As a top WW II pinup girl she inspired many a man to come back home to Mama. After the war MGM turned up the heat transitioning her to fullon glamorous movie star in films like The Postman Always Rings Twice  The Bad And The Beautiful.In 1958 Lana picked a real doozie of a lover smalltime hood and bigtime ladies' man Johnny Stompanato a henchman for mobster Mickey Cohen. On April 4 her daughter Cheryl 14 was home from school lucky for Lana. Johnny slapped Lana and told her ...he'd ruin her face so she'd never work again. Cheryl hearing everything outside the bedroom door ran downstairs terrified and grabbed a kitchen knife...When a movie star is involved in a crime the last person they want to see is a cop ...Attorney to the stars Jerry Geisler rushed to Bedford Drive. Some say Johnny was still alive and Geisler let him bleed out. The rumor that won't die is that Lana killed Johnny and Geisler convinced her to let Cheryl a minor take the fall. The next day the world heard the news...The press buildup was pure Hollywood Stompanato's funeral Turner's insistence that he was an unwelcome presence in her life his brother's announcement that Johnny was stabbed lying down. The coup de grace came two days before the inquest when Lanita's love letters to her Johnny filled with burning desires were plastered across front pages worldwide a little payback from Mickey Cohen Stompanato's pal.Geisler got Cheryl excused from the inquest and that made Lana the star of the show. And what a show. The morning of the inquest as hundreds of fans gathered downtown Lana's makeup and hair people were giving her the works...She entered that courtroom camera ready for the greatest performance of her life. In the hushed sweltering L.A. courtroom Lana Turner breathlessly explained how her teenage daughter came to murder her gangster boyfriend.Only the clicking of cameras could be heard during Turner's anguished 62 minute testimony...

	onyx:emotionText "Generally considered lesser Almodovar by many writercritics Tacones Lejanos is in fact one of the director's most stunning works. This film's true themesmotif pays tribute to Golden Age Hollywood and it's mythic lore. Aldomovar deliberately crafted this film as homage to Douglas Sirk's Imitation Of Life and more importantly it's star Lana Turner.Douglas Sirk's celebrated maternal melodrama Imitation Of Life also begins with a child lost at a holiday location... And the multiple parallels between the two plots are clear both focus on the life of a motherperformer on maternal neglect motherdaughter strife and incestuous rivalry over a man in Tacones Lejanos Rebeca will marry Becky's exlover. And in the murder of a male lover shared by two women Almodovar may also be drawing on press accounts of Turner's reallife drama which famously and ambiguously fed into one of her most commercially successful screen roles. When Almodovar has Rebeca tell Becky stop acting mother! he is signaling a quite explicit reference to Imitation Of Life.When Victoria Abril's Rebeca opens her handbag Almodovar cuts to a loving closeup of its Chanel label. Englishlanguage critics have used this attention to costume and detail to attack the supposed triviality of Tacones Lejanos obsessed as it would appear to be with accessories. Almodovar is paying homage here to a Hollywood tradition. The production notes for Imitation Of Life also stress the importance of Lana Turner's gowns and jewels valued at over a million dollars.At first sight however Almodovar seems merely to have retained and intensified Sirk's formalism while jettisoning his broader concerns but... Aldomovar is insistent on the lack of irony in Sirk's films curiously so when Sirk himself and most modern critics take ironic distance to be his most characteristic response to the melodramatic material he handled so skilfully. From Critical Studies in Latin American and Iberian Cultures Desire Unlimited The Cinema of Pedro Almodovar La Lana Turner was many things to many people but here's the selfreferencial in Madame's Trash Yourself oeuvre that Almodovar pays tribute to LANA TURNER The Lady  The Legend She started in Andy Hardy kid's stuff but soon dazzled audiences in films like Ziegfeld Girl  Johnny Eager. As a top WW II pinup girl she inspired many a man to come back home to Mama. After the war MGM turned up the heat transitioning her to fullon glamorous movie star in films like The Postman Always Rings Twice  The Bad And The Beautiful.In 1958 Lana picked a real doozie of a lover smalltime hood and bigtime ladies' man Johnny Stompanato a henchman for mobster Mickey Cohen. On April 4 her daughter Cheryl 14 was home from school lucky for Lana. Johnny slapped Lana and told her ...he'd ruin her face so she'd never work again. Cheryl hearing everything outside the bedroom door ran downstairs terrified and grabbed a kitchen knife...When a movie star is involved in a crime the last person they want to see is a cop ...Attorney to the stars Jerry Geisler rushed to Bedford Drive. Some say Johnny was still alive and Geisler let him bleed out. The rumor that won't die is that Lana killed Johnny and Geisler convinced her to let Cheryl a minor take the fall. The next day the world heard the news...The press buildup was pure Hollywood Stompanato's funeral Turner's insistence that he was an unwelcome presence in her life his brother's announcement that Johnny was stabbed lying down. The coup de grace came two days before the inquest when Lanita's love letters to her Johnny filled with burning desires were plastered across front pages worldwide a little payback from Mickey Cohen Stompanato's pal.Geisler got Cheryl excused from the inquest and that made Lana the star of the show. And what a show. The morning of the inquest as hundreds of fans gathered downtown Lana's makeup and hair people were giving her the works...She entered that courtroom camera ready for the greatest performance of her life. In the hushed sweltering L.A. courtroom Lana Turner breathlessly explained how her teenage daughter came to murder her gangster boyfriend.Only the clicking of cameras could be heard during Turner's anguished 62 minute testimony... The hearing lasted three hours. The jury returned a verdict in less than 20 minutes justifiable homicide. Mickey Cohen griped to the press It's the first time in my life I've ever seen a dead man convicted of his own murder. So far as that jury was concerned Johnny just walked too close to that knife.

As the plot unfolds we learn that she married one of her mother's former beaus. Did she do it for revenge or to humiliate her mother or was it simply a coincidence? As the plot thickens and something happens to her husband even further questions arise with regards to her intentions and it is perhaps best not to say more to avoid ruining a fresh experience of the film. While the narrative sometimes feels all over the place and not everything that occurs is especially credible especially the jail that seems more like a summer camp! the film has an undeniable charm to it.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie the other day in a film school class and I hadn't seen an Almodovar movie before but went in expecting it to be good. Unfortunately it turned out to be a pointless film with only a couple of laughs mixed in with two hours of sheer boredom.  High Heels is just a collection of random scenes that might have worked in their own separate movies but together don't add up to any kind of meaningful whole at all.Or so I thought.  Then the next day my film professor spent the entire class period explaining all of the movie's hidden little details like how the mural depicting stereotypical flamenco dancers in the background of the drag queen scene is some kind of commentary on the lack of identity that Spain as a nation has developed under fascist rule.  Apparently the whole movie is chock full of clever little visual tricks and references like this.Great but you know what?  It's still a bad movie.  It takes more than depth and complexity to make a good filmyou still need to give the audience a reason to keep paying attention something to interest the viewer enough to actually care about all the subtle tricks.  High Heels gives us strange offbeat characters but keeps them in mostly mundane situations recycled from other movies and Almodovar doesn't seem to be using them to make any kind of point.  What is the significance for example of the Hitchcockian surprise character revelation that occurs towards the end of the film? Why is that even in there?  Just to surprise us?There is one funny scene that has to do with a news broadcast.  And that's it that's the only entertaining moment.  The rest of the movie is just nonsensical filmic references and visual cues that apparently exist only for the sake of showing us how smart Pedro Almodovar is.  But no matter what my film professor says it takes more than selfindulgent trickery for a movie to be good.".

Unfortunately it turned out to be a pointless film with only a couple of laughs mixed in with two hours of sheer boredom.  High Heels is just a collection of random scenes that might have worked in their own separate movies but together don't add up to any kind of meaningful whole at all.Or so I thought.  Then the next day my film professor spent the entire class period explaining all of the movie's hidden little details like how the mural depicting stereotypical flamenco dancers in the background of the drag queen scene is some kind of commentary on the lack of identity that Spain as a nation has developed under fascist rule.  Apparently the whole movie is chock full of clever little visual tricks and references like this.Great but you know what?  It's still a bad movie.  It takes more than depth and complexity to make a good filmyou still need to give the audience a reason to keep paying attention something to interest the viewer enough to actually care about all the subtle tricks.  High Heels gives us strange offbeat characters but keeps them in mostly mundane situations recycled from other movies and Almodovar doesn't seem to be using them to make any kind of point.  What is the significance for example of the Hitchcockian surprise character revelation that occurs towards the end of the film? Why is that even in there?  Just to surprise us?There is one funny scene that has to do with a news broadcast.  And that's it that's the only entertaining moment.  The rest of the movie is just nonsensical filmic references and visual cues that apparently exist only for the sake of showing us how smart Pedro Almodovar is.  But no matter what my film professor says it takes more than selfindulgent trickery for a movie to be good.";

Their first task hire actors. Fox gave them a reasonable budget but the monkeys wanted to save the money. They hired fifteen TV actors shortly after.Now the script. The monkeys wanted to save more of the budget so they wrote the movie themselves. Leaving out important aspects of the two franchises was the easy part. Thinking of great new lines for the general audience to remember years down the line  that was more difficult. They butted heads awhile and came up with a truly awardwinning screenplay equipped with clich characters idiotic decisions an gaping plot holes.Fox was pleased thus far with the results but wanted to see what was to become of the centerpieces to the film  the aliens and predators. The monkeys again wanted to save money in the budget so they decided to trash the great robotics used in the otherwise terrible AvP original and go with the maninthesuit Alien seen in the old films. The actors playing the aliens had trouble fitting into the suits as they weren't properly sized by the monkeys so they jiggled their plastic heads throughout the film with honor. As for the predators the monkeys decided one predator was enough this time around again saving budget to fight the hordes of aliens that seemingly come out of nowhere. But what about the effects you ask? Come on now people. They may be monkeys but they clearly knew CGI would play a key role in the film. Without diving into the budget the monkeys used a standard Final Cut program and cut and pasted some very nice fire and spark effects throughout. Putting red and green filters over the camera lens provided some excellent Predator visions.The setting was something the monkeys thought long and hard about. If this was to be on Earth in Colorado of all places they needed to make it realistic. This was where they admitted they might have made a mistake. See the monkeys didn't have proper training in this department so they thought turning the lights off in the city and having the movie play out in the dead of night and in the rain was the right thing to do. They simply forgot people like to see the creatures instead of looking at shadows and rain the whole film. To add insult to injury the monkeys accidentally filmed all the fight scenes incredibly close so no one could see what was fighting or who it was. But again rookie mistake.The rating. Fox told the monkeys to make the movie Rrated. That was easy. Without showing how many of the injuries or deaths actually happened the monkeys made a habit of showing the carnage after the fact. It was simple the viewers got the gore they desired and the monkeys didn't have to film the majority of action shots involving that violence.Some of the actors originally had questions concerning the screenplay. Why does a blue liquid the Predator has endless amounts of magically disintegrate whatever he wants it to and nothing more than that? Why is an exconvict driving around in a police car the entire movie? Why did the monkeys forget to show a full body shot of the Aliens? Why does a clock play a more memorable role than any of the main characters? The list of questions just kept growing but the monkeys ignored them and finished their masterpiece. Fox was thrilled with their work. So thrilled that they opened the movie nationwide on Christmas Day and even spent a few bucks advertising it the week before it came out. The monkeys had successfully made another installment in these cherished franchises.But some ask what ever happened to the budget the monkeys forgot to use? They put it towards their next film Aliens vs. Predator vs. Hulk Hogan. They knew the general public would be upset with the title but they have since released this statementTo the people do not worry about our upcoming film. It will be rated R and will have violence.And everyone lived happily ever after. The end.".

	schema:reviewBody "With this movie I was really hoping that the idea was to make up for the hashed together ineptitude of the first AVP and yet to my horror Requiem is far worse than I could have imagined.My hopes were up in the opening moments of the film inside the Predator ship and I almost breathed a sigh of relief when we finally saw the Predator home world a throwaway digital matte painting but still nice to finally see it and then of course the humans if such poorly written characters can be referred to as such are introduced...One must wonder why it seems to be impossible for Fox to make a good film out of Aliens and Predators. At the very least the supposed filmmakers could have done their homework.Characters are set up in the same manner in which we would expect from the worst Friday the 13th Sequel. The pizza delivery scene was cringe inducing as was every other scene of character interaction that followed it. Bimbos and teen non actors do not make for a REAL film they make for a cheap flick and Alien 13 and the Predator movies were good because they were produced above the concept remember that the 1st Alien is a B movie done as an A movie The Strause brothers really missed an opportunity that could have been rectified by simply knowing their AlienPredator roots In both the Alien and Predator films we are introduced to characters that are part of a larger group Alien Refinery workers Aliens Marines Alien 3 Convicts and in the Predator films we generally follow a main hero part of a unit Predator ArnoldSpecial forces Predator 2 Danny Glover Police and it's easy to see where the filmmakers of both franchises started to go wrong in Alien Ressurrection we have pirates...or something AVP we have...explorers?...with guns?? and of course in AVPR we have teen slasher clichs. What is there to identify with here? In concept the idea of a convict returning to a small town and a war vet returning seemed a set up for a First Blood type of action hero but like many things it was never paid off.The Filmmaking is equally devoid of rhyme of reason. There is no sense of forward momentum to the action just small sequences that build the most minuscule levels of tension or interest only to cut away just when they're getting interesting...taking the audience out of the movie at every turn. The action scenes themselves though much ballyhooed in the trailers are so darkly lit it is literally impossible to tell what is going on during the fight scenes when they finally occur. Basically the movie is hindered from many levels. Bad actors combined with poor direction and an atrocious screenplay which as a screenwriter myself I noticed seemed to hit every wrong note and clich that only the most untalented writer devoid of ideas could have hashed together The WRITING if it can be called that is not even direct to video quality nor does it demonstrate a shred of respect for the established lore of the previous entries in the series. Why does the Predalien all the sudden have the ability to shoot alien embryos down a pregnant woman's throat to use her as an incubator for chestbursters? More than likely because the brain dead screenwriter needed a way to have more aliens for the predator to fight and given the accelerated growth time even more so than the first AVP as quickly as possible. Why must meaningless small talk between cardboard cutouts on sticks meaning the supposed characterssubstitute for real character development? Remember a character is defined by what they DO not SAY. Why is the Sheriff leading civilians to a cache of guns? isn't he an officer of the law? How does the bimbo of all people know where they are? Why does the Predalien wait for the Predator to VERY SLOWLY remove his mask before it attacks? Why are the aliens still falling into that nasty seriespostAlien 3 habit of hissing all the time to let their prey know to run? How on Earth did this series devolve to a character saying People are dying...we need guns! how this writer even works is beyond me and reflects badly on Fox's already destroyed artistic reputation. It's like everyone involved in the making of this film suffered from a mental impairment or really are that inept at every level of the filmmaking process. The EFFECTS are pretty lousy this time around. The Aliens look like men in suits and ADI is just getting lazy with their creature design. The Aliens look like modified leftovers from Alien Resurrection with that same bulky musculature around the arms as if they did not learn from that movie that it was not a good design nor a good one to recycle. Again everything is shrouded in such a state of darkness not to create mystery or atmosphere but simply to hide how bad the creatures look. And just like in AVP Stan Winston is sorely missed when the fake looking Predator face is revealed.There are too many faults to list so I will just say this Do not waste your money on this movie. Fox is beyond caring about the fans as this cheap and trashy film is clearly evidence of. I felt bad having taken my girlfriend to see it though it was free and apologized to her profusely after. This is one diehard fan who is done with the franchise.Note to Fox What we really wanted wasn't a mindless slasher flick it was a film adaptation of the original Darkhorse Comicbook which was better than anything you've produced for this franchise post 1993.Signing off.".

Bimbos and teen non actors do not make for a REAL film they make for a cheap flick and Alien 13 and the Predator movies were good because they were produced above the concept remember that the 1st Alien is a B movie done as an A movie The Strause brothers really missed an opportunity that could have been rectified by simply knowing their AlienPredator roots In both the Alien and Predator films we are introduced to characters that are part of a larger group Alien Refinery workers Aliens Marines Alien 3 Convicts and in the Predator films we generally follow a main hero part of a unit Predator ArnoldSpecial forces Predator 2 Danny Glover Police and it's easy to see where the filmmakers of both franchises started to go wrong in Alien Ressurrection we have pirates...or something AVP we have...explorers?...with guns?? and of course in AVPR we have teen slasher clichs. What is there to identify with here? In concept the idea of a convict returning to a small town and a war vet returning seemed a set up for a First Blood type of action hero but like many things it was never paid off.The Filmmaking is equally devoid of rhyme of reason. There is no sense of forward momentum to the action just small sequences that build the most minuscule levels of tension or interest only to cut away just when they're getting interesting...taking the audience out of the movie at every turn. The action scenes themselves though much ballyhooed in the trailers are so darkly lit it is literally impossible to tell what is going on during the fight scenes when they finally occur. Basically the movie is hindered from many levels. Bad actors combined with poor direction and an atrocious screenplay which as a screenwriter myself I noticed seemed to hit every wrong note and clich that only the most untalented writer devoid of ideas could have hashed together The WRITING if it can be called that is not even direct to video quality nor does it demonstrate a shred of respect for the established lore of the previous entries in the series. Why does the Predalien all the sudden have the ability to shoot alien embryos down a pregnant woman's throat to use her as an incubator for chestbursters? More than likely because the brain dead screenwriter needed a way to have more aliens for the predator to fight and given the accelerated growth time even more so than the first AVP as quickly as possible. Why must meaningless small talk between cardboard cutouts on sticks meaning the supposed characterssubstitute for real character development? Remember a character is defined by what they DO not SAY. Why is the Sheriff leading civilians to a cache of guns? isn't he an officer of the law? How does the bimbo of all people know where they are? Why does the Predalien wait for the Predator to VERY SLOWLY remove his mask before it attacks? Why are the aliens still falling into that nasty seriespostAlien 3 habit of hissing all the time to let their prey know to run? How on Earth did this series devolve to a character saying People are dying...we need guns! how this writer even works is beyond me and reflects badly on Fox's already destroyed artistic reputation. It's like everyone involved in the making of this film suffered from a mental impairment or really are that inept at every level of the filmmaking process. The EFFECTS are pretty lousy this time around. The Aliens look like men in suits and ADI is just getting lazy with their creature design. The Aliens look like modified leftovers from Alien Resurrection with that same bulky musculature around the arms as if they did not learn from that movie that it was not a good design nor a good one to recycle. Again everything is shrouded in such a state of darkness not to create mystery or atmosphere but simply to hide how bad the creatures look. And just like in AVP Stan Winston is sorely missed when the fake looking Predator face is revealed.There are too many faults to list so I will just say this Do not waste your money on this movie. Fox is beyond caring about the fans as this cheap and trashy film is clearly evidence of. I felt bad having taken my girlfriend to see it though it was free and apologized to her profusely after. This is one diehard fan who is done with the franchise.Note to Fox What we really wanted wasn't a mindless slasher flick it was a film adaptation of the original Darkhorse Comicbook which was better than anything you've produced for this franchise post 1993.Signing off.";

	schema:reviewBody "There was a time when the Alien series was a success with even the third installment Alien 3 showing promise under the guild of a fresh and young David Fincher. The first Predator was a box office hit mainly due to its story in peak star Arnold Schwarzenegger and director John McTiernan Die Hard. The films Alien Aliens Alien 3 and Predator were all highly successful and created massive followings among general film fans and science fiction fans alike. Arguably Predator 2 and Alien Resurrection should have signaled the end for both franchises but studios were undeterred and saw the opportunity to pander to the rumours among fans and combine the two. Step in Paul W.S Anderson Alien Vs Predator and now the Brothers Strauss visual effects graduates not even directors or writers. The problem was that by allowing such profound and revolutionary creations of the SciFi genre to fall into the hands of firstly a mediocre director and now directorial newbie's has led to nothing more than profanity epitomised by incompetence. Upon witnessing Alien Vs Predator Requiem AVPR diehard fans will feel sick to their stomachs that this series could have got any worse.One example of the cinematic deterioration of this franchise is in the opening scene and is likely to cause nausea among fans. The film begins with an Alien making its way onto the Predator ship spurting from the predators chest growing in to a full grown Predalien and bringing down the Predator craft which now seems to have far less Predators on it than it did at the end of Alien Vs Predator and all this occurs with the ship still in Earths atmosphere. Once the ship has crashed AVPR quickly resorts to cheap plot methods and basic narrative conventions it makes no venture at utilizing any of the twists or subversions served up in the two original films. The wearisome plot progresses with tedious pace punctuated only by the near rousing conflicts of Alien and Predator and when that runs the risk of boring us we are treated to either an alluring blonde in a bikini or rapid gunfire. AVPR is plagued by an endless array of continuity errors and plot holes with little or no narrative elucidation i.e. members of the public outwitting an elite military unit or the Predator not adhering to laws established in previous editions. This is a film that has a complete disregard for its predecessors it breaks some of the most fundamental rules of a sequel and in doing so one gets the feeling that it is trying to set itself up as a stand alone feature. Independently the film has no heart no conviction and no soul and with reference to the other films lacks even the most basic continuity. This is exemplified by the over arching narrative of the film as it undermines the basic premise of the first Alien. Because if the species had been encountered before then those in the first Alien film would have been more proficient and not so ill prepared when encountering them.On a cinematic note the film is close to being dire I felt urged at some points to shine a torch at the screen the lighting was so bad. Through utilizing such gloomy and dark effects the audience may feel as though they are being cheated out of some the action  which is ironically its purpose and also indicates the films lack of budget. As with all science fiction one scene normally surfaces as being the most memorable in this instance it is probably the hospital impregnation scene as it ever so tenuously draws on the themes of the original Alien by literalizing it. The directing is poor performances weak and the script rotten. AVPR is the product of a conveyor belt system of filmmaking in which ideas and techniques are assembled by ineffective people and then the finished product distributed among cinemas. This is personified by the absence of gory death scenes and drawn out blood battles because the certification will not allow it  a lower certification achieving a larger target audience. AVPR was purely a business venture and nothing more.".

	schema:reviewBody "The review on the main page admits that the movie is horrible but that you should forgive it because it is nicely violent. No you shouldn't. There are spoilers at the end of this review but how I can spoil this rotten movie I have no idea. Even if you are a die hard AlienPred fan like I am wait for the DVD. It isn't worth a 3.99 rental either but you'll be much less inclined to truly hate this film if you pay that than 12 bucks or better per person plus concession purchases at a theater.In the theater I watched AVPr there were exactly two laughs both by a girl sitting next to me. Other than that there was total silence throughout. No ooohs or that was bad ass! nothing. Imagine being a patient on an operating table and just being given the anesthetic. Now you know what you'll feel like in the theater after the opening scene of AVPr.What was the budget on this movie? Like War of the Worlds MI 3 and other fx driven movies the director seems far more involved in what the CGI people can come up with than developing characters or a plot. Spielberg has tried and failed at this several times usually with Tom Cruise. Sure the movies make money but should they? War of the Worlds and Minority Report had the budget to pay for a decent script Tom Cruise et al and SS himself but were still awful. I'm sure AVP wasted 90 of their budget on CG and had no choice but to hire any actor that would say yes even though the casting agent would have done better by going to the supermarket and picking actors at random.There is no tension developed in any scene so we are never close to being surprised. Who cares who gets killed? We didn't know any of them we all know what happens when the lil aliens make their corporeal exit we all know the blood is acid. In Alien Aliens 3 Resurrection and even AVP the directors make use of the fact that the Aliens can think can hide and can lay traps. This director decided that the Ridley Scott James Cameron and others were idiots for developing characters you actually want to see either live or get killed. In this installment you will never care who lives or dies not a kid a parent a pregnant woman. The characters serve only one purpose in this movie to die. The opening scenes establish the fact that the movie is going to be a predictable joke. The character development scenes mix clichs bad humor and bad acting and numb the viewer to the point where we really don't care if they get killed so long as they die in never before seen ways. But they don't. The director tried to make something different from those who preceded him in the Alien franchise but only succeeded in discarding the good parts of the first films the human protagonists and stealing the rest from other recent scifi films.There is not one original use of the either the Alien or Pred characters. The Pred actually has little trouble killing Aliens by the dozen even though the last movie led us to believe that Pred revered the Aliens as such a deadly foe that they used the killing of one as Rite of Passage. The AlienPred is never really developed as a fearsome creature. Its ability to inject parasites into a host is ripped from several different movies most recently probably was Hellboy where Samiel's dismembered tongue injected eggs into Hellboy or Doom where the mutated creatures would leave their tongues behind after they speared a victim's throat.Simply put we aren't given reason to care about anything in this movie. There is violence but it doesn't shock or surprise and is nothing that hasn't been seen in any of a hundred slasher flicks. The CG is OK and both species of alien are made to look and move as they have in movies past. But since the characters are never developed and the acting is so bad we kind of hope that they all die. The little girl was probably the best actor of the bunch but sadly we aren't made to care whether or not kids women or anyone else lives or dies. We just want the movie to end. Eventually it does but not before another stolen plot line from Resident Evil 2 has a nuke aim Gunnison's way to wipe out the infection. And not before yet another stupid scene that is supposed to open the door for further sequels but does it? In a movie filled with bad scenes the worst may have been saved for last.Sorry for the repetition but everything bears repeating bad script no plot unoriginal action scenes uninspired direction abysmal acting decent fx that were wasted because of the many flaws.I don't mind going to an indie film and being disappointed. The actors and directors and crew are probably getting their careers going and working on a shoestring budget. For a movie with this type of budget and hype I feel cheated along with disappointed. This movie is a painfully boring waste of time from the opening scene to closing credits. Sad to say that a preview of Hellboy 2 was the best part of AVPr and HB2 didn't even look that good.".

	schema:headline " This movie is a waste of time and money!";
	schema:reviewBody "My qualifications for this review? I own all the Alien and Predator movies  I have and have read almost all the books I can find that are related to this series.I can safely say this movie is a Stinker. Save your money  don't waste your time. If you like mindless action mindless gore no plot to speak of  like being taken by Hollywood see the movie.If you are a serious Alien series fan send a message to the over stuffed over paid suits in Hollywood  20th Century Fox  don't give them a penny.This movie has so many plot holes in it you could sieve pasta through it. Read the other negative reviews to get the big picture it has all be said accurately so I don't have to repeat them.The characters in this movie are cardboard. You want them all dead. And the movie doesn't disappoint almost all of them die. Even the hot bubble headed blond. Do you feel sorry for her? Nope. No plot no character development....who cares. The Predators are now idiots too. They scan everything but their own dead warrior. They are suppose to be a high technology society right? In the Predator movie they scanned the soldiers and the girl to determine who was armed. Trophy kills. In AvP they scanned Charles Weyland and let him go because he had Cancer. Major Plot hole!Also the R rating is because they have kids in the movie that get a face hugger lots of gore and violence and there is one hospital scene where a very large pregnant women is injected with chest bursters. She is implanted by the Hybrid Alien with 4 or 5 eggs in a mouthtomouth love sceneorgy and they all hatch in say 30 seconds. Sensational gore a plenty nothing more. These scenes are laughable not serious. It is almost like the violence happens and the Alien looks at the camera and waits for applause a thumbs up or a nod of some sort.The Aliens in this movie are all on performance enhancing drugs. They develop fast and spread quickly all over the town tons of them everywhere in record spawn time. Pathetic because it does not stick to the series story line and adds nothing to the Aliens Aliens Predator continuity.I have noticed the positive reviews are written by people who love the gore. Laughable. As a movie as a continuation of the Aliens franchise and the development of the Aliens vs Predator franchise this movie is a cheesecake clich at best. If you have faithfully followed this series all the rules are broken and the Aliens and Predators are reduced to comic book characters.There is not one fantastic memorable action scene. There are almost no special effects worth remembering. There are no brand name actors. The plot is as thin as onion paper that ultimately ends with a We have two choices to get out of this mess...The Hospital or the center of town!. I just about wet myself. The center of town means everyone is going to get nuked by Big Brother who somehow knows the town has been infested because they have an AWAC in the air that can see the infestation on a radar screen in special effects Red Spots. I just about fell out of my chair. Special effects red spot alien radar on an AWAC over middle America. I am splitting my gut laughing.Having to get to the Helicopter Pad made me choke on my popcorn. Has anyone played a game called ZOMBIES!? You have to get your playing pieces to the Helicopter Pad to win. I almost wet myself laughing.The ending is enough to make you shake your head in wonderment. Who did 20th Century Fox hire to write this script!? OH OH ask me.... a Grade 5 student. There really can't be any other answer. Oh yes there can be another answer... Low Budget Cheesecake SciFi.The ending? Col. Stevens takes the Predator pulse rifle to Ms. Yutani Francoise Yip. She tells him that the earth is not ready for the technology it represents. Col. Stevens knows Yutani doesn't want the technology to use on earth. You are kidding me right? Ms. Yutani? Who is Ms Yutani? forshadowWeylandYutani The Corporation She is in the movie exactly 2 seconds and yet in her infinite far east wisdom she says the world is not ready for the technology. Seriously??!! The Brothers Dweebs Strause as directors? Who is responsible for this hemorrhageabortion of a movie? They are the Doug and Bob McKenzie of directors and yet Fox entrusted the flailing Alien franchise to them. They are touted as special effects experts and yet the movie is all low budget special effects. Hmmm I see a pattern. Laughable.This movie is only made to empty your wallet. It serves no other purpose. It has no plot. It has no main characters worth mentioning. It is disjointed. It does not adhere to any of the character principles established in previous movies. It does nothing to advance the franchise. The special effects are lame minimal and low budget. And it has no ending to speak of. It is low budget and strictly designed to take your hard earned money. Nothing more.Save your money. Either watch it on TV where it will very quickly end up. Buy a bootleg or miss this bleeding ulcer altogether. There is a reason why Fox did not Preview this movie to the critics. The critics would have eaten this mess alive and no one would have gone to the theaters to see it. JR Giger the original creator is at this very moment leaning over a toilet spilling his lunch.20th Century Fox this movie is a stinker. It is as bad or worse than Alien 3. You insult us. Flush now...".

	onyx:emotionText "My qualifications for this review? I own all the Alien and Predator movies  I have and have read almost all the books I can find that are related to this series.I can safely say this movie is a Stinker. Save your money  don't waste your time. If you like mindless action mindless gore no plot to speak of  like being taken by Hollywood see the movie.If you are a serious Alien series fan send a message to the over stuffed over paid suits in Hollywood  20th Century Fox  don't give them a penny.This movie has so many plot holes in it you could sieve pasta through it. Read the other negative reviews to get the big picture it has all be said accurately so I don't have to repeat them.The characters in this movie are cardboard. You want them all dead. And the movie doesn't disappoint almost all of them die. Even the hot bubble headed blond. Do you feel sorry for her? Nope. No plot no character development....who cares. The Predators are now idiots too. They scan everything but their own dead warrior. They are suppose to be a high technology society right? In the Predator movie they scanned the soldiers and the girl to determine who was armed. Trophy kills. In AvP they scanned Charles Weyland and let him go because he had Cancer. Major Plot hole!Also the R rating is because they have kids in the movie that get a face hugger lots of gore and violence and there is one hospital scene where a very large pregnant women is injected with chest bursters. She is implanted by the Hybrid Alien with 4 or 5 eggs in a mouthtomouth love sceneorgy and they all hatch in say 30 seconds. Sensational gore a plenty nothing more. These scenes are laughable not serious. It is almost like the violence happens and the Alien looks at the camera and waits for applause a thumbs up or a nod of some sort.The Aliens in this movie are all on performance enhancing drugs. They develop fast and spread quickly all over the town tons of them everywhere in record spawn time. Pathetic because it does not stick to the series story line and adds nothing to the Aliens Aliens Predator continuity.I have noticed the positive reviews are written by people who love the gore. Laughable. As a movie as a continuation of the Aliens franchise and the development of the Aliens vs Predator franchise this movie is a cheesecake clich at best. If you have faithfully followed this series all the rules are broken and the Aliens and Predators are reduced to comic book characters.There is not one fantastic memorable action scene. There are almost no special effects worth remembering. There are no brand name actors. The plot is as thin as onion paper that ultimately ends with a We have two choices to get out of this mess...The Hospital or the center of town!. I just about wet myself. The center of town means everyone is going to get nuked by Big Brother who somehow knows the town has been infested because they have an AWAC in the air that can see the infestation on a radar screen in special effects Red Spots. I just about fell out of my chair. Special effects red spot alien radar on an AWAC over middle America. I am splitting my gut laughing.Having to get to the Helicopter Pad made me choke on my popcorn. Has anyone played a game called ZOMBIES!? You have to get your playing pieces to the Helicopter Pad to win. I almost wet myself laughing.The ending is enough to make you shake your head in wonderment. Who did 20th Century Fox hire to write this script!? OH OH ask me.... a Grade 5 student. There really can't be any other answer. Oh yes there can be another answer... Low Budget Cheesecake SciFi.The ending? Col. Stevens takes the Predator pulse rifle to Ms. Yutani Francoise Yip. She tells him that the earth is not ready for the technology it represents. Col. Stevens knows Yutani doesn't want the technology to use on earth. You are kidding me right? Ms. Yutani?

After making a pigs ear of AVP1 you hand direction for number 2 to what must be the two biggest boneheads in the film industry. Absolutely genius.These two Strand brothers couldn't organise a trip to the cornershop let alone direct a heavyweight scifi film. Together these total imbeciles have destroyed all future Alien or Predator variants and certainly damaged the preceding films for a lot of people anyway. The only way an Alien or Predator fan can protect the previous films in each series is to pretend this film has never happened. If you even imagine it as a stand alone movie it is so appallingly bad the taste it leaves in your mouth will last forever. It is so bad you cannot even watch for MST3000 style humour value. It really is a steaming dog turd of a film.Reasons without going into spoiler detail although how you 'spoil' a turd such as this is open to debate Plot inconsistency with previous Alien Predator and AVP films. The Strudel sisters must never have seen another film from the series but handed research over to some spotty 16 year old oik to do who evidently sat back getting stoned with his dweeby mates instead of checking out core facts about the universe of both entities.Laughable monsters. Not just bad FX but nonscary very thick monsters of both breeds not to mention the humans who are brain dead twits of the highest order one suspects in real life too  due to them acting so badly or even accepting such a dire script. Whereas both the alien and the predator are cunning and genuinely frightening creatures in previous movies including AVP1 to a certain degree the idiots depicted here are throwaway mindless cretins that bumble around the cardboard sets with no direction. Probably because the 'directors' cannot direct.No character development. All previous films in the franchises have a smaller number of human protagonists that have characters developed to a greater or lesser degree. Here we get weak watery eyed peabrains whose names you cannot even remember least of all care about their life expectancy.No strong plot yet loads of weak story lines. You cannot concentrate on the 'story' due to the fact it flits about from scene to scene without ever delivering a cogent thread to follow.Poor cinematography. You ended up bored witless staring at the exit light in the cinema for amusement rather than the screen that just flashes and jitters about like a very poor MTV music video.No real suspense. Instead of the nail biting suspense of Predator Alien Aliens et al there are moments that the directors evidently feel are 'pushing the envelope' more like pushing out a giant turd. The moments don't come across as sick frightening or suspenseful. More like the fake shocks of an unruly teenage punk who plays his Antinowhere League records too loud to annoy his middle class parents. Tiresome but never shocking.I can't be bothered to go on but see this film at your peril. It's a huge mound of faeces the Twit Twins have unleashed here and just remember...You cannot polish a turd.Ben".

Why is the Predator cleaning up all signs of his influence and than wasting precious time with eviscerating and even presenting the body of an insignificant human cop? Why is the Predator alone? Why is the Predator equipping himself only on earth but on his home planet? Why does the Predator make his job so uneasy for himself by hunting down the Aliens rather than bombing the whole countryside like the humans do in the end? Why is the Predator dropping more  more of his few weapons rather than collecting them to keep them together after using one. In the end he is even dropping his armor before fighting the Predalien in hand to hand combat what a bad plagiarism of the first predators final fight between Arny and the Predator. The Predator's gestures are so exaggerated that he is moving more like a Japanese sumo than like highly skilled extraterrestrialsafarihunter. As one can see immediately the whole story is a mess. But it gets even worse because this botchedup job is filled up with boring patchwork of senseless interludes like a lengthy pizza ordering episode or some detailed information about the criminal past of the two brothers Dallas  Ricky. The Sheriff is of course the friend of these two criminals who he puts regularly behind bars. not convincing  absolutely superfluous for the plot.In addition to that the cast of actors is horrible. Compared to the high class of directors  actors of the former Aliens or Predator movies AvP2 is an embarrassingly bad piece of crap.At last the action of the movie is really poor. There is not a single scene of action combat in which the audience can see the whole set. Each and every fight is filmed in short  shaky bursts with close up zoom at nearly full darkness. That results in an atrocious experience for the audience because one can mostly see nothing but a dark shaky screen.I suggest the two directing brothers Strause to buy themselves a steadycam and get a lesson in modern CG so that the next film contains some visible action of visible figures and might not need to disguise their bad directing abilities in such a manner.I would advise anybody even die hard AvP fans against watching this film prefer the first one or the original Aliens or the original Predator films but avoid disappointing yourself by wasting your precious time on this failure.".

	schema:reviewBody "If only I had read the review by Alex Sander sic on here rather than looking at the rating of over 6 from a select choice of the ignorant viewing public I would not have seen this desecration. Alien was a fantastic dramatic and well made horrorscifi. Predator was a great scifiaction messabout. I do really have only myself to blame though as I saw 'Alien versus Predator'. It too has an average grading of over 6 stars from the connoisseurs of film that frequent this site.STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVE ANY FEAR OF THIS EVER SO SUSPENSE RIDDEN PLOT BEING RUINED FOR YOU.Right from the beginning this film was ridiculous. No explanation was offered for the Predator ship overrunnot overrun by Aliens. OK so maybe they were again going to throw aliens down to Earth to hunt them and something went wrong but how did this result in an AlienPredator hybrid and why did the rest of the crew not realise sooner despite their great technology? The start was actually the most coherent and interesting part of the film because we had some idea of who was who or what was what and perhaps why. From then on it gets really ridiculous. I always leave my disbelief strictly suspended above the door of the screen before entering and collect it on the way out. I couldn't here.A father and son are hunting in the woods. The damaged ship crash lands to from the view given I would calculate at the very least 10 odd miles away through thick woodland. The man and boy track there alone and find the ship and get face hugged. Even at this point you feel very little for them mainly because the face huggers are almost comical rather than scary in their movement and actions and the father seems like such an irresponsible dumb redneck muppet.An edgy thrillertype scenario is introduced with an excon returning to the town near the crash site to be met by his somewhat emotionless dull now cop friend from the bus. When I say introduced I mean a feeble attempt with crap actors and no feeling is played out. A slasherhorror element is then introduced with a sexy girl and the usual supposedly nerdy or somehow undesirable cute guy who gets beaten up by the over protective crazy nasty Jock type American sportsman not a Scottish man. Oh the cutenot cute boy is the excon's brother by the way. Yes they're clever these director brothers whose name I will research in order to avoid any other shite they put out again. Then a modern role reversal oh so boring attempt at PC Ripley credential type character introduction comes with a female soldier returning home to her husband and child.Guess what happens next? I won't tell you much more about the actual smiles sadly to himself about the demise of storytelling in the large majority of recent films plot just in case you have got this far and are not the brightest star in the Alienridden universe.The Predator is stupid for the reasons stated by the previous poster whose post I read too late. The Aliens are boring. The PredatorAlien is ridiculous. The action is at times exploitative gratuitous disgusting nonsense. The hospital scene with the pregnant mothers?!?! Oh I was shocked alright. Shocked at how low some people will go to get what? A scare? Some shock? To titillate the perverse? What? If you really wanted to shock titillate and scare people who are not pregnant or expecting fathers or who have no souls why not just have the AlienPredator shagging the saucy women and teenage girls rather than killing them? The characters have no depth and neither does the plot. It's filmed and paced badly. It's acted by disinterested people not that I can blame them. It further tarnishes two rather interesting and good sets of scifi characters. This film was rubbish and if you gain enjoyment from it I really have to worry about you. If you haven't seen it then well please make your own decision.PS Did I even mention the way that trained soldiers are all killed in about 20 seconds while amateur civilians survive throughout?".

Now I've got those grudging comments out of my system...This movie reeks. The first one was at least mindless action that you could turn off your brain and enjoy things like the references to the other movies a little like the first Resident Evil film. Like the second RE film this is a diabolical mess of subDawson's Creek wangst and drama forgettable characters I confessed to my friend whilst watching that even a good hour in I had no idea of the character's names. And neither did they ridiculous special effects that looked like a bad video game terrible acting and a complete ignoring of what went before.The previous films tended to have real people as characters not stereotypes so you cared about their fates. The dialogue wasn't forced. And the alienspredators actually were SCARY. Now the humans are just targets the aliens are more like annoyances apart from to the woefully inept humans and the predators are useless without their big guns. All characterisation is out of the window there are painful additions to the franchise injecting chestbursters using mouth to mouth? The predator now being a totally inagile lunk? The predalien looking like a fanmade alien with a mushroom on its head? and the action scenes are muddled dark and badly edited.With so much material in the past twenty years to draw from I'm amazed this dreck got made. I actually had tears in my eyes a mix of laughter at the uselessness of the movie and the slaughter of two good franchises. And what was up with the repeated six or so shots of the cloaked predator slamming into the ground just to show he'd arrived? Or the acid blood not affecting him? Or the magic blue goo that dissolves entire bodies when applied only to a bit of them including clothes? Or... snip".

	schema:reviewBody "After waiting so long for this to come out and after all the hype and excitement I'm am extremely disappointed! So disappointed in fact that i am writing this after seeing the film 2 hours ago.Now I'm a great fan of movies I am also an easy person to please. I love loads of films own far too many and am afraid to say i like bad films too. I cannot see what's wrong with AVP I hear so many people complaints about it being terrible. When i think its one of the best it delivers everything except on the gore side of things. It didn't package itself as a serious film so stop complaining that its not as good as alien. I don't want a carbon copy of alien. While waiting for this to come out  expecting it to be excellent because people kept commenting on the Strause brothers being serious about aliens... well they can die. I was amazingly unimpressed... and that rarely ever happens! My problem with it was that i didn't feel like i came away with anything. What was the point? I didn't like any of the characters! They really didn't bother trying to make you like them either. The soldiermother and daughter characters didn't go anywhere the bad boy who comes back to town doesn't do anything bad. The only character I vaguely liked was Jesse and she dies. The editing was a bit to quick there weren't any moments to breathe and take in what had happen. It happened all at once. I also felt a bit confused during fight scenes and had to look away for a moment.The Predalien was very cool but void of much point It would have been nice if it had spread embryos and then triggered the next stage of it life cycle which was to be a queen according to the Strause brothers. Or maybe just include an ordinary queen? I would love to see the life cycle of a queen in a movie growing in size each time you see her. that would be cool!!!! The effects in this are brilliant no doubts there. The one thing you can say about previous alien and predator films is that they have always been character driven thats where the Strause brothers tripped up. Next time lucky I hope!!!! Or just get someone else!!!! I hope you like it and to the Strause brothers.... what the fk? I could do better!!! xxx".

	schema:reviewBody "Disgusting filthy sequel this movie sucks to excellent Paul W.S. Anderson AVP Alien vs. Predator. AVPR Aliens vs Predator  Requiem why is Aliens written? Why is Aliens written in the title? This completely destroys my intelligence. It is offensive movie Alien kills a poor little kids and he cocooned little baby's. The movie is boring I am sorry lame.This movie also copied the lines from Terminator 2 Judgment Day in which the actress playing Jesse Kristen Hager saying we are not going to make it that was the line from Terminator 2 Edward Furlong said that line.They stole another line get to the chopper Arnold Schwarzenegger says that in Predator. This movie stole the name Dallas from Ridley Scott's Alien. They stole the lines from Predator and name from the first Alien. The story is completely a mess and ridiculous it is boring it lacks it completely destroys the mythology and the story ark of Aliens. The CGI the design for xenomorph queen was awful mess. Ian Whyte as The Predator was horrible in this movie. You have unlikable cast you have no one. There is no one from characters likable or the hero. Dog Soldiers is MILES way better horror film that has a hero on the end and gets criticism and AVPR Aliens vs Predator  Requiem is better?They killed off Kristen Hager as Jesse one of my favorite characters and she was likeable by me. They killed off John Ortiz as Sheriff Morales and he was likable.The movie is so boring and forgettable that you can't even remember what it is. Predator did killed the sheriff's deputy in the woods but why would he skinned him alive? He did not come to hunt humans he went hunting Aliens not humans and the cop I don't think he had an gun by him. Alien and Predator are killing everyone in this movie. This is offensive so this movie is better than Predators? I don't think so. I would say Alien Resurrection was a much better movie than this peace a trash.The main hero what does he do? Dallas his brother Ricky Kelly and that guy Sheriff Eddie are running instead fighting. Alexa Woods in Alien Vs Predator choose a side and she fight against aliens that was great. Predator did not mark him self when he killed his pray alien like he did in AVP Alien Vs Predator. Predator was killing everyone the government killed inter city. Robert Joy from CSI NY played that colonel responsibly for killing innocent people. AVPR is the worst movie in the Alien franchise ever made. This movie sucks hard.".

	schema:headline " What a mess!";
	schema:reviewBody "When Aliens vs Predator 1 was released there was a lot of hype around the title fans were excited as a battle between two Alist classic scifi villains seemed like a dream come true However the film was seen to be a disappointment due to poor execution script writing camera angles and shots etc. The same fate befalls is the second instalment of the franchise.Anyone who is a fan of either the aliens or predator films like myself will most probably feel saddened when the credits roll.To put things into perspective take an unoriginal plot a director with a love for extremely low brightness levels a couple of classic antagonists a large splash of gore mix it all together and you have the recipe for Aliens vs. Predator Requiem.The plot doesn't really kick off at any point leaving the viewer waiting for something interesting to happen which unfortunately never occurs. It is also filled with plot holes and contradicts itself on a few occasions an example being that the predator uses a blue liquid to dissolve evidence so that the humans will be none the wiser but then happily kills a human he sees spying on him skins him and leaves him to hang upside down. This then alerts the authorities. Clever Boy!Another issue with the predator is that it is seen as the protagonist in some ways as the good guy the day saver. If you've watched predator 1 and 2 you'll know he clearly fails in the hero category. I know alien vs. predator one revamped the species lore but it feels as if the director throws in a few predatorhuman kills to try and show the viewer that the predator is still not your friendly alien like E.T.The first film portrays the predators as excellent skilled hunters where they bred aliens as game and hunted them in mass numbers but as soon as the hybrid emerges it outclasses the predators in strength stealth and dexterity. Predator lore tells that underneath its armour and without its weaponry it has similar strength to a human so really as the hybrid doesn't use any of the predator technology shouldn't the predator with his experience be able to dispatch the hybrid with relative ease? My main disappointment with this film however was the brightness levels. The film is almost all shot in the nighttime which is OK but the brightness levels are very low making it hard to see detail on the alienshybrid and sometimes the predator although he suffered from this much less. It leaves you wondering if the director deliberately did this to hide poorly made puppets from being seen in their full glory.This film has a fair amount of blood mutilations etc so gore lovers will not feel disappointed here.Overall if the alienspredators were not present in this film it would of got lower score their presence is what made me give it a 4. It's not a great movie not a good move for the franchise and a bit of a disappointment.".

Predator lore tells that underneath its armour and without its weaponry it has similar strength to a human so really as the hybrid doesn't use any of the predator technology shouldn't the predator with his experience be able to dispatch the hybrid with relative ease? My main disappointment with this film however was the brightness levels. The film is almost all shot in the nighttime which is OK but the brightness levels are very low making it hard to see detail on the alienshybrid and sometimes the predator although he suffered from this much less. It leaves you wondering if the director deliberately did this to hide poorly made puppets from being seen in their full glory.This film has a fair amount of blood mutilations etc so gore lovers will not feel disappointed here.Overall if the alienspredators were not present in this film it would of got lower score their presence is what made me give it a 4. It's not a great movie not a good move for the franchise and a bit of a disappointment.";

	schema:reviewBody "The worst movie in the AlienPredator categories. Due to the ending of the first AVP movie I was expecting a lot from this. I thought it is going to be great well designed work but after the first fifteen minutes I was so angry...There are three main problems make this movie dog food.Alien ship crashes. Predator generalbosslordsquirewhatever watching transmitted CCTV records of the ship on Predator's planet he saw the Predalien. He is in the hurry. The trouble is big. I was expecting he will call a few other welltrained Predators and they will go to Earth together. No this guy says NOTHING and goes alone. Okay I trust the guy he's going to do something extraordinary.Now he's on Earth in the forest where the ship went down. He makes a basic research in the ship then destroys the wreckage. Now it is clear for the audience probably he will destroy all the evidences. Then he's destroying corpses hit by the Alien. He's following them in the tunnel cleaning after them. Then once he runs into a policeman watching him behind. He kills skins the guy and pulls him up to a tree. That was when first I said to myself it's nonsense. He's so busy to hide everything then once he brutally kills someone and leaves the corpse where people will find it. The whole work before was waste of time. There were so many chances to make a good scene... e.g. The policeman's keep following him LONG TIME following him! He can see what he's doing and he has time to be in dread of Predator. Maybe the Predator can hear a noise in the forest on the front of him and he quickly turns the camouflage on. And now our guy is shaking getting swallowing he's fist Mother of god. The Predator is seeking on the front of him for the noise using the laser still in camouflage. Our guy's starting to lose selfcontrol Predator can hear our guy's movement. The guy is trying to keep himself behind the tree now the P. is seeking behind where our guy is. He can't see him yet because the tree. But our guy also can not see him in the camouflage. Predator is approaching the tree our guy is still behind the tree and trying to stay in the opposite side where he believes the Predator is. Then NOW the radio VERY QUICKLY the guy's keep turning scared he looks behind but somebody is already waiting there. And NOW comes a blade.This is the first main problem with this movie nobody is scared. Including the little approx. 6yearold girl who is actually a witness of her father's brutal murder? She sees AvP fights dead bodies a 'cheap woman' fixed to the wall by a star and there is no sign of mental trauma? If nobody is scared the audience is also not scared. If the audience is not scared in a horror movie the whole thing is waste of time and money.So Predator's moving on killing Aliens Predaliens by weapons by hands  either simultaneously then once he probably takes a look at his watch oops end is coming so now I need to drop weapons mask and he begins a fight by hand with  probably not the last  less significant Predalien. Why?This is second main problem in this movie nobody is thinking.Fights to fast too dark zoom is too in camera is switching positions too often opponents can not be tracked and distinguished well. When they're having a short break audience can maybe find out who got the last punch from the previous round.There is a young woman who decides a jump from a guy to another as monkey from tree to tree in the Jungle. Then she fires the guy reports it to the other one okay my now I am ready. Is it the accepted way as people are doing over there? Was it necessary to set these people in 'positive' role in a movie that millions will see?Then let's see the brutal scenes. Was it also really necessary to put pregnant women in a scifi horror movie and get killed like this?? Isn't there any feeling of human dignity too? Then the kid in the forest awfulHowever created this movie have a quite distorted vision or social ambient.And this is the third main problem the largest one in this movie creators are also not thinking  which can be the cause of its failure in my eye.This movie was a bin of rubbish I am not going to buy it on DVD and probably my friends are also included.There were 3 nice scenes too  but they're still not making this movie any better in my eye. The Alien and the father through the window the humaneatingAlien gets a pike in the head and the one at the power station Predator's walking on the bridge and the Predalien's following him quietly underneath.Avoid this movie.

Our human characters are caught in the middle of the intergalactic battle.The biggest problem with this movie is the pacing. This movie moves along way too fast. The opening credits have only just rolled and already the Predator ship crashes into the Earth after the Alien grows to full hight a hunter and son character are introduced but before we even get to learn their names they are both killed then we see the Predator homeworld and the lead Predator flies off to fight the Alien infestation and all this happens within the first five minutes. This unnatural pace does not let up for the entire movie the National Guard comes into town but within two minutes are all killed without even getting a good look at a single ones face the manager of a pizza store gets one scene of character development only to be killed off the very next time we see him once again without even learning his name random hobos a coffee shop waitress and chef are killed again without learning their names. One moment our main characters are at home the next running around town the next in a gun store  the next in an APC and this random set jumping over and over just doesn't ever let up leaving the audience no time to settle in leaving them grasping for straws.Another problem is the settings and time frame. The movie is set in modern day Gunnison Colorado. Every other Alien and Predator movie was shot in enthralling settings such as industrial space ships guerrilla war zone rainforest's alien planets and underground labyrinths. Now comes along AVPR set in a small modern day American town with set highlights including a sporting goods store parking lots Pizza Shops and little girl's bedrooms. I mean were they actually trying to make the movie look as dull drab and uninteresting as possible?! It's hard to perceive these monsters as frightening creatures when they are standing next to a shelf full of Reeboks or hiding in the bushes outside little girls bedrooms.Continuity is a big issue with this film. The Alien series was set in the future no human had even heard of an Alien before the first film and the Aliens not only had never been to Earth but if they ever did reach Earth humanity would be destroyed. This movie ruins that entire concept by being set in modern day with Average Joes seeing the Aliens all over the place and by the end of the movie humanity is not destroyed not even suffering what could be considered minor losses. It pisses all over that entire concept of the other movies. Attempts to maintain continuity are made with massive Deus Ex Machina's. The Predator just happens to carry around a bottle of unlimited magic blue liquid that's just to melt away any bodies with just a single drop the army at the end of the movie just happens to go to overly drastic measures and drop a nuclear warhead that just conveniently erases all evidence of the Aliens existence despite the fact there were many survivors of the incident who are witnesses and many more bad attempts are made at filling up impossible to cover plot holes.Also for a Verses movie it has unrelenting bias in favor of the Predators. For the majority of the film a lone Predator manages to kill dozens if not tens of dozens of Aliens all at mle range while barely gaining a single scratch while the Aliens just get slaughtered left right and center like clay pigeons merely waiting their turn to be killed by the Predator without putting forth any effort to defend their selves. This movie should not be called Alien vs. Predator as much as it should be Predator massacres Aliens. I mean how can you have two species battle it out with suspense and tension when one is portrayed as being vastly superior to the other? The characters in this film are amongst the biggest flaws. Not only do they pale in comparison to the characters from the previous Alien and Predator movies but even as a stand alone movie they are bland dreary and even at times cringe worthy. The characters in this movie consist of I kid you not horny couples wanting to get laid pizza delivery boys blonde bimbos high school bullies children and a blatant copy and paste job ripping off Ripley and Newt the worst and most clich possible ideas for characters. Not only that but all of the aforementioned characters are acted by teenagers. While the casting of teenagers is an obvious attempt to pull in younger audiences its only effect is to make the movie look and feel like a typical teenybopper slasherporn movie with actors who are too young to have learned how to give a convincing performance with them mostly having completely blank facial expressions delivering monotone dialog. Not only this but these characters do some of the most cinematically retarded things ever such as using Predator guns commenting the powers out when it has been for hours following dumb plans to get out of town rather than just walking out of town somewhat quickly and just so many other idiocies that the movie actually had the audience in my theater sighing out of frustration.In the end this movie is just a horrible B movie something deserving of the direct to DVD category. The fact this movie was a theatrical release astonishes me as every part of the movie just ranks of amateur work.".

	schema:reviewBody "9 stars out of 10 seems pretty ridiculous for a movie that has the most threadbare of plots and the most twodimensional of characters. Make no mistake AvPR is a terrible terrible film.But it is an AWESOME movie. Anyone who goes to this expecting anything other than absolute mindless relentless carnage deserves what they get. Those of you who really just wanted to see a movie with aliens and predators wrecking crap and each other will have a blast.The movie is a checklist of clichs gimmicks and devices. But more than that it's a checklist of all the superficial crap fans want to see. Ever wonder if an alien's retractable jaws can punch through a safety helmet? NOW YOU KNOW! There is no logic or sense rhyme or reason to this movie. But it IS loaded to the gills with violence. It's ridiculously overthetop gloriously violent. Every time you get sick of the plot or characters something dies. Even if you count JUST kids in the movie there are still five kills counting kids in utero at least alone. Let me be clear they killed pregnant women and children. It is hilariously cartoonishly violent.This is the Looney Tunes of the Alien and Predator franchises. It is modern grand guignol. It is GLORIOUS.".

Make no mistake AvPR is a terrible terrible film.But it is an AWESOME movie. Anyone who goes to this expecting anything other than absolute mindless relentless carnage deserves what they get. Those of you who really just wanted to see a movie with aliens and predators wrecking crap and each other will have a blast.The movie is a checklist of clichs gimmicks and devices. But more than that it's a checklist of all the superficial crap fans want to see. Ever wonder if an alien's retractable jaws can punch through a safety helmet? NOW YOU KNOW!

First  friends neighbors just ordinary people. Second  mother and daughter. Third  generations conflict. And in the third story Muratova is a cowriter alienation achieves the extreme degree  old handicapped intelligent man and little healthy ordinary girl. The key to the whole movie is a scene between two old women  mother and daughter  in the second story. The only people in the film who REALLY WANT to hear DO care but they just CANNOT reach one another. Muratova's directing Tabakov and Makovetzkiy's acting and cinematography forgot the guy's name  surely the best of recent Russian movies.My rating is 100 of 10!PS. Watch undubbed!".

I can't do it justice. Just see the movie. The cast includes many of my alltime favorites including Dick Van Dyke Bob Newhart Tom Poston Barnard Hughes and Jean Stapleton. You'll see a lot of people you recognize from other movies and sitcoms of the 1970s including many who turned up on All In The Family and other Lear shows. Cold Turkey is also the best movie showcase for possibly the greatest comedy team of all time. Bob  Ray are brilliant satirizing newscasters of the time like Walter Cronkite David Brinkley Paul Harvey and Hugh Downs. If you're not a Bob  Ray fan hopefully this movie will make you one. Randy Newman's soundtrack is terrific. If it ever came out on a CD I'd buy it in a heartbeat. And it helps that the movie which is set in a small Iowa town was actually filmed in a small Iowa town rather than some Hollywood backlot. It gives the movie a feeling of authenticity. This movie should have been on the AFI 100 Best Comedies list. See it.".

Filmed in Iowa in 1969 and released to the theater in 1971 the comedy is timeless. I have the laser disc it is not available on DVD as of yet but is available on VHS video tape. Barnard Hughes gives the performance of his career as Dr. Proctor the town surgeon and doctor who is a chain smoker. The best scene in the film is when Dr. Proctor is in the operating room with a cigarette and Dick Van Dyke and friends are trying to convince him not to light up because the town will not get the 25 million dollars for everyone not smoking for thirty days if he does. Then Walter Chronic appears in the operating room under a round light which is made to look like a halo. Pippa Scott is Dick Van Dyke's long suffering wife. Graham Jarvis is President of the Christopher Mott Society a takeoff on the John Birch Society. Tom Poston has a small but important role as the town drunk Mr. Stopworth. Dick Van Dyke is the preacher at the Eagle Rock Community Church who almost single handedly whips the town into action. Edward Everett Horton in his final screen appearance as Hiram Grayson head of the Valiant Tobacco Company. Bob Newhart in a somewhat unusual role as the villain from the tobacco company who is trying to win the bet with the town. An early vehicle for Norman Lear this movie foretold his eventual success later. The old lady who is so cantankerous is priceless. Comedians Bob and Ray play numerous news anchors of the time. Vincent Gardenia plays the towns Mayor. I have seen this film many times. I recommend watching it if it comes on TV or buying the video tape if you come across one.".

Does Big Tobacco not want anyone to see this? I understand this is a niche film but c'mon surely there is a small distributor willing to pick up the rights and get this into the hands of the people? Dick Van Dykes name alone should be enough to warrant a release along with Bob Newhart and Norman Lear. I guess that unless there are some big firey explosions or gratuitous nudity not that there's anything wrong with thatthen something isn't worthy of a DVD release. This is a wellacted and scripted satire of the culture of smoking and gives great insight into how smoking was treated 35 years ago.".

	schema:reviewBody "Never was the human limitations tested as they were in this film when the town of Eagle Rock Iowa must quit smoking for 30 days to win a foolish challenge proposed by a big tobacco company. As Parent Trap became a strange testimony on how divorce affects children so has Cold Turkey become a statement on addiction and withdrawal with humorous results.Dick Van Dyke is the town minister who finds himself caught up leading the fray first he must develop an addiction then join his neighbors in quitting. Barnard Hughes is the town doctor who cannot quit smoking at all. The fight with his wife over the ashtrays in the car brings a smile to my face everytime.  Bob Newhart is the tobacco company representative who must now get someone to start smoking so they will lose the bet. Pippa Scott is Van Dyke's wife Natalie who endures some of the most verbal spousal abuse laced with concern and mock sincerity There's a demon in you Natalie. Why are you working against me Natalie? that I have ever heard. Scott only has one scene with dialogue. Jean Stapleton Vincent Gardenia Paul Benedict Barbara Cason Tom Poston and Graham Jarvis also appear in various roles. And yes Bob and Ray spoof many of the newscasters who were popular at that time with hilarious results. They do it so well and are both so unassuming you will not realize it is the same two guys over and over again. But the town's withdrawal is hysterical as well. I will always love when the crossing guard screams at the little girl. And the auto smashup that happens just before the dogkicking incident will hold your undivided attention. Finally the town council is told if they can wait another day or so the president of the United States himself then Richard Nixon will present Eagle Rock with the prize money. The council's reaction is absolutely brilliant. Add to all of this a typical Randy Newman song 'He Gives Us All His Love' played at the beginning the end and when Dick Van Dyke realizes the town is caught up in its own celebrity as he watches over a dozen children run by wearing masks of his own face. They just don't make films like this one anymore.".

This poking fun at the smoking and other related habits of a small time are priceless. the on top of that parodying of smoking is the lampooning of a small midwestern town that is suddenly thrown into the national spotlight. The acting and comedic timing are greatby a group of actors who we have seen in a bunch of different movies and tv shows. the story is well done and taken from a true story. This is one of Norman Lear's best. It has to rank with the best of his best t.v series's for comedy. The little old lady who says bullshit and has the gun Barnard Hughes' desperate for smoke Doctor and Tom Poston drunk definitely steal the show. This movie will make you laugh until you not only cry but almost wet your pants. How many of us know people that we have seen give up or try and give up smoking. This is a classic. I do not think the movie could ever be remade because the times were different and because of all the political correct BS of today.Cold Turkey captures all of the little quirks of a small towns characters as well as the oddballs in town trying to quit smoking for one month. I'm laughing out loud just thinking about some of Cold Turkey's scenes right now and believe me there are plenty. From Dick van Dyke's frequent daytime visits home to be with his wife Jean Stapleton's overeating The little old lady saying bullshit Barnard Hughes's pulling out his cars backseat to find a cigarette and later needing a pacifier the choir singing for the t.v. camera and one member not singing the party at the beginning and the coughing the next day Cold Turkey is one funny moment to another. Don't just rent this buy it. I did. It a shame there aren't more parodies like this movie. Or at least ones that work as well as Cold Turkey.

The evercunning Newhart is in his best form ever and Tom Poston's few lines are enough to keep you laughing for days.Overall we see two sides of human nature 1 when people try to stop smoking for 30 days... and how their relationships degrade and 2 when big media comes to small town America complete with Brinkley and Concrite knockoffs and the impact on rural life and strife given the circumstances  especially in church services.This is a must rental a pilgrimage should be made to Eagle Rock every five years or so. It is a fun film funny unpredictable and surprisingly relevant. It's amazing to look back and see how much has changed and yet how much has not.SHOULD'VE BEEN IN AFI'S TOP 100 COMEDY MOVIES!!!".

Although the Vietnam War was still going on  and still the focus of national attention  director Lear wisely avoids any mention of it and thus any use of it for political purposes he chooses instead to concentrate on how Americans of that period saw themselves  in other words what most Americans thought was good about America not any of the social issues that were dividing the country at the time.Well but what is this good about America that the film lampoons so unrelentingly? Most Americans think they have a religion  even though their ministers prefer showing up on the cover of Time magazine to living a good life. Most Americans believe TV newscasters keep them informed even though they know that those people are just entertainers really reading script written out for them that may or may not actually have something to do with current events. Americans want to believe that they are politically committed to some important cause or other  but they can get hysterical over matters as trivial as someone lighting up a cigarette.The fact is American morality is just a big balloon  it looks impressive but it's all hot air.I should point out that satire can frequently be put to use to help with the improvement of social life by pointing out attitudes that need changing  and balancing this film off against Lear's television shows there's little doubt that such is the case here. If the film still seems vicious  and it does  it's because Americans haven't yet stopped to think through the consequences of their attitudes  such as the thousands dead in Iraq or the continuing misery of the poor.I certainly hope the day will come when I can look back at Cold Turkey as a relic of the past with nothing more to say. Sadly that is not yet the case. America still looks and sounds pretty much like this today and so the satire remains as potent as when this film first came out.Oh yes and it is also VERY funny.".

	schema:reviewBody "The idea for Cold Turkey was a good one and it had a lot of potential. It could have been a firstrate satire but instead we have a film that goes part way and then losses its steam. So it comes off like a lighthearted soap opera. The film has a few good laughs but as another reviewer noted it begins to wear thin. It's too long for the content. Had there been more meat with the potatoes it could have become a fullscale satire. I'll grant that it starts in that direction but most of the film is obvious and repetitious. Great satire sneaks up without warning and sometimes doesn't make much of a noise. It comes out in witty dialog or clever scenes that we viewers don't expect. But this plot with all the buildup and TV coverage as part of the story leaves little room for anything surprising. So instead it seems like tongueincheek preaching to the audience. It tells us that this is dumb that these people are in denial the pastor is a hypocrite the people are just grubbers etc. Those who think this is great satire should watch masterful examples. Start with Dr. Strangelove The Mouse that Roared The Great Dictator and Ninotchka. Then see how this movie stacks up. There can be no real comparison. For the parts they had to play most of the cast are OK. Dick Van Dyke Edward Everett Horton and Tom Poston have been in much better comedies and roles than they have here. Again it's an idea with a lot of potential. Norman Lear just needed to be a little more creative and imaginative. One shouldn't announce that people are about to see a satire and then deliver them predictable bits and pieces. Without its comedic punch satire slips into lecturing and finger pointing. My five stars are for the idea a few laughs and the decent effort some of the cast put into their roles.".

	schema:reviewBody "TV legend Norman Lear 'All in the Family' 'Maude' 'Sanford and Son' etc. made this sole venture into feature filmmaking with this bright satire of then contemporary American society. It's a biting commentary on addictions in this tale of a tobacco company P.R. man Merwin Wren Bob Newhart who comes up with the idea to offer 25 million to any town or city whose citizens can quit smoking for 30 days. Confident that Americans are far too tied to their vices he believes that his company will never have to fork over the dough.But he didn't count on the tenacity of the small Iowa community of Eagle Rock who are marshaled into action by wellloved Reverend Clayton Brooks a charismatic Dick Van Dyke.Naturally things do NOT go smoothly. Tempers frequently flare up something fierce and citizens try to fill this temporary void in their routines by falling back on other vices like the act of physical love. And the weaselly Wren bends over backwards to try to sabotage the efforts of the Eagle Rock people when his peers voice their displeasure.What's really so effective about Cold Turkey is that it's so relatable. Any individual who's ever tried to kick a bad habit will see themselves in this story.But Lear and company take plenty of other shots too at the news media comedy team Bob and Ray have a field day making fun of various reallife newscasters the publicity machine profiteering and organized religion.The cast is full of familiar faces that generate some big laughs along the way Pippa Scott Tom Poston Edward Everett Horton in his final film Vincent Gardenia Barnard Hughes in one of the brightest touches he plays the town doctor who is the biggest smoking addict of them all Graham Jarvis Jean Stapleton Paul Benedict Peggy Rea Woodrow Parfrey M. Emmet Walsh Walter Sande and Harvey Jason. Newhart is great slimy fun as he tries his hardest to foil the townspeoples' efforts.Also noteworthy for its onlocation shooting and feel of small town America and for featuring the first movie score for the veteran composer Randy Newman.This viewer imagines that this is one of those movies that just looks better and better the more one watches it.Eight out of 10.".

Confident that Americans are far too tied to their vices he believes that his company will never have to fork over the dough.But he didn't count on the tenacity of the small Iowa community of Eagle Rock who are marshaled into action by wellloved Reverend Clayton Brooks a charismatic Dick Van Dyke.Naturally things do NOT go smoothly. Tempers frequently flare up something fierce and citizens try to fill this temporary void in their routines by falling back on other vices like the act of physical love. And the weaselly Wren bends over backwards to try to sabotage the efforts of the Eagle Rock people when his peers voice their displeasure.What's really so effective about Cold Turkey is that it's so relatable. Any individual who's ever tried to kick a bad habit will see themselves in this story.But Lear and company take plenty of other shots too at the news media comedy team Bob and Ray have a field day making fun of various reallife newscasters the publicity machine profiteering and organized religion.The cast is full of familiar faces that generate some big laughs along the way Pippa Scott Tom Poston Edward Everett Horton in his final film Vincent Gardenia Barnard Hughes in one of the brightest touches he plays the town doctor who is the biggest smoking addict of them all Graham Jarvis Jean Stapleton Paul Benedict Peggy Rea Woodrow Parfrey M. Emmet Walsh Walter Sande and Harvey Jason. Newhart is great slimy fun as he tries his hardest to foil the townspeoples' efforts.Also noteworthy for its onlocation shooting and feel of small town America and for featuring the first movie score for the veteran composer Randy Newman.This viewer imagines that this is one of those movies that just looks better and better the more one watches it.Eight out of 10.";

And even the most rabid of Star Wars fans would have to concede that the movie is certainly not anything spectacular. It's fairly charming and reasonably amusing but never really riotously funny. But it works. More or less.The movie is set in the autumn of 1998 a time before Jar Jar Binks had been foisted upon the world. Four friends major Star Wars geeks all decide to drive across the country break into Skywalker Ranch and steal a rough cut of The Phantom Menace. The major motivation for this journey is that one of the friends has cancer and will not live to see the movie released. But once that is established the cancer storyline is basically put on the back burner and this turns into a mostly predictable wacky roadtrip comedy. Some of the wackiness works some of it falls flat. There are a bunch of celebrity cameos thrown in some of which are inspired and some of which are rather random and pointless. So it's a movie which has its ups and downs. But it's enjoyable more often than not and the movie breezes by in a nice tight wellpaced 90 minutes.None of the actors playing our gang of four really stand out in any memorable way. Dan Fogler's character is a little more outrageous than the others but that's about it. But the group works together well and they are ably supported by the varied cast of characters who pop up throughout. Seth Rogen's portrayal of a pimp is one of the standouts. Of course this ode to Star Wars fans wouldn't be complete without taking some shots at Trekkies. So there's room for another funny turn by an actor portraying Admiral Seasholtz an uberTrekkie. Who is the unrecognizable actor memorably bringing this character to life? You may have to wait until the closing credits roll to figure it out. And in this Star Wars geek universe there's room for one girl and Kristen Bell is both charming and funny in the role as her character gets swept along for the ride. Could the movie be a little more consistently funny? Most definitely. But the movie about Star Wars geeks will probably leave you with a smile on your face. Especially if you're a Star Wars geek yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here is a film for the Star Wars geeks out there and only them. The story follows a group of five Star Wars obsessed friends in 1998 setting off on their own journey across the country to break in George Lucas's ranch and steal a copy of PHANTOM MENACE for an early screening. The original motivation for the endeavor is that one of the friends Linus Chris Marquette has cancer and might not be around for it's theatrical release. It's a nice touch that could've added extra meaning behind the crazy plan of breaking into Lucas's home but unfortunately its a fact that's breezed over and rarely mentioned over the course of the film. There had been reports of consistent trouble in the postproduction process and studio interference that resulted in a lot of the cancer subplot being removed if so that's a shame because I think it could've only strengthened the plot putting more meaning into their drastic actions.Nearly all of the humor in the film is related to the original epic trilogy and while casual fans will understand a good deal of the references I'm sure even more of the jokes will go right over their heads. A lot of the laughs come from throwbacks to iconic moments the malfunctioning hyperdrive on the FalconHutch's lightspeed on the van failing to function and from the cameos scattered throughout the movie. All the best parts of the film are from the cameos dropping by in every other scene Danny Trejo Seth Rogen in not one but three bit parts Ethan Suplee Kevin Smith Jason Mewes and a few key cameos that I'm not going to spoil here for those who plan to see the movie the best being the inside man who supplies the information to get into Lucas's ranch.The cameos really steal the show in this movie and there's practically one in every other scene but the core cast certainly does a great job on their own. The central group of actors do such a good job and appear to be having so much fun that I wouldn't be surprised if they were Star Wars geeks offset as well. It was a good idea casting actors who could almost be considered unknowns most of them recognizable for past projects but far from being big names with exceptions. Sam Huntington is the team's straightman Eric who abandoned his friends after high school in favor of a job with his father's used car lot. Chris Marquette is Linus the cancerstricken friend providing the backbone for the whole motivation of the film despite his cancer subplot being brushed under the carpet his longstanding disappointment with Eric over giving up on their dream to start their own comic remains as the main point of contention to add some sort of conflict to their trip. Dan Fogler is easily the funniest cast member as the friend who continues to live in his mom's garage sorry carriage house and has the soupedup Star Wars van complete with R2D2 poking out the top. Finally Jay Baruchel as bernerd Windows and Zoe Bell as the fangirl with an attitude round of the rest of the team.The movie is funny but the problem lies in that it targets a niche audience. People who aren't at least casual fans of the Star Wars movies might watch this and wonder what everyone else is laughing at. It's funny enough for us fans though that it makes for an entertaining movie the first time through but repeated viewings don't stand up as well because the cameo surprises are old news and the trivia moments don't hold up.".

	schema:headline " A movie made for Fanboys";
	schema:reviewBody "An easy way to measure how much you will or won't enjoy Fanboys is how closely you fit to the titular category. The more of a Star Wars fan you are and the more your gender and maturity is on par with 'boy' the more you'll like this ode to Star Wars fans.The premise of this film is excellent In 1998 six months before the scheduled release of Star Wars Episode I a group of fanboy friends in their 20somethings road trip to Skywalker Ranch to try and steal a rough cut of the movie because one of them has a terminal illness and won't live to see the release. The execution however is spotty.The movie is a Star Warsthemed version of Road Trip with the guys heading across America in a van and stopping along the way solely to buy some time before they get to the ranch. My guess would be that Ernest Cline and Dan Pulick are fanboys themselves who came up with the premise of stealing Episode I and then had to find a way to actually make it work. Therefore the guys stop off in Iowa where the character of Captain Kirk from the Star Trek franchise was born to antagonize some Trekkies they get caught at a gay biker bar and they have to go to Las Vegas to get security clearance to the ranch from an insider.The main character and the story are not all that strong but the small tributes spoofs and cameos all related to the Star Wars universe is what makes Fanboys entertaining. Therefore the more you know Star Wars  things like thermal detonators and that Chewbacca is from Kashik  the more you love Fanboys.In addition to appearances from a few notable actors from the Star Wars franchise director Kyle Newman does some nice homages to Lucas and obviously Star Wars. The infamous side wipes that Lucas uses to transition in those movies appear a couple times and the security at the ranch resemble the ones from THX 1138 one of Lucas' first movies although that might just be the truth who knows. The writing also does this too including famous quotes when appropriate and even the movie's funniest scene when the gang ends up in George Lucas' trash compactor. Other cameos include Seth Rogen Billy Dee Williams and Kevin Smith to name a few without spoiling one of the film's few excellent aspects. Stars Sam Huntington Superman Returns the rotund Dan Fogler Balls of Fury Jay Baruchel Knocked Up and Chris Marquette The Girl Next Door are all average though mostly because their characters are written sloppy.Bottom line is Fanboys states in title alone exactly who it's intended for. I don't know why Harvey Weinstein would fight to try and make this something that would appeal to the masses only to let it come out without making a peep. If Star Wars is going to be the focus of a movie there's one segment of the population that will like it no matter what you do. Fortunately for those fans Fanboys is good.

	onyx:emotionText "An easy way to measure how much you will or won't enjoy Fanboys is how closely you fit to the titular category. The more of a Star Wars fan you are and the more your gender and maturity is on par with 'boy' the more you'll like this ode to Star Wars fans.The premise of this film is excellent In 1998 six months before the scheduled release of Star Wars Episode I a group of fanboy friends in their 20somethings road trip to Skywalker Ranch to try and steal a rough cut of the movie because one of them has a terminal illness and won't live to see the release. The execution however is spotty.The movie is a Star Warsthemed version of Road Trip with the guys heading across America in a van and stopping along the way solely to buy some time before they get to the ranch. My guess would be that Ernest Cline and Dan Pulick are fanboys themselves who came up with the premise of stealing Episode I and then had to find a way to actually make it work. Therefore the guys stop off in Iowa where the character of Captain Kirk from the Star Trek franchise was born to antagonize some Trekkies they get caught at a gay biker bar and they have to go to Las Vegas to get security clearance to the ranch from an insider.The main character and the story are not all that strong but the small tributes spoofs and cameos all related to the Star Wars universe is what makes Fanboys entertaining. Therefore the more you know Star Wars  things like thermal detonators and that Chewbacca is from Kashik  the more you love Fanboys.In addition to appearances from a few notable actors from the Star Wars franchise director Kyle Newman does some nice homages to Lucas and obviously Star Wars. The infamous side wipes that Lucas uses to transition in those movies appear a couple times and the security at the ranch resemble the ones from THX 1138 one of Lucas' first movies although that might just be the truth who knows. The writing also does this too including famous quotes when appropriate and even the movie's funniest scene when the gang ends up in George Lucas' trash compactor. Other cameos include Seth Rogen Billy Dee Williams and Kevin Smith to name a few without spoiling one of the film's few excellent aspects.

	schema:reviewBody "I write this review as a guy that was a kid during the Star Wars hype in the late 70's and early 80's. I can quote all of the Star Wars movies and understood all of the references to them in Fanboys. The bottom line is that while this movie has some fun moments overall it is pretty boring. This is largely because the humor isn't inventive and outside of some cameo appearances the performances are entirely uninspired.The main approach to humor here is essentially showing a group of awkward nerds injecting uncomfortable displays of Star Wars fandom into nearly any social situation imaginable. This bit has been achieved to greater effect with many other movies in the past the only new thing in this movie is the All Star Wars All The Time bit. Sure they got in a lot of obscure original trilogy references but citing pop culture for its own sake is only so funny. Note the miserable failure of movies like Epic Movie. You just require more than these references.The various plot points are completely uninspired and unoriginal. We've seen the awkward internet girlfriend meetup before but it was funnier in Napoleon Dynamite. We've seen the nerd that is too dense to notice the girl right in front of him but is blowing it but it was funnier in Sex Drive. And not only are all these plot conventions unoriginal but they are executed so poorly in this movie they hard seemed worth including in the script.The best parts of the movie are some of the clever cameos. William Shatner steals the stage with his 2 minutes of screen time though the funniest moment in the whole movie is a super brief appearance of Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes and the punch line had nothing to do with Star Wars incidentally. A notable appearance by Seth Rogen is also amusing mostly because he gives his little cameo everything he has and seems to have a lot of fun with it. But the cameo appearances aren't frequent enough to float the movie and leaves a lot of dry periods where the film simply crawls.And perhaps another small grievance is that the only nerd girl in the movie happens to be super hot while all the guys are doofs. Why couldn't the nerd girl be a doof too? What do they really achieve making this super hot girl fall for Poindexter just because he's a nerd? It just seems like an awkward casting decision in the middle of a movie full of awkward direction choices.I guess if you identify with Star Wars nerds you will at least enjoy parts of this movie. If you just want to see an awkward comedy about nerds making fools of themselves you can do a whole lot better than this.".

It just seems like an awkward casting decision in the middle of a movie full of awkward direction choices.I guess if you identify with Star Wars nerds you will at least enjoy parts of this movie. If you just want to see an awkward comedy about nerds making fools of themselves you can do a whole lot better than this.";

	schema:reviewBody "Well it was a great idea. It showed promise. Four friends that are Star Wars fanboys set off on a self discovery cross country trip to Skywalker ranch to see Episode I before it opens.The main problem with this movie is that it really doesn't hold up together. The actual emotional storyline looks like it was shoehorned in the script and feels disjointed. The performances are decent but none of the leads have that sense of comedy where they can improve their lines and make them funnier. Most of the cameos don't really work with Billy Dee Williams and Carrie Fisher looking more like frustrated yesteryear actors than genuine characters. The campfire scene with Danny Trejo is an instant Big Lipped Aligator Moment which really serves no purpose to the story.The true asset of this film are the references. Going from quotes to scene remakes the movie is more of a test to see if you truly are a SW fan than an actual comedy. The nonSW jokes seem like they ran out of creativity most of them are predictable and when they come out the chuckle comes mostly by obligation. Still my favorite scene is the confrontation with the Trekkies with some of the best geek jokes ever.The music from the film is really subpar. One might feel tempted to decry the absence of any of Star Wars themes though with the indie movie's budget it would have been impossible. But given the premise of the film and their absolute adoration to the franchise it's rather insulting that none of the characters ever even mentions the music.As an overall product it's a flawed indie movie. Perhaps they could have used some input from other more comedy inclined writers and it would have worked.Given the fact that referencing Star Wars has made TV shows like The Simpsons Family Guy Robot Chicken and Spaced even funnier it's so appalling to know Fanboys isn't really funny.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sam Huntington plays what may be the lead role in the otherwise ensemble Fanboys not the friend who has been given four months to live but the guy inheriting the father's business and facing a future he equates with the dark side not unlike George Walton Lucas Jr who did not want to simply inherit his father's stationery store. Huntington also appeared as the lead in another ensemble road movie Detroit Rock City where he was under the thumb of a domineering religious mother. That film was released in 1999 a year after Fanboys begins its story.If you like Detroit Rock City chances are Fanboys will appeal as well. Instead of KISS these characters are obsessed with Star Wars in a period where there wasn't as much need to qualify those words. One of the guys happens also to be obsessed with the Canadian rock band RUSH. At first some references come from out of nowhere but they add a texture  people are going to like what they like. In both movies Huntington has a scene where he has to strip in a bar. It made more narrative sense in Detroit Rock City but at least he's not alone in the humiliation and one of his friends takes the brunt of it.I didn't have to be a hardcore fan of KISS to enjoy Detroit Rock City and likely people don't have to be fans of RUSH or Star Wars to enjoy Fanboys but it will help. I enjoyed where the RUSH music ends up being used and it helps put the viewer in the nostalgic mindset of well teens of the early and mid nineteeneighties  exactly the range of time 19821984 that four of the five guys were born Kristen Bell was born in 1980 so she's an Empire Strikes Back baby. Dan Fogler was born in 1976 a year before Star Wars itself but because he is heavy some in the audience may accept him as a childhood and high school friend of the others. His sensibilities are those of the director and at least one of the writers all born in 1976 or perhaps closer to people like myself who were fans in their early thirties when the notorious 1999 Star Wars prequel hit us. The characters do seem to show up at a party with teenagers and yet most own business. Ultimately they aren't meant to be flesh and blood. One happens to look like young George Lucas we've seen in file photos or from the funny short George Lucas In Love and Kristen Bell seems to have died her hair dark for one reason only to look more Leialike in a later scene. Seth Rogan plays three roles which helps reinforce the unreality along with cameos by Jay and Silent Bob Jason Mews and Kevin Smith along with Smith's documentary guy Zack who was known to like donkeys in Clerks II. Billy Dee Williams and Carrie Fisher also pop up in amusing cameos that allow us to assume the interior of Skywalker Ranch in act II of the story may not have to look and work as it does or did in reality. Much of Lucasfilm's operation has been moved to The Presidio property now. For all the amusement and invention and the heartfelt stakes at the heart of it with a friend's dying wish the movie is a little short sighted in the sense that these young men  characters in their late twenties or early thirties  often talk in outbursts more suitable for thirteenyear olds. There is an overthetop hatred between Star Wars and Star Trek fans when in reality whether we like one brand more than the other there is more audience crossover than polarity. For a comic book store owner to throw out a member of the competing fan base and call him a Kirkloving Spock sucker will play as offputting and mean even if it is a satirical exaggeration meant to expose the absurdity of the Trek versus Wars rivalry. Unlike Ebert I'm not bothered that the kid with cancer can participate in a fight since no extraordinary skill is displayed any more than the idea that he is walking around and simply taking his pills. It upholds the idea that genre trivia knowledge has an inverse relationship to carnal knowledge. The characters can be at once cool and pathetic or offensively immature and brilliant which are combinations many people like to pretend do not exist in reality. Overly sensitive audiences won't like this movie. There are bumps along the way but I like where it is going and it has a very appropriate ending line.Despite the very limited release of this movie and relatively little hype for the film itself as opposed to the internet controversy Fanboys lives up to the anticipation a lot of us may have built up unlike Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace. When movies about 911 come out many people coo too soon. Maybe ten years after we met Jar Jar Binks we can finally laugh at the summer of 1999. Or maybe the solution ended up being this temporal displacement of a story that is really about being stuck in the late 70's and early eighties whether we had been born then or not listening to RUSH and worrying only that Yoda sounds a bit like Sesame Street's Grover. Not an entirely unpleasant fog.".

	schema:reviewBody "Indeed it was. It was about the fans of Star Wars this film was practically made for Star Wars fans. It's such a shame that this movie didn't get a wider release across North America..a 6 million dollar budget and only got 760k in gross revenue.The director Kyle Newman is clearly a Star Wars fan and he knew what he was making. Ever since I saw the trailer for this movie on the Clerks 2 DVD I knew I was dead set on seeing this since day one. So I waited and I waited and I waited and well you get the point. The day finally came for me to see the movie. But not in theaters I waited for it to come to blueray.I felt really good after watching it. I was in such a great mood because of this film. I expected it to be funnier because it's a 2006 film that had so many readjustments to the script but I can understand where the director was going with this film.I had a good laugh at all the Star Wars oneliner references to the original trilogy and I never knew about Harry Knowles but it is true he really is a major fan. Apparently this plot of stealing the rough cut of The Phantom Menace is referenced to Harry Knowles at Aintitcoolnews.com for stealing the actual rough cut of Star Wars and posting it on his website. If he did that then shame on you Harry you're a thief I hope your website gets shutdown for good one day.Fanboys had one little flaw Seth Rogen playing the southern accent pimp who also happens to be a Star Wars fan. His character was really annoying in the hotel scene. But Kirsten Bell that hot beauty makes up for his parts we get to see her behind. He did play the Trekkie part very well though. It was spoton. I'm sure Trekkies all over are pretty angry but we all know STAR WARS IS BETTER THAN STAR TREK. Clearly. There was a scene of sadness in the movie near the end kinda tore me up inside. I couldn't relate to it but I do miss my old friends my first few friends that I used to spend weekends playing Nintendo 64 with and watching the latest Leslie Neilson movie. That's why this movie brings nostalgia into play. You can clearly see it in some of the set designs. The car that guys garage oops..sorry I meant carriage.The last line of the movie was pretty funny kinda bad to be put there and kinda good. It was bad because of all the events that lead up to the ending and it was good because it made fun of everyone who hated Episode 1. But it's kinda funny if you hated the first film which I didn't by the way. In the end result this movie gets a 1010 for originality and for appealing to not only Star Wars fans but anyone who still has love for the era they grew up in. This movie was for you and me. I'm proud to say that I can watch this movie again and again and still want to continue watching it again the next day. Go buy this movie if you don't have it it's worth the money and wait. Don't listen to the reviews especially the Ebert tools. I recommend this for everyone. It manages to have an original plot with some light humor but all that makes sense for the situation and a little sense of nostalgia in it.Kyle Newman if you're reading this you made a very good movie I hope you can make more films like this. This is one of those movies you should watch before you die clearly.".

	schema:reviewBody "I bought this and was so completely put off by it that I happily deleted it immediately after watching it. It is so bad that it is embarrassing and I shudder to think that poor George Lucas allowed them to film at the Skywalker Ranch. Maybe George is just getting old and sentimental.How could this garbage have been greenlighted and over 3 million sunk into it? What was there  a let's find some utterly pathetic script and make it into a movie freebie day at Triggerstreet? Did Kevin Spacey actually read this script and say  I know I have two academy awards and all but I really really want to put my name as producer on the worst film I can possibly that isn't porn with dwarfs and mechanical bulls. Well Kev  this is it. Go back to the theatre  where you can do little harm.The characters are offensive stereotypes not a single heartfelt emotion exists in the film even after putting in a character dying of cancer you find that out in the first ten minutes. He's lucky that he gets to die before the cheezy end but not so lucky that he doesn't have to go through most of the ridiculous film although he looks healthy and fit as a fiddle I might add with only a few months to live.I know that people think that nerds like this cannot possibly have real lives but many nerds do. They get married they have kids they even tend to have good jobs.

Fanboys even has that happen. .As a Star Wars and Star Trek fan I found it insulting. I did enjoy William Shatner's cameo because the Shat is the shezit. He was the best thing in the movie. They dusted off Billy Dee Williams wellpreserved and Carrie Fisher not so wellpreserved and I cannot believe that they stooped this low. Maybe they got to hang out together on the set and talk about when they made a really great film like The Empire Strikes Back.The film looks very much like some guys made it in their backyards for You Tube.It could have been done so much better if there had been a decent script without the gross unfunny jokes if the characters had not been cardboard cutouts with no depth or characterization if the film hadn't looked like it was shot with a handycam and if every onscreen moment had not literally been a smack in the face to fans of Star Wars and Star Trek.As it is  it belongs right in the Death Star trash compactor with the slime and the walls closing in.".

It is so bad that it is embarrassing and I shudder to think that poor George Lucas allowed them to film at the Skywalker Ranch. Maybe George is just getting old and sentimental.How could this garbage have been greenlighted and over 3 million sunk into it? What was there  a let's find some utterly pathetic script and make it into a movie freebie day at Triggerstreet? Did Kevin Spacey actually read this script and say  I know I have two academy awards and all but I really really want to put my name as producer on the worst film I can possibly that isn't porn with dwarfs and mechanical bulls. Well Kev  this is it. Go back to the theatre  where you can do little harm.The characters are offensive stereotypes not a single heartfelt emotion exists in the film even after putting in a character dying of cancer you find that out in the first ten minutes. He's lucky that he gets to die before the cheezy end but not so lucky that he doesn't have to go through most of the ridiculous film although he looks healthy and fit as a fiddle I might add with only a few months to live.I know that people think that nerds like this cannot possibly have real lives but many nerds do. They get married they have kids they even tend to have good jobs.

One of the 5 Linus is due to die in the next few months and it has been his lifelong dream to see star wars episode 1.

It was a pretty painful experience and not one I would recommend.If you are thinking about watching it even if you are a huge Star Wars fan just do yourself a favour and watch Episode 1 again instead. Episode 1 was pretty bad but this is a real stinker.It's no wonder at all that the studio sat on it for so long. Any rational person viewing it would immediately be aware that there is nothing at all of merit in this waste of celluloid.It's difficult to place the blame anywhere in particular as the product fails on every level.

That film is the latest in the Star Wars franchise Episode I. After one of the group takes sick it is nothing short of a moral imperative that the friends break into George Lucas' Skywalker Ranchi to watch the seminal scifi picture together before the film's actual release to the public.By now we have become inundated with Seth Rogen humor in a series of first run films. The movie feels a lot like Rogen humor only less refined. Which is what it is. Actually Rogen is in the film and plays Admiral Seasholtz and perhaps another character or two. Fanboys has had a wild ride as an indie film with the director traveling to multiplexes and comic cons to stir a fan base. The film has gone through some reshoots and reedits and comes out in limited release on February 6.Anyone who the film is really marketed to may have already seen this movie either at one of the many film festivals around the country or among the masses that attended Comic Con this year. There are some very funny and inspired moments in the film such as an outrageous brawl with some hardcore Trekkies but overall the film is a tad flat and slow at times. I laughed and for that I think the film is worth seeing somewhere. 610 The poster of hands holding a blue light saber towards space is great and one I will add to my collection. The inspiration for the poster concept or should I say copying is of the 1983 teaser poster for Return of the Jedi.

The first half does. The theme of interconnected stories is common in Czech films and not a bad one since this is a rather small country and what might be 6 degrees of separation in the US is more like 2 here but the story is simply boring. The lack of colour in the film expresses boredom. The funniest scenes are in the beginning but once they get to Brno boring. In that sense the film lives up to its title. By the end of the film I didn't really care about the characters. Life in Brno might be slow but not as slow as this film which was shot in Hradec Kralove".

	schema:reviewBody "If only for it's unusual cast this Civil War western revenge saga merits watching one time.  Unfortunately there isn't a great deal more about it to recommend as it is uneven and unsatisfying for the most part.

Soon after she leaves Hamilton and a cache of his men revolt and escape.  They capture Stevens and kick off a chase across the desert to Mexico with Ford in pursuit.  Of main interest is the oddball cast which includes Ford who at 51 sure was dragging his feet in marrying Stevens! Hamilton his tan completely in place and with his helmet hair and come 'n go accent a very unlikely Confederate prisoner of war! Baer jr giving quite possibly the worst performance ever captured on film as a lunatic soldier who giggles when killing and fights incessantly with everyone Armstrong trading in his sword and sandals Stanton longtime character actor who appeared in many cult favorites Peterson fourthbilled former child star who has little to do but represent innocence and Harrison J. Ford hardly onscreen as a heavily sideburned Union soldier.  The film starts out with an incongruent theme song which is abruptly cut short by the action of the plot.  This sets up a consistent pattern of odd music cuts and choppy editing the music in this film is FAR too overemphatic and insistent not to mention repetitive.  There are some okay action sequences and some decent scenery and occasional periods of dramatic interest.  They are often undone however by some really bad supporting cast members and awkward writing and direction.  There's a Union officer with a thick New York accent a pair of nitwit supposedly amusing but actually deadly unfunny soldiers who keep interrupting the drama with their awful shtick and then a passel of chatty cantina whores.  The all time worst acting honor though goes to Baer jr who is so relentlessly bad that it actually hurts to watch him.  He's a lunkheaded unbalanced giant whose penchant for violence is not as shocking as it is annoying.  The actor claims that playing on The Beverly Hillbillies typecast him but he seems here to be unable to play anything better.  The comic relief in the film which couldn't be any less amusing is at great odds with the rather visceral violence and cruelty of the rest of the film.  It's all put together so amateurishly and with so little regard for nuance or real feelings that it hardly matters.  Thus the opportunity to see some namecult actors in a tough little western remains the primary attraction.".

Glenn Ford is the top billed star but he disappears for almost the entire middle of the film and it's really George Hamilton and Inger's show.

George does fine as the Confederate soldier who can't face the war's imminent end since it has given him purpose and he has nothing to go back to. This was made towards the end of his short serious actor phase before he slipped into the overly tanned caricature he became and he gives it his best effort.Inger Stevens breathtakingly beautiful in the first of several westerns she made in the period between the end of her series The Farmer's Daughter and her too early death registers strongly as the missionary who is in love with Glenn Ford but must contend with her captive status against George and his increasingly unruly band of refugees. It also affords a chance to see several notable actors starting out. Max Baer of Beverly Hillbillies Jethro fame plays a total whack job with brio and Harry Dean Stanton shows up in a small part. Most surprisingly right at the top of the film is a baby faced Harrison Ford who vanishes after a few minutes. Not really a western nor a great film by any means but a decent effort if you like dramas set in the West.".

This mind you is after the escaping Confederates kill a dispatch rider bringing news of Lee's surrender at Appomattox.With the Civil War so close to an end it would have taken one charismatic leader to have kept those Confederates in line for this crazy mission.

You've got some real lowlife specimens on both sides Timothy Carey on the Union side and Max Baer Jr. on the Confederate. Both are really into combat and killing Baer who one remembers as the amiable dunce Jethro Bodine in The Beverly Hillbillies really surprises you with his role.

As he directed Western as Gunman's walk  They rode west Texas rangers Iroquois trail and Gansters genre or Noir films as Phoenix city story and Scarface mob . Failure alternated with hits through his career though Karlson's direction was more than successful in  Walking tall with invaluable help of Joe Don Baker . Rating  Acceptable Western  George Hamilton and Glenn Ford fans will enjoy their idols .";

	schema:reviewBody "Others have nailed it. It's the casting that makes this movie interesting. Makes it worth watching too. Many names here. Ironically Harrison Ford probably the biggest name of all when one takes the long view was an absolute total nonamed nobody in 1967. Glenn Ford was the only true Hollywood movie star in the cast although probably a little past his prime at this point. Meanwhile Paul Peterson Inger Stevens and even Max Baer Jr who were household names in 1967 might well have younger folks these days scratching their heads saying Who? But they were names then mainly TV names of the day but names nevertheless.Based on the inspired casting clearly somebody had some higher aspirations for this movie. Somebody was trying hard to inject superior production values into this project. Somebody wanted this to be a box office success maybe even a noteworthy film. But alas whatever it was something was lost along the way. We could speculate about it 41 years later try to pin it on somebody but why? No point to that. Suffice it to say that somehow somewhere before all was said and done it lost its edge. Another consideration is the year 1967. How could this offering ever hope to compete? As I've written elsewhere 1967 was the very best year ever for movies. The Graduate Cool Hand Luke In The Heat of the Night Guess Who's Coming to Dinner Bonnie and Clyde The Dirty Dozen. Remarkable films all. There might be one such notable movie of the caliber of those in any one year. Two would be better than average. But six in one year? Extraordinary indeed.The point is that 1967 was a remarkably good year for movies. Of course it's hard to flatly state that it was the very best movie year ever because how could one possibly measure that? It is based on pure opinion. But try this name another year that was any better than 1967. No can do. So this is the stuff A Time For Killing was up against as competition for the box office dollar back in 1967. It never really had much of a chance. In another year it might have fared a little better. But in 1967 it got lost.".

Oddly he has much more screen time than Ford though maybe that's for the best since Ford seems a bit bored and uninterested in the little we see of him. It's not like the script is inspired or anything giving us weak characters unfunny comic relief despite some brutality shown or implied several times and even offensive racial stereotypes. Not to mention an underwhelming ending that at the same time feels unfinished. The production quality is also surprisingly cheap and sloppy at times not just with some incredibly bad editing but with obvious postproduction shots and sequences shot in a studio instead of outdoors on location.

This is still worth taking a look at mostly because of all the great names involved Karlson Corman Glenn Ford Inger Stevens George Hamilton Harry Dean Stanton Dick Miller plus the already mentioned Harrison Ford.

	schema:headline " Confused Civil War Western.";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1865 somewhere out West around Las Cruces a band of Confederate prisoners led by George Hamilton escape from a Yankee fort with missionary Inger Stevens as hostage. They head for the safety of Mexico. They are pursued by a unit of Federal soldiers led by Major Glenn Ford. By the time the end rolls around all the men of both sides have either been killed or have run away except for Hamilton and Ford who shoot it out over the outraged honor of Inger Stevens.Now there's a certain dramatic potential in a story like this and the director Phil Karlson who has done some brutal work elsewhere starts it off well. In the opening scene a rebel prisoner has killed a guard while trying to get out and he is about to be shot by a firing squad. But the end of the war is near. Everyone knows it. And the squad balks. So the Commanding Officer turns the rifles over to the Colored Troops as they were called and orders them to fire at the prisoner. The nervous squad of exslaves has never handled rifles before and mostly they miss. The wounded prisoner cries out I'm still alive. They reload and fire. Once again they only wound the tortured man who screams and laughs. The scene is excruciating.From there on it's pretty much downhill. The usual problem is that clich is piled upon clich. Here it's that the narrative itself falls apart not so much because the conventions are too strictly observed but because the writers seemed to be seated on a runaway wagon.That Southern Captain  Hamilton  is a proud man and a determined one. This war will never end he mutters several times a gentleman warrior. Yet when he's alone with Inger Stevens he slaps her around rips her dress off runs his spur along her naked flesh and savagely rapes her. Whose breath blew out the light within this brain? But then nobody's motivations are entirely clear. They aren't ambiguous as they are for you and me. They're muddled and conflicting and almost drawn up in order to suit the demands of the situation. Example Glenn Ford is leading the pursuit but he's firm in his decision to not chase them beyond the Mexican border. Not even the pleas of the battered Inger Stevens the nowdebauched missionary and nurse will sway him. Yet later when one of his men is killed he abruptly changes his mind and charges towards the final confrontation. The dead man was not particularly important to Ford or to the plot. That is he wasn't Ford's cousin or son or anything. So the newly formed engram is left unexplained.The movie is routine by default. It doesn't carry with it the burden of ordinary stereotypes. It opens up a whole new package of problems involving mediocrity.The period detail is carelessly handled. The mob of Confederate prisoners wears new boots. By the end any attempt at realism is tossed out the window. The muzzleloading rifles of the opening scene are soon replaced by singleshot breachloading carbines. And in the last scene Winchester repeating rifles are used. No one ever pauses to load  regardless of the weapon.The musical score is by Mundell Lowe a decent guitarist but it's terrible. From the beginning we're subject to the kind of theme song common to the period with lyrics. A man's gotta ride home. But home is nowhere.... Something like that.

	onyx:emotionText "In 1865 somewhere out West around Las Cruces a band of Confederate prisoners led by George Hamilton escape from a Yankee fort with missionary Inger Stevens as hostage. They head for the safety of Mexico. They are pursued by a unit of Federal soldiers led by Major Glenn Ford. By the time the end rolls around all the men of both sides have either been killed or have run away except for Hamilton and Ford who shoot it out over the outraged honor of Inger Stevens.Now there's a certain dramatic potential in a story like this and the director Phil Karlson who has done some brutal work elsewhere starts it off well. In the opening scene a rebel prisoner has killed a guard while trying to get out and he is about to be shot by a firing squad. But the end of the war is near. Everyone knows it. And the squad balks. So the Commanding Officer turns the rifles over to the Colored Troops as they were called and orders them to fire at the prisoner. The nervous squad of exslaves has never handled rifles before and mostly they miss. The wounded prisoner cries out I'm still alive. They reload and fire. Once again they only wound the tortured man who screams and laughs. The scene is excruciating.From there on it's pretty much downhill. The usual problem is that clich is piled upon clich. Here it's that the narrative itself falls apart not so much because the conventions are too strictly observed but because the writers seemed to be seated on a runaway wagon.That Southern Captain  Hamilton  is a proud man and a determined one. This war will never end he mutters several times a gentleman warrior. Yet when he's alone with Inger Stevens he slaps her around rips her dress off runs his spur along her naked flesh and savagely rapes her. Whose breath blew out the light within this brain? But then nobody's motivations are entirely clear. They aren't ambiguous as they are for you and me. They're muddled and conflicting and almost drawn up in order to suit the demands of the situation. Example Glenn Ford is leading the pursuit but he's firm in his decision to not chase them beyond the Mexican border. Not even the pleas of the battered Inger Stevens the nowdebauched missionary and nurse will sway him. Yet later when one of his men is killed he abruptly changes his mind and charges towards the final confrontation. The dead man was not particularly important to Ford or to the plot. That is he wasn't Ford's cousin or son or anything. So the newly formed engram is left unexplained.The movie is routine by default. It doesn't carry with it the burden of ordinary stereotypes. It opens up a whole new package of problems involving mediocrity.The period detail is carelessly handled. The mob of Confederate prisoners wears new boots. By the end any attempt at realism is tossed out the window. The muzzleloading rifles of the opening scene are soon replaced by singleshot breachloading carbines. And in the last scene Winchester repeating rifles are used. No one ever pauses to load  regardless of the weapon.The musical score is by Mundell Lowe a decent guitarist but it's terrible. From the beginning we're subject to the kind of theme song common to the period with lyrics. A man's gotta ride home. But home is nowhere.... Something like that. The rest of the score would have provided a typical and uninteresting background for a shot of cars whizzing back and forth across the George Washington Bridge.It's not worth going on about.";

Oh sure TV westerns had their serious moments but most of them had healthy doses of comedy and I was just getting to the age when the good guys and the bad guys weren't so cut and dried. Plus Jethro was in it so it's probably pretty funny. Surprise! Still I was glued to the screen and completely taken in by the story. Now having finally seen it again on Encore I still think it's pretty good. There are some major editing problems but the acting is very good and the dichotomy of the war is very present and really makes one think about the futility of our civil war. I didn't remember much over the years except that the ending really struck me and it still does 41 years later. Maybe I'm just a sucker for westerns but I'd really like to see this on a fully restored DVD. Oh and as a musician as well as a fan of Mundell Lowe's jazz stuff his score here was intrusive and inappropriate. It sounded more like a rahrah WWII score.But stay with this one to the end.

	schema:reviewBody "It aired on TCM last night and as I remembered that when it came out in 1967 I walked out of it I wanted to see just how bad this thing was or if I was that impatient. I rarely walk out on films.As soon as the credits ended I was reminded of one of the initial negative reactions I had to the film. We get a title song under the credits left over from when the production title was The Long Ride Home and as soon as the director credit disappears so does the song. As in someone picked the needle up off the phonograph record before it was done. That's only the first example of the kitchen blender editing that goes on in this film.A group of Confederates are in a Northern fort caged in a big pen and apparently treated decently by Major Glenn Ford. The leader of this group is played by George Hamilton and when his accent isn't atrocious it's gone. The editing faults show up again when somehow a bunch of the rebels kill some guards turn the fort's cannons around and begin firing on it. We just don't get to see how they managed to get out of the holding pen in which they were confinedThey escape through some magical tunnel that leads to the river but with no establishing shots we have no idea of how far that tunnel goes. We never even get a shot in the tunnel. The rebs manage to catch up to and defeat a previously departed detail that includes Ford's betrothed Inger Stevens and they accomplish this by magically hiding in trees that manage to be right in the path of each Union soldier in the detail as they attempted to scatter when fired upon.There's all sorts of exposition here to show us what a mean bastard Hamilton is  he's left most of his men behind when he should have waited for them at the river. There's so much exposition that we forget that topbilled Glenn Ford is even in the film since he disappears for about a halfhour. Ford's search party includes two comic relief types one of whom is Dick Miller who seem to have walked in from another movie or an episode of F Troop. This is made more apparent as they are frequently seen in obvious studio shots that don't match the surrounding footage shot on location.It was at this point that I recalled that this film was started by Roger Corman but it was usurped by the studio and given to Phil Karlson. Corman's involvement would explain Dick Miller but the handling of his scenes might explain why Corman was dismissed. Apparently it was enough of a disaster for longtime producer Harry Joe Brown to quit the business.Harrison Ford billed with middle initial J gets reasonably prominent billing but he disappears once the film leaves the fort  we don't see if he's killed while the rebels escape. Paul Petersen is given very prominent billing above the title but he doesn't show up with any dialogue until Glenn Ford comes back into the film in the last halfhour. That's just as well Petersen is horrendous in his few scenes.Even worse is Max Baer Jr. as a whackedout Confederate who loves killing and physically sparring with a buddy. This goes on my list of alltime worst performances and it indicates why Baer never got beyond Jethro Bodine on The Beverly Hillbillies. Surprisingly effective is Todd Armstrong as Hamilton's sympathetic secondincommand yet this was his last feature film. As George Hamilton's moral conscience he has the most wellwritten role in the film.There is one strong plot twist here involving Inger Stevens that is quickly thrown away. En route Baer comes across a Union dispatch carrier and kills him taking from him the message that the war is over. The message couldn't have been that important to the carrier anyway as he's hanging out in a cantina with a bunch of whores. Hamilton swears Baer to silence this way he can kill more bluebellies as he wants to engage in a catandmouse game with Ford.This makes no sense as there would be no need for further pursuit but that would mean that the film would end just as abruptly as the title song. So just in case Hamilton rapes and beats Stevens after telling her that the war is over. He leaves her there but when Ford the Glenn one not Harrison catches up to her she fails to tell him that the war is over. She wants vengeance for having been spoiled. The film makes little more of that motive.I could go on but the film isn't really worth the verbiage I've given it thus far. Consider this a public service message and beware at all costs.".

	schema:reviewBody "It seems this movie has taken a bit of heat known by many as Shyamalan's worst film. It is often written off as slow moving and the twist at the end as unoriginal and boring. I've heard people say the acting and camera work was awkward and stale and that the casting was poor. Ironically enough as more people begin to dislike this movie the more I seem to fall in love with it. This film has a lot of personal bearing with me both as a student of psychology and a lover of movies and just plain art. I feel like I've taken this film under my wing during its times of criticism and now I'd like to try and show everyone what exactly I love about it so much. Shyamalan really showed a stroke of brilliance by getting Serra to be his cinematographer and to play around with the aestetics of the film. I don't know how or where Shyamalan is getting these guys for his movies but I definitely love the style of each frame he shells out. Serra had been involved with predominately foreign films before Unbreakable. This was his first big American film and I think you gotta give a little credit to Shyamalan for that. His unique and creative touch really added to the direction. In keeping with the comic book theme of the movie you will notice that almost every shot is taken as if you are looking through or in between something. Like the squares of a comic strip. There is also a dark slightly blue colored filter used throughout most of the film. This gives the movie a very bold but eerie tone. Showing that the world can be a rough and scary place but it can also be fought and overcome. It is evident that time and effort went into every shot. It may not slap many viewers in the face as brilliant but it really strikes a chord with me. As for the score I am more than willing to argue that this is hands down James Newton Howard's best score of his very successful career. It is compelling and booming. It's very powerful but not overthetop and excessive. For anyone with the soundtrack check out 'The Orange Man' and 'Visions'. These are two of the most powerful pieces of any film score around. And I stress the word powerful. Yeah he's no Hermann or Morricone but the emotional weight and emotive power of his chords and his overall composition are just downright chilling. The writing and the direction are just as captivating as the score. Almost every line of dialogue and every scene seems to be placed out on an island alone so that everyone can stop and judge it. Some people might view this as cocky andor boring direction but I see it as daring and unique. Much of Shyamalan's writing is done that way. '8230I see dead people8230' '...They call me Mr. Glass8230' etc. etc. Another aspect of the film that tickles my fancy is the underlying themes. I do believe to a certain extent that people do have somewhat supernatural powers at times. People have been known to make miracles and do unbelievable things. Maybe these things could be 'developed' in some way. These theories are in a way intertwined with some aspects of psychology such as selective attention and selfactualization. If you care to discuss some of these ideas let me know and I will relate them to the film through my eyes. In short I do believe there is a superhero in everyone. It may not be through supernatural powers but it may simply be through the act of reaching out to a person in need. Other themes of the movie like how completely different people can always be connected in some way and how everyone has their vulnerabilities and weaknesses are intriguing yet universal. From a psychological point of view Shyamalan really gets inside the head of OI patients osteogenesis imperfecta. He then brings this psyche to the next level with Jackson's character. Elijah is very passionate but very tortured and evil. His interactions with Willis bring depth and focus to both the characters and the story. Certain scenes in the movie are really quite striking and powerful. The shots of Willis in his security poncho. The train station scene. Elijah's breathtaking fall on the stairs and many more speak so loudly to me and say so much in just a simple clip. For some reason this movie just speaks to me like art. If anyone cares to discuss more about this film that'd be cool. There is a lotta other cool stuff to talk about with this movie. Just thinking about it makes me want to watch it a few more times. It may not be the feel good film of the year or the masterpiece that everyone was looking for but it definitely sits well with me.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love this film. I'm the only person I know who doesn't hate it but I cannot fathom why it gets such a bad rap from everybody. It seems that Shyamalan's films have this a running theme  with the notable exception of the Sixth Sense which pretty much everyone seems to get. He makes movies that are very subtle and which seem to need you to focus on them just right to fully grasp what he was trying to do. I've enjoyed all his movies but for me the alien part of Signs takes a lot away from what I believe to be the central storyline and as such the whole movie suffers a little. Yet I know other people who think Signs is his best specifically because of the way the alien plot line accentuates the central one.Unbreakable is a beautifully simple film but I think it has to hit you just right for you to completely get it. All the actors nail their parts particularly Bruce Willis and his kid. Shyamalan takes an interesting if slightly fringe theory and puts it in a real world context with a real family. Somehow he manages to never go overboard with it and  for me at least  it gripped me from the first moment to the last. Samuel L Jackson's character history is really nicely crafted in the middle of the other plot lines and you get genuinely involved in the people Shyamalan has created.Don't get caught up in all the talk of the twist ending. The ending is good but if you spend the whole movie waiting for this tumultuous twist you'll inevitably be disappointed and the movie stands alone without it. Don't go into this movie expecting another Sixth Sense or Signs. It's very very subtle and very understated. If you don't like slow movies just don't watch this because it moves at a very sedate pace but I personally think you'll be missing out. You'll likely either love it or you'll loathe it but at least it will make an impression.".

	schema:reviewBody "My kudos to M. Night Shyamalan for proving the consistency of his moviemaking abilities. Unbreakable is a movie that is rich in both technical brilliance as well as script quality.First let me get my one objection for the movie off my chest. The ending could have been done better. The majority of the length of Unbreakable does an excellent job of building suspense with the wonderfully muted melancholy acting adding depth and tension to the plot. My problem is that it fails to live up to its own expectations the ending does not consummate entirely what I expected it to. Somehow in a movie that took painstaking details to illustrate every step and glance concluding it in the manner that it did felt almost blasphemous. Maybe in a nameless action thriller it could be passed off as mere hackery. But here it seems strangely out of place kind of an enigma in itself...Now that the ugly part is over with I feel almost obligated to sing the praises of Unbreakable. Shyamalan's prowess with photographic techniques and processes shows through in this with rich reds and blacks given to scenes of moist emotion and colder colors dedicated to the bleak uncaring uncared for? world. One technique I particularly liked was the manipulation of photographic mediums some parts using crisp 35mm films and others using angry shuttered magnetic or 16mm? film. In the end it all worked very well because each technique seemed to integrate seamlessly with the plot and mood notice the confusion and panic at the very end? Traffic is a good example of processing overdose. Unbreakable on the other hand hones it perfectly. The lushness of this movie comes in close second to the wonderful eye candy of American Beauty. I could watch it again easily... with the sound turned off!On the more human side of the spectrum the acting was wonderful. How nice it is to see Bruce Willis proving himself to be a true Aclass actor! His unassuming and insecure behavior worked perfectly for this role. Samuel L. Jackson like always did a bangup job with what the script gave him. Robin Wright and Spencer Clark's characters seemed a bit two dimensional but they seemed to be minor roles compared to the prominence of Willis and Jackson's characters. A little character development would have been appreciated but if the ending was a result of the timeconstraint guillotine then I would expect the developmental scenes to have gone too.The thing that people seem to complain most about this movie is the plot. I like the premise. A little fantasy in our movies isn't such a bad thing once in a while is it?".

To explain the story would almost ruin it because it's preposterous. I'll just call an interesting fantasyhorror film with a little family story tied in with Willis' wife Robin Wright and young boy Spencer Treat Clark.Unbreakable is beautifully filmed has very little profanity in it and a strange strange story with a great twist at the end....one of the best I've ever seen in a movie. This movie is done by the same man who did The Sixth Sense M.

	schema:headline " Unbreakable is one of the finest movies in years.";
	schema:reviewBody "I guess I can't be too surprised with all the negative responses that Unbreakable is getting.  These days the masses don't appreciate a buildup of atmosphere strong character interaction and stories heavily centered on characters and their psychology.  Unbreakable has all of these traits and proves to be a superior movie to the Sixth Sense in my opinion.  Too bad it's so underrated.I've seen this movie several times and I have never even gotten tired of it.  It does deal with comic books but approaches it with a level of sophistication and intellect never found before in comic book movies.  The movie walks a very fine line between reality and the comicbook world at the same time walking a very fine line in terms of audience perception. Some chalk it up to be a silly comicbook movie others a brilliant comicbook movie. And yet there are still others that maintain Unbreakable's comic book theme does not exactly make it a comicbook movie. It's more of a drama just like the Sixth Sense was more of a drama than a horror movie.  Both are excellent dramas but Unbreakable was superior in every aspect.I especially admired the camera movement and the framing of certain scenes to bring to life an actual comicbook.  I also admired how Unbreakable was very light on dialogue making full use of subtle gestures movements and actions to represent the character's thoughts.  The character's environment plays a similar role and certain colors are often brought up to represent distinct emotions and thoughts the character has.In the end there are a number of things in this movie that can cause people to quickly denounce the movie but these are all dependent upon perspective as there's nothing truly wrong with the movie.  In fact if viewed objectively and with an open mind the viewer might be much more apppreciative of Unbreakable.It's clear that many of the posters to this comments area were truly angered by the movie and did not think their thoughts through prior to writing their comments which is a shame as Unbreakable truly deserves better.  If M. Night Shyamalan's next movie is at least half as good as Unbreakable I'll definitely be in line to buy a ticket.".

	onyx:emotionText "I guess I can't be too surprised with all the negative responses that Unbreakable is getting.  These days the masses don't appreciate a buildup of atmosphere strong character interaction and stories heavily centered on characters and their psychology.  Unbreakable has all of these traits and proves to be a superior movie to the Sixth Sense in my opinion.  Too bad it's so underrated.I've seen this movie several times and I have never even gotten tired of it.  It does deal with comic books but approaches it with a level of sophistication and intellect never found before in comic book movies.  The movie walks a very fine line between reality and the comicbook world at the same time walking a very fine line in terms of audience perception. Some chalk it up to be a silly comicbook movie others a brilliant comicbook movie. And yet there are still others that maintain Unbreakable's comic book theme does not exactly make it a comicbook movie. It's more of a drama just like the Sixth Sense was more of a drama than a horror movie.  Both are excellent dramas but Unbreakable was superior in every aspect.I especially admired the camera movement and the framing of certain scenes to bring to life an actual comicbook.  I also admired how Unbreakable was very light on dialogue making full use of subtle gestures movements and actions to represent the character's thoughts.  The character's environment plays a similar role and certain colors are often brought up to represent distinct emotions and thoughts the character has.In the end there are a number of things in this movie that can cause people to quickly denounce the movie but these are all dependent upon perspective as there's nothing truly wrong with the movie.  In fact if viewed objectively and with an open mind the viewer might be much more apppreciative of Unbreakable.It's clear that many of the posters to this comments area were truly angered by the movie and did not think their thoughts through prior to writing their comments which is a shame as Unbreakable truly deserves better.

	schema:reviewBody "A massive train crash outside Philadelphia kills 132 passengers and leaves only one survivor.  The survivor security guard David Dunn walks away completely unhurt from the accident.  Some time later he is contacted by comic book collector Elijah Price who believes that comic books are merely exaggerated versions of truth and that some people are created weak like him while some are created strong in order to protect the weak.  David develops his talents with the support of Price and his son Joseph and despite his cynicism starts to try to use his powers to help people on need.The 6th sense was always going to be a hard show to follow up but Shyamalan has managed to make a film that is almost as clever emotive thoughtful and slow.  It even manages to end with a twist that is almost as good as sixth sense's was.  The story moves quite slowly almost painfully at times however I found this succeeded in making the film feel more thoughtful and less glamorous.  The director even shots the train crash in a very low key manner as if to make the point that the film isn't about cheap spectacle or visual thrills.  Instead we follow David as he finds his abilities and gradually accepts them all this side is fascinating although some of the side stories are a little dragged out.  The twist is only the icing on the cake and if you're into the characters the way I was then it is really impacting.  One bit of advice  don't think about it or try to work it out. Thinking about the twist will stop you enjoying the main story and will spoil the film for yourself.Willis is excellent  he doesn't set the world on fire but he does a very lowkey performance as a common man confronted with so much potential responsibility.  He doesn't ham it up but you know that there's things going on inside his head that reflect on his face.  Jackson is also really good  he maybe plays it a little too weird and should have been a bit more of a geek rather than an uptight art dealer sort.  Willis and Jackson should keep making films together from now on cause even there worst collaboration so far has still been good  Pulp Fiction Unbreakable Die Hard With a Vengeance  it seems to be a winning partnership Loaded Weapon 1 doesn't count as Willis is only in it for 5 seconds!.  A surprise addition to the cast is Eamonn Walker as Dr Mathison it's a small role but he is a fine actor and deserves to be seen in big films check him out in HBO's Oz for a real show of his abilities.Overall it's very slow and may frustrate some people but if you got the 6th sense then you'll probably get this.  The story is moving and thoughtful and the final scene is merely the icing on a very fine cake.".

Director of Photography Eduardo Serra's execution is subtle understated and absolutely beautiful.Cinematography legend Greg Toland of  Citizen Kane and The Grapes of Wrath fame would be proud of what this film accomplished artistically. I also couldn't help but notice all the long camera takes this film had reminding me of a few Woody Allen films that let the actors act without the intrusion of the film making process i.e. getting a scene covered from multiple and sometimes meaningless camera angles just so the director and editor have something to work with in post production.  The characters seem at times to be acting for the benefit of the others on screen rather than us the audience lending a quality of voyeurism to quite a few scenes.  The directors intent is quite clear to anyone wishing to delve a little bit deeper into the story and characters while appreciating how such a vision came to breath on film.With regards to the story Mr. Shyamalan and his crew have constructed something so rich in visual texture while managing to keep the story subdued and character development full of deepseated  anticipation.  Every plot point came perfectly without any extra connotations that usually creep into a story such as this super heroes?.  Without any melodrama both Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson give very authentic performances that help the film keep its Any Town USA and Average Joe Sixpack feel very much alive.By virtue of ingenuity and most likely a meticulous preproduction period Unbreakable manages to be a consummate clinic in directing writing acting and cinematography.

Night uses colors mostly blue purple and green and well chosen cameraangles as imagesystems word is that the storyboard read like a comic. Most of them really work out well. I loved the slow pacing of the film. It really takes it time to tell us what's going on. As usual Shyamalan puts human drama first in his script. The first scene where Willis meets the woman in the train... You have to see the genius of it. In a few lines of dialog Shyamalan let's us discover the character Dunn.Another reason why I love this film is because Shyamalan shows he has courage to make THIS after the enormous success of The Sixth Sense which I think is inferior to this film.

I know he's made some suspect flicks ever since his early successes in the late 90searly 00s with a recent rejuvenation with the highly acclaimed blockbuster Split and the pending Glass which feels like another surefire success. In between he's definitely made some headscratchers although I kind of enjoyed The Visit more than I thought I would. While The Sixth Sense is probably considered his best film among most I honestly was kind of bored by it and think it was a wee bit pretentious. I actually believe his best films so far are between Split and this one I'm reviewing UNBREAKABLE 2000. I'm not the biggest fan of either Bruce Willis or Samuel L. Jackson but this might actually be arguably the best film that either of them have been in! Yeah I know they were both in this popular flick called Pulp Fiction and have separately been in a lot of good stuff but in terms of quality the level of their acting the naturalistic writing atmosphere and direction this is probably the true best film either of them have done in my opinion. And to me unlike the rather gimmicky Pulp Fiction which looks dated 20 years later Unbreakable looks like a flick that looks fresh even in 2018. Willis is superb as David Dunn a depressed family man who is a native Philadelphian film's setting duh it's Shamalyan! LOL and works as security at the city's football stadium. In the film's opening Dunn survives a train derailment that killed every passenger except him. Upon being released David is reunited with his wife Audrey strong performance by Robin Wright and son Joseph impressive work by Spencer Treat Clark. David was on a job interview in New York and planning to divorce Audrey who he's lived in an estranged marriage for years. News of the tragedy piques the interest of another native Philadelphian Elijah Price brilliantly played by Jackson. Price is a collector of classic comic books and owns a his own art gallery. Elijah was born with a rare disease where his bones are incredibly fragile and easy to fracture. He's suffered multiple bone breaks during his life and walks with a cane. Price contacts Dunn and theorizes that David is the opposite of him a human with superpowers and encourages David to embrace his gift.The film is a provocative interesting exploration into the possibility of a person actually having superhuman abilities and the pressure strain and responsibility that goes along with it. David was also an exfootball player whose career was ruined in a car accident many years earlier so this new gift is like a second calling for him. Shyamalan occupies the film with a sequence of strong characterdriven scenes that build up exquisitely through dialogue and character. No explosions no CGI no car chases just good oldfashioned conversation. The acting is uniformly excellent and in addition to the aforementioned Willis Jackson Wright and Clark solid work is done by Charlayne Woodard as Elijah's mother as well as by veteran Elizabeth Lawrence of All My Children fame in a spooky scene at Joseph's school.I definitely like this film more than Sixth Sense and it's probably on equal footing with Split for me. And with the pending Glass looks like Shyamalan is back!".

	schema:reviewBody "Interesting film and one of the greatest successes of the magnificent filmmaker Night Shyamalan . This intriguing picture with twist ending revolves around a security guard named David Dunn Bruce Willis who miraculously survives a catastrophic train crash outside Philadelphia . His marriage to Audrey Robin Wright is crumbling  and he's thinking of moving to New York . David learns something extraordinary about himself after a devastating accident . He formerly had a car accident that was a pivotal point in David and Audrey's relationship. He meets a strange man Samuel L Jackson with Osteogenesis Imperfecta  a real but rare disease . At the end takes place a confrontation against a violent delinquent  some camera shots show David in a hooded raincoat  which may be to imply that he's some sort of a caped crusader.A suspense thriller with supernatural overtone full of intrigue  emotion  surprise and plot twists . Shyamalan came up with the idea for the film while filming The Sixth Sense  of all the films he's made  this is Shyamalan's personal favorite and of course is set in Philadelphia  like most of his films . He is an avid comic book fan which was made apparent in this film . As in comic books the main characters have their identified color schemes  David's is green and Elijah's is purple  they show up in their clothes the wallpaper and bed sheets in their houses Elijah's note to David and various personal items among others. Several camera angles were chosen to simulate the comic book device of a frame around each scene . Excellent performances from the two main characters  M. Night Shyamalan always had Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson in mind to play the roles of David Dunn and Elijah Price. Enjoyable support cast as Robin Wright  Spencer Clark  Eamonn Walker  Leslie Stefanson and Charlayne Woodard who plays the mother to Samuel L. Jackson's character is actually almost a full 5 years younger than her on screen son . And as usual director M. Night Shyamalan makes cameo appearances in his own movies like Alfred Hitchcock one of his favorite directors  this time as a Stadium drug dealer . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Eduardo Serra . Marvelous and thrilling musical score by James Newton Howard who always works with the director . Well produced and directed by Night Shyamalam  many of his films have car crashes playing pivotal roles and involve two ordinary individuals with extraordinary abilities or events happening to them  one of the people either has connections to a child or is a child and the one connected to the child is always having marital difficulties . Night Shyalaman is an expert on fantastic films plenty of intelligence and thoughtprovoking issues as proved in Sings The village  Lady in the water  The incident with exception to flop titled Airbender . Rating  Better than average  worthwhile watching .".

Most of the plaudits for Sixth Sense went to the kid and Twelve Monkeys to Pitt although Jackson is superb as usual Bruce Willis steals the movie with a subtleness most screen stars cannot portray.

	schema:headline " M. Night's best contains spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "Unbreakable is one of those films that garners extreme reactions on both ends of the spectrum either people love it or hate it.The biggest criticism is that the movie is too long and too slow to develop which is certainly a understandable argument.  I prefer to look at M. Night's films in a different light I admire the way that he absolutely refuses to rush through a story and the way that he lets the characters develop at their own pace.  Bruce Willis's slow gradual transformation is a beautiful thing to watch a testament to Bruce's incredible talent.  The aura of sadness that he projects through most of the movie is tangible and it's only through the teachings or manipulation if you will of Samuel L. Jackson's character Elijah that Bruce's character David is able to finally realize his full potential to understand his place in the world and to connect with his son in a way he never could before.I would also like to give special kudos to Spencer Clark's performance as David's son Joseph.  Most kids especially those not close to their parents have no understanding of what their parents do for a living.  It's more comfortable to live a fantasy where your Dad is a superhero and you will one day follow in his footsteps.  It's no wonder that when the possibility presents itself that David is special Joseph latches onto that notion and proceeds to stop at nothing to prove it to his father even coming a hair'sbreadth from shooting him.David's first adventure as a superhero was magnificently done.  He walks into a train station bustling with people and lets his instincts take over.  Just by touching people he can see what terrible things they've done kind of like John Smith on USA's The Dead Zone but not as extreme for example shoplifting race violence and date rape.  But when he brushes up against a man who had committed coldblooded murder David leaps into action.  He follows the man to a house he has taken over  both parents are dead but the two children are still alive.  The confrontation is also very well done.  No words are spoken there is no flurry of blows or martial arts moves simply one man taking another man down in a way that any of us might do in similar circumstances.The next morning David shows his son a newspaper detailing the incident. He silently mouths the words You were right and his son sheds a tear of joy his fantasy has been fulfilled and his connection to his father can only get stronger from here on out.  They also agree to keep his double life secret from David's wife which is another nice touch.Given Elijah's life and state of mind it is very reasonable to understand his motives for wanting to find someone like David.  That he used such reprehensible methods for doing so makes the ending that much more shocking.Most people especially moviegoers are easily bored.  They are addicted to the quick fix where something dramatic or exciting has to happen every five minutes or they lose interest.  That is why Unbreakable has elicited such negative praise from some critics.  But I am of the opinion that if the view at the top is spectacular enough it's doesn't matter how long it takes to get up the mountain.My score 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "As an unwavering fan of Mr. M. Night Shayamalan I must say this was good. But to clarify my perspective I did not see this when it first came out. I rented it after having seen The Sixth Sense Signs and The Village. Being a fan of those three I knew this would not disappoint.This film has all of the prerequisites of an M. Night film....slow brooding atmosphere dialogue instead of action heaps of character development and a twist of some kind. Ultimately this film works. It works well. We feel for the characters want to know what will happen next and are intrigued by the premise. All of the actors meet my expectations  there is no weak link in the acting. Shayamalan tends to pull good performances out of everyone.That being said I think there are two minor problems with this movie. First the movie has a boldly slow pace but that works for the film. What bothered me a little bit is there was about a 30 minute period of time in the movie where very little happened  in the action or in the characters. It seemed a repetitious  am I really unbreakable or not? Is this guy yanking my chain or what? This problem is minor but with weaker actors my attention would not have been held.The other minor problem is how the twist was carried out. There is a potentially massive revelation but it gets written off by two sentences on the screen. The climax becomes an afterthought. There is no falling action. I liked the twist but I thought it was written off.All in all this is a good movie  much better than your average Hollywood entertainment. I recommend it if you like to think about movies.".

	schema:headline " So close to being great";
	schema:reviewBody "It's really frustrating to find a movie that comes so close to being great and only a few minor faults are holding it back. Luckily it's not so frustrating that it ruins the experience. Unbreakable is still an intense and emotional movie and I wish M. Night Shyamalan was still making movies like this.Bruce Willis plays David Dunn a man unhappy with his marriage and his relationship with his son. David is trying to get a job in New York so he can move out of the house and move his life in his own direction. When his train back from New York derails David is the only survivor and he is sought out by a fragile man named Elijah who believes David is special.This could easily be cheesy but Shyamalan wisely plays up the comicbook feeling of the plot while maintaining a certain sense of reality. Bruce Willis is a good choice as the passive David a man not sure where he fits in the world. Samuel Jackson always good is great here it's probably his best role that I've seen since Pulp Fiction. Robin Wright Penn also has some touching moments as Willis's despairing wife as does Spencer Treat Clark as his neglected but loving son.The problem is not with the story or cast but with the direction. There are some awkward transitions and some moments that should have been played out longer it sometimes feels like Shyamalan is copping out on giving us real drama and instead giving us an outline of what happened. But no matter it's still an intriguing movie and it has some great images. And while it may not be on par with his The Sixth Sense and Signs it comes close and that's good enough.".

He's consistent in his directorial style. It works.I've never even read a comic book but I seem to enjoy movies about them. Perhaps it's the lack of moral ambiguity. The bad guys are bad and the good guys are good. If only life were that simple! A couple other reviewers have called this and other M.Night movies family friendly but I have to disagree.

I enjoyed the plot a lot. You've got a guy who survives a train wreck  the only survivor. He seeks answers as to why. You get to follow along questioning as he questions. Why did he survive? Is there something special about him or was he just lucky? And who is this guy who approaches him and tries to explain to the main character what HE thinks happened? Is he a kook or can you accept that he might be right? I enjoyed every twist and turn every new revelation taking you to a new level of thought. Very well written. I enjoyed Bruce Willis in the main role and Samuel L.Jackson was fabulous. The casting lacked a little in a couple roleswhich is why only an 8 for this one. If you're not sure if you liked it the first time watch it again. It's definitely worth a second look.".

In my opinion this is indicative of the fact the movie going public no longer understands what makes a good film or even recognizes one when they see it.  Unbreakable was an attempt at a two hour character study primarily of two men.  I'm guessing it was meant to be a character study because there isn't a plot or story line to speak of.  This is fine character studies can be interesting unfortunately we are spoon fed little pieces of information in one scene and then shown the effect of it in the very next as if we were being spoon fed the dimensions of the characters. For all the benefit of the doubt M. Night Shyamalan gave his audience in The Sixth Sense he treats them like complete idiots in Unbreakable making sure he drops a small foreshadowing to the audience before hitting them over the head with the actual event to make sure they understood.  And even with this heavy handed approach we ultimately end up with two people we don't care about swimming around in a thin story based on the incredible assumption that someone wouldn't realize that they had never been sick or injured in their entire life until it was pointed out to them.  In fact the entire foundation of premises this movie is built upon is so fanciful and preposterous that even a reasonable suspension of disbelief is impossible.  Lastly the camera work particularly the artsy shots should LEND to the storytelling not take away from it.  Every time Shyamalan indulges in one of these sequences he is not highlighting something important he is reminding us we are only watching a movie.  What he did so skillfully in The Sixth Sense comes across as random and forced in Unbreakable.  Top this off with one of the most ridiculous scenes ever put on film in a serious movie those who have seen it will probably know what I am talking about those who don't heed my warning and go see it anyway just watch for the scene with the kid and the gun and you have a selfindulgent pile of trash unworthy of even going straight to video.  I don't know if Shyamalan was rushed to get this out or if he got Kevin Costner syndrome after the success of his first movie and decided that he could mail one in but Unbreakable is Unthinkably bad.  At the very very least do yourself a favor and catch it for free on HBO or Showtime or spend a buck and watch it in the dollar theatres where it will be very soon I hope making room for something more palatable.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll say it right now Unbreakable is my pick for worst movie ever made. Not necessarily in terms of quality I'm sure some SciFi channel movie would snatch that prize but in terms of writing acting and most importantly directing. I counted how many words Bruce Willis said throughout the entire movie my final total was 6 that is not technically true as I didn't really count but I'm confident my estimate is within about 10 of the actual number. There is an unbelievable amount of epic staring at each other done by all of the characters involved. I really wanted to enjoy this movie when we popped it in in fact it was my choice to rent it but by the end everyone in my family was laughing quite hysterically needless to say the movie was not supposed to be funny. I do not enjoy when a movie is filled with dumb characters in fact I really hate it when it seems every character is mentally deficient. This is one of those movies. One scene in particular struck me as incredibly ridiculous. Bruce's son decides he's going to shoot Bruce to show everyone that Bruce is truly invulnerable. Bruce and his wife freak out naturally and try to get the son to put the gun away. In a moment of unintentional comedy myself and two other members of my family all said outloud For God's sake just shoot him. The movie would have been over and this horrible scene would cease to poison our minds with contagious stupidity. The big twist at the end was not clever and relatively easy to predict meaning of course that it was disappointing and therefore fit great with the rest of the movie. If you are someone who can REALLY get involved in a movie and truly feel the character's pain. then perhaps you will love this movie but my entire family just couldn't get over how ridiculous everything was and how everyone kept staring at each other in an unbelievably corny way. I do not recommend this movie to anyone unless you are looking for a comedy cause after all I found this movie quite hilarious in a pathetic sort of way.".

Orphaned Eric has never spoken a word and without having been told about the incident began to think he could fly at the exact moment his parents died in a plane crash.

Every other week we are tortured with some nonsense of this calibre and whenever I wish for a movie that stands out from the crowd I have to go back in time and consider some overlooked gem. The Boy Who Could Fly is exactly that.The characters seem so real and their emotions genuine it builds at a slow pace but it never gets boring and story development is consistent. This is not a ferociously loud summer crowdpleaser or something bloated with pointless SFX. Very few movies have the power to make a whole story out of characters and situation alone without feeling the need for some ridiculous set piece or blaring thrash metal guitars.In fact Bruce Broughton's score is the wonderful opposite of that. The performances especially the two leads are flawless and the direction is far more refined than the typical. Everything in this movie comes together perfectly to make a film so unique and charming. If you have lost your faith in the current dreck that graces our screens and if you want a family movie with some meaning and subtext then check this out. And keep an eye out for director John Carpenter as on of the Coupe De Villes.The DVD is in 1.781 anamorphic widescreen and in Dolby 2.0. It has an introduction by Jay Underwood and director Nick Michael Myers Castle they also feature in a commentary with Lucy Deakins and Fred Savage.".

The story centers on a mother Bonnie Bedelia her young teenage daughter Lucy Deakins and her preteen son Fred Savage as they struggle to cope after the beloved father's sudden passing. Their grief is intensified by the manner of his death and their almost immediately having to adjust to a new life a new home a new neighborhood and for the kids a new school and new friends. Into this mix enters Eric Jay Underwood the apparently autistic teenage boy next door who is coping with demons of his own as a result of his parents' sudden death in an airplane crash. So grief is involved and adjustment and trying to fit in and acceptance of human differences and courage and love  love within a family group and among people as well as real boygirl love. Writerdirector Nick Castle deals with these issues with respectful sensitivity as does the excellent ensemble cast of Lucy Deakins Jay Underwood Bonnie Bedelia Fred Savage Colleen Dewhurst Fred Gwynne and Mindy Cohn. That fantasy might be important to plot movement shouldn't be surprising considering the movie's title. However whether that fantasy is allegorical or real or both is in the eyes of the beholder.

I never quite understood the complexities of emotion that were put into this movie. But I had always remembered it from my younger years. I decided to pick up the DVD when it came out again. Now that I'm older and actually work with cut scenes as an animator for a living. I now see everything that I missed. I am by all means not an emotional person or cry a lot etc but I have at least watched this film more then 15 times in the last year. No other movie has ever brought me to tears every time I watch it. Not tears of sadness or being upset  but tears of happiness. There are so many moments in this picture that can overwhelm you with that gut feeling of real love. You really let these characters take your heart and go with it. That is what a true movie is a about  is the ability to let you heart go and pull in that emotion from them and try to imagine feeling what they feel. I don't think any other movie has captured my heart that way. I might seem all soft and sound like a push over but I'm about as manly as you can get. If you have the time to see this movie or buy it. You truly will receive a much broader look at life  love  fear  relationships and most of all believing in yourself and who you are.

	onyx:emotionText "I'm really surprised I didn't see more comments on this movie. I remember watching this movie when I was I think 13 or 14. I never quite understood the complexities of emotion that were put into this movie. But I had always remembered it from my younger years. I decided to pick up the DVD when it came out again. Now that I'm older and actually work with cut scenes as an animator for a living. I now see everything that I missed. I am by all means not an emotional person or cry a lot etc but I have at least watched this film more then 15 times in the last year. No other movie has ever brought me to tears every time I watch it. Not tears of sadness or being upset  but tears of happiness. There are so many moments in this picture that can overwhelm you with that gut feeling of real love. You really let these characters take your heart and go with it. That is what a true movie is a about  is the ability to let you heart go and pull in that emotion from them and try to imagine feeling what they feel. I don't think any other movie has captured my heart that way. I might seem all soft and sound like a push over but I'm about as manly as you can get. If you have the time to see this movie or buy it. You truly will receive a much broader look at life  love  fear  relationships and most of all believing in yourself and who you are. I didn't want reveal any of the movie but it really has touched me. Michael Loeck Character animator httpwww.immortal3d.com";

Deakins gains interest in Underwood's silent world of thought while attempting to keep things stable at home. Unusual things begin to happen around Underwood. While life seemingly falls apart for her family Deakins and the audience are irresistably drawn into Underwood's world and we begin to question if his apparent dream to fly isn't more than just a fantasy. The acting in this film is superb especially silent Underwood who conveys more thought and emotion with his eyes face and body than the actors who speak. Bruce Broughton's melodious score is heartwarming and delivers full enchantment for the flying? scenes.  The main theme is so enchanting the Walt Disney company has used it to open every film at their El Capitan theater in Hollywood CA. This is a wonderful film for the entire family.  Slight warning  for families that have recently lost a parent it would be a good idea for the other parent to watch with the kiddies. And although they may find themselves dealing with the emotion of their trauma they should feel much better when the film ends.".

This movie is very rare in today's movie market a wholesome and innocent film that is a pleasure to watch again and again. One of the most beautiful scenes to me is when she reaches for a rare white rose with one pink petal and as she climbes the railing the only thing gaurding her from a deep gorge Eric immediatly grabs her arm concerned for her safety.

For me the relative innocence of 80s movies and childhood nostalgia made it a much better if absolutely unrealistic movie. It could be seen as some sort of modern fairy tale not be considered seriously but with some sort of hidden meaningmoral.I can relate to this movie because of some similar events fears and dreams from my own life of course like most movies this one is exaggerated a bit and mixes fantasypeople's dreams with real life.This is why some 80s movies are so fun to watch because they are absolutely unrealistic escapism and fantasy to the max cheesy and overly optimistic as some may consider but so is belief in God and Lord Jesus Christ which i do share by God's grace. This may be due to a partial return to conservative and Christian values that the world had in the 80s as a backlash against confused and crisisridden 70s.The film is about a family struggling with their lives after the tragic death of their father who chose suicide instead of fighting with cancer. But no matter how hard one's life is there is surely someone whose life is worse so their neighbor is an alcoholic man with an autistic nephew whose parents have died in a plane crash.While this movie is not Christian in showing no love to or mention of God it is similar to Jesus' second greatest commandment Love your neighbor as yourself. The girl Milly while doing her best to be the family cook actually finds time and care to help the autistic boy next doorwindow Eric. As many 80s movies' characters Milly doesn't have much flaws except for underage alcohol drinking though i expected her to breakdown into i'm getting no respectreal life fit guess i've seen too many 90s00s overdriven realistic movies where teenagers are too often rebellious and egoistical.As the Milly's mother and brother get through their work and bully problems Milly and Eric get romantically close in an innocent way and get to fly holdings hands to the amazement of the whole city. Then Eric flies away. THE END.CONCLUSION The whole flying may be a metaphor for the first love with Milly and Eric being high on the wings of love. It may also be an aspiration to what is true noble right.. as in New Testament Philippians 48. The fact that Eric then flied away may mean that Milly and Eric separated and never seen each other again or that Eric may have fallen off the roof and did die which sounds sad but possible. Thus many people could relate to it adding their own life stories about their first love life tragedies or mental problems.".

Lucy Deakins is terrific as an intelligent thoughtful 14 year old who slowly grows to care for the autistic boy next door. He doesn't speak but dreams only of flying away a condition brought on by the deaths of his parents in a plane crash years before. Now he's in the care of an alcoholic uncle the always wonderful Fred Gwynne and the powers that be think he might be better off being institutionalized. Almost all the acting is top notch which is crucial in this character based story. Jay Underwood walks various fine lines as the titular boy named Eric. By turns mysterious locked in charming he seems believable as an emotionally isolated adolescent as well as a possible source of magic. Colleen Dewhurst doesn't have a lot of screen time but makes something rich and real out of a concerned teacher who doesn't want to see Eric locked away knowing it will kill his spirit. And Bonnie Bedelia makes a touching warm and understanding widowed mom. There are some scenes where the comic relief is more than a little forced and a subplot about a little brother taking on neighborhood bullies seems grafted on from a far more Disneyish film. But this Capraesque gentle bittersweet fantasy is a great 1980s film for tweens even today and not a bad one for adults as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just watched this movie for the first time in at least 20 years and to my pleasant surprise it lived up to my fondest memories of it.To be sure there are flaws in the movie. I doubt that an autistic person with as severe a case of that disease as Eric would show so much response ... but then I suspect he was not truly autistic but traumatized. A couple of scenes are cheesy or out of place the dream sequence or the drinking scene in particular.Still it is a touching film. Outside of Eric the characters are very real and you feel for them. You feel the Louie's frustration and the mother's fear and Milly's uncertainty and Uncle Hugo's disappointment in himself.Beyond that the emotional touchstone is NOT Eric and NOT the mystery surrounding him but rather the struggle of the Michaelson's and Milly in particular. Even before the dramatic conclusion Milly has found hope through her relationship with Eric and tries to share this the rest of her family. As the movie reaches it's somewhat cheesy conclusion it feels good to see all the happy endings but mostly feels good to see the characters with hope and optimism regardless of the end result.As a child I remembered having a minicrush on Milly. As an adult I totally understand why. She is a beautiful character not just her looks where she is very pretty in a girlnextdoor sort of way but her care for her brother her mother her neighbor. The strength she shows in trying to keep everything together when she feels like its falling apart. Her kindness. Her gentleness. Her love. What a wonderful character and what a character so deserving of being saved.Ultimately the movie is very uplifting. It reaches beyond plausibility but while the ending may have been necessary for some characters Uncle Hugo Milly had already grown into her happy ending and I could feel her turning the tide for her mother and brother regardless. And much like the Shawshank Redemption delivers it's best line at the close MINOR SPOILER HEREwhen Colleen Dewhurst says Maybe if you dream hard enough and love long enough anything is possible.".

It opens as Millie and her family are starting there new life in town and moving in to their new home. As they are settling in Millie sees a boy called Eric he lives just opposite her he doesn't speak and shows no emotions. But one thing he can do is fly. Millie befriends him and tries to get to know him better and slowly he begins to open up to her. They fall in love and it's so sweet and heart warming This is an underrated gem from the 80's.Some people may have missed this film but I recommend it to anyone looking for something with a heart and a great story. The music by Bruce Broughton is just beautiful and wonderful and the song in the closing credits walking on air is just fantastic. This film has a positive message about dreams and believing that things can happen it's one of the best films I've ever seen. They just don't make films like this anymore.".

A big problem I had was with the movie's length  it is almost two hours long. Though it could have been worse since there is evidence here that the original cut of the movie ran much longer and was whittled down in the editing room to its present length. Evidence the bullies that show up in the first few minutes of the movie subsequently disappear for more than an hour before showing up again. Also the movie seemed to be spinning its wheels over and over with one scene after another advancing the plot little or not at all.This isn't a BAD movie  it has charm and warmth  but I think directorwriter Nick Castle should have either reviewed his script a few more times before filming or invited outside input to review the script.".

	schema:headline " A quite lovely and affecting story";
	schema:reviewBody "The Boy Who Could Fly is a very underrated film from the 80s. A film that addressed the condition of autism long before Rain Man did and much better too than that overrated Oscar winner. The tale of an autistic boy Eric Jay Underwood who believes he can fly and his neighbour Milly Michaelson a sweetly appealing Lucy Deakins who forms a friendship that blossoms into love.Eric has been autistic since his parents died in a plane crash when he was five. Ever since he's imagined he can fly like a plane possibly so he could save his parents sitting on the windowsill of his bedroom or standing on the roof of his house getting ready to take off. Eric is in danger of being institutionalised. He doesn't speak a word to anyone. Not even to his own uncle Hugo amusingly played by the late Fred Gwynne who cares for Eric and drinks more than he should.Milly has just moved in next door with her widowed mother Charlene another fine performance from Bonnie Bedelia and her brother Louis a groan inducing Fred Savage. She becomes fascinated with Eric and cares for him a great deal. She's not sure if she believes Hugo's stories that Eric can really fly but when she falls from an overpass and somehow survives she slowly convinces herself Eric has the gift of flight.I really did enjoy The Boy Who Could Fly. There's a wonderful simplicity to its storytelling and thanks to director Nick Castle's confident and assured grasp of narrative its a rewarding experience. Sadly Castle never really distinguished himself in the following 90s with anything particularly worthwhile. Only this film and his previous venture The Last Starfighter an equally underrated film are films that really stand out.Castle finds just the right tone and sense of whimsy. In some ways its almost a Spielbergian story. But it hardly ever lapses into slush and oversentimentality. I could have done without Fred Savage's unnecessary subplot about finding the courage to ride around the block on his bike and the ending does somewhat surrender itself to full blown fantasy but up until then TBWCF seldom puts a foot wrong.Really the only problem I have with the film is when it outright embraces the fantastical. When I saw TBWCF for the first time I assumed Eric's desire of flight was a metaphor for freedom. That on the outside he's cut off from everybody. But on the inside his mind is free and perfectly clear. In fact if the film had stayed true to those conceits I probably would have gave it 1010.But unfortunately TBWCF chooses to stray too closely to fantasy. Midway there is a scene when we see Milly flying with Eric. Now that scene in of itself works quite well. It seems very magical although the moment they kiss in a background of a fireworks display is overdoing it and hits an uplifting note but when its revealed to just be a dream I liked the ambiguity to it. It adds an air of mystery that permeates the film.Its just unfortunate that for all the deft direction Castle displays beforehand he chooses to cop out with an ending that's pure escapism. If the climax had some of the same mystery the rest of the film had it would have made Eric's departure even more powerful.But still TBWCF has much to recommend it. The performances are uniformly excellent. Lucy Deakins is a wonderful young actress. She has charm grace and a genuine sense of sweetness. What a shame she hasn't gone on to the acting career she richly deserves. And Jay Underwood is a master of minimalism. He communicates volumes of frustration and pain without ever having to open his mouth.Its in their relationship the film soars. You really feel their love and affection for each other and Castle handles it all with a light but expert touch. The fantastical elements aside the way it addresses autism is done with a refreshing and unpatronising maturity. At least you don't get Eric screaming his head off with fists flying like Dustin Hoffman's embarrassing performance in Rain Man. The Boy Who Could Fly is a far superior film.Another of the 80s many hidden treasures.".

	schema:headline " A mix of subtlety and nonsense";
	schema:reviewBody "I go back and forth on this film so much that it makes me dizzy. But when I hit the ground I am on the side of really liking this film. It is the subtle handling of the conflicts in this film that wins me over. The underlying conflict lies in the death of Millie's father. He dies before the film begins but we find out that he chose suicide instead of a long probably losing battle with cancer. Millie's little brother asks the question one stormy night after his dog who he loves very much is hit by a car and may dieWhy didn't he even tryMillie? Life has been very difficult for Millie's family which consists of Millie's brother and her mother. Her mother is having difficulty in her new job Millie has to take care of her brother fix all the meals and generally take care of things around the house and Max is doing poorly in school and is being bullied by kids in the neighborhood. The family shows signs of cracking and the question is Why even try. The climatic scene for me is the stormy night right after Max asks the question when he runs out to dig up his buried Army figurines and Millie and Mom end up out there with him. Max is crying and desperate to find the figurines in the mud. His mother and sister instead of dragging him in out of the downpour dig through the mud with him. It is a beautiful scene that makes the movie for me.The nonsense is ironically the boy who could fly. Although Jay Underwood plays him sensitively and wonderfully it is the literal fulfillment of this title that blows away all the subtlety seen previously. I understand that the boy being able to fly is symbolic of achieving the unachievable in the face of life's obstacles but seeing him fly through the fair making a slam dunk on the way was just too much. Although my children loved that part I always cringe a little when I see it. For me it turns what was a very sensitive movie about a family fighting dissolution into a comic. And yet the first 110 minutes is good enough for me to have me put up with the ending. Lucy Deakin is such an attractive character and the show is wholesome and gives the cold shoulder to ugliness without denying it's existence. I found this very refreshing.".

	schema:headline " It's Exactly What You Expect";
	schema:reviewBody "From the writers of 'The Hangover' comes 21 and Over another comedy about people getting really drunk and then having a bunch of crude and insane things happen to them. The difference here is that the three leads are not trying to find their buddy they're instead trying to find their buddy's house. Oh and the buddy whose house they're trying to find has passed out and has to be carried from place to place as the circumstances around them continue to get more dire.Let's back up a bit. It's Jeff Chang's Justin Chon 21st birthday. He's a premed student who has a big interview the next morning. His best friends Miller Miles Teller and Casey Skylar Astin have come to his apartment to surprise him and take him out for drinks as is the American custom. Upon learning that the biggest interview of his life is the next day Casey does the responsible thing and says that those plans can be postponed. Miller threatens to keep Jeff Chang up all night if he doesn't come out. One drink we're told. Like that's going to happen.We don't even see Jeff Chang resist the party once it starts. He's loaded by the time we've zoomed forward in time and only gets worse over the montage depicting the group's barhopping. Eventually he's passed out and time is running out to get him home and to bed. The other two friends are from out of town  they've all separated once college started I guess  so they don't know their way around. They spend nearly the rest of the film attempting to get him into bed before 7AM.Doesn't this sound familiar? Three guys trolling around a certain location in hopes of finding something or someone? While doing so they find themselves in a bunch of I can't believe it situations while also learning things about the others that perhaps should have been better left a secret. When Casey and Miller find a gun in Jeff Chang's pocket and later learn that he was arrested by the police we have a mystery on our hands. One whose conclusion is mishandled so badly that I thought there must have been an alternate ending.It feels too similar I suppose. We've seen movies that contain situations more shocking than this. When a guy gets run over by a buffalo  which we don't actually get to see by the way because the camera cuts to black before impact  that winds up being one of the more crazy points of the film. Sure a couple of other moments are funny at the time if only because at least one of the guys  Casey  doesn't seem like he deserved to be put through them but they're kind of bland for the genre.There are a few running gags scattered throughout  always calling Jeff Chang by his full name being one of them  but most of the humor in 21 and Over comes from the situations themselves. That can work for some people. Many of you might find a lot of the film funny. It wasn't for me. Watching stupid people act pretty stupid and have bad things happen to them isn't the funniest thing in the world. Like I said there are a few good moments but not enough of them to fill the 90minute running time.Moving away from the amount of laughter which is about all that matters in a comedy the dialogue also leaves a lot to be desired. The film was written and directed by The Hangover writers after all so that should be expected. It's all profane and silly and accomplishes one of two things exposition or forced character development. The dialogue itself rarely attempts to make us laugh. That's a problem since there's a good deal of time spent walking from place to place.It says a lot about our main characters that they wind up being chased andor hated by everyone they come into contact with. They wind up being hunted by at least three groups of people as the film progresses all of whom show up seemingly at random. These groups are often forgotten about until the script calls for them to pop up for a few minutes. You forget too and it makes their reappearances seem to come out of the blue. Sure the film is about these three guys  although it's really two of them because Jeff Chang isn't awake for most of his screen time  but if you want to continue bringing back these secondary characters at least treat them with a little respect.I'm sure that all of these actors have talent. Justin Chon turns in the best performance in the film whenever he's awake. Skylar Astin was in Pitch Perfect and fared much better there. He delivers every line with great sincerity but that doesn't work with this type of character. Miles Teller was in Project X and plays the same type of role here. He isn't good in either.21 and Over is pretty much the exact type of movie that you expect it to be. If you think The Hangover is funny you'll probably find this movie hilarious as well. It has issues with its characters dialogue and situations but if you find it funny you probably won't notice. I didn't like 21 and Over but if it sounds like your type of thing you'll probably get some enjoyment out of it.".

	onyx:emotionText "From the writers of 'The Hangover' comes 21 and Over another comedy about people getting really drunk and then having a bunch of crude and insane things happen to them. The difference here is that the three leads are not trying to find their buddy they're instead trying to find their buddy's house. Oh and the buddy whose house they're trying to find has passed out and has to be carried from place to place as the circumstances around them continue to get more dire.Let's back up a bit. It's Jeff Chang's Justin Chon 21st birthday. He's a premed student who has a big interview the next morning. His best friends Miller Miles Teller and Casey Skylar Astin have come to his apartment to surprise him and take him out for drinks as is the American custom. Upon learning that the biggest interview of his life is the next day Casey does the responsible thing and says that those plans can be postponed. Miller threatens to keep Jeff Chang up all night if he doesn't come out. One drink we're told. Like that's going to happen.We don't even see Jeff Chang resist the party once it starts. He's loaded by the time we've zoomed forward in time and only gets worse over the montage depicting the group's barhopping. Eventually he's passed out and time is running out to get him home and to bed. The other two friends are from out of town  they've all separated once college started I guess  so they don't know their way around. They spend nearly the rest of the film attempting to get him into bed before 7AM.Doesn't this sound familiar? Three guys trolling around a certain location in hopes of finding something or someone? While doing so they find themselves in a bunch of I can't believe it situations while also learning things about the others that perhaps should have been better left a secret. When Casey and Miller find a gun in Jeff Chang's pocket and later learn that he was arrested by the police we have a mystery on our hands. One whose conclusion is mishandled so badly that I thought there must have been an alternate ending.It feels too similar I suppose. We've seen movies that contain situations more shocking than this. When a guy gets run over by a buffalo  which we don't actually get to see by the way because the camera cuts to black before impact  that winds up being one of the more crazy points of the film. Sure a couple of other moments are funny at the time if only because at least one of the guys  Casey  doesn't seem like he deserved to be put through them but they're kind of bland for the genre.There are a few running gags scattered throughout  always calling Jeff Chang by his full name being one of them  but most of the humor in 21 and Over comes from the situations themselves. That can work for some people. Many of you might find a lot of the film funny. It wasn't for me. Watching stupid people act pretty stupid and have bad things happen to them isn't the funniest thing in the world. Like I said there are a few good moments but not enough of them to fill the 90minute running time.Moving away from the amount of laughter which is about all that matters in a comedy the dialogue also leaves a lot to be desired. The film was written and directed by The Hangover writers after all so that should be expected. It's all profane and silly and accomplishes one of two things exposition or forced character development. The dialogue itself rarely attempts to make us laugh. That's a problem since there's a good deal of time spent walking from place to place.It says a lot about our main characters that they wind up being chased andor hated by everyone they come into contact with. They wind up being hunted by at least three groups of people as the film progresses all of whom show up seemingly at random. These groups are often forgotten about until the script calls for them to pop up for a few minutes. You forget too and it makes their reappearances seem to come out of the blue. Sure the film is about these three guys  although it's really two of them because Jeff Chang isn't awake for most of his screen time  but if you want to continue bringing back these secondary characters at least treat them with a little respect.I'm sure that all of these actors have talent. Justin Chon turns in the best performance in the film whenever he's awake. Skylar Astin was in Pitch Perfect and fared much better there. He delivers every line with great sincerity but that doesn't work with this type of character. Miles Teller was in Project X and plays the same type of role here. He isn't good in either.21 and Over is pretty much the exact type of movie that you expect it to be. If you think The Hangover is funny you'll probably find this movie hilarious as well. It has issues with its characters dialogue and situations but if you find it funny you probably won't notice. I didn't like 21 and Over but if it sounds like your type of thing you'll probably get some enjoyment out of it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Watched 21 and Over last night at an advanced screening so sharing a review for those wondering about it.If you should use other filmsmedia to describe 21 and Over it is like a combination of Hang Over American Pie and Jackass. If describing in one sentence 21 and Over is stupid drunkenness or drunk galore? It is an enjoyable film and I would recommend it for those who enjoy dirty slapstick humor and just college craziness. I wouldn't feel the need to watch this film again and it isn't an Oscar nominee type of film but If you like watching drunk people this film is for you.I admit I like watching this type of films from time to time but a big reason I was interested in this film was because I liked the writers' Jon Lucas and Scott Moore's other pieces the popular Hang Over film series and Change Up. I did assume that 21 and Over would be structured and directed just like Hang Over but 21 and Over does not have the storytelling abilities that Hang Over has nor are the story plot resolution and characters anywhere as interesting. One's own experiences and perspectives change with age and Lucas and Moore are out of touch with the current 20s generation as the dialogue story development and characters in 21 and Over are old clichd and stereotypical.The movie took a while to pick up the pace. Surprisingly and thankfully Jeff Chang is not the main focus in this film nothing against the actors these newcomers did a great job but the supposed main character burned through his drinking and bar scenes early on in a series of montages.Some of the likable aspects of this movie are the timing of the stunts and how outrageous the stunts are. When it seemed like the film would end soon or run out of tricks the characters' rolling ball of chaos just got bigger and bigger. The stunts pulled now a day for slapstick humor are getting more outrageous and openly visually sexual. If nothing Lucas and Moore get kudos for fresh stunts. Perhaps they spent the time they were supposed to use for brainstorming dialogue and story development watching Jackass instead.In the end this film is still enjoyable because it's not like this film's audience watches these kinds of films for the dialogue nor accurate representation of cultural identities. All that matters is that the slapstick stunts and moderate dirtiness of the film is enough to not leave a silent house. For sure the high school kids during the advanced screening got a kick out of it hoping their college life can be that fun? Crazy at least.Review by WendyXSFeiXiangFilms".

A lot of the supporting characters are really funny so you're glad to see them each time they pop up throughout the film. I anticipated a lot of rubbish cheap racist Asian jokes to be dotted all over the script but only a few did and they were from a character that seemed like the kind of person who would say those kinds of jokes. This was quite relieving the film did its best to make jokes and references that people of a similar age would recognise and find funny.Overall this film is nonsense but the people who created it know this and don't try to pretend it's anything else.

Great time for another beer.I was aware that this film looked quite poor from the trailer and copious amounts of bad reviews however as i walked into the cinema merry after a few beers i thought it may be a nice easy watching movie with a few cheap laughs. I was wrong.This film is poor. Very poor.It is a very familiar concept a guy has the biggest exam of his life and his friends decide to try and persuade him to go out the night before and get completely wrecked. Of course he refuses at first and then of course he gives in. The acting is poor the script is awful and the characters are awful. None of them are funny or even slightly likable. The over the top scenes which are trying so hard to be funny fail on so many levels. A pathetic cringe worthy love story is also thrown into the middle of this movie which is just down right ridiculous. I don't know what else to say really apart from don't go and see this movie.".

Like anybody planning to sleep in a catharsis of vomit and food consumed from the afternoon 21  Over is a raunchy absurd highly energetic and overly confident comedy that unapologetically assaults its audience members with inappropriateness from beginning to end.On the day of Jeff Chang's Justin Chon 21st birthday his old friends Casey Skylar Astin and Miller Miles Teller show up to his residence on campus. Adamant to get him drunk despite a very important medical meeting the next morning that Dr. Chang Franois Chau had arranged Casey and Miller convince Jeff Chang to go out and party. What starts off with just a few drinks and a bit of misdirection turns out to be a riproaring journey into the dark corners of Jeff Chang's college campus.Where 21  Over succeeds and other movies like it fail is in the underlying themes and chemistry. In so many coming of age stories most notably Project X last year the friendships that were tested were not tested on the basis of any change. Oh sure a house was destroyed and a neighbourhood was in complete chaos but what did it matter to the protagonists? In 21  Over each one of the three friends are facing the biggest issues of their lives growing up. Often longer for some people sometimes a lot quicker and at times unknowingly to others the theme of growing up is the quintessential magic formula for coming of age rompcomedies. Just look at one of the best comedies of the last decade Wedding Crashers and how that theme was explored with oversized children as adults. The chemistry in 21  Over is spoton. Miles Teller is reminiscent of a young Vince Vaughan and his wildly fasttalking antics drives most of the ridiculous comedy forward with ease. Skylar Astin much like his previous role in Pitch Perfect serves as a worthy counterpart to Teller and the eye candy for female audience members to flock to theatres. If there is one thing that makes me mad about 21  Over and the previous writing efforts of the comedic writing duo Jon Lucas and Scott Moore is how simple their script ideas are yet how well done their narratives and plot points are. Penning the first two Hangover films it angers me to think how simple the premise for all their hits were and why I couldn't think of it myself. It seems like the writing duo have a knack for exploiting the obvious yet unexplored on film adding a lot of fun in the mix.21  Over is an outrageously fun time at the movies. Although the film may not be for everyone 21  Over is a flashback of so many times when the images on screen are so reminiscent of some of the stupid things that may have happened to you at one point or another. Don't deny it just laugh and enjoy the ride. Just like what Jeff Chang's yells at the bouncer before getting in 21blackjack motherfer!. Its not denying that 21  Over is definitely a sloppy winner!".

	schema:headline " Unrealistic and Doesn't Provide Laughs";
	schema:reviewBody "21  Over seemed to be a film which came and went and for good reasons. The trailer made sure to advertise that it was by the writers of the Hangover. This is what got people's attention of course. Now to the film simply by reading the synopsis you could tell that it is similar to the Hangover except aimed more towards teenagers and college students.21  Over is a mix of the Hangover Project X Superbad and the American Pie films. Though all those were superior. While watching 21  Over I tried to get engaged in the story and waiting for it to get better but it rarely did. The lead character Miller was unlikable and far too obnoxious right from beginning while sidekick Casey was slightly better as the typical preppy nice guy. Jeff Change was the third wheel tagged along who's 21st birthday it was. His performance was a little better but felt forced at certain moments. We first see when they take Jeff Chang to the bar to celebrate for his birthday realistic then he gets heavily wasted and can't wake up. It goes on for far too long where we see Miller and Casey carry him around town across to Sonoritys until they can find information to where he lives. It was hard to believe that through this entire time he was still drunk and was not able to wake up. About over an hour of story time the time in the film from where they went is with him being passed out. This wasn't realistic and two close friends would have made sure to wake up their drunk friend so they wouldn't have to go through all the trouble that the characters went through in the film.Low on laughs though many people will of course laugh at the situations that Miller and Casey get themselves in including a scene where they sneak in the wrong Sorority house along with the scenes with Jeff Chang acting under the influence acting crazy along with the constant curses in the dialogue. There was also a lot of nudity in the film more so male nudity than female nudity. The ending scenes of the film where we see Miller and Casey break Jeff Change out of the hospital is around where the film becomes better. We see the two of break him out Jeff Chang still being sick throwing him out the window landing on top of a vehicle Chang then stealing the vehicle and taking himself along with Miller and Casey to his house to get ready for his interview later on in a few minutes. Very predictable as we then see Chang not really wanting to become a doctor but being forced but his over protective father. I enjoyed how this all spilled out as it felt more realistic than it's previous parts. Also enjoyed how along their journey people were telling information about Jeff Chang that had them in shock failing is science program partially bring a criminal stealing a gun etc.. The very last scene seemed to be left over for a sequel. Miller having confidence in himself enrolls himself into college we then see him from an obvious hangover his hair dyed in crutches as well as being late opening the door for his interview as a he looks sees a the professor turned around in his chair then as he turns around Millers notices a familiar face. It turns out to be the Chief a character shown throughout the film in costume parading for his needs. They acquaint each other then the film ends.There were many problems and flaws I found with 21  Over. Some of the them include it isn't good enough for people wanting more we have seen films like this in the past and executed better most of the jokes aren't funny including many racist jokes by Miller the dialogue is filled with constant F bombs which is okay when well written but this was overboard a lot of stereotypes of characters in the film and the overall plot and the way it all happened was unrealistic.".

But that would mean this would have to be an extended movie review which would increase the chances of not being read thoroughly by you. The film stars Miles Teller as Miller a slackertype college dropout who most probably spent too much of his Miller time partying and not concentrating on his studies. Skylar Astin costars as Casey Miller's preppy high school best buddy who reunites with Miller so they could take out their other high school compadre Jeff Chang played by Justin Chon for a liquorish hardpartying night on the town to celebrate his liquor legalization into the world in other words to celebrate his 21st birthday. So as Wang Chang I mean Chung sings about they want for everybody to have fun tonight. Jeff Chang as Miller and Casey call him instead of the good ol' calling someone by their first name is in a predicament because the next morning he is scheduled for a very important interview for a premed medical employment position set up by his imposing pressuring dad Dr. Chang. When the night on the town becomes a wild partying romp which causes Jeff Chang to be heavily liquored up it is up to Miller  Casey to take him back home before Dr. Chang finds out about his son's fiesta time. The big predicament is that Miller  Casey are not aware of Jeff Chang's address so they go on this wild goose chase to locate a gorgeous sorority female friend of Chang named Nicole in order to obtain his address and also Casey has his own personal reasons to chase down the hottie Nicole. Are you still with me? Anyways Jon Lucas  Scott Moore who both wrote and directed it really took two people to develop this crap 21  Over have developed an unoriginal lame movie which has the same formulaic features as most of the teen partying movies in the past. So just because it's 21 and Over it does not mean it gives it a legalization credence. While he was handed a farcical screenplay I must say what saved this film from ultimate disaster was the fasttalking charismatic performance of Miles Teller. However I cannot say the same for the robotic acting effort of Skylar Astin as Casey and the overthetop work of Justin Chon as Jeff Chang try to say that 20 times without stuttering. Even though it was healthy for the eyes to look at Sarah Wright's performance as Nicole was lifeless and stereotypical in this type of genre. Lucas  Moore's screenplay was so awful that I think someone 12  Under could have written up a better scribe of 21  Over. Teller's performance is the sole reason I would even consider a marginal recommendation of this movie but even that is not enough to card you at the door to enter the silly world of 21  Over.  Average".

	schema:reviewBody "After enduring a series of movies over the past two months so bad that the word bad is woefully inadequate I thought I might have reached the nadir with such titles as Playing For Keeps The Last Stand A Good Day to Die Hard Hansel  Gretel Witch Hunters Identity Thief Parental Guidance and other works of low quality  that is until I was forced to view the latest comedic travesty that is 21 and Over.And since this forum will not allow a grade lower than one star I am reluctantly unable to award it the 10 it more than justly deserves.Relativity Media's attempt to make a juvenile The Hangover meets Animal House meets Revenge of the Nerds succeeds only in the juvenile part and codirectors and scribblers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore The ChangeUp seemed to have thrown any attempt at humor out the window replacing that emotion with senseless drug and alcohol abuse mindnumbing violence racism nauseating nudity misogyny and unabashed stupidity. In fact this was the first movie since 2009's Observe and Report to actually make this critic physically ill.I'm not sure if the upset stomach was because I was already a tad woozy from the flu but the splitting headache was no doubt caused by this production which stars absolutely no one and elicits no laughs whatsoever  unless one finds things like projectile vomiting urinating on people being drunk and stoned to the point of annoyance being spanked with a cricket bat automobile accidents people being thrown from balconies and beaten senseless animal abuse making fun of the mentally ill parental violence and probably worst of all a throbbing and brain tumorinducing rap soundtrack that pulsates ceaselessly throughout this unmitigated disaster  a fun time.And while I knew I wasn't going to see Shakespeare with this picture it doesn't mean I wanted to see a pile of crap either. In fact 21 and Over was obviously made for individuals with mental ages of 10 and under.I suppose some explanation of the pointless plot is in order so here goes Viewers are first greeted with a shot of two naked guys and their red and beaten butts  and things go downhill from there. We then see longtime buddies Miller Miles Teller Project X another vivid example of how today's youth and unlimited partying definitely does not go together and Casey Skylar Astin Pitch Perfect travel to an anonymous college town to visit a third chum the super brainiac Jeff Chang Justin Chon Twilight to help him celebrate his 21st birthday. It's too bad they showed up though because Chang has a very important interview with a bigtime medical school the next day.Throwing caution  and intelligence  to the wind Chang decides to have just one beer but of course we know the night will escalate into a series of wild debauchery frat parties pep rallies which seem to go on all night and breaking into a Latina sorority for no other reason than to add female exploitation and objectification to the mix all of which leads to arrests incarcerations and suicide holds. And the laughs keep coming friends.Even the inclusion of a tepid romantic triangle between Casey Nicole Sarah Wright Celeste and Jesse Forever and her cheerleader boyfriend Randy Jonathan Keltz Prom brings nothing but cringes to the table. As does the phony friends falling out but coming back together routine.Then after all of the completely lame attempts to squeeze any kind of laugh from this effort we're supposed to care when the movie decides  at the last minute  to send us some kind of message. It's way too late and I am far too ticked off to care at this point.If 21 and Over is ANY kind of example of how today's American youth gets its jollies I am perfectly content to either move to a Third World country or to just live in the past.Either choice is better than this monstrosity.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you've seen the trailer for 21 and Over there's no reason you should be surprised at its content. It's a juvenile tasteless retread through the gutter of party movies explicit in language redundant in debauchery and forgettable almost entirely. Contrary to those who believe I went in with the preconceived mindset to dislike this film I was quite optimistic the trailer got one laugh out of me. It was tied with last year's romp Project X for the number of laughs it generated.Seeing as I laughed once in the trailer and once in the actual film this technically makes 21 and Over a funnier film than Project X although that's not saying too much. It continues to accentuate every loathsome quality of the youth in America for us to laugh at and for other countries to sneer at. For those who can't see why I'd dislike a film like this it's the aftertaste I get with these films that really sits uncomfortably with me. To think how people in other countries see the twentysomethings of America after these films really makes me upset.Our story immediately breeds contempt with his familiarity two collegian friends named Miller Miles Teller and Casey Skylar Astin decide to pick up their friend Jeff Chang Justin Chon to party on his twentyfirst birthday. Jeff Chang who is always referred to by his full name for whatever reason has an important medical interview the following day and tells his friends that he can't party but they don't listen and force him to live up his birthday with them. When Jeff Chang gets so drunk and incoherent that he can't stand up straight Miller and Casey carry him around town haplessly Weekend at Bernie'sstyle searching for his house in order to get him ready for his interview in a few hours.Watching these nitwits wander around town in search of their pals home while dragging him on his feet carrying him like an infant or tossing him in the back of a golfcart as they go down the stairs is not one of the definitions of comedy for me. If it's yours embrace it because this is the kind of humor you're in for. It wasn't long ago that I saw Seth Gordon's Identity Thief a mostly mediocre film that predicated itself off of tired formula and worn jokes. it functioned in the genre of comedies that I label maximum antics minimum laughter which the same can be said for 21 and Over but at least Identity Thief was buoyed by charismatic leads. Sure they were subjected to pretty trite material but they weren't as bland and faceless as the teens in this film. Aside from Justin Chon who seems like an actor that can be capable in a role if he wasn't playing dead for twothirds of the movie no one seems to truly be inspired by this material.But again how could they? This kind of script leaves almost nothing notable in terms of influence subject characters or events. It's the kind of film young actors use as their breakout role. If there's any positivity in this film it's that hopefully the young stars here are welcomed to more efficient projects that do not capitalize off of senseless debauchery.Finally do I need to make note of how degrading this film is to both sexes? It's not as hopelessly nihilistic as Project X per say but it's definitely not as spirited as one would hope. The men are chauvinistic selfcentered dogs motivated by sex popularity and hormonal lust while the women are no better than the size of their breasts and buttocks. What a shock.The writingdirecting team behind the 2009 comedy success The Hangover have gone on to make a film that simply feels gridlocked in its unambitious nature. It contains roughly two healthy laughs in its ninetythree minute runtime features forgettable instances of brutality and disregard for safety shows how manipulating and careless seemingly best friends can be with each other and further throws its fun down the drain in favor of having a money mindset. If there's one positive to come out of all of this it will give me time to reflect on my choice of friends in the future.My video review of 21 and Over httpwww.youtube.comwatch?v63C8Aubcv8cStarring Miles Teller Skylar Astin Justin Chon and Sarah Wright.

Also like The Hangover the cast was primarily Caucasian which to me seems unrealistic but it's just a movie at the end of the day. You will instantly laugh as soon as the movie starts and won't stop until the end. If you loved the hangover you should definitely see 21 and Over".

When he gets too drunk to find his house the hilarity ensues I wish. This movie could have been good and I'm not expecting Oscarworthy here but instead it was a rehash of movies we've all seen before. Now I should also say that I didn't like Project X.

Reviewers posting they walked out after 15 minutes really shouldn't contribute here. And quite frankly you need to have a serious problem if you are analyzing the actors voices with respect to the original artists. This movie is good fun and true to the times... This movie is THE musical for all rockers out there! Absolutely wonderful fun for the family with a stellar performance from the entire cast. A good couple of chuckles in there and if you're over 35 years old... I dare you to not sing along with some of those classics.

It put me right in the Bourbon Room audience blithely wearing the tasteless and bizarre outfits that I couldn't wear because I was setting a standard of decorum for my kids in those days and embarrassing them was anathema. It features a period of Rock 1987 when the genre was flanked by inane crap music aimed at the 1316 year olds I was raising. Fortunately they didn't bite. This movie features the memorable music of the decade that my grandson is now still honoring. This music and that of the late 60's and early 70's helped me as a beleaguered working mom Rock through a day of commutes housework and culture shock. I don't get  the focus on plot and antics that some of the more serious reviewers are stroking themselves with. I paid 8.00 and didn't fancy myself being at a rock concert or a stage play but I got all of that feel and more. I would have paid 30 just to see Baldwin grunged and desperate but hopeful. Cruise's character looked shaky at first. But as usual in trademark style he starts off blas and then explodes into passion and surprise. Paul Giamatti and ZetaJones were fun to despise in their hypocrisy. Hough and Boneta were fresh talented and beautiful. Mary J. Blige Justice Charlier was superb and although I never got Russell Brand before he was the most fun of all. Leave your pretense at home. PLOT!? Yada Yada. If you are pushin' or draggin' 60 go pig out on some Italian and party with Rock of Ages.".

	onyx:emotionText "I'm 60 I want to have some fun and this movie was fun. It put me right in the Bourbon Room audience blithely wearing the tasteless and bizarre outfits that I couldn't wear because I was setting a standard of decorum for my kids in those days and embarrassing them was anathema. It features a period of Rock 1987 when the genre was flanked by inane crap music aimed at the 1316 year olds I was raising. Fortunately they didn't bite. This movie features the memorable music of the decade that my grandson is now still honoring. This music and that of the late 60's and early 70's helped me as a beleaguered working mom Rock through a day of commutes housework and culture shock. I don't get  the focus on plot and antics that some of the more serious reviewers are stroking themselves with. I paid 8.00 and didn't fancy myself being at a rock concert or a stage play but I got all of that feel and more. I would have paid 30 just to see Baldwin grunged and desperate but hopeful. Cruise's character looked shaky at first. But as usual in trademark style he starts off blas and then explodes into passion and surprise. Paul Giamatti and ZetaJones were fun to despise in their hypocrisy. Hough and Boneta were fresh talented and beautiful. Mary J. Blige Justice Charlier was superb and although I never got Russell Brand before he was the most fun of all. Leave your pretense at home. PLOT!? Yada Yada. If you are pushin' or draggin' 60 go pig out on some Italian and party with Rock of Ages.";

Tom Cruise is a hoot in his role think Axl Rose and the others weren't bad either. Small cameos by some 80's rock stars. I have seem some references to its similarity to Grease and its portrayal of the 1950's. I think that is a pretty good comparison. Again if you are not a fan of the 80's you probably won't like this too much. But if you like the 80's and its music you will probably enjoy this movie and leave with a smile.".

Those looking for realism should recognize that a musical is never an actual representation of the day and most often is a parody exaggerating and mocking its point.

	schema:reviewBody "There are no real spoilers in this review just some minor plot details.I had the privilege of being able to see this at an advance screening a couple of months ago. Just to let you know I have never seen the Broadway show so I can't compare the two.On one hand Tom Cruise stole the show as he always does. He plays the role of aging rocker Stacee Jaxx tasked with saving the Bourbon Room from the villainous Patricia Whitmore's ZetaJones wrath. He has a killer voice and he shared some great chemistry with journalist Constance Sack Malin Akerman. I think everybody is going to love those two together.On the other hand the two lovebirds Sherrie Christian Julianne Hough and Drew Boley Diego Boneta just did not bring a lot of chemistry. And their acting ability is so far inferior to the likes of the Cruises Baldwins and the Giamattis of the world. And when they are the leads it kind of brings down the movie a little bit. The singing was great but isn't that the standard for musicals? I would've preferred Brittany Snow be cast alongside the original Drew Constantine Maroulis. Even though I have not seen the original play live I've seen numerous of his performances either live or on the computer.Another critique I have is that the whole thing is a little too much. This film felt a little busy to me. I almost wish someone would have told Adam Shankman to tone it down a little because it fizzled a little towards the end.The musical numbers in were just incredible. As someone in the younger generation I don't believe I could appreciate the the 80s music as much as the people born in the later 1950s 1960s and early 1970s. But make no mistake every single number was executed pretty well. I happened to like the performances more than Shankman's previous musical Hairspray.It was legitimately funny. Even if you don't like Tom Cruise personally he kills it in every movie he's in. His scenes are the best. I was also impressed by the performances of Alec Baldwin Russell Brand and Paul Giamatti. Even singer Mary J. Blige got involved.This is a movie that is some big time fun. It's not for everybody as the person sitting next to me reminded me of. But if you liked Shankman's Hairspray then you'll probably have a place for this one in your heart too.Kudos to Adam Shankman and Chris D'Arenzio creater for achieving what they wanted to accomplish.".

A few upfront disclosures are in order I spent quite a few evenings on the Sunset Strip during the era of this story I had no idea who Diego Boneta was and only vague name recognition of Julianne Hough when I walked in and I never saw the hit Broadway production. These points may help explain my reaction to the movie.The opening sequence immediately informs us that we are in for something different. Aspiring singer Sherrie Christian Ms. Hough is running from her backwoods Oklahoma life to the bright lights of fame offered by Hollywood. While on the bus we get the first of an endless stream of staged karaoke routines ... Sister Christian get it??. Once on Sunset Boulevard she is quickly mugged and then comforted by Drew Mr. Boneta an aspiring singer and current barhop at The Bourbon an obvious nod to such hallowed rock ground as Whisky A Go Go and Roxy.No need to spend much time discussing plot. There is a muddled love story filled with teenager dreams and miscommunication and a financial crisis at The Bourbon thanks to back taxes owed by manager Dennis Dupree Alec Baldwin and a political backlash against the club thanks to the Mayor's wife Catherine ZetaJones who has a not so secret need for revenge. The only way to save the club is for rock idol Stacee Jaxx Tom Cruise to play a gig. The only way to save the love story is to write it out of the film all together. The political agenda is simply an excuse to add two more excruciating karaoke numbers.What little fun there is in the movie is thanks to Cruise Baldwin and Russell Brand who plays Baldin's sidekick and confidant. Cruise jumps into the Jaxx role with both feet and seems to understand that a parody should be fun. Being a rock idol isn't far removed from being the biggest movie star on the planet so Cruise blends Axl Rose and Bret Michaels to create Jaxx ... throw in a pet baboon two Hemen bodyguards an endless train of groupies and a dragon codpiece ... and you get Stacee Jaxx legendary rock star.If one is going to make a rock 'n roll movie it either needs to be played straight Almost Famous or as a headon parody This is Spinal Tap. What it can't do is celebrate the dead zone of lameness lame music covered by lame singers playing lame characters. No amount of star power actors can overcome material that doesn't capture the power and passion of the music. And we aren't even talking real rock n roll here ... this is glam rock stadium rock big hair bands. Yet the movie still falls incredibly short of making a statement or providing insight or even entertainment.Cruise's performance generates some laughs as do Baldwin and Brand. However Hough and Boneta aren't even cringeworthy. They have no screen presence and neither belong in a rock movie. Maybe the real problem is that most of the songs in the movie have survived these 25 years because of their mediocrity ... they can easily be sung while intoxicated. Evidently that's not enough for a decent movie.".

That threw me off right away because the attention to detail of the era was lacking. But on to the acting and the music. The only real shining star of the movie was Tom Cruise. And I don't even like him. But he was fun to watch. Everyone else seemed air brushed and auto tuned. Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin were also decent. But the entire movie just didn't seem 80s enough to me. I'll put it this way. During the first hour I was debating walking out. The second hour I was checking my watch. I made it through but wish I had been more into it. On another note what was 80s about the strip club? The outfits the interior....nothing said 80s to me. I feel like whoever was styling this movie either wasn't alive during the 80s or doesn't remember how everything including outfits looked. Anyway I give it a 4 for Tom Cruise.

I went in and gave it an honest chance and had to get out of there when Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin started singing together in a hairbrush. It almost seemed like a really bad version of a Glee episode. The music selection we heard was great but it was very karaoke and I didn't care much for that. I couldn't even stay in my seat long enough to see Tom Cruise's character. Frankly I'm not even sure I could rent this movie to see if the rest was as bad as it began. The trailer for the movie gave it a much different feel and it was kind of deceiving. Big thumbs down from me!!".

	schema:reviewBody "A musical starring Tom Cruise as a rock singer and featuring some of the best rock songs of the 1980s seems like this would be a lot of fun to see in theaters.STORY Rock of Ages takes place in 1987 and follows a girl from a small Midwestern town Sherrie Christian Julianne Hough and a boy from the big city Drew Boley Diego Boneta who meet in Hollywood while they are pursuing their dreams. While at Hollywood Sherrie gets a job at the Bourbon Room a nightclub run by two guys Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin. They are going to be showing Stacee Jaxx Tom Cruise and his band Arsenal to perform at the place. While this is happening they  along with other characters in the movie  do covers of '80s rock music.MY THOUGHTS I was excited while going into Rock of Ages. Not only because Tom Cruise stars in this but because it looks like it would be a fun moviewatching experience and that's what really good musicals  like Grease or the 2007 version of Hairspray  intend to be. Maybe musicals don't have to have a good story to make it great but only just a way to make the audience to have fun and to be entertained by them.I didn't go into Rock of Ages expecting it be the best musical like Grease. I just went in expecting to have a great time at the theater and that's what I got. Although it wasn't a perfect movie it was still a very good experience at the theater.The musical numbers  which are covers of some of the best rock songs of the 1980s  they were firstrate. I thought they were added at the right place at the right time and all the actors did an excellent job singing and dancing to whatever song they covered. Most of them were wellchoreographed and they were very entertaining to watch. The story to Rock of Ages although it isn't really strong it isn't bad either. It was wellpaced and easy to follow. Yes it does become rather predictable at the end.THE ACTING One of the main reasons why I was so looking forward to see Rock of Ages is because of Tom Cruise. I thought he did fantastic playing the rock singer Stacee Jaxx. This time Tom Cruise wasn't being his regular self he was being like an actual singer for a rock band. I think this is one of his best performances of his career.Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta although their singing and dancing were fine their acting wasn't really great. I didn't care for their romance all that much.The rest of the supporting cast was good Alec Baldwin Russell Brand Paul Giamatti Malin Akerman and Catherine ZetaJones they were good.IN CONCLUSION Although not a perfect movie Rock of Ages is a fun musical that is definitely worth seeing in theaters that have great surround sound. If you like 80s music this movie is for you. If you like Tom Cruise this movie is still for you.710".

	schema:reviewBody "Take Spinal Tap Mamma Mia and Almost Famous wrap them all together and play it with a face as straight as a razor and you have Rock Of Ages. I haven't laughed this hard in ages. For those who expected something serious when Tom Cruise literally sang into the butt of a woman that should have been a giveaway that this movie shouldn't be taken seriously. I think the problem most people have is that it's all played with such a straight face that it's not obvious this is a comedy. It also helps if you are familiar with the music even better if you grew up with the music. For those who complain the cast doesn't sing as well as the original artists that's the point. All these songs exist these days only in karaoke bars. That's part of the fun. Did the guys from Wayne's World sing Bohemian Rapsody as well as Queen? It seems with this one you either get it or you don't. I can see if you don't get it how this can come off as one of the worst musicals of all time. But if you get it the fact that this is the worst musical of all time IS THE POINT. It is absolutely hilarious. I honestly haven't laughed this hard since I rewatched Slapshot for the umpteenth time. This movie is nothing short of brilliant.".

	onyx:emotionText "Take Spinal Tap Mamma Mia and Almost Famous wrap them all together and play it with a face as straight as a razor and you have Rock Of Ages. I haven't laughed this hard in ages. For those who expected something serious when Tom Cruise literally sang into the butt of a woman that should have been a giveaway that this movie shouldn't be taken seriously. I think the problem most people have is that it's all played with such a straight face that it's not obvious this is a comedy. It also helps if you are familiar with the music even better if you grew up with the music. For those who complain the cast doesn't sing as well as the original artists that's the point. All these songs exist these days only in karaoke bars. That's part of the fun. Did the guys from Wayne's World sing Bohemian Rapsody as well as Queen? It seems with this one you either get it or you don't. I can see if you don't get it how this can come off as one of the worst musicals of all time.

This will give you an idea of what too expect!This is supposed to represent the music scene in LA with focus on Sunset Strip around 1987. Really?! Are you kidding me?! Several of these bands had nothing do do with the scene there and so many that SHOULD have been represented are not! Performing wise then? Well some of the performances are that bad but most really aren't that good. Meaning a real singer can role outta bed 3 in the morning hung over and having smoked 2 packs of cigarettes and still sing better but the actors do OK. The huge problems is no feeling....90 of it have absolutely no feeling at all. When it comes to that it sounds cold and clinical with zero attachment to the song they're singing. Maybe I'm biased here since I'm a musician myself but I really expected a bit more than this! Make me belief that you BELIEVE in what your singing about. Gimme some emotion here......alas...none! Honestly I couldn't even see the whole thing without hitting fast forward to get past to most embarrassing parts. If you are a Tom Cruise fanatic you might enjoy this. If you love musicals sure...why not. If you grew up with 80's rock hardrock heavy metal....well no.If you want a rockmovie that beats this by lightyears both acting and performing wise...see Rockstar with Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston. Rock of Ages?! Yeah....right!".

And that's my point take him out of the film and you have a big fat nothing.To me it was simply a collection of wellchoreographed music videos held loosely together by one of the weakest screenplays I've experienced in a long time. When one looks back at past musicals of note Chicago for example this one was lacking in any sense of accomplishment. Yes I know it wasn't to be taken seriously  how could it be? I'd like to say that it was at least worth it to see ZetaJones back in form. I am however convinced that this was without a doubt her all time worst performance in a film. What was she thinking when she accepted the totally ridiculous role as the L.A. mayor's inhibited selfdenying wife? It just wants to make you cringe to think that such a talented actress would subject herself to such humiliation. Maybe I just didn't get it.Without resorting to details the scene between Baldwin and Brand's characters anyone whose seem the film knows which one was unsettling and absurd. It didn't affect me personally but it just didn't seem right or appropriate.I've never been a fan of watching characters in a film break out into spontaneous song in the middle of even a mildly dramatic scene. It always grabs me the wrong way. Thank the gods that it doesn't happen in real life.In the end if you're in to musicals you'll probably like this one. If not like me you've likely suffered through it for someone else's benefit. But hey we all have to do that at some point. Like I said to my better half You owe me big time for this one.".

The song list they had chosen to sing in this movie went along with the storyline and flowed throughout the movie. As for the singing well it was spot on and delightful to listen to. Had me singing a lot of the songs with them. Each character was playing such a big role with the almost ensemble cast it seemed. Tom Cruise crushed it as the Rock Legend Stacee Jaxx it was very intriguing to see what his character would do throughout the movie. Julianne Hough was stunningly beautiful in every scene and her singing was nice as well but it seemed she could use some better acting. Mary J. Blige was good in her role and really brought good quality to her character in the film that it made her star for her sort of little camera time. Overall I would recommend musical lovers and nonmusical lovers to watch this for good entertainment and great music.".

It's hard to imagine this happened ten years ago in a Western European country and yet it DID happen and it could  and probably will  happen again. That's why it is so important to deal with the topic of police violence instead of ignoring it or playing it down. The film crew and cast did a great job capturing the horror of this disastrous event. And that's what 'Diaz' mainly seems to be about recreating and contextualizing the occurred violations of human rights in 2001 in Italy as authentic and accurate as it can be done in a feature film. It obviously wants you to be shocked but with good reasons it describes shocking incidents which should not be trivialized. If you do some research you'll find out that the film indeed does not exaggerate anything. But it does NOT inform you about the political background you have to inform yourself.

	schema:headline " Diaz raid in Genoa in 2001 shown with violent visuals in full force. Much more than a documentary due to personal stories behind the dire event";
	schema:reviewBody "The film Diaz  Don't clear up the blood had its world premiere in Berlin as part of the Berlinale 2012 film festival in front of a full house with an estimated 1750 viewers. The screening ended with an overwhelming applause that lasted for an unusual long time. A considerable part of those involved in making this film was present. In his introduction the director mentioned that several victims of the raid were among them. He admired their preparedness to relive the dire event.The film title has two parts. The first Diaz part refers to the name of the school where the raid took place. The police thinks it is a nest full of black bloc allegedly being the core of demonstrations around the G8 summit in 2001 in Genoa Italy. The second Don't clean... part refers to a hand made sign that was written on the wall after the raid actually asking to keep intact what was left behind. That included large blood stains all over floors and walls very useful as indisputable contradictory statement against the police PR.A clever scenario circles around what happened rather than treating events chronologically. An important feature of the film is that we were introduced to miscellaneous persons having specific roles later on. This served as a binding element elevating the film above a simple documentary. As the director said due to these minor roles you better remember the events afterwards. We see for example an elderly tourist who got detached from his bus tour and was only looking for a place to sleep. Another example is a journalist from a rightwing magazine taking leave to report from the inside out. Many more such personal stories develop along the line working out exactly as the director mentioned.We were also offered an impression how average policemen stand in this. The tone is set in a scene where we see how a police car gets lost in some neighborhood they better stay out. They are immediately surrounded by angry citizens calling them murderers the result of a recent event where one person was killed in the course of a demonstration. The policemen feel threatened but escape unharmed.Also from a law enforcement viewpoint but on a different level we observe several decision makers district attorney police commanders city council etc. They had to depend on biased reports from police officers finally deciding to proceed on very weak grounds but we must do something. Various evidence was planted to support their decision or declared solid evidence later on. Benign empty bottles were allegedly stocked there for making Molotov cocktails. The PR aftermath from the police was evidently biased too Best example were remarks about prepared wounds said to have already existed before the raid with express intent to blame the police later on. Of course speaking of obvious bias is easy for us to say we had ample chance to see the general picture from both sides.The actual raid is visualized in full force about halfway the two hours running time. What we see before and after this core scene continuously circles around it by showing whereabouts of victims and bystanders and how they got involved. All are clearly innocent of the bad things the police attributed to them. They all happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. These personal stories however small and trivial in the context of what is happening work very well to elevate this film above a dry documentary that only states facts.I could not help wondering how useful it is to show the raid in every nasty detail. One important reason is that pictures speak one thousand words. We can expect the impact on the average viewer to be much greater than only words. A second reason could be that the film clearly shows the needlessly exaggerated amount of police power put into force just for a relatively small unarmed group. A perfect illustration was the scene were everyone was standing with hands above their heads apparently believing that an explicit show of being unarmed and defenseless would suffice but the police bulldozed over them regardless.We witnessed a meeting of city council and law enforcement decision makers giving a clear insight how it could come that far. The proof that lefties not my words were gathering was very thin long hair hoodies what further proof do we need?. Also noteworthy was a statement from the police commander that he would be unable to control his men once in action. After that we saw a rather sketchy briefing for the policemen in the field merely amplifying already dormant feelings that Diaz housed very illegal nearterrorist actions. After such a biased preparation the heavily visualized police brutality within Diaz becomes a bit more understandable. The instructions to the policemen conveyed an image of illegality with adversaries determined to plan demonstrations and other unlawful actions.Part of the final credits were some statistics about policemen and other officials convicted for involvement in the action. That is how the system works but I'm certain it took years to come to final convictions. And above all it leaves us with doubts whether it will improve future decision making. And last but not least it won't repair the internal and external wounds of the victims having to live on with the consequences.All in all an impressive document about the raid providing very useful insights in what happened before and after. The various personal stories bring it to a much higher level than just a documentary. Also very interesting is that we see both sides and the mechanisms involved how things like this get out of control.".

	schema:headline " I was at Diaz";
	schema:reviewBody "In Late April 2009 I got a call in London to come to Genova to meet several mystery guests who wanted to meet me and several of the other Diaz victims. I was coming anyway to see Dr Zucca The Genova prosecutor but I was intrigued to find out who the mystery guests were. I met Domenico Procacci and Daniele Vicari in Genova at the Via San Luca office where the Diaz case is archived in late May for a 'secret weekend meeting' after the Cannes Film Festival.At the time I did not know who Procacci and Vicari were but I was told they were the best film producer and director in Italy and they wanted to make a movie of the raid on Diaz during the G8. I had seen Gomorrah Procacci's mafia film and thought it was brilliant. Using this film as a comparison I listened to what Domenico wanted to say to all of us present. Procacci explained to us that he had wanted to make a multimillion euro film about the raid for a long time but had been prevented because the trial process against the police.He was willing to risk a lot of money on the project and we could all see that Domenico and Daniele were committed to making the movie. I personally told them that whilst I had a lot of personal confidence I thought the Diaz police would try and stop the project or the right ring politicians like Berlusconi or Fini my sue Fandango. I also told them that Diaz is still live court case and that they had to do a lot of research.After all of us from Diaz consulted with each other we gave Domenico Procacci and Daniele Vicari permission to make the film. All of us were taking a risk allowing a production company like fandango access to the video evidence  photos and documents involved in the trial. However we all felt that the story of the raid and what we had lived through had to be told to the rest of the world.What is unusual about the Diaz movie was that there was no script in existence so Fandango commissioned Laura Paolucci to spend two years writing a script. The end result is a pulp fiction style film which is 80 true to the story of Diaz. Obviously Vicari could not go into detail about the entire G8 which forms the backdrop for the beginning of the film but I think Vicari has done an almost perfect job of marrying together true events with a few high drama fictional characters.I think the combination of powerful high impact footage recreated scenes and the chance of lifting the lift on the inside of the antiglobalization movement makes Diaz the movie a special film. The 2001 G8 was the biggest and worst riot in Europe in 60 years. To complete the film Vicari has combined the usual high quality style of Italian film screening to capture this important moment of history making it one of the best most talked about and most controversial films to come out of Italy in 20 years.Only after the film had premiered in Berlin did I learn that Procacci had said that Diaz had been his most challenging and complicated film to makewith Vicari in agreement.My story is played by an Italian actor Pietro Ragusa and my almost death is one of the penultimate scenes in the movie. Because I ran out of Diaz I took the full force of Canterini's unit the 7th Mobile heavy riot unit that had specially trained for the Genova G8 summit. Pietro's part is almost as it exactly happened and I am very happy despite the scene is one of the most harrowing.".

	schema:headline " Flawed but heartfelt and factually accurate";
	schema:reviewBody "I just can't believe that even now there are people like one reviewer on this page who are so nakedly towing the fascist party line on Genoa. The Diaz raid WAS as bad as this film makes out... at least according to the severely injured and traumatized protesters it was. And call me crazy but their take on the events matters a lot more to me than what some disconnected overseas film critic who wasn't even there has to say. Especially a critic who is more or less quoting the same anticommunist lines that the police in this film dispensed as they were beating people up...! That aside I want to say that this film while overlong and brutal is extremely hard to stop watching because it is so heartfelt. I was 24 when these events happened and I was attending the equivalent actions in London. Being that we were all so connected to the global antiglobalization movement if that's not a contradiction in terms? my friends and I were among the first people outside of Genoa to hear about the events at Diaz. Back then I assumed from the descriptions given by Indymedia that it was pretty awful they described the blood on the floor and walls as well as the fact that women and elderly people were beaten in their sleep. Even so I still didn't grasp the full extent of the damage until I saw this reenactment. What would have been a good addition to this film though would have been to show some of the aftermath in which various countries pursued justice for their respective citizens and were rebuffed by the Italian authorities with what can only be described as fascist zeal. This left the rest of Europe shaken I believe in the same way that the abuse meted out by the police left the left activist scene shaken. It was also a telling moment in the anticapitalist movement because it demonstrated how little the values of the masses actually mattered to the elite.One interesting commentary that kind of sums the whole event up was made by Nick Davies of the Guardian eight years after the fact. He wrote that at Genoa the police acted as though somebody had promised them impunity. Since none of the assailants ever served time for their crimes we can safely assume that that promise was upheld... and continues to do so. But by whom? I guess the answer lies is in the name of the entity whose summit the Genoa Social Forum was protesting against.".

That aside I want to say that this film while overlong and brutal is extremely hard to stop watching because it is so heartfelt. I was 24 when these events happened and I was attending the equivalent actions in London. Being that we were all so connected to the global antiglobalization movement if that's not a contradiction in terms? my friends and I were among the first people outside of Genoa to hear about the events at Diaz. Back then I assumed from the descriptions given by Indymedia that it was pretty awful they described the blood on the floor and walls as well as the fact that women and elderly people were beaten in their sleep. Even so I still didn't grasp the full extent of the damage until I saw this reenactment. What would have been a good addition to this film though would have been to show some of the aftermath in which various countries pursued justice for their respective citizens and were rebuffed by the Italian authorities with what can only be described as fascist zeal. This left the rest of Europe shaken I believe in the same way that the abuse meted out by the police left the left activist scene shaken. It was also a telling moment in the anticapitalist movement because it demonstrated how little the values of the masses actually mattered to the elite.One interesting commentary that kind of sums the whole event up was made by Nick Davies of the Guardian eight years after the fact. He wrote that at Genoa the police acted as though somebody had promised them impunity. Since none of the assailants ever served time for their crimes we can safely assume that that promise was upheld... and continues to do so. But by whom? I guess the answer lies is in the name of the entity whose summit the Genoa Social Forum was protesting against.";

The hunt for the white buffalo in the Black Hills is presented as a psychological battle in the mind of Wild Bill Hickok Bronson and a spiritual one for Chief Crazy Horse Will Sampson. Sure the creature itself may look unrealisticbut the concept of battling your nightmares and the teaming up of two racial enemies as well as the dark cold almost sinister locations make this an interesting experience in my view. I also feel the dialogue is extremely appropriate with the use of 'Gold Diggers slang'. I am sure I am in a minority when I say I like this film so much.".

	schema:reviewBody "To understand the failure of WHITE BUFFALO one has to explain what moviegoers and critics were expecting when the film was released back in 1977. WHITE BUFFALO was released in the late 1970s in between KING KONG and ORCA which were all produced by Dino de Laurentiis. WHITE BUFFALO was seen then as part of this unofficial Big Animal on the Rampage trilogy de Laurentiis produced. This is unfortunate because amongst the three movies WB is the best and clearly the most misunderstood movie of the bunch and one of the most misunderstood movies ever made. Timing is everything and in WHITE BUFFALO's case everything went against it.After the spat of spaghetti westerns made during the 1960s and early 1970s audiences grew tired of them. They wanted something else. By the early 1970s to mid 70s the number of westerns was dwindling fast and western stars like Charles Bronson needed to make a transition away from the tired genre. In 1974 Bronson starred in DEATH WISH which became a huge hit all over the world. Bronson was suddenly seen as a contemporary action hero Clint Eastwood also made the same transition from western star to action hero with the Dirty Harry series around the same time. By the time WHITE BUFFALO was released Charles Bronson had made a couple of modernday action movies and his new audience that made DEATH WISH such a smash expected to see the Charles Bronson they knew and liked in contemporary action roles and were disappointed with what WHITE BUFFALO had to offer in terms of action violence and sex. But then the people who still remembered Charles Bronson as a western movie star were also disappointed with WHITE BUFFALO because the role Charles Bronson played the legendary Wild Bill Hickok was so different from the type of roles he did in his previous westerns that they didn't warm up to this strange shoot 'em up. And then there are the horrorscifi fans who went to see KING KONG or JAWS and expected to see another type of Big Animal on the Rampage film and were clearly disappointed with WB because it is NOT a JAWSlike movie even if there are some scary JAWSlike moments in WB. This is due mainly to the terrible advertising from the studio which had NO idea how to sell this odd western and decided to sell WB as a Big Animal on the Rampage film because of the theme present in the title and story.So when one looks at all of this in hindsight one can clearly see that WHITE BUFFALO simply had NO chance of succeeding with critics or at the B.O. regardless of how good or bad the movie was in itself. There were too many misleading and conflicting factors outside of the film itself for anyone to have a clear and objective view of it. This is why it's always good to look at a movie decades after it was made when all the hype andor expectations are by now forgotten or gone and one can hope to view a movie for what it was not necessarily for what people critics or even movie studios and stars expected it to be. So when I watched WHITE BUFFALO recently I had already seen it back in the 80s and always remembered it I was pleasantly surprised by it. It is much better than what anyone thinks of it.I'm the first to say that Dino de Laurentiis is a hack. And that director J. Lee Thompson is not a very good director. And that Charles Bronson is not the best actor in the world. But even with all these seemingly negative elements WHITE BUFFALO is pretty good. It's obvious that Bronson and Thompson saw an opportunity to create something that was close to their hearts and basically created an artsy kind of western most likely without Dino being aware of this. Yes there are several problems with WHITE BUFFALO but the good qualities of the movie overshadow the bad ones. And watching the movie today one can clearly see that the film is supposed to be seen first and foremost as a MYTHICAL ALLEGORY It's no wonder United Artists had no idea how to sell this movie. How do you promote an allegorical film? The white buffalo the meeting of Wild Bill Hickok and Crazy Horse etc. The dreamlike atmosphere is what makes WHITE BUFFALO so memorable. The conflicting narratives between the standard western and the one with allegorical elements give the latter even more power because as we watch the movie one sorta forgets that the film has a white buffalo in it and when it finally arrives the whole thing seems even more unreal. Imagine a western directed by David Lynch.Aside from the couple of shots where you can clearly see the track on which the mechanical buffalo is mounted on the buffalo itself is okay. There isn't any scene in WB that last long enough with a clear view of the mechanical animal to have a really good idea how it looks like. The scenery is beautiful and the music by John Barry is excellent. And there is a strange foreboding claustrophobic mood that permeates the whole film. And Jack Warden gives an excellent performance as Bill's partner. His performance anchors the dreamlike film. WHITE BUFFALO is NOT the disaster that everyone claims it to be. And it definitely has a cult following.".

So ... why were more advanced effects not used?My theory is that the makers wanted to create a surreal dreamlike feeling much like it might have been to listen to an Indian storyteller around a village campfire a hundred and fifty years ago. In those times human imagination could not have constructed the special effects images that we take for granted in our presentday monsters. Modern effects would detract from the misty mythlike ambiance of this movie ... the myth of James Butler Hickok the myth of Crazy Horse the myth of the white buffalo.When combined with John Barry's haunting score this movie really has an effect on me. I give it an 8 out of 10 and hope to see it on a 1.851 widescreen DVD soon.

He awakens every time he tries to sleep from the same nightmare. He knows he must face his nightmare or go insane.Oldtimer and Indian hater Charlie Zane Jack Warden also known as Oneye  the great white warrior of Sand Creek  himself an famous Indian hunter in his younger days go with Wild Bill Hickok to hunt down the White Buffalo.The old Indian warrior Chief Crazy Horse Will Sampson is looking for the White Buffalo for different reasons. For him the hunt is sacred and if he doesn't succeed he cannot live with himself. His dead little daughter killed by the White Buffalo will be forever tortured in the other world until he has avenged his child's death. This he must do in the old way.The realistic locations makes the film chilling indeed. It was filmed on scenic locations in Canon City Colorado with interiors at the MetroGoldwynMayer lot. The scenes showing mountains of bleached white buffalo bones are harrowing as are the cruelty by both whites and Indians.Great supporting roles by Slim Pickens as a vocal stage driver Stuart Whitman as a slimy gambler Cara Williams as the gambler's loumouthed girlfriend John Carradine as a undertaker the monstrously big Clint Walker as the murderous trapper Whistling Jack Kileen Bert Williams as a barkeeper who helps Wild Bill Hickcok from being killed and finally Kim Novak made an outstanding return to the screen as Wild Bill Hickcok's old love and onetime hooker Poker Jenny now turned respectable.This is a strange mythical and murky film. Forget the bad special buffalo effects and the bad monster. The screenplay in this movie is the thing. The language in this movie is very realistic. I wouldn't be surprised if this was the way the tough hard people up in the Black Hills really talked back in the 1870s.I'm proud to call this my favorite western of the 1970s. Not because it was the best but simply because of it's dark mythical tone. I've had this on video for a very long time and have seen it numerous times.When you see a film over and over again you notice all the little details missed by the ones who saw it only once.In the 1970s only Sam Peckinpah's westerns were as or more interesting. Not to forget Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone. A matter of taste of course.".

	schema:reviewBody "Surely one of the strangest big budget actionstar vehicles of all time The White Buffalo stars Charles Bronson as a syphilitic Wild Bill Hickok returning to the West after a stint on the stage and haunted by night terrors featuring a rampaging white buffalo. He is determined to track down and kill this creature of his nightmares a quest shared by Indian chief Crazy Horse Will Sampson. Whilst Hickok's pursuit of the white spike is motivated by dreams and greed the quest takes place in the midst of a goldrush which Hickok plans to make his killing in Crazy Horse must kill the animal in retribution of its rampage through an Indian village a rampage in which the chief's own child was killed. At first the two men both travelling under pseudonyms are rivals and enemies but their shared mission makes them allies and tentatively friends.The film is not what you'd call an actionpacked adventure. Hickok does get involved in fights and shootouts but the overarching mood of the film is of melancholy as if the quest were a kind of deathdrive for the characters. This mood is helped by the casting as various and often doomed travellers or death merchants of fading Hollywood luminaries Stuart Whitman Kim Novak Slim Pickens memorably John Carradine as an undertaker whose ageing faces and bodies act as memento moris in the audience's eyes visible symbols of the progress towards death that the film seems keen to put before us. The white buffalo itself is as more of a symbol than a living animal and this is emphasised by its being depicted by the use of a clearly mechanical model. The white buffalo is a close relative of Melville's white whale and whilst the quest doesn't end in Hickok encountering an Ahablike death there is a shared sense between this story and Melville's that the pursuit of the white beast is a negative form of the hero's journey his motivation is in dreams and greed and this is contrasted with Crazy Horse who has a more intimate and honourable relationship with the quarry. Hickok realizes this himself when he lets Crazy Horse keep the dead beast's meat and fur a decision which alienates Hickok from his white ally Charlie Zane Jack Warden.Yet Crazy Horse and Hickok can never be friends Hickok has sinned against the Indian nation in the past and so finally even having achieved his dream quest alongside the chief Hickok is left a man alone. This gives the film an almost unbearably chilly conclusion leaving the viewer with the sense that the hero can never find redemption can't ever beat death. It is little wonder that the film was roundly rejected by audiences and critics on its original release as it is ultimately a rejection of the Hollywood hero's journeyredemption narrative. The only place the hero is going is to a lonely and violent death as stated by the final credit sequence showing pictures of our two heroes with the information that a few years after the film's events both died violently.J Lee Thompson directs the film with a great feel for the mysterious and deathly allure of the object whether this be the sheer face of a rock wall the desert a field of snow or the furious brow of the buffalo. That the animal is a mechanism only reinforces the tragedy of man  all objects whether 'natural' or 'manmade' serve to allure men towards their deaths. Ultimately the film is a poem of death it's most haunting image being a huge pile of buffalo skulls by the side of a railway line an image which can't help resonate with the 19th genocide of the American Indian as well as 20th century traintracks towards the deathcamps. Perhaps the centre of the film is in Hickok's selfjustifying speech about the cycles of history where he tells Crazy Horse that it is not the white man's turn to rule through violence and the terror of their weapons. That may be true but in the film's disturbing vision racial success history brings no content just loneliness fear and death.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've found that Charles Bronson's portrayal of Wild Bill Hickok in the White Buffalo to be the best and most realistic one I've seen on film or television. He certainly looks the most like Hickok and is properly attired with both pistols in a sash as Hickok was known to favor. The novel and film are set in 1874 as Hickok has returned to the west after several years of play acting as his good friend Buffalo Bill Cody talked him into doing. Whereas Cody was a natural for show business Hickok hated the whole business and went west again when gold was reported in the Dakota territory. It's there where he met his death in 1876.But according to this novel Hickok went on a hunt for a legendary white buffalo which has been plaguing him in dreams. Hickok also suffered from glaucoma and had to wear dark glasses because his eyes couldn't deal with bright light. Clearly not the man he was when he was the legendary marshal of Abilene.He was however the man who carried out what was essentially a contract hit on a legendary charismatic Indian leader called the Whistler who back in the previous decade was trying to unite various Indian tribes to forget their own differences and wage a united war against the whites. The Indians especially the Sioux hated Hickok for that though he was at the time carrying out Army orders he was scouting for them at the time.On his odyssey to the Dakotas Hickok meets up with Crazy Horse two years before he became legendary leading the Sioux to victory at the Little Big Horn. The white buffalo is real and stampeding through the Sioux village killed Crazy Horse's toddler. Because Crazy Horse played by Will Sampson did not show proper Indian stoicism on the death of the little guy he's been banished from the tribe and can only redeem himself according to their religion by killing the white buffalo himself and not with the white man's guns.Of course Crazy Horse and Hickok meet up in the Dakota territory each pursuing the albino bison. Whether they ever really met they were in the same area at the same time. No record of it but they could have met.Bronson and Sampson are a fine pair of leads and are ably assisted by a veteran cast of players that include Slim Pickens John Carradine Kim Novak Stuart Whitman Cara Williams Ed Lauter Clint Walker and Douglas Fowley. Standing out however is Jack Warden playing Hickok's sidekick on the hunt. If you want to see the best portrayal of Wild Bill Hickok done on big screen or small catch The White Buffalo by all means.".

It's really an offbeat character study in which the character in question none other than Wild Bill Hickock Charles Bronson has to face an internal demon of his by also doing battle with a real one supposedly the last of the great white buffaloes that have mostly been wiped out.On his way to meet his destiny Wild Bill  now travelling under the alias James Otis  meets a variety of colourful characters including his old friend Charlie Zane a hearty Jack Warden and Poker Jenny Kim Novak looking as beautiful as ever. Some of his encounters get intense with the requisite amount of gunfire and bloodshed but things really pick up once Bill and Charlie make the acquaintance of the Indian named Crazy Horse Will Sampson who is on his own quest to slay the beast.The special effects may draw criticisms from some viewers but this viewer never had any problem with them and certainly appreciated seeing old style animatronics. The wintry atmosphere of The White Buffalo is incredible accompanied by genuinely spooky music by John Barry and the film has a wonderful spiritual quality not to be found in other collaborations between Bronson and director J. Lee Thompson. It's an unconventional choice of material for them and today it rates as an underrated entry on their resumes.Much of the cast are relegated to cameo roles but make the most out of their brief screen time Clint Walker Stuart Whitman Slim Pickens John Carradine Cara Williams Douglas Fowley Ed Lauter and Martin Kove among others.With this assemblage of talent and a decent script by Richard Sale based on his novel this makes for fairly compelling viewing.Seven out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although the story had a number of ideas that didn't ring true for me I still found it largely entertaining and interesting. Of course having Wild Bill Hickok cross paths with Crazy Horse was one of the more creative elements in the picture and that they didn't recognize each other was probably something of a stretch. In fact having very few people recognize Hickok on his return from Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show was probably darn near impossible. I'm going by Hickok's reputation and the fact that his image would have been one of the more prominent ones featured in newspapers and dime novels of the day. But as far as fiction goes this one gets points for the idea of a mythical white buffalo that haunts Hickok's nightmares and has caused Crazy Horse disgrace following the death of his daughter. Both have their reasons for revenge on the 'buff' and the events leading to their team up is handled skillfully.You know if I hadn't seen Clint Walker's name in the opening credits and been looking for him I probably would have entirely overlooked his presence as Whistling Jack Kileen. He's one guy who never seemed to age following that successful run as Cheyenne Bodie in the 1950's. He's a bad guy here though virtually unrecognizable under a beard and a brogue but I don't think he ever did whistle.If you listen closely you might be shocked to hear Charlie Zane's Jack Warden comment the first time he and Wild Bill get a look at Crazy Horse before they know who he is. Under attack by a band of Crow Indians Charlie says  Look at that red niger take on. The only other time I've heard that reference in a movie before was in 1960's The Unforgiven in a similar context. Interesting but disconcerting to hear a racist remark like that regarding Native Americans.For Western movie fans the picture offers quite a notable cast heading off into their own personal career sunset folks like Slim Pickens as a stage driver and John Carradine as a busy undertaker. Both have rather brief roles along with Kim Novak as a former Hickok flame Poker Jenny. Speaking for myself it's always a treat to catch Will Sampson in any kind of role my favorite has to be his portrayal of Chief Bromden in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.Fans of Charles Bronson should be pleased with his effort here about midway between his Death Wish appearances. Somewhat less charismatic is the white buffalo itself a rather modest special effects effort even by 1970's standards. At times it looks more comical than fearsome and I had to ask myself why they couldn't come up with something a bit more realistic looking especially considering it had the power to wipe out Indian villages and knock down mountains.".

Some of the beautiful shots of snowy mountains and valleys brought to mind such great earlier westerns as Sergio Corbucci's 'The Great Silence' or Anthony Mann's 'The Far Country'.The hunt for the white buffalo is seen both from an Indian's and a white man's side reaching to mythical levels.

In one breathtaking sequence we see this ranting beast charge through a village no blood spared either. This is a great vehicle for Charles rather than the norm of vengeance movies that become so stereotypical of this acting great we become thankful of this change but still remains is this never changing tough guy personal that made this actor a legend. The surroundings in which this solid actioner piece is shot I loved. It very much reminded me as if being on the same set of Daniel Boone. I loved seeing Charlie pitted up against this beast and the unlikely if inevitable friendship formed between these two once bitter enemies. After all isn't there enough hate in the world.".

	schema:reviewBody "My review doesn't spoil any of the plot development twists or ending but I've added a spoiler warning because I do discuss the characters' motivations which might be spoilery to some viewers.This is a surprisingly effective and unique film ostensibly a Western but proving to have more parts supernatural thriller and mythical quest. The premise seems so ridiculous that it'd have to be either a comedy or an overthetop action flick Wild Bill Hickock and Crazy Horse team up to hunt a evil white buffalo. Instead this film takes itself completely seriously and amazingly succeeds. I'm not going to call this one of the greatest Westerns or any of that stuff but it's uncommonly absorbing and not quite like anything else I've seen.The Western elements are thus the setting the tension between whites and Native Americans the gunslinger of little words who is frequently attacked by snarling baddies wherever he goes but guns them down with hardly a blink usually the Clint Eastwood role. Yet the main plot is part quest part supernatural thriller Hickock Charles Bronson is plagued by nightmares of the White Buffalo attacking him and must confront the beast in order to keep from being driven insane likewise the Oglala chief Crazy Horse  who was stripped of his rank and name after weeping like a woman at the death of his infant child when the White Buffalo attacked his village  must kill the beast in the old way to regain his honor and provide peace for his child in the afterlife.The White Buffalo itself appears nearly demonic  in addition to invading Hickock's dreams even while he was living hundreds of miles away in the East it stalks them from the shadows of snowy mountains plays psychological games by making noises at night kills their horses to deprive them of easy transport and causes avalanches to intimidate them and cause mayhem. It reminded me of equal parts Moby Dick and the Red Bull from The Last Unicorn.The movie is directed in a slow slightly surreal not completely steady manner. In the first ten minutes of the movie I wasn't sure if it was well made or not. The outside nighttime settings look limited as if filmed on dark stages perhaps the lighting was low and natural often obscuring landscape or facial details due to darkerthannormalformovies shadows. The acting for the Native American characters is stiff and stereotypical of old Western portrayals  flat voices no emotion somber faces. And the White Buffalo itself is filmed mostly in lightning quick almost shakycam shots up close so you can't quite get a good look at it. Since it's likely a big puppet they had this kind of choppy shooting was probably to disguise the artificiality. And it works. Sure we're used to big CGI shots of creatures and a bigger budgeted movie in 1977 could probably have done more but this limited approach WORKS for this movie. It makes the White Buffalo more surreal more monstrous and more threatening. It's not a real buffalo  it's practically a demon! I think that's the point and it really helps build the suspense and eerie atmosphere for this movie. And this goes for the whole movie  as it progresses the directing feels more assured and the narrative finds its focus.Bronson is one of the iciest action heroes of his time all the moreso because of his leathered face and deepset stern eyes. He doesn't emote much but he doesn't have to. His character is hard and driven knows he's done bad in the past and doesn't apologize for it but also seems to be looking for a way to atone for it. I think he ends up finding a way towards something resembling peace by the end although it's not much and you can decide for yourself.The supporting cast are all pretty excellent though may not notice until the end. Jack Warden starts as an entertaining clich but by the end becomes a more complex and in a moral view tragic figure. Will Sampson plays Crazy Horse with solemn dignity somewhat of a living caricature of the noble steeleyed savage but with such presence as to match the ominous White Buffalo's and lift this story further into the realm of legend. The character of darkhearted Whistling Jack Kileen I swore was played by Gregory Peck but in fact is played by towering deepvoiced Clint Walker. A deadly fearsome opponent even for the likes of Charles Bronson.There's very little humor in The White Buffalo but it never gets as depressing as it threatens. I enjoyed it  it's cool if grim and has a sense of honor about it. And it's fascinating for how it mixes the genres of the Western the personal quest and the supernatural beastly thriller.".

	schema:reviewBody "To me this movie is one of those romp types of films where you can almost feel that you are gleaning an actual glimmer of what the times it was set in were actually like. Beyond hearing phrases like marble hat and wooden suit...which immediately reminded me of Treasure of the Sierra Madre...where Bogart's character warned he would let it out of you in little round holes reminiscent of the gunfighter saying you'll be pushin' up daisies!...I really liked the ambiance of this movie...the barren gloominess of the snow and the sereneness of it all...with a backdrop of unpredictable terror provided by thea treacherous behemoth that ALWAYS must be dealt with personified by the unpredictable buffalo...that was actually like a fleeting supporting character in the grand scheme of the story. But the MAIN thing I liked in addition to appearances by favorites like Stuart Whitman Jack Warden John Carradine and Will Sampson is how it reminded me of the HARD men of the past! How they MUST have been SO rugged and resourceful. I like...no I LOVE...to escape this...OUR time of the meterosexual and the politically correct SOFT men and people of today! Watching this movie and choice timeless ones from the 70s and earlier...as the 80s brought an irreversible tinge of hazy pseudo to EVERYTHING! took me back to when men were MEN!! I am quite frankly disgusted by what we have become in this society. Thank God I can see a movie like this and not only feel a bit of nostalgia from when I was growing up as a starryeyed young kid yes I saw this movie a LONG time ago and always liked it...but I can get a decided feel especially watching old westerns offor what REAL men were like in our country's past...HARD men like Wild Bill Hickok and Crazy Horse...men of the frontier! The ghostlike screenplaymusic especially in the ending credits mixed with these legendary subjects will always be alluring for grudgingly sentimental and romantic fellows like me.".

And it is one of the many B movies made by Bronson that gave me much pleasure. Its quality comes exactly from its moderationit refuses to drift into melodrama or camp it keeps a cool note and such as it is I prefer to consider it more meaningful than symbolicthe story is not betrayed by an extraneous symbolism. The things shown are rather signs than symbols. Allegory? Why no of course not. I loathe allegory parables the Bronson tale is a pretty straightforward action drama very unpatronizing and decent.It is the tale of a hunt a mythical though not a mythologized one. Do you like tales with few characters and much physical nature? Balzac wrote that a story should not be like that and he chided Cooper for too many landscapes and too few characters. Well I assume the two approaches are not opposed but complementary. The Cooper approach was the best for what Cooper had to say and Verne and some French romantics took in both Cooper and the writers with more characters in their stories. I guess such principles should not be divisive. Bach to our movie it too is a tale of few characters and many landscapes hence a certain contemplation.As an actor and he was when solicited a true one Bronson had no ancestors and no successors either a singular impressing who got though lately some exciting career opportunities and remarkably assuredly seized them as a man who had no time for fooling anymore. Bronson made in fact he truly knew how to made these unassuming action movies Bronson movies.Bronson is my favorite western actor and gunman. Perhaps my favorite action actor also because for me Willis remains mainly the unequaled comedy actor.He was often compared to Eastwood Rourke I believe states that he likes them both which is fine and a nice thing to say. They both starred in Leone '60s westerns. Fourthly they are both considered predecessors of the '80s'90s action stars. Perhaps as far as I go I have always found Bronson to be the more exciting one. It's true that I had my first Bronson movie in '89 four years before I had my first Eastwood delight one of the Leone westerns Bronson remained the quintessential gunman the towering fighter. I began with such enchanting westernsa western from Wayne's late career Douglas' GUN HILL the Bronson show and only afterwards John Ford etc.. So I remained true to these first perceptions and nothing signaled I should change that.".

	schema:reviewBody "The White Buffalo is directed by J. Lee Thompson and adapted to screenplay by Richard Sale from his own novel of the same name. It stars Charles Bronson Will Sampson Jack Warden Clint Walker Slim Pickens and Kim Novak. Music is scored by John Barry and cinematography by Paul Lohmann. Plot finds Wild Bill Hickok Bronson and Crazy Horse Sampson teaming up to fight a giant white buffalo during the bleak winter of 1874. Hickok is plagued by nightmares of the beast Crazy Horse is out purely for revenge after the rampaging creature laid waste to his village and killed his newly born son.It flopped at the box office which in all honesty is not hard to understand for The White Buffalo had too many things to fight against to put up a good showing. It's very much an odd movie a strange blending of genres it often looks cheap and it had the unenviable task of trying to stay in the giant beast slipstream created by Jaws two years previously. After Spielberg unleashed his Carcharodon Carcharias on the cinema loving world a number of film makers tried the same idea but with different creatures Grizzly and the star studded Tentacles were just two around the same period even King Kong got a reimaging in 76 while The White Buffalo was also up against the Richard Harris led Orca Killer Whale also featuring Will Sampson this same year. Was the 1970s film lover in need of a hybrid creature feature Western with shades of Moby Dick stitched into the narrative? One with an oddly cast Bronson playing a legendary man of the West with sun glasses and penis rot? No was the answer but a cult fan base grew over the years and it's definitely worth more than a second glance these days.Film pretty much thrives on mystical symbolism shades of the supernatural hang over proceedings while the Native American culture is given adherence as well. The idea of teaming up two legends of the West enemies at that also gives the picture a high novelty factor. As the two men and Warden's gruff Charlie Zane who is along for the ride go off in search of the beast they must overcome hostilities of the human kind as well as the harsh winter that nature has provided for the back drop. Time is afforded development of story and principle characters this is not merely an excuse to be a carnage based creature feature it has ideas formed around man against nature men against their fate often it is philosophical even literate. Of course this has proved to be seen as pretentious by some and once the big white animatronic thunders into view with its awesome sound effects it's easy to be steered away from the more brainy aspects of the piece!John Barry lays a magnificent foreboding score over the top of it a score that deserves a better film in truth but it imbues the picture with a sense of dread helping us to stay with Wild Bill and Crazy Horse to see if they can cut down the demon while casting off their own? The studio filmed sequences are unfortunate but necessary considering the budget restrictions yet the sets do have a garish quality about them further aiding the weirdness on offer. Cast performances are perfectly in keeping with the material Bronson as cool as ever though it should be noted that Novak Walker Pickens and Stuart Whitman really are light support players here. Much has been made of the creature design unfavourably so but it's one of the better animatronic creations of the 70s. Put it alongside those used in the Kevin Connor pictures around this period and you can see its benefits. Though facial close ups should have been kept to a minimum!It's obviously not high art and it has ideas above its station while some of Michael F. Anderson's editing is so dizzying your head might explode. But this is no ordinary picture surreal and hypnotic intelligent yet off beat it's better than you might think and worth viewing more than once with expectations levels correctly channelled. 710".

Although certain scenes in the film show the shoestring budget it was created upon the acting score and the haunting white buffalo itself keep the film worth watching. It is a very simplistic film that was shot and released about ten years to late if it had been done about 1967 when westerns were popular and still prevalent then the response probably would have been greater but filmdom by 1977 had evolved into bigger and better things. The thing I really appreciate about this film is that it almost has a dreamyfantasy approach to it not typical for Charles Bronson but it definitely works. Trust me I'd want to bump off a white buffalo too if I had dreams about it coming after me while it roared like an Amtrak going 200 mph! Good film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I hadn't seen director J. Lee Thompson's mythical 'The White Buffalo' in a long time so when I came across it on DVD which it has just been released here in Australia I snapped it up. This was the second pairing of Thompson and Bronson after the solidly suave crime caper 'St Ives' 1976 and what they brought to 'The White Buffalo' which Richard Sale adapted from his own novel was a visually atmospheric mystically dreamy and really offbeat journey of symbolic meaning involving two completely different men Wild Bill Hickok and Chief Crazy Horse with differing mindsets one is sweaty fear and the other is spiritual vengeance but dealing with one obsessive target on mind the legendary White buffalo. They're chasing a dream or maybe it's a nightmare? and the only way to rid it from their plaguing thoughts is to come face to face with it which forms some fascinating interactions.There an obvious inspiration from Herman Melville's Moby Dick even though it's not in the same league it delivers a diverting western enterprise of that framework. As for the white buffalo itself it appears every now and again in glimpses and even so remains very important in the larger schemes of things. It's the story's backbone. From what you see of the creation it looks very mechanical and stiff but far from harmful as it looks quite good and it's echoing roar is effective. Its encounters are furiously intense bloody destructive and rapid like the opening slaughter of an Indian tribe. The way those scenes are filmed are suitably shot and edited in a murky fashion that we don't entirely get a clear shot of the buffalo. When it came to its barnstorming climax however you couldn't help but feel it came to be too sudden possibly too easy. Thompson's sharply measured and lowkey stylish direction is sturdily handled although it does feel staged by focusing on the expansively snowbound backdrop obvious backlot sets presented with its expressive cinematography of riveting camera angles. John Barry's score is majestically haunting and provoking. Leisurely it ticks along with some languishing passages of endless talk but I never found it that slow although it begins to plod when the fates of Bill and Crazy Horse come together with some pushy messages or particularly dull because of it's always curiously unique style of not knowing what was going to happen.Charles Bronson gives a stoutlike performance spending a lot time behind shades but showing a multifacet character hiding from his past. Will Sampson is confidently tailored as Crazy Horse and a genuine Jack Warden is terrific as Hickok's grouchy offside Charlie Zane. Clint Walker adds venom to his role and Slim Pickens minor part is noticeably enjoyable. There's strong support in the likes of Stuart Whitman John Carradine Ed Lauter Richard Gilliland and the very pleasing Kim Novak.The curiosity of this cultitem weighs quite heavy with its potential but it's an admirably flawed effort.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one movie it pays to revisit OUT of the context of its time. I think we need to stop comparing it to Jaws or King Kong. I think the relationship between the leads is much more important and I liked the character development devoid of many Bronson films. I liked the fact that creature special effects were in the camera animatronic rather than CGI. To be frank CGI had NOT risen to the level of creature creationsstop motion which was not used was mainstay until the early '90's even in Star Wars sequels five years later. And the mood music? The music is extraordinarily moodythis is a monaural track yet it filled the military theater in Frankfurt Germany where I served back in '77 and paid my 50 cents to see it. Maybe the mood of the movie is too dark. Maybe it's too cold it left me shivering.

I think the relationship between the leads is much more important and I liked the character development devoid of many Bronson films. I liked the fact that creature special effects were in the camera animatronic rather than CGI. To be frank CGI had NOT risen to the level of creature creationsstop motion which was not used was mainstay until the early '90's even in Star Wars sequels five years later. And the mood music? The music is extraordinarily moodythis is a monaural track yet it filled the military theater in Frankfurt Germany where I served back in '77 and paid my 50 cents to see it. Maybe the mood of the movie is too dark. Maybe it's too cold it left me shivering.

Unfortunately the storyline would appear to be too slight to warrant the obvious expense which has been spent here and the fact that the film received a very limited international release outside the countries that funded it and remains obscure to this day would tend to back this up. It does look absolutely beautiful in the German DVD release but unless you have a good understanding of that language then I'm afraid I would find it difficult to recommend other than as a bit of an ordeal for the curious.

Hellboy II The Golden Army is a more confident assured outing than the first film and while it does not draw from Mignola's comics for its plot it is perhaps better off for it lacking the usual burden of comparison and expectations. The Golden Army is more fantastical than the first film and is less scifi oriented but this is the sort of thing Del Toro does exceptionally well as a writer. He never lets the fantasy become the focus of the film instead concentrating on characters and delivering action scenes that can only be described as forgive the crass immaturity kickass.As entertaining as many comic booktofilm adaptations are it is a rare event when one can call one of these films a true artistic achievement. I am convinced without a shadow of a doubt that Guillermo Del Toro's entire career has been leading up to this film particularly regarding his work as screenwriter here. The comedy feels less forced and is worked incredibly well into the script here so much so that it doesn't feel remotely unnatural when the scene of comic drunken singing leads directly without a break into one of the film's most intensely dramatic sequences. Del Toro's handling of character has never been better not even with The Devil's Backbone which is still my favorite of his films and his sheer skill and ability when it comes to telling a fairytaleesquire fantasy is astonishing as proved in the prologue to this film. In short this is Del Toro at the top of his game and providing artistry the likes of which we rarely if ever see in summer blockbusters. It's only fair that an astonishingly brilliant comic like Hellboy by an astonishingly brilliant artist like Mike Mignola is adapted this well and by someone as talented at what they do as he is.How refreshing it is a week after the release of Hancock which to me epitomizes everything wrong with action filmmaking today that we get The Golden Army which features hands down some of the finest action scenes we have ever seen in this sort of film. Just stunningly beautiful wellshot wellcrafted the sort of thing that leaves one wondering how much time and effort went into it and endlessly thankful that some really talented people went to the trouble of making the film. The film is generally just superb on a technical level. Why am I even saying this? Of course it is. Danny Elfman composing Guillermo Navarro serving as cinematographer topnotch editors fantastic special effects wizards. It's a worldclass crew that made this film. I shouldn't be surprised at its quality but The Golden Army really just floored and astonished me with how good it is. The cast is also excellent proving once again that you don't need 'big names' to carry a movie. Just about everyone here is excellent particularly Perlman with another excellent turn as Hellboy and the underrated Selma Blair as Liz Sherman. Hellboy II The Golden Army provides essentially everything a Del Toro or Mignola fan would want. I imagine it will entertain and charm many outside those circles as well with its fantastic action sequences engaging characters and wonderful sense of humor. I would personally go as far as calling Hellboy II The Golden Army one of the top five or so comic book movies ever made.".

	schema:headline " Del Toro cements his place as a contemporary visionary. Brilliant stylish hilarious and great.";
	schema:reviewBody "I have long felt that the first Hellboy installment is one of the most underrated films of the 2000's. The first thing you notice about both the first film and this more than worthy successor is the passion. Everything is simply beautiful not in the typical beautiful sense but in that you appreciate the art that it is and it should come as no surprise as the film's director Guillermo Del Toro is a long time fan of the comic stories on which the movie is based. Del Toro turned down multiple high profile projects including multiple Harry Potter films so he could work on the Hellboy series which we all know will not gross as much money. Del Toro's passion for excellence is evident in this wonderful sequel which is better than the first and cements Del Toro's place as one of the top filmmakers of today.The first thing I liked about the movie the easy transition from the first to the second movie. Though I don't remember exact plot details it was very easy for me to get back into the story world and especially our three main characters. I'd reckon that you could watch this movie without having seen the first and still have a great time though it helps. A great cast with great chemistry more than sets the tone and makes this one very watchable.First you've got Ron Perlman. For those of you who don't know this terribly underrated actor he's one you can't afford to miss as Hellboy. Even though he's covered in makeup and prosthetics Perlman does a great job of making us love him as a hero and a man. This is something most of the superhero performers do not or perhaps cannot do. The justaspassionateasDelToro Doug Jones leaves a HUGE mark on the viewer here not just for his performance as Abe Sapien but for his remarkable range as a couple of other characters in the movie. Luke Goss is the film's villain and I really saw the dedication in his performance as well something required for his character who is of course a dedicated man. He's not necessarily the typical 'evil' character but a somewhat misguided one and I think Goss got that across to me very well. A fact often ignored by critics in the comic booksuperhero realm of films is the supporting heroine. Most times without the audience knowing it this character makes or breaks the movie. Selma Blair boy does she make it. Not only does she look absolutely stunning as Liz Sherman she takes the final act into her hands and does wonders with it. Definitely the best performance I've ever seen from Ms. Blair. Add in a hilarious and great performance from Seth MacFarlane yes the voice of multiple Family Guy characters as Johann Kraus's voice and Anna Walton as Princess Nuala and you've got the best ensemble of the year thusfar. Yes this cast is better than Iron Man.As for the action it's stunning. Hellboy has a LOT more to work with than the traditional superhero film and Del Toro more than takes advantage of it. With action ranging from lighting fast and well shot sword fighting and hand to hand combat to Hellboy versus a giant plant it's a sight to behold as we watch a legendary director in the making perfect his craft. There were multiple times where I found myself saying holy crap or wow. Del Toro also keeps some humor in there to balance the much darker tone of the film. This includes one of the most hilarious scenes I've ever seen about being lovesick.I sadly feel that many will not see this movie and it will become a diamond in the rough much like its predecessor. Hopefully that doesn't happen and it becomes the blockbuster it deserves to be. Though the ending is a tad predictable not too much but it is the one thing that keeps it from a 10 I found Hellboy to be one of the most pleasing adventures at the movies I've had this year. It's a shame that it comes out between Will Smith and Batman because this film deserves its own day in the spotlight. You know what they say...Every demon has his day...P.S. I can't wait to see a third one.".

	onyx:emotionText "I have long felt that the first Hellboy installment is one of the most underrated films of the 2000's. The first thing you notice about both the first film and this more than worthy successor is the passion. Everything is simply beautiful not in the typical beautiful sense but in that you appreciate the art that it is and it should come as no surprise as the film's director Guillermo Del Toro is a long time fan of the comic stories on which the movie is based. Del Toro turned down multiple high profile projects including multiple Harry Potter films so he could work on the Hellboy series which we all know will not gross as much money. Del Toro's passion for excellence is evident in this wonderful sequel which is better than the first and cements Del Toro's place as one of the top filmmakers of today.The first thing I liked about the movie the easy transition from the first to the second movie. Though I don't remember exact plot details it was very easy for me to get back into the story world and especially our three main characters. I'd reckon that you could watch this movie without having seen the first and still have a great time though it helps. A great cast with great chemistry more than sets the tone and makes this one very watchable.First you've got Ron Perlman. For those of you who don't know this terribly underrated actor he's one you can't afford to miss as Hellboy. Even though he's covered in makeup and prosthetics Perlman does a great job of making us love him as a hero and a man. This is something most of the superhero performers do not or perhaps cannot do.

I love the second films of a super hero franchise Superman II Spiderman II The Incredible Hulk because the heroes have been introduced and the origins are out of the way so the story can begin from the start unfettered. This film is not just about Action Action Action but about character development and their interaction. I liked Pan's Labrynth but felt a little bit let down when the creature's personalities were not explored enough. This film takes the time to establish who Abe Sapien is beyond being defined as a fish man. Johann Krauss is a great uptight Teutonic addition to the old team with a few tricks up his sleeve and Hellboy  Liz's professional and personal relationship get more play in this film. The detail in the troll market is amazing and the story rings true to the Mike Mignola comics without having to lift a story arc from any one specific past issue. Bravo! Guillermo del Toro! I can't wait for Hellboy III.".

Hellboy II had everything the first had but with bigger and better qualities. The action was superb story line was great and acting directing etc. was just as perfect.I was entertained through the entire film and I enjoyed every minute and in the end I was left with a big smile on my face for how great this sequel turned out to be but here again I still think it is on par with the first because of how the first was so perfect at setting up the story from the comics and how amazingly entertaining it was as well with all the great performances that the second had and just when I put the two films together I honestly can not decide which is better. All I have left to say is that if you loved Hellboy this is no disappointment whatsoever and you need to see it right away!".

He has created some of the most fascinating creatures that traditional Hollywood doesn't have the guts or inclination to ever assemble. I would take Guillmero Del Torro in the director's chair any time any place but Hellboy II shows that he is not without his flaws. Ron Perlman who is terrific as Hellboy doesn't have anything truly interesting to say or do the world around him is magical but the plot isn't.Hellboy is the most unique character to appear in your comic book shop. The mythology and the character are such the opposite of the main stream and to Hellboy II's credit so is this movie. Ron Perlman doesn't deliver catch phrases or gun down bad guys for the sake of doing so. He is an interesting character but he is overshadowed by this lackluster plot and the world around it. I felt as if we didn't see enough of Big Red or maybe we did we just didn't get to see the most of the talents. Del Torro constantly wants to remind you that he directed Pan's Labyrinth because visually the creatures look like they were leftovers from that film. I don't mind this per say but these characters just don't have much to do they are there really to look at rather than them having significance. Visually I can't complain about them because they are amazing but they serve little purpose to the story.The plot is really the weakest thing this movie has going for it. I felt it took too many liberties against the original concepts of Hellboy. Hellboy is a creature alive in our world Del Torro tries to tell us that our world is nothing more than a division of fantasy and reality. Well we spend too much time in the fantasy that we forget the fact that this Golden Army is a threat to reality. The villain Prince Nuada is weak we don't see any method to his madness other than the fact that the plot dictates that he be the antagonist. In the first film and to a lesser degree this one we were given details about why Hellboy has faith in humanity and would chose not to serve his purpose. It's interesting because we are given glimpses of what could have been something that could have added real teeth and tension to the story for the first time Hellboy is tempted by evil weakly tempted but tempted nonetheless. This mental struggle could have given our actors the chance to show their talent but instead the filler between the action scenes is just okay at best.I didn't hate Hellboy II I just think it needed some beef in it's story. Del Torro has shown us he is a master storyteller but this time he didn't focus on the story it's self. I would recommend this film but I know Del Torro can and has done much better.".

I'm a HUGE fan of the comics and thought that the first movie was done just right.I think Hellboy II the Golden Army is as good as the first movie. It takes awhile to get used to Doug Jones' voice as Abe but once you do you see why it's better to have the guy in the suit doing his own dialog. And Seth McFarlane does a fine job voicing Johann although not as I had imagined him.The design work is superior to the first movie and the humor is ratcheted up a notch. The fights are better and more thrilling and the monsters are way cool. Great use of costumes and CGI working together something Lucas should have done more of in the Star Wars prequels to make everything feel REAL.I expect many won't like it as much as the first movie because the newness will be lost. This was in fact my immediate reaction as well but after a few days I realized I was just as excited to see it again as I was the first one.The story isn't as grandiose as the first Hellboy and the overall pace and build have a few problems. POSSIBLE SPOILER There is also a tad too much time spent with the many love stories one of which works better than the others  Liz and Hellboy but they all play out well. And an AWESOME flashback that had me grinning from ear to ear.PLEEEEEASE let there be at least one more Hellboy movie!!!".

Now I know that this is not a study of deep human drama but I DO ask any movie no matter how ridiculous the premise to at least attempt to establish an environment conducive to immersion. Unlike the first this movie abandons any attempt at consistency and believable interactions between characters a problem compounded by some bad voicework Doug Jones Seth MacFarlane strained performances Jeffrey Tambor ... damn he was great in the first what happened here? and most importantly a terrible terrible script.The movie starts out by shoving this glaring problem right into your face. The relationship between Liz and Hellboy is muddled and unconvincing. Yes yes I know you're wandering the mythical and neverbeforewitnessed Troll Market but you know I have something really important to tell you about our relationship that is exceptionally private but is best shared over an open radio frequency or Hey I know let's have a gigantic fight that results in me blowing a reinforced vault door off it's hinges with sheer pyrokinetic force but then play it off as me just needing my space. It's ridiculous distracting and cheapens what could have been a viable subplot.Tied to this is the fact that Liz Sherman although she can literally obliterate just about anything spends much of the movie shooting with a sidearm on those rare occasions she chooses to engage in nonrelationship babble and actually hurt an evil faerie monsterrobotwhatever. When it suits the plot she is capable of focusing and controlling her powers to the necessary end but for the most part she just stands around on fire then pulls out a gun to deal with the bad guys. Part of what made her character so interesting in the first movie was the sheer destructive force she commands in this she is virtually neutered unless something very very important and seemingly indestructible hint hint needs to be somehow done away with. How convenient and yet how disappointing.The overall feeling of the movie is best summed up by the nauseainducing tagline running on various banners and prefacing every trailer BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE VISIONARY DIRECTOR OF PAN'S LABYRINTH. The whole movie is an excuse for Del Toro to show you how wonderfully creative he is to make you forget about the cheesy dialog giant plot holes and some lessthancredible performances. That's fine  it's what made Pan's Labyrinth successful and worthwhile. Unfortunately I didn't pay to see Pan's Labyrinth 2  I wanted to see the sequel to Hellboy.More importantly unlike Pan's Labyrinth the movie keeps yanking you away from the visual splendor and makes you focus on other more unsavory elements. The movie cannot stand alone as either a fantasy a superheroaction movie or a comedy but rather tries to bridge all three genres. This schizophrenic inconsistent approach ruins those things the film does well  action oneliners and mind boggling special effects. One of many examples watching Johann Krauss flow around and take control of objects and creatures is a really cool premise and leads to some great scenes unfortunately Seth McFarlane's voice work is far too over the top. As soon as you think to yourself damn this is pretty cool the scenefight ends and you get to hear a voiceover that sounds like the Germanophile orphan of a mating between Stewie from Family Guy and C3PO from Star Wars.In short every time you begin to feel immersed in this fantasyoccult setting you're unnecessarily distracted by poor voicework bad writing or yawning chasms in continuity Spoiler The Golden Army is indestructible but the crown controlling it is really THAT easy to destroy??? Why not just melt the damn thing in the first 15 minutes and be done with it?. Watching the movie I couldn't help but feel that Del Toro jumped the shark  that he was so enraptured with the size of his budget and the scope of the film that he completely forgot all the great things that made the original so enjoyable.If you like me enjoy scifi fantasy superheroaction summer popcorn movies ... eh it's OK. The visuals are impressive the action is consistent and the creatures are mostly interesting. Unfortunately all of those elements are undermined by the complete lack of immersion with the film being ridiculously overthetop plagued by horrific consistency and plot holes you could throw a tractor through. The sad thing is that I really wanted to like this movie but even I  an apologist who can overlook the warts in just about any film of the genre  just couldn't hang in there with Hellboy 2.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw the trailer for Hellboy II The Golden Army I hadn't seen the first Hellboy so before I saw the sequel I wanted to see the first movie so I rented it and when I watched it I wasn't really thrilled with it. I mean it was a decent movie but it wasn't something I would watch again so I was thinking that the sequel was going to be a bust and probably not do much for the story for what they had at least. Another thing was that the people that I talked to who had seen this movie before I saw it said that it was horrible and a waste of time but I still did want to see this movie so I decided to go ahead and just judge for myself. After all I do admire Guillermo del Toro's style his visions are eye candy and his stories can be incredible so Hellboy II The Golden Army? It seriously was so awesome! It was a whole lot better and stronger than the first Hellboy.Hellboy is becoming quite the star in town which isn't making the government very happy and they are becoming more and more angry with him since his growing popularity but they're not the only one who's unhappy with his behavior Liz is getting upset with his behavior as well. But things are more worse than Hellboy's youtube popularity Prince Nuada wishes to raise the undefeatable golden army that can destroy the human race. Princess Nuala his twin sister is the only link that can stop him as well as Hellboy and his friends but the strong link between Nuala and Nauda is scary if he dies she dies as well since she helps out Hellboy and becomes Abe Sapien's new love.Hellboy II The Golden Army is a great action movie and I'm really glad I gave it a chance. I'm telling you right now the creatures in this movie are so visually stunning the work that was put into this film was absolutely incredible and I have a whole lot more respect for Guillermo del Toro for his work he really knows how to keep the audience's eyes on the screen. He made Hellboy into a solid comic book film. I love the character Hellboy I think more so in this one because he acts more human and you can't help but feel for him when the world turns on him after him saving it. Hellboy II The Golden Army is a recommendation from me it's a good movie and is guaranteed fun to watch.810".

Why did The main antagonist have so little presence? Why did they suddenly get mad at Manning who had done nothing but try and pacify them? Why did Krauss turn around and insult Manning at the end for no reason? Why was the giant terrifying monster that was so feared get dispatched by a single shot to the head? Why did nobody question the dangers of Liz carrying Hellboys baby? If Nuala was willing to die to stop her brother why didn't she try to stop him in at the elrond council thing at the start If the characters had more time to develop they could probably explained this but they didn't?

	schema:headline " Much Better than the First IMHO...";
	schema:reviewBody "I honestly didn't expect much when I first saw this movie. I was a fan of the first film though it wasn't anything spectacular and I figured this would be more of the same. Wow no. This movie was SO much better than the first in my opinion it was easily one of my favorite movies from 2008. I'm not saying the first was bad I just found myself bored a lot easier at times. But this film was just flatout more entertaining. Hellboy and the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense find themselves caught up when an elven prince declares war on the human race and attempts to awaken the invincible Golden Army to aid him.Whereas the first film delved into more occult themes the sequel is full of fantasy and mythical elements. The film is full of some of the most imaginative creature creations I've seen in years and most of it was done with animatronics and puppetry with very little reliance on CGI. Wink the prince's monstrous bodyguardhenchman was a fullsize costume with animatronics and CGI used to enhance it and it was amazing. I was blown away by the Troll Market scene and how much detail went into creating that neverbeforeseen world of fantasy creatures. When you see some of the amazing creations of Del Toro and his crew you'll be baffled as to how they managed to do most of it practically the Angel of Death rocks BTW.Most of the key cast have returned from the first film...Ron Perlman Selma Blair HOT Doug Jones and Jeffrey Tambor. The writing was sharper in this film and the cast are better than they were before. I especially liked how Liz Sherman Blair was given more to do than sulk in this installment. In addition the BPRD receive a new agent in the form of Johann Krauss an ectoplasmic entity in a containment suit voiced by the awesome Seth MacFarlane. For me Krauss stole every scene he was in and I really dug his introduction to the film series. I definitely hope he's brought back in any future sequels. Also a bit different this time around was the villain Prince Nuada Luke Goss...rather than the usual world domination motivation he is jaded at how his people have been treated by the humans and is determined to retake their rightful place in the world. His intentions are noble in a sense but his methods are severely flawed and he presents Hellboy with views that cause the hero to question his place as a defender of humanity.Seeing as how I've never read the comics I can't say how faithful the film stays to the Hellboy canon but as a filmgoer I loved this movie. It was a drastic improvement on the first in my opinion and I really hope Del Toro is given the chance to continue the series in the future with the seeds he planted in this film for ongoing plotpoints.".

I was a fan of del Toro's work before I got into Hellboy but that was several years before the first movie. This is quite honestly one of the best marriages of both source and original material I could've hoped for. I felt the movie far surpassed the original. It was smarter funnier and as visually stunning as anything you can expect from either del Toro or Mignola. The sheer number and variety of fully realized monsters with the stronger emphasis being on puppetry and makeup as opposed to an over reliance on CGI is almost astounding in this day and age. The performances were also top notch. It was a little weird to hear Doug Jones's voice actually coming out of Abe Sapien at first but I think it added to the character and Seth McFarlane as the voice of Johann Krauss was a rather inspired gamble that paid off. All in all the best thing I can say that will probably make the strongest impact on the largest number of people is that I would gladly pay to see this movie again and I would recommend it to any of my friends regardless of how familiar they are or aren't with Hellboy. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.".

Following the cringeworthy opening scene with young Hellboy surely just an excuse to get John Hurt in the film i was hoping the film would pick up with the introduction to our villain yet the almost immediate revelation of his fatal weakness ensured that we already knew how he would ultimately be defeated. The plot was so utterly unengaging and dull that even the fantastical creatures could not reignite my interest in what was going on.

Did anyone laugh when hell boy is beat up by the mist guy with lockers? did you not feel uncomfortable and like you went to the wrong movie with the stupid love stories involved? For instance Abe falls the princess in .01 seconds and we are expected to just let it slide because the have a psychic connection. When Liz is pregnant and she has to tell hell boy to bring him back to life I decided I would never see this movie again. I waited that long in to get to that point because I just wanted it to be good so much. outside of the plot holes and clich beyond clich twists the characters are just unlikeable in this one and the music score is an abomination compared to the score of the first.

The comedy was overdone and hardly funny the only good scene was when Hellboy and Abe were drunk and that was the only thing they didn't do as much with as they could have done. The villain looked great and had lots of great fighting moves but he was weak. He was hardly bad at all. His makeup and skills were the only thing that posed any threat of a villain. While the relationship between Hellboy and Liz has grown it does nothing but bore the viewer. It was as if everything was slow. The fights were prolonged unnecessarily.The only reason this movie MAY be acceptable is because it seems to be setting up a Hellboy 3 where Hellboy becomes evil and turns on mankind. But even that wasn't shown as much as it should have been.This movie was trying too hard to be like Pan's Labyrinth that the magical world was so far out there than what most people could imagine.Seriously painful movie.

	schema:headline " A letdown poorly written.";
	schema:reviewBody "OK I've read some of the reviews and commentary on this movie and I just don't get it. I did not enjoy this movie as much as the first one. Something was just missing. Hellboy 1 had more soul. 2 was just a bunch of action scenes tied together and with a thin veneer of personal chemistry thrown in to make the viewer feel drawn in emotionally. But it didn't work on me. I really really wanted it to and I waited breathlessly for this release. The trailers were great but the movie did not deliver.In Hellboy 1 we witness a creature from another world who is wallowing in his selfpity and conflicts borne of his differentnesshe was raised as human by his human stepfather but he is too different to fit in. Forced to revert to a demon of destruction by the forces of evil he comes to the brink of destroying the world. Then he is reminded of his humanity by John Meyers just in time to avert calamity. Thus we learn that all sentient creatures whether human or wannabe human can take charge of their destiny we can overcome our programming.Then there was the romantic triangle that formed between Meyers Liz and Hellboy. Liz was a confused troubled girl who sort of loved Hellboy but was so afraid of her power that she withdrew into a shell. Meyers drew her out of that shell and in the process fell in love with her or at least developed a bit of a crush. In the end Liz herself realized her responsibilities and loyalties in time to save her buddy Hellboy and thus she came into her full power as a super hero and a woman.Hoo boy. What a world they created. Now we come to Hellboy 2. Meyers is inexplicably gone even though Dr. Broom specifically recruited him to continue HB's lessons in being human. Abe has changed and oh do I miss Michael Lindsay's voice! I have read that Lindsay wanted Doug Jones to recite his own lines so I guess he got what he wanted and as a result the delicate and humorous Abe we came to know in HB 1 is gone. Oh yes and Abe was willing without hesitation to cravenly betray humanity because of his love for the Princess. Sorry I don't buy that. This isn't the same Abe.Tom Manning has also changedhe was a takecharge guy before butting heads with Hellboy all through the first movie but in the end he was won over and the two came to have a mutual respect. Now suddenly he's reduced to bribing Hellboy with cigars to not show himself in public. What happened? Manning was useless and contemptible in this movie.I don't see the point of Kraus except as more eye candy. Evidently they were hoping Kraus would add some humor and tension to the story but it didn't really work. But he was an interesting creature nonetheless.The elves wore too much makeup and the princess behaved strangely. The prince at least had some motivation in this movie unlike almost everyone else. But he was also either a psychopath who would unhesitatingly slaughter his father or else the elves are just different from us humans. Not very believable in either case.Oh and Hellboy became weaker in this movie. He was a powerful kickbutt demon in the first one and now he gets knocked on his ass by every monster that comes along. He gets a magical razor in his chest and almost dies. What happened to the Hellboy we knew from HB1?Lastly and sadly was the ridiculous scene at the end where the agents quit. Huh? Since when had the Department become an evil big bad boss that deserved to be treated so shabbily? They took these freaks in trained them helped them to have a niche in a hostile world and together they protected humanity from the things that go bump in the night. This is Professor Broom's legacy. Now as if to show how little they think of Prof. Broom Hellboy and his gang just walked away from Manning leaving him plaintively crying for them to come back. And where exactly were they going? To live on a commune of mutants and freaks somewhere in Ireland where they happened to be stranded? Brilliant writing guys this really ties everything togethernot!!!I could go on and on. Well it's only a movie. But I am really disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "In this continuation to the adventure of the demon superhero an evil elf breaks an ancient pact between humans and creatures as he declares war against humanity. He is on a mission to release The Golden Army a deadly group of fighting machines that can destroy the human race. As Hell on Earth is ready to erupt Hellboy and his crew set out to defeat the evil prince before The Golden Army can destroy humanity's existence.When the first scenes rolled through the film my jaw dropped. I was already disappointed by the film. The first scene shows Hellboy being a little boy and John Hurt as his father making a cameo role. It seemed kinda childish and not funny at all. The next scene doesn't do any good either. It shows Hurt telling a Christmas story which is all in Legolike form. Definitely cheesy.But it's obvious I was taken aback by the shift in tone from this film. This felt like Shrek 2 which is the best example I can give here. The first movie took itself very seriously yet the sequel although still serious is very laid back. It took some time to get used to this but I eventually gave in and I came out having the time of my life! This film is immensely entertaining from beginning to end I can tell you right now. For being not as serious and more laid back the movie is more entertaining and better by a notch or two. I was kinda upset how they took out Rupert Evans Myers out of this movie but I understand that the movie is trying to have this movie about the creatures and not the humans which is good I guess.The originality and variety of the creatures in here are fantastic. Guillermo del Toro's wide use of imagination is simply brilliant and can be seen as hard proof by seeing this movie. There's also one or two brilliant action sequences that absolutely blew me away in awe because of its ingenious thought. Many of the actors reprise their roles with one new added cast member played by gasp Seth MacFarlane! He did simply stated a fantastic job as the voice of his character. Everyone else also did a great job with their 3dimensional characters.As I end this review I'm going to say this film surprised me. Yeah maybe the new tone of relaxation is going to be getting used to and some probably won't buy it at all but in the end many people will enjoy it. The film is entertaining throughout has a great use of imagination some fantastic action sequences great characters and everything else you would wanted in a summer blockbuster!".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a prime example of why I don't often see movies in the theater anymore. If I were at home I could have just turned it off but if I've spent both time and money getting to the theater I feel compelled to at least sit thru the movie in hopes that it'll get better. This one didn't.The problem with sequels is that you've already introduced the characters in the original so now you have to make them do something the audience cares about. Which generally means a good story. The plot here is OK but its Broken truce from the pastbattle fought here on Earth tonightfate of mankind has been done ad nauseum and better than this. Del Toro has done much better work than this and I feel he's either out of his element in a big budget Hollywood movie or that he has much less creative control in such situations.This movie is a mishmash of hackneyed plot she's pregnant inane dialog You must stay fockyoused see how funny words can sound when Germans pronounce them? crummy sets the Troll Market has nothing on Diagon Alley and Abe Sapien doing his best C3PO in a fish suit impression.The Forest Elemental is a particularly offensive segment. At its start Prince Nuada opens the Golden EggCage of Power and pulls out the Pulsing Green Jelly Belly. Princess Nuala who presumably knows what this thing is does nothing to stop it does not even yell Get It! she just comments that It's heading for water as the characters inexplicably watch it bounce along and let it roll into water after a fairly lackluster attempt after it's too late by Abe to stop it. Perhaps the Jelly Belly has a standing 8 second Stupefy Curse upon release...No the real reason the characters do nothing to stop the Jelly Belly is because if they did then the movie makers wouldn't get to show us just how much money they spent on CGI. On a side note this bothered me throughout the movie. The possessed Tooth Fairy and the Sleeping Giant Rock ManDoor were just Hey Look at Me I'm CGI! scenes that could have been much shorter because they added nothing to the progression of the story. Do I really care about a killer Tooth Fairy in its death throes?Anyway back to the Elemental. This is probably the biggest budget scene but also the most emotionally muddled. After dispatching this humongous tentacled creature which predictably destroys cars buildings people etc.. the Prince leaves Hellboy a dilemma can you kill the last creature of its kind? Well since that creature tends to wantonly destroy everything it's not too hard a dilemma. After Hellboy too easily kills the creature and it starts dying we are made to feel sorry for it. Wait up 45 seconds ago it was killing people left and right and now I'm supposed to feel sorry for it as it dies? I mean it's only CGI. It bored me while it was destroying and now it's boring me while it's dying! Move on to the next scene already!The ending was almost as bad. After descending into the Lair of the Hidden Golden Army which looked suspiciously like the derelict spacecraft in Alien Hellboy has it out with Prince Nadua in every 'Gladiator meets Martial Arts' fight you've ever seen manner. It would've been better if HB had managed to dispatch the Prince in a shorter and more clever way because then we wouldn't've had to've sit through that mindnumbing segment but I suspect the movie makers had enough trouble stretching the plot to get the movie past an hour.At the very end the 4 main characters inexplicably quit their jobs and I suspect one whole scene and perhaps a subplot was cut because this mass exodus comes out of nowhere. To further highlight their resignation the German Krauss character says to Jeffrey Tambor after his pleas for their return Suck my ectoplasmic schwanzstucker which about sums up the literacy level of the script. Over 15 need not apply!The only positive thing about this cryptic ending is that now that all the main characters have quit their jobs there may be no Hellboy 3.".

If you are of the there's no way in hell they can do that mentality and wish to stab yourself in the head with a screwdriver whenever a movie pushes that envelope too far then stay far far away. The movie is disjointed and lacks continuity from the original. The action scenes aren't bad but there's a major lack of development on the part of the villain Prince Nuada and his race of people that are slowly on the verge of extinction.

Touted as indestructible Hellboy has very little problem dispatching them. I believe some more effort could have went into the final halfhour of the movie but the same could be said about the whole movie. The biggest problem I had with the movie is why did Abe make a big deal about his breathing apparatus in the beginning yet throughout the rest of the movie he doesn't wear one and is perfectly fine? Also the twist at the end of the movie was super predictable. Visually the movie was beautiful but pretty scenery can only account for a small overall piece of a film's quality.5.010".

There was a lot of good effects and the creature makeup and designs were top notch but unless you have a good gripping story then i am afraid it counts for nothing. The story line felt like you have seen it all before and knew what was round the corner it lacked the lightning pace of a good film. The original Hellboy is far superior to this and a lot more entertaining if they tried to flesh out the characters in this sequel then to me they have failed and introduced worse ones. I really hope this is not heading down the Pirates of the Caribbean route as i do like Hellboy but not this well below average second offering.".

I haven't had the luxury of reading any of the Hellboy books yet but if she had the same hairdo in the comics please comment and tell me why.Once again I'm not entirely sure if he was in the comics but Johann Krauss ruined the entire film for me. He had no significance contributing absolutely nothing to the story and having the hilarity level of about a madeforTV Disney channel movie. Please for the love of God and all that is holy why was this unimportant uninteresting and downright inexcusable character allowed any screen time? People who are used to watching new and experimental films during this modern era of cinema must learn to not be so black and white about what they see. A movie needs more than witty action banter and showy special effects to be worth a move ticket. And though I have seen much worse don't get me wrong The Golden Army just didn't measure up.".

Mainly for the great visual effects and a quite awesome action.If 'Hellboy  The Golden Army' was a standalone movie or if I didn't see the first one I'd say that something lacks in this movie. Something that make this movie very childish. But after seeing the first one I know what this movie lacks. It lacks the Hellboy character.What makes 'Hellboy' different from other superhero movies is the character of Hellboy. Cool quite egoistic funny ... . His character and charm applied to the scenes he's in. However in the second movie it's quite the opposite. The scenes are built to fit Hellboy's character. For instance it seems that the whole contribution of the 'Johann Krauss' character was that Hellboy could mock on his German accent.Some of the scenes were quite ridiculous 1 When the paranormal bunch went to Prince Nuada's den they accidentally bumped into a creature that healed Hellboy the emphasis is of course on accidental. 2 In the first scene of the 'good guys' against the 'little eating creatures' the humans FBI agents just stand still and shoot  and await to be eaten . They don't try to run or to avoid those creatures. Worse is that no one of the superheroes there tries to do anything to avoid their death. 3 There supposed to be 70 golden warriors though in the end their number is close to 70000.There are few more but I'll settle with the above.I don't think that kids will notice the flaws I mentioned. So probably they'll love it. Even more than the first one.".

This time though he has aligned himself with some big star power in the form of Robert DeNiro and Forest Whitaker but is it enough to deliver that extra punch to step this cop thriller or will it just be another forgettable addition to the genre?Freelancers follow a young cop who joins in with a group of rogue cops led by his father's expartner. When the truth about his father's death is revealed it pushes him to finally make sure justice is served. This isn't a bad movie but it isn't anything different than every other cop movie that has come along over the years. Jackson does a decent job here but just doesn't have the chops to really sell the emotional aspect of the character. He works well for the action but as soon as he has to deliver some sort of emotion it just comes off nonexistent. Whitaker and DeNiro both pretty much phone this one in but thanks to their amazing talent still manage to deliver some interesting characters. The story is pretty straight forward but wants to try and deliver twists and turns where it is pretty obvious as to where it is all headed. In addition there are some aspects of the story that just come off a bit unbelievable in the system. There's some decent action moments here but nothing that really stands out to help push this along.Overall this is a pretty generic delivery into the cop thriller but thanks to the star power behind it at least feels a bit bigger than the straight to video release it got. If you are a fan of this genre or any of those involved give it a try just don't expect anything all that new or original.httpwww.examiner.commovieindallasbobbyblakey".

We saw him pull of Mad Dog and Glory at least I did and we saw his chops as a comedian in the Fockers films. But lately the legend is disintegrating and here we find a man on autopilot restlessly moping his way through a character he's played countless times before.Freelancers finds 50 Cent as a young cop who's father is slain by bad cops when he is little. Now on the force himself Fiddy finds himself taken under the wing of corrupt captain Sarcone DeNiro along with other dirty cops like Detective Leurie Forest Whitaker.

We saw him pull of Mad Dog and Glory at least I did and we saw his chops as a comedian in the Fockers films. But lately the legend is disintegrating and here we find a man on autopilot restlessly moping his way through a character he's played countless times before.Freelancers finds 50 Cent as a young cop who's father is slain by bad cops when he is little. Now on the force himself Fiddy finds himself taken under the wing of corrupt captain Sarcone DeNiro along with other dirty cops like Detective Leurie Forest Whitaker.

	schema:reviewBody "In all fairness and truth I was quite liking the movie at first. By all means this should had been one that would had been bad to watch from start to finish and one that I should have hated watching since it stars Oscar winning actors Robert De Niro and Forest Whitaker opposite 50 Cent and Vinnie Jones. All alarm bells should go off when you hear this especially when you learn that 50 Cent is playing the lead role. But in fact the movie isn't being all that bad to watch and its first half especially makes this a decent enough little genre movie.The first half of the movie is basically one about rookie training in which rookie cops one of them played by 50 Cent get teamed up with an older and more experienced cop who starts learning them the tricks and ropes. It all sounds very familiar I know but it does work out interesting and entertaining enough and I was ready to really start liking this movie.But then its horrible second half came along. Half way through it suddenly becomes a far more standard crime movie and not a very good one I'm sad to say. About half way through exactly there is a certain scene in the movie after which the movie starts to take a turn for the worse. The scene in itself already is being something ridicules and out of tone for this movie but everything that follows after that is about just as bad and silly. Suddenly 50 Cent and friends become hardcore crime fighters trying to solve a case which also involves dirty cops while before that they were being naive and timid young cops afraid of their superiors. It doesn't quite click all and the second half almost entirely ruined the movie for me.It might seem strange to you seeing 50 Cent playing a cop in this but it in fact is not a movie that glorifies the police corps at all. On the contrary really since the cops are the biggest bad guys in this who also form the biggest danger do most of the drugs and have sex with prostitutes whenever given the opportunity all while being on duty. No I don't think the makers of this movie have a lot of love for the police man and woman out there and 50 Cent also quickly finds an excuse in this movie to take off his uniform. It's a bit too overthetop all at times which obviously doesn't make this the most convincing and realistic genre movie out there.I have always thought that 50 Cent is an horrible actor. He's even terrible in his own music videos! Now I'm not talking about him as a performer of course but he out of all rappers always seemed to be the most unlikely one to ever have a decent acting career some day. Guess movies like this won't really help his acting career forward since he also really isn't being all that impressive in this. He especially has some real difficulties in the scenes in which his character was supposed to show his emotions. And watching him sitting across Robert De Niro having dialog with him feels just wrong! They are not remotely in the same league and I was also quite surprised to see the likes of De Niro and Whitaker in this.It's definitely not the worst movie you'll ever see but it's not one to get very excited about either.510 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is an overall quite entertaining and mostly fast paced action thriller that though lacks of depth. The story simply features too many stereotypes and is therefor sometimes even mildly amusing even if this surely wasn't the intention of the makers of this bmovie.The film is about three crooks that get out of prison and get to work in the corrupt New York City Police Department. Soon they get involved in the local crime scene and must learn how to survive in tough circumstances where nobody's left whom they can trust in. At the same time the main character portrayed by a weak but not completely bad Curtis James Jackson III wants to resolve the secret of his father's assassination that he witnessed as a child.The problem with this movie is that it almost has no clear guiding line and some events happen without any logical reason whatsoever. Sometimes the characters rapidly change their moods and appear almost schizophrenic which is very odd. Apart of a slightly stronger and even quite entertaining ending at least three quarters of the movie go straight to nowhere or are highly predictable. Most of the actors and especially the cop roles are simply not credible at all and even happen to be quite ridiculous. Sometimes the movie just feels like a longer 50 Cent video clip with senseless violence gratuitous sex a very minimalistic story line and some cameo appearances by a couple of good actors such as the strong Robert De Niro or the now deceased and surprisingly convincing actor Pedro Armendriz Junior where one ends up asking oneself why these gifted guys are starring in such a bad movie.In the end there isn't much interest in watching this film. Especially the story is quite random and predictable. The low budget flick features almost more shots of nocturnal New York City every ten minutes that are taken from a plain than gripping action or suspense scenes. The only reason to watch this flick are the solid appearances of Robert De Niro as well as Pedro Armendriz Junior or if you simply are a big fan of 50 Cent. Objectively seen his acting is of a rather average quality and lacks of emotion and quality but he surely has a quite cool image and mostly promotes himself and his music in this movie. You can grab this flick at a cheap price for a loan if you have not much else to do and want to switch your brain off for one hour and a half but apart of that there definitely isn't much in this.".

The stereotype hang the guy out the window by his feet type scene that we've all seen at least three or four times already. It was plainly unbelievable and lifeless. And it was obvious they had to do some real creative editing for a few seconds in attempts to hide 50's horribly bad action performance. While watching this movie a parallel between Elvis kept coming to mind. With all due respect to the King his first few movies were great but look at the period when he was contracted to just crank them out. This movie is comparable to those okay probably worse I'd rather watch Fun in Acapulco five times over then finish watching this one just once.Skip it unless you enjoy the sensations of projectile vomit and wanting to pluck your eyes out in disgust.".

The story line wasn't bad at all nothing surprising but not bad. Watched it all the way through and didn't want to turn it off.

The biggest problem is that it was trying so hard to be another Training Day that it never really found it's way on it's own. I do have to say that 50 Cent is becoming a much better actor but this is still yet another Training Day rip off that is no where near as good.

	schema:reviewBody "How good should this film have been? Starring Robert De Niro and Forest Whitaker two great American actors and 50'Cent Curtis Jackson who I've noticed acting well in other films this should have been at the least a satisfyingly good film. So when I saw The Sony Movie Channel was airing it I thought I'd give it a view.DAMN! This was bad! If I were any of the actors I wouldn't even consider putting this on my resume. Robert De Niro played the leader of a group of bad cops Joe Sarcone who recruits Malo Curtis Jackson and his friends. These had previously been thugs who had supposedly seen the light but were very quick to jump on board Sarcone's ship so much for the good guys Milo is paired with LaRue Forest Whitaker who is a drug addict and will let anybody off if he can score from them. Even though he's not openly racist he does have a hatred for whites. This is balanced off by a minor player in the film Billy Morrison played brilliantly by Matt Gerald who is the only acting light in this dire movie as he has a hatred for anyone not white and is very vocal and aggressive about it.The only good cop in the whole film is Terrence Burke played by Robert Wisdom. He tries to keep his distance from the others and even gets his rookie partner A D Malcolm Goodwin to help him train the kids in his area at football. The only communityminded cop in the city it would appear. Even when the cop who's pursuing Sarcone's mob Robert Jude played by Michael McGrady tries to recruit Malo by telling him what really happened to his father you get the sense that he isn't as clean as he should be.This is a pretty depressing tale that paints the majority of police in a bad light stating that most of them are corrupt and on the take. If I were in this city I'd not ask a policeman directions because they would direct you down an alley shoot you in the back and steal all your valuables.The writer L Phillipe Casseus gives the audience a bleak tale of greed and depravity in the police force. This isn't a bad thing it's been done before though it's been done better. The fault I believe lies with the director Jessy Terrero who probably only got the job because he'd worked with Jackson before.Most of the scenes are slapdash and so brilliantly set out. Jackson most of the time stumbles around the sets without an idea of what his character is about. There is one hell of a lot to Malo and giving the role to a newbie without proper direction was a bad decision. De Niro is at his shouty best here stomping around hitting and shooting things. Even though it's nice to see him go berserk he just does it too much  poor guy must have needed some lockets afterwards to soothe his throat.Forest Whitaker is brilliant as the drugaddled cop... so good that he actually does appear to have been on something. It was probably needed to get through this rubbish with most of his sanity intact. But it really didn't help the movie any it just made his lines seem slurred and indistinguishable.If you like any of the actors or cop drama's then I would recommend you to stay away from this pile of diatribe.".

Now 50 Cents acting is average at best but his acting sort of served his character's role in this film he seemed cold and devoid of emotions which was quite a reflection of his character in the film so it worked out well for him but there is no denying his below average acting.the story definitely has several weak points and as one reviewer already mentioned characters shift suddenly in their behaviors nevertheless i wasn't expecting a well crafted master piece of a film but rather a nice little drama with big names and wonderful performances with a story that held my attention enough. I might be biased here because I'm a big fan of the police Drama genre like Cop land and this movie but for what its worth i thought this movie was better than Son of no one which is also a police drama starring another legend Al Pacino and Channing Tatum.I give Freelancers a 7".

	schema:headline " Nosedives below a low low line";
	schema:reviewBody "I always thought that there was a line which filmmakers would not go below as far as 'star power' movies go.  Movies which rely on the fame of their lead actorrole as the main drawcard are rarely any good but I always thought that there was a certain level of competence to them all.  I've seen Vanilla Ice spout 'drop dat zero and get wit da hero' in 'Cool as Ice' and it was not pretty.  I've seen Britney Spears recite poetry from her personal book in Crossroads and that was not good either.  And I've seen Hulk Hogan dressing up in a ballerina costume for 'Mr. Nanny' and that needs no comment.  But all of these movies managed to maintain a certain level of competence.  Granted it was not a high one but it was still there.  And Da hip hop witch was the first movie I've ever seen which stooped below that line.To try to give an outline of this movie movie is a loose term as there is no story it's necessary to first try to understand how it came about otherwise an explanation of this mess of scenes would be incomprehensible. I can see numerous ways but the most likely is that the directorwriter is a friend of eminem and came up with the idea of the hip hop witch as a take off.  He probably took up a few minutes of eminem's time and got him to speak about some hip hop witch and then I'm guessing the idea grew from there and he asked various rappers to comment on it.  After a while he would have had a good 30 minutes of comments by rappers some very famous about the 'hip hop witch' and he figured that knocking together some half plot and releasing the 'star studded' film would mean instant success. This is only an hypothesis but would explain what we have here.And what do we have here?  The answer is.A complete mess.  We have eminem who is obviously improvising his entire speech the thing would probably go on for a good 20 minutes and he continues to repeat his lines as he thinks of the next thing to say changing his story as he goes along.  The other rappers are no better for people who are or were 'scared to death by the witch' they seem to find the whole thing remarkably funny they laugh while describing their 'horrible near death experiences'.  Most of the rappers feature fleetingly ja rule would only be on screen for 30 seconds but is credited as the second lead actor which was obviously for the 'star power' motive.And then we have the other part of the movie which fills it in making it a 'releasable' 80 minutes.  We have the 5 kids who hear about the witch and go to jersey I think to hunt her down we have a reporter who wants to dig up information about the hip hop witch and we have the record producer who is secretly faking the whole hip hop witch thing while noone realises.  These characters are all arbitrary and serve only to fill in time we are treated to a long and pointless scene where the reporter argues about a promotion another scene where she hides papers in the photocopy room and then these groups start interacting to waste even more time.  Then we are informed the 'street don' has been killed which I'm sure is terrible news but it would be sadder if we knew who he was.  This time wasting continues in this roundabout fashion which I find probably the most frustrating aspect of any movie especially in an era when most filmmakers are unable to shorten their films below 2 hours.  Just about the only interaction we do not see is anyone mentioned in this paragraph with any of the rappers.  We see a reporter standing outside a door saying 'we are outside shady studios where eminem has locked himself inside for fear of the witch allowing in only our cameraman' which just goes to show that he had no interest in making a good film or spending any time shooting.  The rest of the rappers are exactly the same only ever seen on camera giving conflicting evidence never seen talking to anyone.  This just further goes towards proving the hypothesis.But the hypothesis really doesn't matter.  What matters is that this is a terrible movie. The camerawork is awful perhaps as they were aiming to imitate the blair witch project but in that movie the camerawork was believably bad in this the cameramen run circles and do gymnastics around the target seemingly aiming to induce migrains.  The acting is bad by the 'cast' and unspeakable by the rappers who obviously do not care at all. The plot is non existent the dialogue terrible basically any aspect of filmmaking here either does not exist or is so bad it's not worth mentioning.  One does begin to feel sorry for eminem as one can see that he was just joking during his 'performance' and had no idea that it would end up in this form.  It's the nerve of whoever released this that really disgusts me stooping to a level so low to make money based on eminem's face.  Watching this film just really feels wrong like it is so bad that it never should have been released.  I do hope and pray that nothing this bad will ever be made again and can only recommend that noone waste their time on this plotless rubbish unless they want to see a group of rappers improvising a string of 4 letter words.  Disgraceful.".

This witch just happens to stalks various rap artists so the white kids try to get famous by looking for her. This parody ? of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is beyond awful in every way imaginable. The screenplay is awful. The acting is awful. The direction is awful. The entire intent of this thing is awful and for the life of me I can't understand what writerdirector Dale Resteghini was trying to do other than get idiots like me to watch this film. What we've basically got is a bunch of scenes that make no sense thrown together and the highlight is seeing various hip hop artists talk about their encounter with the witch or stories they've heard about the witch. These include Eminem talking about how the witch tried to stick her butter finger up his butt. Really? Was this meant to be funny? Were we supposed to take this serious? Mobb Deep Rah Digga Pras Killah Priest Ja Rule and Vanilla Ice also show up. There's no question that this film wasn't made to try and win an Oscar but at the same time you'd hope for at least some cheap entertainment or fun. This movie really offers neither and it actually gets worse as it goes along. It's just mindblowing that the director would make a film like this but again I'm sure it was for money. Even then was there a reason for this to clock in at 90minutes? The entire film looks incredibly cheap and from what I've read the director just pretty much showed up at the various artists' locations threw them some money and then had them talk. It's clear none of them knew what the heck was going on as their stories just drag on and there's no point to any of them. DA HIP HOP WITCH is a complete piece of junk that probably ranks as the very worse I've ever seen. I at least can't think of another movie where less effort was done.".

The storyline sucked the music sucked the acting was so abysmal I can only compare it to a cheap porno minus the breasts. I remember where I was when Lennon was killed where I was when 911 occurred sadly I will remember the night that I watched this catastrophe as well. The best comparison that I can make is...Garth from Waynes world with his hair stuck in a flowbee screaming that he was losing his will to live. And lets be honest here...the only way that Vanilla Ice is going to scare anyone is if he starts trying to rap again. As for Mister Eminem? Don't quit your day job because I have seen better acting in infomercials. The combined I.Q'S of the entire cast couldn't add up to more than a lone Mensa member. I am actually embarrassed that they managed to dupe me into seeing this film. Giving us a refund simply wont suffice. I could get a refund gas money wear and tear on my vehicle for its trip to the video store a gigantic tub of popcorn twizzlers heck even an elephant ear...it STILL couldn't remove the emotional scarring that we both have after seeing this. My recommendation to anyone that has seen this is...1800CALLSAM. Personal injury attorneys.".

I have a collection of over 100 dvds that range from imports cult classics Hollywood blockbusters and the 5 dollar bin at walmart and this is by far the worst one i have. Compared to it Starship Troopers 2 looks like it should have been nominated for an Academy Award. Don't avoid it. If you see it buy it and then burn it.

	schema:headline " A decent spoof of The Blair Witch Project";
	schema:reviewBody "When reviewing this film it's hard not to be at least a little biased there are people who love some of the hiphoprap artists in this film and hate the rest there are some who hate all of themand the entire rap music genre and then there are the few who love all of themI guess though I've never met anyone who loved all of them especially since many of them hate each other. Let me say right now I hate Vanilla Ice and Ja Rule I have an enormous amount of respect and love for Eminem and his music and most of the rest of these artists I am indifferent toseveral of them I don't even know. I did indeed want to see this film because I knew Eminem was in it though not as much for his talent or my being a fan of his as simply the fact that I knew that he can be incredibly funny as I've seen a lot of interviews with him and he also played a great funny character in The Wash with Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. And let me tell you right away if you like Eminem's warped funny sense of humor that we often see in interviews you will like his performance in this film. He can really convince you that he believes what he's saying is true no matter how bizarre it sounds. Many of the other rappers give halfdecent witness statements though a few were very bad and just took up screen time. Worst was probably Ja Rule and Vanilla Ice in my opinion but then again that might just be because I hate them. The main characters of the film have unbelievably little screen time actually and are probably only there to make fun of the original group of morons from the original Blair Witch film. They only have one really funny scene and then a scene at the end that obviously makes fun of a similar scene in the original Blair Witch and apart from those two I'd guess they have two or three other scenes that might have one or two good jokes in total while the rest like several other things in this film merely take up screen time. What's funny about this film is even though there seemed to be so many low points and pointless scenes I never really felt like turning it off or leaving the room to do something more fulfilling like I seriously considered with the original Blair Witch film. Maybe it was just to see the next hilarious Eminem sequence but something definitely kept me glued to my seat throughout the entire runtime.A lot of the jokes in the film are based on what the viewer knows about hiphop and ghettos not to mention black slang which definitely limits the audience of the film though I would say that the title can't throw too many people off. This is a spoof of The Blair Witch Project that revolves around various hiphop stars. The plot is fairly incoherent and all over the place though I think that's the point. Don't expect some huge plot twist or to be told a great story. It's basically some hiphop artists making fun of the basic premise of the film a witch hunting hiphop artists. The acting is hard to comment on I wonder if it's supposed to look as lame and bad as it does which I'm pretty sure that it is. The characters are also all over the place with only a few of them being part of the actual storyapart from of course the hiphop artists themselves and even fewer of them have enough screen time for us to actually recognize them in the next scene they're inbut maybe that's just me. All in all a decent film if you're a fan of hiphop and you just want to have a good laugh that's mostly on The Blair Witch Project's expense but not something I would recommend too many people to watch as many will hate itIt appears that most who've seen it already do. I recommend it to huge fans of one or more of the hiphop artists or just people who'll go to great lengths to laugh at and mock The Blair Witch Project. Not something you want to spend too much money onI got it as a gift thankfully. 510".

Neither of the two stars Shirley MacLaine or Nicholas Cage are normally high on my list of favorites but they pull off this odd ball relationship to perfection. There's chemistry here just not in the usual sense of the word! It's a plot idea unlike any I've previously encountered...Doug Nicholas Cage is a Secret Service man assigned the dubious honor of guarding Tess Carlisle Shirley MacLaine the feisty aging crotchety widow of a former American President and friend to the current President who owes her favors and she doesn't let him forget it!. Nothing Doug does pleases Tess nothing ANYONE does pleases Tess. Yet she has an obvious underlying affection for her Secret Service guard the only agent she'll in fact tolerate who most of the time wishes he had just about any other job. Tess's own son totally neglects her and she's a lonely lady caught up in old memories of her past White House days when she and her husband were objects of great respect affection and attention. Tess is a cantankerous character now of course Shirley MacLaine's a natural for the part! but altogether sympathetic. I won't give away the story but Doug has his work cut out for him and not just putting up with her moods whims and assorted outrages. The plot thickens and drama awaits...There's action and adventure but the movie is much more character driven than plot driven. It's a treat to watch the unfolding relationship between this unlikely pair. Whether it's a realistic scenario or not it makes for an entertaining amusing and touching movie you're bound to enjoy.".

From an infinite number of quickly subdued facial expressions inhalations and rare comments we see that Tess the former first lady is a complicated character built of far more complex material than that which has created simply a tiresome demanding and spoiled lady finding herself in old age without having prepared for the life she has now.Rather quickly we see her aloneness in the world.

	schema:headline " Nick Cage and Shirley MacLaine make this an enjoyable little movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "Somehow I had never gotten around to seeing Guarding Tess but did so this week on broadcast TV.  It starts with Nick Cage playing a by the book Special Agent assigned to guard former first lady Tess ending his tour of duty and returning to D.C. Upon arrival he is informed that the president has personally requested that Cage return to Tess for another 3 years because she likes him. His choices were that or be assigned to guard the president's dog! So he went back to rural Ohio combatant and bitter because the old lady whose husband had died of a heart attack was very difficult to get along with.  Turns out she also had inoperable brain tumor which only her doctors know about which complicated her demeanor.The last 34 of the film deals first with their relationship which gradually improves to the point where the two of them actually go to a bar and have drinks.  Turns out that Nick's character represents the son she never had. Oh she had a son but he only shows up for one scene Edward Albert where he tries to get her to endorse a retirement development he is working on and she refuses simply saying no. It was clear they had no relationship.Some drama is introduced when Tess' driver along with his sister and her husband plot to kidnap Tess and demand 15million taking hew away as Nick retrieved a folding chair at the lake after an outing with Tess. Cig lighter burns on the driver's neck provides the clue for Nick to solve the crime and they retrieve her 6 feet under with a 4inch PVC pipe breathing tube. They apparently had no plan to free her so Nick actually saved her life.Most of the film was obviously humorous and was fun as such. The serious ending didn't quite fit. However watching the good acting by Nick Cage and his interaction with Tess make this a very watchable movie. I rate it 7 of 10. Shirley MacLaine gives her usual solid performance essentially the same character she plays in all her movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is not the first time that we have seen Shirley McLaine play the role of a crusty old lady and in the 1994 movie Guarding Tess is no exception either. But it has me wondering how many bitchy roles has McLaine played throughout her career? If you check out IMDb.com you will notice that she has played a myriad of cantankerous characters the best being Terms of Endearment but no matter what she has played those roles flawlessly. Therefore we can safely summarize that McLaine could have easily played her part as widowed exFirst Lady Tess Carlisle with her eyes closed.Situated between the genres of comedy and drama I felt that the comedy outweights the drama by a near margin of 55 to 45 percent. However no matter how you look at it Guarding Tess is a warm affectionate and lightweight that succeeds in refraining from being overly hilarious and from being overly sentimental. Without being judgemental we get to take a liking to Tess and her guard a Secret Service Agent Doug Chesnic Nicolas Cage we still feel that they're still strangers to their audience. Sure we understand that Doug has other ambitions with with his life and Tess is quite lonesome. But everything we know about Tess and Doug and the other supporting characters is what's shown on the screen. There is no physical mental or visual indicators that give us any information as to why Tess hardly has visitations from anyone.One of the more memorable scenes is when Tess goes grocery shopping. McLaine steals every scene she's in and she does this flawlessly. Then after news of her abduction Doug goes out to get information of her whereabouts and goes far as to shoot someone's toe off during that process. Later when he tells her about the whole toe incident she responds in a pitiful way. I also found it hilarious when Tess goes on the phone and starts speaking to the current President and refers to him by his first name.Overall this movie was light in comedy and drama and the characters on the whole were very likable. The chemistry between the two leads Tess and Doug was very magnetic and there are many scenes with will linger in mind for a longtime. I only wish that there was more information as why these characters are what they are and the only thing we know about the characters is what's presented on the screen. And so what if Shirley McLaine is typecasted as a crusty old widow she's natural in playing those kind of roles.".

However it is pretty forgettable and this film has similar themes and plot points as the much better film Driving Miss Daisy. Both films are about a younger guy and an older woman going at it with each other before their relationship improved. But all in all this is a good lighthearted film.Hugh Wilson's film is about a Special Agent Douglas who has been trained for the very best. Instead he is assigned to keep watch over former First Lady Tess Carlisle. We realize that these two people have nothing in common and is very hard to get along.The acting is solid. Shirley MacLaine is one of Hollywood's best and rumor has it that this role is very similar to her reallife persona. But she was magnificent here. Nicolas Cage is also good and his role is very restrained for once. There are other wonderful 90's character actors that take up the screen including Richard Griffiths and James Rebhorn.Overall this is a delightful mildmannered film about two people with nothing in common defying odds so that they begin to respect each other. This is labeled as a comedy but I can't see why. I hardly laughed but this works very well as a drama. This film reminds me greatly of Driving Miss Daisy and I think that's a good thing. I rate this film 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having just read a section of the book Camera Politica the idea of reaction against feminism has been on my mind. Some of the movies of the early eighties was much a reaction against feminism and the rebuilding of the patriarchal society. Guarding Tess is a movie that falls into this category though it was released in the early 90's. Guarding Tess is a reaction to is the woman's desire for individuality.Guarding Tess is about a former first lady Tess Carlyse Shirley McClaine and a secret service agent Nicholas Cage. The agent finishes his duty looking after Tess and returns to Washington but is pulled back straight away because Tess trusts him. Tess is a very strong willed dominant woman that does not like people pushing her around. She has mostly male servants and secret service agents and likes to try and break away from their watching every so often. Tess is portrayed as a typical feminist who wants to be independent of male support.Tess' character goes deeper though for she also takes the role of the dominant gender. She is not happy unless she dominates the male sex such as the seven secret service agents in her employ. The President who sounds like a cowboy is also very much dominated by her and we see from the couple of phone calls she has with him actually only one at the end that she has him under her control.This movie though goes to undermine this dominance of the female to show the need for the woman to rely upon the male. Tess is not only dying of a brain tumor but she is placed in a position of helplessness that without her secret service agent she would die. She is a very strong woman but she needs a male to survive. This is played out in the kidnap scene where Cage digs her out of her grave.Tess treats Cage like a son. This becomes apparent when we meet her son an ambitious but failing real estate salesperson. He comes to visit her but only to try and win her support on a development program. We realise that what Tess really wants is a relationship one of equals and friendship rather than business associates.In some ways this is a relationship movie and the theme music reveals this. The break in the relationship caused by the kidnapping is a sorrowful part of the movie not an exciting part. It is about relationships and dependence. It is a lash at feminism to say that even if the male cannot do anything else we need them for companionship for that is the fundamental aspect of our nature relationship.".

Shirley Maclaine can see that this is a thin idea and really works the slowburn heart of the film only softening her stubborn lonely widower by increments.

She's cranky mean and willing to do whatever it takes to drive people crazy.I honestly didn't find the film to be overly funny but there's no question that the two stars are very good in their roles and they also share some nice chemistry.

However if you can make it past the puerile comedy face pulling 3 Stoogesstyle routines and endless attempts by the 'heroes' at ogling or fondling young women and turn a blind eye to the forgettable story cops v bad guys there is plenty of other stuff to enjoy about this manic 80s Hong Kong classic.Featuring martial arts superstars Sammo Hung Jackie Chan Yuen Baio and Andy Lau Twinkle Twinkle's action scenes are amongst the best you'll see on film. An early fight between good guys Chan Baio and Lau and a warehouse full of gangsters showcases each star's incredible moves with Baio in particular impressing with some mighty fine acrobatic kicks. Sammo Hung also gets to shine in a fantastic showdown against both an Aussie badguy the formidable Richard Norton and a sai wielding Japanese killer.And even when the action lulled and the 'comedy' was in full swing the movie kept my attention thanks to the presence of several rather lovely ladies pretty Sibelle Hu returns as Barbara Woo the gorgeous Rosamund Kwan stars as ladyinperil and object of lust for the guys ChiChi Wang and even Michelle Yeoh pops up as a sexy Karate instructor.Although not the best Hong Kong actioner of the 80s by a long shot Sammo Hung's Eastern Condors gets my vote for that accolade Twinkle Twinkle Lucky Stars is still on the whole very entertaining and well worth giving a go.6.5 out of 10 rounded up to 7 for IMDb.".

At least this one has a great cameo from Michelle Yeoh as a fight instructor and what seems like half of the Hong Kong stars of the time coming out of a lift at the end.";

	schema:reviewBody "This broadly humorous sequel to the cult hit MY LUCKY STARS is another film cast from the same mould small scale comedy and laughs combine with hardhitting action the result is a rollercoaster of a film slow in some spots and riproaring in others. The thing that really made me enjoy this film was the fun atmosphere even more improved since the last instalment the leads now seem really natural together as they should having starred in two ensemble films previously and the comedy comes brisk and naturally. Plenty of the humour surrounds the boys' attempts to score with a pretty young woman creating fires and fights in an attempt to grope and see her naked as many times as possible. Yes it all sounds pretty low brow but that's the point and there's an innocence about the humour which makes it impossible to dislike.Just about every cast member acquits themselves admirably in this production. The comedy stars shine through and the action heroes are quite wonderful. Comedy and action is mixed together in a successful always moving nonboring sequence. There are two main martial arts sequences whilst the rest of the film involves incredible stunts jumping from buildings and moving cars particularly motorbike chases shootouts and just plain oldfashioned escapism Jackie shooting the door off his car is a favourite moment. The warehouse attack about halfway through is a major tourdeforce for stars Jackie Chan Yuen Biao and a young Andy Lau. Each faces a weaponwielding toughie in a warehouse setting the resultant fights are fast and furious in the truest sense of the words.The film is really a who's who of Asian talent along with bitparts from popular players like Kara Hui Jason Pai Piao Phillip Ko and villain Dick Wei we have freshfaced soontobefamous bits from Michelle Yeoh and Andy Lau amongst the more established turns of the three leads. Rosamund Kwan lends fiery support but the fun is in the villainous trio comprising Fat Chung with hilarious eyebrows imposing Japanese villain Yasuaki Kurata and best of all the Australian martial arts master Richard Norton. In one of his first roles Norton is great as the shellsuit clad baddie particularly when shooting people with a machine gun whilst hanggliding through the air! He also gets some great dialogue such as in the final fight scene Painful?. Norton's tongueincheek turn makes for the best villain of the series and every scene with him is a winner.Sammo Hung only really comes to light in the film's finale a chasecumshootoutcummassfight in a theatre and a restaurant. There's a great gag in which a girl pretends to be blind then some blistering action from Hung and Chan. Hung is particularly good wielding wooden tennis rackets and beating bad guys like the pro he is. Obviously these kind of films are an acquired taste a mix of oldfashioned slapstick sniggering schoolboy humour and the kind of martial arts flavoured mayhem they can only make in Hong Kong. It's reall rather good.".

Muscles Jackie Chan and Ricky Biao Yuen are under cover HK cops. They are assigned to protect their colleague Barbara Woo Sibelle Hu who is also assigned to protect informant YiChing. Barbara has also solicited the help of her five friends. Together they fend off the assassination attempt of the gangs who are trafficking drugs between Thailand and Hong Kong. This movie stars almost the same cast as Winners and Sinners and My Lucky Stars that was also produced by Sammo. The atmosphere of the story is almost identical too. They are so similar that it's hard to tell which movie is which at some point. The story goes nowhere until the last where there's massive amounts of hand to hand combat. This is also same as the Winners and Sinners and My Lucky Stars. The story is made around the talents of these five stars Six if you count Sibelle Hu and isn't particularly fresh approach compared to other HK movies of that time. This movie has the best cast. It's the earliest movie I've seen Andy Lau in. Other stars includes Yasuaki Kurata Rosamund Kuan and Michelle Yeoh to name a few. Out of the three almost identical movies this one is the best made and most recommended for viewing.".

They are so similar that it's hard to tell which movie is which at some point. The story goes nowhere until the last where there's massive amounts of hand to hand combat. This is also same as the Winners and Sinners and My Lucky Stars. The story is made around the talents of these five stars Six if you count Sibelle Hu and isn't particularly fresh approach compared to other HK movies of that time. This movie has the best cast. It's the earliest movie I've seen Andy Lau in. Other stars includes Yasuaki Kurata Rosamund Kuan and Michelle Yeoh to name a few. Out of the three almost identical movies this one is the best made and most recommended for viewing.";

	schema:headline " Terrible comedy with a couple of decent action scenes! 210";
	schema:reviewBody "Review This movie was awful. There's loads of unnecessary comedy which is really not funny but the action is fast when it is taken seriously. I thought that the movie was going to be based around Jackie Chan and his crime squad but most of the scenes are with these 5 characters who seemed more like the Marx Brothers than action heroes. Anyway the serious side of the movie is about a police informant who sends an important letter to his friend which contains information about an illegal drug operation. When the informant gets brutally murdered by the druglords hit men the cops put the informants friend in protect custody by making her stay with the 5 Lucky Stars who I personally thought was a bunch of misfits who were completely useless. When the druglords find out about the mysterious letter that will damage there operation they go on the hunt for the woman that the police are protecting but Muscles Jackie Chan and his elite squad manage to stop them in there tracks by using there Kung Fu skills to take down the bad guys. The movie wouldn't have been that bad if that was the main story because the epic battles with the bad guys actually wasn't that bad but we're stuck with this badly written comedy scenes which became hard to watch after a while. I should have known what to expect once I saw that Sammo Hung was in the directing chair because he's known for his comedic movies which I really don't find that funny but I thought that I would give this movie a go because I'm close to finishing my Jackie Chan season. His acting wasn't bad in this film and the epic fight at the end was worth the wait but the rest of the movie was a waste of time. Disappointing!RoundUp This movie was directed by Sammo Hung 63 who brought you the great Prodigal Son Winners  Sinners Project A Wheels on Meals Dragons Forever Moon Warriors the Evil Cult and Mr. Nice Guy. Personally I'm not a fan of his movies because I don't really find his comedy that funny but he can fight and he does put together some epic action scenes. His haircut was really strange in this film along with his weird costumes and he did seem to be making a fool out of himself in most of the scenes. With that aside the elite police squad made this film slightly watchable but I still found the core of the movie quite poor.I recommend this movie to people who are into their actionmartial artscomedies starring Jackie Chan Sammo Hung Biao Yuen Michelle Yeoh Richard Ng and Andy Lau. 210".

I see this film in the ballpark of The Evil Dead ReAnimator Bad Taste and many other classics of splatter legend. I don't feel the need to criticize the acting unless you count the first two hapless victims and this is because this movie does what most movies don't with their characters it makes them REAL people. The fantastic elements blend beautifully with the boring frustrating mess of most people's everyday life. Still this is a fun bmovie which means instead of depressing us with the reallife stuff it puts some humorous spins on it. The gore and creature FX are amazing. Don't let that R rating fool you this is one HARD R so those with weak stomachs need not apply. The creature FX I was amazed by most of all. I would love to know how they did this with such a low budget! Everything in this looks extremely vivid and real with the exception of some amateurish backgrounds at the beginning and end that are obviously pictures somebody painted or whatever. Even the computer cartoons of Jurassic Park do not hold a candle to these creature FX in the least. This is definitely one of the greatest indiescifihorrorsplatter films ever and I do wonder why it hasn't got the kind of recognition that movies like Evil Dead have no bigbudget sequels maybe?. As for those who call Parasite a sequel to this I don't get it. Not only is this a film far more superior to Parasite and was seemingly made by totally different people there is absolutely no way to connect them unless you're talking genrewise. Parasite is in the faroff future this one's in the present. Parasite is about genetically engineered creatures this one's about space aliens. This one has a sense of humor. Parasite doesn't. In any case I love Return of the Aliens The Deadly Spawn no matter what title it's under for it is the classic that Parasite should have been and much much more.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie in the mid '80s renting it for a highschool slumberparty I dubbed Dusk to Dawn' a marathon of Bmovie horror flicks.  My jaw dropped  this was intense stuff!  I recently watched it again and was extremely impressed by the imaginative filmmaking by everyone involved. First off I don't this utterly fantastic piece of lowbudget filmmaking should be referred to as a ripoff of Alien.'  Just because both films share something' that comes from another world with sharp teeth and kills people doesn't mean they're in the same ballpark!  If anything this film owes a lot more to old Corman pieces and stuff like Trilogy of Terror' Don't Look In The Basement' the early Raimi pieces and the reprehensible Rabid' starring Marilyn Chambers.  If there's any connection real or feigned it comes from the distributors who hoping to cash in on the rumor of a sequel to Alien' gave Deadly Spawn' another theatrical as The Return Of The Aliens The Deadly Spawn' hence the odd title or Return of the Alien's Deadly Spawn' if you like Continental's misprint.I enjoy this film because it's gritty and real shot in 16mm over weekends only filled with the normalcy of everyday life  people prepare breakfast and lunch they feed the cat they worry about tests they talk about plaster giraffes.  The director gives us a glimpse into a normal middleclass family with a penchant for hardwork and education then shows us how they and a surrounding circle of people react based on their backgrounds.  For example the brainy older brother wants to dissect one of the alien brood the uncle wants to help his nephew by psychoanalyzing him a little the younger imaginative brother wants to defeat the entire pack as a horrorfilm defender the little old ladies fight back dynamically  hell aliens are nothing next to the Depressionera vermin they might have faced! Simply put this is topnotch amateur acting with a dose of actuality!  By film's end you feel at home in their house despite the nastiness!That said almost all of the actors here are great!  Boring' Uncle Herb played by John Schmerling must be where the character of Dr. Frazier Crane Kelsey Grammar came from 'cause he's on the money!  Other MVPs include Ethel Michelson as the progressive Aunt Millie and Judith Mayes as her offthewall newage mother Bunny.  And unlike the array of idiot characters you get in most horror flicks these characters seem pretty smart especially Charlie played by Charles George Hildebrandt who comes to breakfast reading a copy of Famous Monsters' and his scientist brother Pete Michael Robert Coleman.  I like the way director Douglas McKeown juxtaposes their two disciplines outlooks on life  left brain right brain against one another. in the end science and imagination triumph together in sheer MacGyver genius!This is an independent film much like Evil Dead III' with the same tongueincheek approach plenty of pointofview shots the same good editing though certainly not as tight and loads of staggeringly elaborate alien and gore effects that would make Tom Savini proud.  The adult alien is much like Audrey the blood thirsty plant from The Little Shop of Horrors' but has thousands of teeth and an almostleering grin while the offspring are part piranha part mealworm part eel part phallus  they like look like something you'd see in a Gwar stageshow or film.  None ever seem like puppets!   Like Raimi's film this one has an energy and spirit that surpass the goreandhorror paintbynumbers.  In fact while McKeown with screenwriters Ted Bohus and John Dods isn't as effective as Raimi in the humor department here he brings a much deeper social and truthseeking criticism to the table.  He pokes fun at vegetarians amidst maneating aliens and ends the film in a 'black humor' finale.A charming film Deadly Spawn' overcame some serious distribution problems imagine that and eventually grossed something like 320000 in one weekend ?.  Made for less than 20000 it's since gone on to make several million dollars wonder who got the dough?.  Hooray for the little man!".

It has the same elements that made Peter Jacksons Braindead and Bad Taste so good heart. the people who made this film obviously loved what they where doing and managed to pull off some great special effects and gore whilst doing so. i wish this film had another equally lowbudget followup because the creatures are really great and after watching it you can almost smell all those 80's creature features looming round the corner.

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the best alienmonster slaughtering and splattering movies I've ever seen! It is so funny and creative as the monsters are something I hadn't seen before. They are ugly disgusting hungry and have about 7000 teeth! They can also move but pretty slowly. How they did those monsters with the low budget? They look so fantastic and scary as they actually have nothing but huge mouths and hundreds of sharp teeth in them.Some alien stone comes from the space and crushes into the Earth with these nasty visitors. Soon they find a new home in a cellar of one apartment and then the fun begins. There is one slow sequence in the middle of the film and it is boring to sit through but fortunately for most of the time there is always something going on. The effects and overall look of the film is so 80's and low budgeted and nostalgic and it really makes to miss those golden days when these were made. Nasty slashers stupid Conan rip offs alien clones etc. Those were the legendary days that produced us these gems that we can now track down and enjoy. The Deadly Spawn is recommended HIGHLY for all fans of marginal cinema and especially monster cinema because these babies are something new! They bite in a way that no other monster has ever bitten before! They appear also in a form of slithery worms and it only raises the pukeometer and funometer but only for those who understand these rare pieces of gold. Others will only feel sick watching these!This film earns at least 7 ultra gory stars out of ten and these films will NEVER die no matter how many stupid mainstream efforts or modern horror films are made!".

You get peeled off skin decapitations bites limbs chewed off and more. It is a unique film and a great standout scene includes the monster's babys they look like mean tadpoles with teeth attack an old folk's home. totally funny stuff seeing a retirement home go into chaos.If i were an actual film critic i'd score this movie 4 out of 10.

	schema:reviewBody "What this film lacks in budget and professionalism it certainly makes up for in terms of special effects I would say that these are some of the most inventive imaginative and damned good effects that I've ever seen in an amateur film. Okay so some effects like the miniatures at the beginning and end are predictably awful but the actual alien creatures themselves here definitely do not disappoint.The plot is a typical one involving an alien invasion which begins with a meteorite crashing into the woods hmm where have we heard that before? THE BLOB maybe?. Scores of little worm things are released into the countryside and some take refuge in the open basement of a house where they quickly develop. The family members are then picked off one by one by the horrible creatures. So to put it very basically a group of people trapped in an isolated location are menaced by a toothy beast. I guess the makers of this film saw ALIEN when it came out four years previously.The acting is as you can imagine really bad with people either reading the lines off their cards or simply not bothering at all. It's not really really bad but it's quite laughable. There's nothing in the way of scenery or atmosphere and the amateur nature of the film is noticeable at all times. And sad to say towards the end it all gets rather silly indeed with our young hero employing the same methods as Roy Scheider did in JAWS to get rid of the monster.But...there are some real standout moments here which just have to be seen to be believed. Some notable gore moments include a corpse with worms wriggling from the eye sockets and bursting from the sockets and a head being pulled off and the decapitated body being thrown through a window. There's another hilarious moment where the worms attack a group of old ladies having a party. The creatures themselves sometimes look bad sometimes look real enough to be convincing especially during an impromptu dissection on one of them.The highlight of this film for me and I'm sure for many others comes when a young boy ventures into his basement. He wanders through the darkness before his torch lights something up in the gloom. It's the alien a multiheaded creature with rows of sicklylooking teeth something which could almost be Lovecraftian in nature. At its feet or should I say tentacles lies a half eaten body. Then from its jaws falls the head of the boy's mother all mutilated. The tiny monsters then proceed to tear the flesh from the head in graphic detail. Let me say this scene is absolutely PERFECT. It immediately repulses horrifies and scares setting out exactly what it was meant to do. The effects work because the basement is dark and the darkness hides any joints. There's no CGI this monster has body texture you can almost smell it. I'm actually inclined to say that this one scene is one of the best I've ever seen in a monster movie in this one moment everything falls into place and it actually becomes better than ALIEN the film which it was ripping off. Therefore it has to be watched because of this just to watch this totally unexpected graphic and shocking moment. And the rest of the film isn't that bad so why not give it a go?".

Despite being low budget and over the top the effects are pretty shocking and eye popping and definitely not for the squeamish.".

This is a monster movie 1980's style! It starts off with the meteor crashing and the creatures emerging killing anyone nearby. They somehow make their way to a cellar in a family house. Living in the house is a little boy obsessed with horror films who sure enough becomes the hero due to his vast knowledge of how to defeat monsters. There is plenty of blood splatter and hilarious scenes such as when the creatures attack a house full of elderly ladies having some sort of vegetarian party one of the sluglike creatures ends up in someones salad!. This is the funniest scene in the film and one you will want to watch again and again. I actually found the small sluglike creatures more creepy than the full sized monsters because they looked more realistic. I even had a nightmare after watching this about slimy slug creatures in my living room! I would recommend The Deadly Spawn to all horror fans who can tolerate cheesy monster horror films it has plenty of blood to satisfy and is highly entertaining. It loses 1 mark from me only because some scenes are slightly boring but the good parts make up for it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Deadly Spawn is very likable earnest stuff and one can tell that it's made by fellow fans of the scifi and horror genres. Made for approximately 25000 and filmed on location in New Jersey it's done in a fine old school style with use of obvious matte paintings and the kind of practical effects that people like me thrilled over during their introductions to this kind of thing. Its story deals with a meteorite that crashes in the woods a meteorite bearing a disgusting species that basically looks like a many toothed very phallic version of Audrey II. The miniature versions of the monster definitely will have viewers thinking along sexual lines! After gobbling up some dumb ass campers the creatures find a nice comfy home in the damp cellar of a nearby house and during the course of the next rainy day find an assortment of human victims on which to snack. Now The Deadly Spawn is likely not going to quite be for everybody as it takes its time preparing for its wild finale. One may grow impatient as the people inside the house go about their business completely oblivious to the danger down below. For a movie running a mere 82 minutes there is some slow pacing going on to be sure. But it's too hard to really knock a movie featuring such characters as a horror junkie kid Charles George Hildebrandt who's got enough smarts to figure out a way to destroy the monster Give this kid credit also for staying so cool when he sees what remains of his mom. his science obsessed teen aged brother Tom DeFranco and their psychiatrist uncle John Schmerling who takes the time to interview his precocious young nephew about his interest. The writing isn't completely predictable with a nasty fate in store for a rather amiable character. There's lots of splatter tossed about and genre lovers will be delighted once the attack is finally underway and our human cast starts getting munched on. It's never ever taken too seriously with the tongue in cheek tone emphasized strongly with that priceless it ain't over yet final shot. The acting is admirably sincere and the shoestring budget and absence of excessive slickness you'd get from a studio picture makes The Deadly Spawn a pleasing unpretentious and simply fun experience flaws and all. Seven out of 10.".

It's that simple but that doesn't mean it isn't lot of fun.Characters aren't all that great but they are functional. They work within the story because let's face it  you're watching this movie to see monster eat somebody. Script starts out fast and it's fast moving for most of the parts but there are some moments when movie tends to drag along like it's trying to fill in the runtime. There's a random scene with grannies and baby aliens that is so over the top that you'll laugh hard. You have to experience itGore is well done for a time period and budget it had. Monster looks great and puppets are well handled. Direction and camera work isn't all that impressive but it's not terrible. Acting is mixed bag but it won't matter much. If you're watching movie called Return of the Aliens The Deadly Spawn you're probably horror fan that's use to campy acting in campy movies.5 stars. If you're horror fan don't miss it.Ps. There's no first alien movie. Title was probably made up by distributors to cashin on Alien movies much like it's unrelated so called sequel Metamorphosis.".

However the Ministry of Education the official reminiscent of Lenin's widow Krupskaya sends her off to the Altai Mountains in Russian Mongolia to provide basic education for the youngest children of the Altai shepherds. Once in the desolate frozen mountain area she begins building a school. The male population particularly is against it. All Kuzmina's attempts to educate the children are obstructed and the local soviet leader is a lazy corrupt burocrate! Kuzmina is abducted and left alone in the snow far from the little village. She is rescued by a little plane and brought back to her beloved Leningrad promising the children that she will return to do her job. Odna was designed as a silent film. When it was about to be released sound film was introduced in the USSR. Shostakovich wrote a dazzling score for Odna which also received some lines of dialogue. The picture is based on contrasts between the safe haven of modern Leningrad and life in the middle of a frozen nowhere. Between education and the poverty of noneducation. Between progress and medieval backwardness. The drama was inspired by a small newspaper article about a young woman in the middle of nowhere being rescued by an airplane crew.".

After it fell into political disfavour the film was archived in the Lenfilm complex which was destroyed during the siege of Leningrad. Fortunately although much of the score was lost all but one 8minute reel survived as did the full score for the missing reel. Mark FitzGerald and colleagues with the encouragement of Shostakovich's widow completed the restoration of the original score in 2003. It was first performed in the Netherlands and has also been performed in France Switzerland and Germany. I attended the London Premiere on 10th February 2006.Normally a review relates to an experience that can be shared subsequently by any cinemagoer or watcher of DVDs. A live concert performance the BBC Symphony Orchesttra conducted by Mark FitzGerald is different. The entire orchestral performance and live sound effects such as the throat singer Theramin and Harmonium will not be constant factors  which is why performances of great musical works are reviewed repeatedly. The performance I experienced may be different from what you experience. For me what might have been a rather sentimental ending was transformed by the 'buzz' of the live musical climax the entire restored score was performed with titles explaining the action of the missing reel.A notable feature of the film was the superb natural performance of the 'actors' including a real shaman performing a real ritual with none of the exaggerated eye makeup of 'Napoleon' and the German expressionists. Such a live performance converted a good propaganda film into something more sublime and an experience that should not be missed if the opportunity is repeated.".

Ja even in the Communist Country par excellence there is that kind of youngster  who recently has graduated to become a school teacher she lives in a big city and she is a modern girl. She wants to work at any school in her city teaching to poor kids the glorious achievements of the Socialist regime and while she explains the incredible and exciting Leninist life or the successful potatoes' annual harvest ratings she has planned to marry her fianc starting in this way a wonderful Bolshevist life. But in the U.S.S.R. there is no chance for a wonderful life and those dreams of hers suddenly are broken when she is posted to the faraway Altai region of Russian Mongolia In this Herr Kozintsev and Herr Trauberg's work are depicted the contradictions the big differences between the city and the isolated towns of the vast U.S.S.R. the old and new  as Herr Eisenstein said some years before  Kuzmina's modern spirit full of initiative  it's very interesting and even curious to watch in the film how Kuzmina rebels against the fact that she has been posted to such a far away place even defying the authorities for their designation a strange criticism in this film against the Soviet authorities although finally that subject is solved by the young schoolteacher's patriotism deciding her sacrifice takes priority over her suspicious individualism  against the ancient customs of the Altai region where Kuzmina will find selfishness corruption and loneliness.

Ja even in the Communist Country par excellence there is that kind of youngster  who recently has graduated to become a school teacher she lives in a big city and she is a modern girl. She wants to work at any school in her city teaching to poor kids the glorious achievements of the Socialist regime and while she explains the incredible and exciting Leninist life or the successful potatoes' annual harvest ratings she has planned to marry her fianc starting in this way a wonderful Bolshevist life. But in the U.S.S.R. there is no chance for a wonderful life and those dreams of hers suddenly are broken when she is posted to the faraway Altai region of Russian Mongolia In this Herr Kozintsev and Herr Trauberg's work are depicted the contradictions the big differences between the city and the isolated towns of the vast U.S.S.R. the old and new  as Herr Eisenstein said some years before  Kuzmina's modern spirit full of initiative  it's very interesting and even curious to watch in the film how Kuzmina rebels against the fact that she has been posted to such a far away place even defying the authorities for their designation a strange criticism in this film against the Soviet authorities although finally that subject is solved by the young schoolteacher's patriotism deciding her sacrifice takes priority over her suspicious individualism  against the ancient customs of the Altai region where Kuzmina will find selfishness corruption and loneliness. The main character of the film will also fight against the local soviet  even the Bolshevist chiefs are fond of bribery  denouncing the injustices that are committed in the town trying to open the villagers' eyes to such abuse of authority.

In this movie this pole orienting the viewer is missing. Howeverlike those early preLeone movies it has a bizarre enthusiasm that is enjoyable in and of itself even if the movie itself is simply silly. Pistol for a Hundred Coffins with its goofy madmen escaped from an insane asylum is reminiscent of the portrayal of the mentally ill in povertyrow American horror movies of the 1930s and 1940s. Similarly Gun Shy Piluk is evocative of American bwesterns from the 1930s especially the hoedown scene. These movies can have a rawness to their aesthetic that is really intriguing to some degree Gun Shy Piluk also has that quality. To think that it was made in the late 1960s is a little startling.Piluk's son the sheriff has been shot in the back by Sebastian Mason Dan Harrison who with his brothers dominates the town.

	schema:headline " A colorful wellwritten portrayal of a forgotten event in the history of television";
	schema:reviewBody "Quiz Show is the type of movie that invites viewers to ask themselves how they would act under similar circumstances. If you were a contestant on a TV game show and the producers offered you a load of money to do a fixed show where you're given the answers in advance would you do it? Or would you turn your back on the producers and walk away? In this film Charles Van Doren does not walk away but he does hesitate. As played by Ralph Fiennes he's a bright likable fellow who seems like a good man despite his willing participation in a fraud.The film is smartly written tightly plotted and populated by interesting characters. It is also entertaining. It unfolds like a great detective story except that no murder has taken place. There isn't even any crime. As shocking as it may seem there were no laws against rigging a quiz show back in the 1950s because no lawmaker had considered that such a thing would ever happen. When the scandal came to light those working behind the scenes who engineered the fraud managed to survive with their careers intact and the people who suffered the harshest consequences were the contestants who were simply pawns. That says something about the distortions of television culture but this theme among others is nicely understated in the film.Director Robert Redford has a gift for finding the drama in seemingly mundane topics but not in a contrived or manipulative fashion. The '50s quiz show scandal is the sort of topic that could easily have made for a preachy and artificial TV movie. It's a great credit to Redford's film that it doesn't contain any long moralizing speeches. Though the movie has many great quotes the characters talk like real people and the situations grow out of their personalities. We end up rooting for several characters at once. We want Richard Goodwin Rob Morrow the lawyer sent to investigate the show to succeed in uncovering the scandal. But we also feel for Van Doren who almost comes off as a tragic hero. We even feel a little for the pathetic and unlikable Herb Stemple John Turturro the whistleblower who's been bamboozled and humiliated by the producers.The movie works on the most basic level as simple drama the high points being those scenes where Goodwin uncovers each new layer to the case. The first time I saw the film I was put in mind of a detective story like Colombo. There's no mystery of course since we know from the start who the perpetrators are what they did and how they did it. But the labyrinth of corruption that Goodwin must probe is fascinating to behold.Goodwin naively assumes he's practically taking down the network the movie hints that the scandal goes to the very top even though no laws were broken. The situation has the feel of a conspiracy the people talking in euphemisms like they were mob bosses or something For seventy grand you can afford to be humiliated. The contestants themselves are no dummies they are smart knowledgeable people who could very well have been used honestly on a trivia show. The producers simply wanted to control the responses to make the show more dramatic. What made this unethical was the amount of deception it required. It's one thing to have entertainment that everyone knows is fake e.g. prowrestling it's quite another to pass off something phony as something real. Of course now I'm getting preachy something I praised the movie for not doing. But that's exactly my point. In a lesser movie there would have been characters explaining the distinction. Here it's left to us to assess the situation. That's the best kind of movie the kind that invites further discussion.Above all the movie is about integrity and what defines it. Goodwin in a classic reversal of our culture's typical view of lawyers is the boy scout in the story who says at one point that he would never have participated in the fraud if he were in Van Doren's shoes and we believe him. But a large part of the film involves his relationship with Van Doren a man he likes and doesn't want to hurt. His desire to protect Van Doren but not Stemple from ruin while bringing down the true perpetrators of the scandal leads to one of the movie's most memorable lines when Goodwin's wife calls Goodwin the Uncle Tom of the Jews because he's sticking up for a corrupt Gentile. We respect Goodwin and admire his reluctance to hurt Van Doren but we too wonder whether he's handling the case with the proper objectivity.The movie has some interesting subtexts dealing with the antiSemitism coming from Jewish producers themselves. In one scene producers Dan Enright and Albert Freedman basically explain to Van Doren in so many words that Stemple is too Jewish for the show. This is a phenomenon I've rarely seen dealt with in the movies possibly because there aren't too many films depicting the history of television.The film is often criticized for departing significantly from the facts of the case. For example the real Goodwin actually played a minimal role in exposing the scandal. I can understand why those involved in the case may have resented these inaccuracies. But filmmakers do have dramatic license. Probably this film should have changed the names of the characters from their reallife counterparts to reinforce the fact that it's not an exact account of what happened. The purpose of movies isn't to duplicate real life but to reflect on real life to gain fresh insight and Quiz Show achieves that purpose with dignity and style.".

	onyx:emotionText "Quiz Show is the type of movie that invites viewers to ask themselves how they would act under similar circumstances. If you were a contestant on a TV game show and the producers offered you a load of money to do a fixed show where you're given the answers in advance would you do it? Or would you turn your back on the producers and walk away? In this film Charles Van Doren does not walk away but he does hesitate. As played by Ralph Fiennes he's a bright likable fellow who seems like a good man despite his willing participation in a fraud.The film is smartly written tightly plotted and populated by interesting characters. It is also entertaining. It unfolds like a great detective story except that no murder has taken place. There isn't even any crime.

When I saw the rating I was very impressed not to mention how this was nominated for best picture of '94 considering it was up against Forrest Gump Pulp Fiction and Shawshank Redemption it didn't really stand a chance. But I rented this movie and I'm convinced that 1994 had to be one of the best years for films. Quiz Show is an incredibly impressive film by Robert Redford which I didn't even realize that this guy could direct! The story is just a perfect one for any type of a debate conversation on what is right and what is wrong.21 is a popular TV quiz show in the 50's where they ask very hard questions and the guests win lots of money Herb Stempel has been the reigning champion for weeks. But he's not exactly what you would call the TV hunk he's got the radio face. Charles Van Doren is a huge fan of quiz shows so he auditions and when the executives see him they go crazy over him he's handsome he's smart he's charismatic and his family is famous. They tell Herb to dive down and get a wrong answer so that Charles can take over as the champion. Everything seems to go smoothly that is until Harvard grad government agent Dick Goodwin is convinced that there's something wrong. He is determined to prove that the show is rigged and that 21 is ripping of America's intellects.Quiz Show is a great film the acting the picture the editing everything about this film is pretty much flawless. I couldn't believe that this film is not anywhere near the top 250 I don't see any problems with the film. But I know every film has a hater or two. But for me the film acting wise the film went to Ralph Fiennes he did an incredible performance and was so touching during his statement to the jury. I just would highly recommend this film to anyone this is a great film and Robert Redford did a terrific job.1010".

The principal actors give phenomenal performances  Fiennes' Van Doren is usually unflappable and cold but manages to allow vulnerability to surface at times and Turturro's Stempel is a study in almost sociopathic and manic behavior.  What allows both actors to transcend mere greatness is their ability to make the viewer both admire and detest their characters with something as subtle as a glance or body language.  Morrow's character of the whistleblower' is there as the moral fiber the outsider who looks upon the situation both with objectivity and as the devil's advocate. Redford's direction is rich and wellpaced.  There were not any slow moments in the film and he did not have to adhere to rapidfire editing to achieve the momentum of the film.  Perhaps the subject matter is a factor but I have found that with the exception of Ordinary People' the films I have seen under Redford's direction have been good in a technical respect but lean toward the maudlin.  With Quiz Show he does what should be done when telling a true story  he does not resort to preaching rather he directs with an objectivity that allows the viewer to come to their own conclusions. Quiz Show is an excellent film that I highly recommend especially to see the razorsharp performances of Fiennes and Turturro. Shelly".

Unfortunately the end of TV innocence in the '50s brought us other game shows in recent years and real life survivor series that are guilty of shortcomings just as egregious in other ways but not to be discussed here. Manners and morals began a fast decline in the late '50s and only got worse with each decade in my opinion.The reallife story of Professor Charles Van Doren Ralph Fiennes son of a famous scholar Mark Van Doren Paul Scofield is told in a lively and detailed way with many sights and sounds of the '50s making the atmosphere look very authentic. When the less than charming winner of a TV show Herb Stempel John Turturro is dumped in favor of the more charismatic Charles Van Doren the story goes swiftly through a series of expertly written scenes in which all of the behindthescenes goings on are revealed and characterizations are sharply defined. In truth the ratings game between Van Doren and Herb Stempel went on for many weeks before a showdown was reached.An especially touching scene shows Charles wanting to reveal to his father the truth about his upcoming appearance before an investigative committeerelaxing as the two have an informal midnight snack in the kitchen but unable to tell his father played to perfection by Paul Scofield who is a symbol of unwavering integrity. In fact Scofield is so good in his supporting role that it's a pity the script didn't expand his role to give him more screen time.John Turturro as Herb Stempel has the unfortunate task of appearing to be an obnoxious nerd whose only redeeming moment comes at the end of the film when he realizes how destroyed Charles Van Doren is by the revelations. He never tries to make the character anything less than the boorish selfabsorbed fool he is and does an excellent job. Rob Morrow is sometimes less than convincing as the tenacious investigator.Despite its lengthy running time it all moves along at a brisk pace under Robert Redford's outstanding direction. Well worth your time although I can't say television has raised the bar very much since its fall from grace especially with regard to daytime talk or game shows. Are audiences any wiser today?

	schema:headline " An Interesting Study Of TV Corruption But Strangely Lacking In Intensity";
	schema:reviewBody "In the late 1950's the TV game show TwentyOne was rigged. Popular contestants who could grab ratings were fed the questions and answers and those who the network wanted off were told to take dives all for the sake of keeping ratings up and selling Geritol. Quiz Show is the story of the scandal and of the potential danger of the power of television. The movie focuses around two contestants in particular Herbert Stempel John Turturro the reigning champ at the start of the movie who the network decides it wants to dump in favour of someone more glamorous who can pull in higher ratings Charles Van Doran Ralph Fiennes a college literature professor. Stempel feels cheated of the glory that he feels was his due while Van Doran is tormented by his desire to tell the truth but also to cover up his involvement in the scandal.This is an interesting film that gives a fascinating look at the inside workings of the TV game show of that era. And it does paint a fascinating moral dilemma. As Dan Enright David Paymer  TwentyOne's producer  says to the Congressional committee that investigates the scandal this was after all just a TV show by definition a piece of entertainment. The sponsor sold its product the network got ratings the contestants made money and the public got entertained. Where was the victim? And yet it WAS dishonest. It's a fascinating issue this whole concept of a victimless crime. And the ultimate irony was summed up by Dick Goodwin Rob Morrow the head Congressional investigator the Committee got Van Doran but what he wanted was to get television. In the end as he says television will probably end up getting them.All in all this was an interesting movie although  strangely for a true story  I felt it lacked any sustained dramatic intensity. Remembering Jack Barry from the 1970's as host of the game show The Joker's Wild he was also the host of TwentyOne I was very impressed by Christopher McDonald's portrayal of him. Although the role wasn't really that central to the movie McDonald had Barry down pat and I felt as if it really were Jack Barry I was watching.All in all this is a very good movie. I wouldn't run out and buy it but it's certainly worth a rental.710".

	onyx:emotionText "In the late 1950's the TV game show TwentyOne was rigged. Popular contestants who could grab ratings were fed the questions and answers and those who the network wanted off were told to take dives all for the sake of keeping ratings up and selling Geritol. Quiz Show is the story of the scandal and of the potential danger of the power of television. The movie focuses around two contestants in particular Herbert Stempel John Turturro the reigning champ at the start of the movie who the network decides it wants to dump in favour of someone more glamorous who can pull in higher ratings Charles Van Doran Ralph Fiennes a college literature professor. Stempel feels cheated of the glory that he feels was his due while Van Doran is tormented by his desire to tell the truth but also to cover up his involvement in the scandal.This is an interesting film that gives a fascinating look at the inside workings of the TV game show of that era.

When WASP Charles Van Doren comes to audition for another show they offer to ask him the questions that he already answered at the practice.  Herbie is told to take a dive and Van Doren becomes an audience draw.  However when Herbie starts making noise about a fix a congress employee Dick Goodwin decides to go after the network.This is a glossy professional piece of work that sadly was never as huge as hit as it deserved to be probably not enough explosions for the US audience.  The story is based on a true story that happened in the 50's and it's used here partly as a bit of history but also as a look at television in terms of it's most basic desire to sell and entertain at any costs  if that means fixing shows or getting the right' ethnic groups on screen then s be it.  It is effective on that level because it's hard to imagine anything has changed since 1950.  The actual human drama comes between Van Doren and Stempel  the film makes them both real people neither good nor bad but having a bit of both.Turturro is the best thing in this film.  His Herbie has so many levels which he must touch throughout and he does them all well  whether it's humour pride anger or realisation.  Fiennes is good but at times I did find it hard to be sympathetic with a WASP born into a lofty family who gets more given to him.  That said Fiennes did him well.  Morrow was a strange choice  famous at the time for Northern Exposure he does a weird performance here  almost doing an impression of what he thinks a tough Noo Yark investigator would be like.  The supporting cast is filled out with quality so deep that even the extras are famous now! Calista Flockhart turns up briefly.  David Palmer and Hank Azaria are good as 21's producers Christopher Mcdonald is good as the host  people like Griffin Dunne Mira Sorvino Timothy Busefield and Barry Levinson come and go and Martin Scorsese has a wicked role as the money behind the scandal.It works on many levels  at it's most basic it is a true story of great interest at best it lets you see how television works and how men with money can rarely be reached for any wrong doing.

	schema:reviewBody "That TVstations always have played a dubious role in the selection of their candidates isn't anything new. Only a couple of years ago there was a game show over here where some people weren't allowed because they weren't 'fit for the screen' a nice euphemism for saying that they were just too ugly. So that I saw this in this movie didn't surprise me. But giving the questions and answers to the contestants that was really something new. But apparently it really happened because this movie was based on actual events.In the late 1950's an idealistic young lawyer who works for a Congressional subcommittee discovers that game shows aren't always played honestly. He focuses on two contestants on the show 21 and finds evidence for the fact that NBC and the sponsor have been screwing with the system. He interrogates Herbert Stempel an ordinary workingclass Jew from Queens and Charles Van Doren a member of one of America's leading literary families although he doesn't want to blame them for what has happened. He wants to nail the TVstation but when the official hearings are held the big guns escape and the true victims are the two contestants...If you only want one reason why you shouldn't miss this movie than I would definitely say that you should watch it for the acting. John Turturro is excellent as the Jewish seemingly media crazy Stempel. But Ralph Fiennes as Charles Van Doren Rob Morrow as the lawyer... all did a fine job as well. In fact I find it very hard to say which actor did the best job because I liked them all. Of course they would never have been able to give away such a performance if there hadn't been a wellwritten and very interesting script thanks to Paul Attanasio.Normally I don't say too much about the writer but this time I will make an exception to my own rule. The reason for that is because Paul Attanasio isn't just an ordinary screenwriter. He is also a movie critic and many of the critics always say that they know so much better what a script should look like but this man actually proves it by writing a very good one himself. But a good script isn't of course all the work. Without the good direction of Robert Redford this wouldn't have worked either.All in all this is a very good movie that deserves to be seen for many different reasons. Some very good acting a nice script good direction... this movie has it all. The only problem that I had with it was that it was a bit of a slow starter. But don't let that be a reason not to watch it. It's a very fine movie and that's why I give it a score of at least 7.510.".

Only a couple of years ago there was a game show over here where some people weren't allowed because they weren't 'fit for the screen' a nice euphemism for saying that they were just too ugly. So that I saw this in this movie didn't surprise me. But giving the questions and answers to the contestants that was really something new. But apparently it really happened because this movie was based on actual events.In the late 1950's an idealistic young lawyer who works for a Congressional subcommittee discovers that game shows aren't always played honestly. He focuses on two contestants on the show 21 and finds evidence for the fact that NBC and the sponsor have been screwing with the system.

	schema:reviewBody "Why do networks take a decent movie like this and lop off parts to fit it into a Procrustean bed? So they can include more commercials and make money. Why do contestants cheat on TV quiz shows? Well yes to make money too  but more than that. They want adulation as well as new Caddies. At least Herb Stempel and Charles van Doren do  brothers under two highly unsimilarlooking skins. This movie at any rate was chopped up by WGN and a shame too. I thought networks had gotten pretty much out of the habit. What was lopped off consisted of small but highly revealing character touches as is usually the case. What's missing from the print here at least what came to my notice are two relatively short scenes whose importance as revealers of character I leave to you to judge. 1 Van Doren has been on the show and become a celebrity and has gotten used to being surrounded by envious and gushing young idolators. He arrives a bit early before one of the campus buildings discharges its horde of students. And instead of alighting immediately from the cab he pauses leans down and begins fiddling with his shoelace  until the building opens and disgorges its young people and then he gets out and is quickly engulfed as a bit of nutrient might be engulfed by a brainless amoeba. 2 Dick Goodwin visits the van Dorens and their guests Bunny Wilson etc.at their Connecticut home where everyone sits around the picnic table playing a kind of Shakespeare trivia contest. Dad starts a quote and challenges Charles to finish it and identify its source that sort of thing. The erudite byplay of all concerned is enough to convince Goodwin that nobody from a community like this could be guilty of cheating on a stupid quiz show. The film rolls along with a lot of dash. Redford has a real facility in the use and placement of the camera. After several important exchanges he tends to linger on the face of one of the speakers usually the one who has just learned something and whose mouth is left slightly open. The score is mostly of contemporary songs and intrudes a bit seems loud. Charles van Doren may have envied and perhaps resented his father's fame the movie hints that it was his desire to become as wellknown as Mark that prompted him to cheat but he's lucky to have had the father he did. Otherwise master's in astrophysics and doctorate in literature or no it's unlikely he would have been teaching at Columbia even as an Instructor. Talk about unfair advantage! What is the movie's point of view? It's not completely spelled out but it seems to be that it was okay for a nobody like Herb Stempel to cheat but not for someone with Charles van Doren's status. There's a certain reasonableness about this judgment. It's one thing for schmucks like you and me to steal towels from a fancy motel like the Tiki Waterbed Palace in Kansas City but it means something entirely different if a celebrity does it. It's not part of our job descriptions to be models of rectitude whereas we feel that famous professors and politicians ought to be. It seems an especially apt observation since in the case of quiz shows nobody gets hurt or deprived of anything. It's not a zero sum game. Under different circumstances though that's exactly what it is and that's when cheating becomes not simply unethical but criminal. An armed robber is depriving another of something of value. Yet our attitudes towards cheating must be very mixed indeed to judge from the users' comments under The Cheaters. If you cheat in an academic decathlon you're depriving someone else of something of value although it isn't a material good but rather a reward whose value is symbolic. At the end of this story no one has profited. Stempel the loudmouth who has been gunning for the blond Aryan finally brings him down only to discover that he feels not satisfaction but pity for the poor guy. Goodwin who was after television has torpedoed a comrade instead. The public loses its innocence. One or two network small fry are barbecued. And van Doren of course is ruined. The only winner is television itself which will go on to bigger and better things like World's Wildest Police Videos. Why bother watching someone on TV exercise their brains when you can watch people smash up their cars on a freeway? It's difficult to believe that there was actually a time in our history when people would crowd around their TV sets and watch a contestant struggle to answer a question about the King of Belgium. Maybe Ray Bradbury put it best The television that insidious beast that Medusa which freezes a billion people to stone every night staring fixedly that Siren which called and sang and promised so much and gave after all so little. Gimme Survivor any day and pass the sugar frosted flakes.".

Those of you who are a little younger will think Quiz Show is a very fascinating and creative film. But to my fellow young'uns let me tell you this it's a true story.This piece of social commentary that's sometimes hard to watch but has fantastic acting well framed shots and great scene transitions is directed by none other than Robert Redford the master of all elements mentioned. Quiz Show really is an important movie even though it's the posterchild for the people are mean mentality. It was nominated for Best Picture Director and Supporting Actor at the Oscars but John Turturro's and Ralph Fiennes's performances went unrecognized. But it was released in 1994 the same year as Forrest Gump and The Shawshank Redemption so it didn't really stand a chance during awards season.In the film Christopher McDonald is the host of the incredibly popular television quiz show 21. David Paymer and Hank Azaria are the show's producers. Martin Scorsese is an executive to the show's product sponsor. Everyone has a stake in the ratings so when successful contestant John Turturro wanes in audience popularity the network asks him to take a dive. Will he do it? Will he tell the truth that the show is being riggedand more importantly will anyone listen? While I kept asking myself Why wasn't this Timothy Hutton? every time Rob Morrow was on the screen the other leads gave excellent performances most of them more likable in this movie than in any of their other movies I'd seen. I was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time and each time a new character's plight was introduced my heart completely transferred its sympathy to him a testament to Paul Attanasio's fastpaced and welldefined script. Every character was made to be both likable and unlikable this is the type of movie that will make you talk about it afterwards.".

	schema:headline " The Movie in a Little Historical Context";
	schema:reviewBody "Wow I sat glued to the screen for two hours without a break. That doesn't happen often but the movie was that good even with a onenote plot and no action or romance. Yes it did bring back 60year old memories sometimes fond sometimes not. First a few words on historical context.In the summer of 1955 Revlon cosmetics experimented with a big money quiz show not sure how it would work in prime network time. It was called the 64000 Question. Up to that point quiz shows whether radio or newfangled TV offered only small amounts of prize money. So this was an unimaginable amount to offer. Not surprisingly the show was an immediate hit earning a permanent place on the CBS network. Viewers were clearly enthralled especially when a delicate little Dr. Joyce Brothers showed off her expert knowledge of Boxing of all things. Thus it was possible for contestants to win not only big money but become minor celebrities in the process that is if they caught the public's fancy.Of course network programming being a commercial enterprise imitators soon followed the most successful I think being TwentyOne. Unlike 64000 it had the distinction of two contestants competing against one another from inside the famous isolation booths. There viewers could watch them sweat as they pondered their answers. The format was also a comeon since most everyone had played the simple card game of being the first to reach 21 in point count. I think this format had the most builtin drama of any other TV quiz show which by 1956 were at least several.The movie of course exposes the biggest scandal in quiz show history which occurred in 195657 on TwentyOne. I was in high school at the time and never missed these shows. I think it's fair to say that practically all viewers believed the shows were honestI know my family did. And that's even when quizwhiz Herb Stemple missed probably the easiest question asked him namely who won Best Picture Oscar from just 2years earlier. We all shouted Marty at the screen while he appeared terminally stumped and we felt suddenly superior to this knowitall. Likely more discerning viewers suspected something fishy from that point on. But remember this was the 1950's when coming off a triumphal big war most everyone still believed unquestioningly in authority. My friends and family certainly did. So when the rigged nature of TwentyOne was exposed in 1959 the public was generally shocked especially as fairhaired boy Charles Van Doren was implicated. In fact the big money quiz format was so discredited it didn't revive for many decades.The movie itself amounts to a narrative triumph. Skillfully scripted acted and produced. The contrast between the nerdylooking Stemple and the aristocratic Van Doren is striking. So in retrospect it's not surprising that producers Barry and Enright would see real ratings potential in a goodlooking guy with a wellknown family name. Fiennes's smirking Van Doren comes across as a rather slimy character once he's been compromised. Still that scene of him amid the outdoor intellectual gathering is one a commoner like me can only imagine. As a result I can understand how he could be seduced into establishing a reputation separate from his illustrious father Scofield. Then there's the bluecollar Stemple harrumphing around his coldwater flat having trusted the producers to come through for him after he took the humiliating dive. At times he's almost a comedic figure in his thrashing about.I guess my only reservation is with Morrow's casting as the bulldog investigator Jim Goodwin. To me he doesn't project the kind of force necessary for untangling the shenanigans or tangling with stone walling network bigshots. But then maybe he's intended to be a Peter Falk type Columbo with his disheveled appearance and mild manner. Be that as it may the network honcho's are well cast and appropriately slippery as they seduce Stemple and Van Doren with prize money and promises of network jobs. Viewers can almost see their numberscrunching brains in action. Tellingly no woman is featured in the two hour runtime and as an odd moment of curiosity there's no indication whether Van Doren's successor Vivian Nearing was fed her answers or not.Anyway the movie's fascinating in what it shows about the corruptive potency of TV ratings and commercial sponsors a risky marriage that nevertheless endures. Thanks Robert Redford for reviving this sorry episode for generations later than mine.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a classy intelligent and hugely entertaining drama about a seemingly forgotten part of television history. It's one of the smartest and most sophisticated films I've ever seen about the meaning of truth in a socially practical sense.Redford tells the true story about a fixed quiz show very thoughtfully. He passionately sympathizes with the side of truth but he's also smart enough to not get out of his role as an observer either. He trusts the viewers to meditate about the subject themselves and to each individually draw conclusions about how meaningful and valuable truth really is in our current system.I've always been interested and fascinated about the illusion of truth and the practical side of lying. Everyone knows that being truthful and honest is the right thing to do as a human being but paradoxically it also seems that in our practical society making your own truths can make you much more successful. It goes even further. When you're able to keep up a specific strong illusion of truth you can even fabricate a situation where everyone involved seems to get an advantage out of it! It's only when the bubble actually bursts that most people start to realize that they prefer the truth over fabrications even though it's sometimes hard to rationally explain why.I guess people are so angry when they are confronted with other people's lies because lies can also produce very terrible consequences. It's impossible to truly draw a fine line between when it is acceptable and when it is not. A society would implode if there wasn't any certainty of truth anymore because there would be no trust. A whole society can lose its credibility just as much as one individual can.You yourself can choose what kind of person you want to be. 1 You can be one of the many people who tries to make a profit from that inevitable immoral loophole in our society. The immorality of lying can be compensated by the generally good personal consequences those lies might carry with them.2 You can be a person who believes in the values of honesty and trust and who believes that those values are an inherent part of the moral foundations of a free society. Bending the truth to gain profits can have horrible sometimes unforeseeable side effects even if it's only in the long term.The most valuable thing this film may actually show is that it is especially important to be aware of what both sides of the argument imply and ultimately may have in store. It's a very interesting film overall. It's well acted the cast is fantastic it's very solidly directed I wonder if Redford got any tips from Scorsese who played a small role in the film and it has a very strong script about themes that will always be endlessly fascinating to me. Quiz Show managed to keep me entertained both dramatically and intellectually. I'm very much impressed and I strongly recommend seeing this film!".

Rather it's just a very lighthearted mostly enjoyable film that happens to be about vampires although it's primarily interesting for a one of the earliest prefame appearances of Jim Carrey and for nostalgia as Once Bitten is firmly mired in mid1980s pop culture.The biggest flaw is that the mythology behind the film is not very well explained or followed. The Countess finds Mark Kendall Carrey fairly easily but we're not shown her and her clan looking very hard until just before Halloweenthey had all year. We're never told if the clan has to follow the same rules. It doesn't seem so in the end but why not? It's never very clear why The Countess can't just go after say an eleven year old. When things are getting down to the wire near the climax of the film there are other virgins around but The Countess just ignores them as potential drinking fountains of youth. It seems like maybe she has to bite the same person rather than three potentially different people three times but that's never directly stated. How long does it have to be between bites? Why couldn't she just bite the one person twice then bite someone else three times within a few hours? Although I don't usually like to try to apply real world logic to films in this case I couldn't help it. Once Bitten isn't meant solely as a comedy and there is a long sequence during the climax that should be as suspenseful as it is humorous. But the suspense was gone because all I could think of where the questions above instead. To make it worse the timeline of the film gets a bit muddled and we lose any sense of when Halloween night is actually occurring. At one point during a Halloween dance that seems like that should be Halloween night but then it seems like Halloween should be over already at a later point. At that later point it seems like the dance must have been on a different earlier day. That this crucial fact for suspense in the film isn't clear is a problem. Once Bitten suffers from sloppy scriptwriting and sloppy direction from Howard Storm whose resume shows that he's much more comfortable with halfhour television sitcoms.But if one can overlook some of those flaws Once Bitten is worth at least one viewing. Carrey's performance is good. He easily shows why he became a star in later films. His transformation over the course of the film is great and a scene with Carrey in full vampire makeup and clothing makes one long to see a serious vampire film with him as a star. I also liked the ice cream truck and took it as a nod to Phantasm 1979. There are enough comic moments that most viewers will at least be occasionally smiling if not laughing out loud. A scene where Mark's friends are trying to check him for evidence of vampirism is a standout as is much of the material where Mark and his friends interact. Carrey's scenes with his parents are even better but there are too few of them. Both Hutton and Karen Kopins as Mark's girlfriend Robin are sensuous. The Countess' vampire clan is severely underused but they are okay when they do appear. And even the obligatory mid80s music videodance scene is mostly tolerable.I also enjoyed the subtext that sex is a means of protection from evil rather than something dangerous to be avoided. Robin's attitude about Mark's relationships was also a nice change of pace.This is definitely a film that needs to be approached with lowered expectations but in the right mood you just might enjoy it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Strangely enough I read a review of one IMDb user who asserted that Once Bitten is one of Jim Carrey's best performances since going mainstream. I'm curious as to what this user means by that statement because Once Bitten was YEARS before Carrey went mainstream. Is this person saying that Carrey's performance here is better than his performances years later when he did in fact get into mainstream films? If so I beg to differ. And if not I still beg to differ.The first thing that struck me about Once Bitten is that it is a teen sex comedy which is not something that I ever associated with Jim Carrey not the least reason for which is because most of his better know movies are not only above such childish comedy but were made long after his teenage years were over. Even in Once Bitten he was about 23 years old but the movie focuses on his inability to communicate very effectively with women much less pull off any successful sexual encounters. Enter a vampire surprisingly sexy for her 400 years who must feed on three virgins or cease to exist. All desperate high school guy in the 80s should have been so lucky.The premise is ridiculous comparable to those bad movies that feature things like strippers that turn into aliens or other monsters that feed on humans by taking on the form of sexy naked women in order to seduce men. Where the movie goes right is in the two main characters Lauren Hutton as the vampiress trying to feed on Mark Kendall to whom Jim Carrey brings a surprisingly effective level of insecurity and awkward appeal. Carrey obviously remembers similar developmental difficulties in his own youth.Mark's two friends the obligatory sexstarved geeks who bounce crude humor off of each other are negligible put into the movie for no other reason than for some vampire snacks and to have someone for Mark to complain to about his nervousness about sex while they confidently give him all kinds of advice momentarily forgetting that they share in at least his same level of cluelessness on the subject.While earlier and dumber sex comedies like Porky's made no attempt to be more than they are dumb sex comedies Once Bitten successfully tries to present a sort of lesson about the dangers of promiscuity while at the same time failing ultimately because it tries to be too much than its material allows. Rather than seeking the old jugular this vampiress prefers to drink from a more southerly location providing a pretty hamhanded allegory of sexually transmitted diseases. Carrey has been prowling dingy bars in search of an easy first time in response to his lack of success with an unpromiscuous girlfriend and ends up placing in grave danger the very parts that he is trying to get some much needed attention.There is a sad story behind the writing of the screenplay. David Hines a college student desperately avoiding real life took endless art classes to postpone graduation and ultimately dropped out when it seemed that his screenplay for Once Bitten at the time titled Nightlife seemed to be taking off. The movie was put into production produced released and then six months later sat on the shelves at Sam Goody where Hines worked as a lowly entry level employee constantly teased by his coworkers over the spectacular failure of his movie. I really can't say that I found it to be THAT bad but again this could be just because I'm a huge fan of Jim Carrey. Maybe the movie was just overshadowed by Fright Night also not great but better than Once Bitten released the same year and The Lost Boys vastly superior to both released two years later. Either way Once Bitten is hardly an underrated gem.The film itself is pretty dismal but it remains interesting even if for no other reason than because you can so clearly see the budding elements of what would later become Jim Carrey trademarks. Not just his overthetop comedy performances but also even slight hints at his more dramatic roles like when he goes to the Halloween party and is exasperated that he keeps having to explain that he's not dressed as a vampire he's not even wearing a costume. It's a cheesy teen sex comedy but Carrey makes it interesting at least some parts. It's just too bad that he had to develop more of a career before people cared.".

It's not the kind of movie that makes you want to turn off the TV  but it's pretty forgettable.Still. It does have the dance scene and there is a certain 80's nostalgia factor.

	schema:reviewBody "Exploiting the typical male teen's desperate attempt to lose his virginity 'Once Bitten' is a light comedy from the teen horror comedy catalog of the 1980s though not as funny as say 'My Best Friend is a Vampire' nor as satirical as 'My Boyfriend's Back' a 90s comedy. In part the comedy is never too adventurous with comedic quips and instead carries with it for some parts in the movie a rather unnecessarily serious mood.Lauren Hutton plays the sleek voluptuous Countess a vampire desperate for virgin blood in order to sustain her youth.

Teenage high school student Mark Kendall Jim Carrey is becoming frustrated with his girlfriend Robin Karen Kopins who refuses to have sexual relations with him while everyone else around him seems to be at it like rabbits poor old Mark remains a virgin. With this in mind Mark  two of his friends Russ Skip Lackey  Jamie Thomas Ballatore decide to visit a seedy bar to try  pick up girls Mark catches the attention of the Countess who takes him back to her place where she drinks his blood. Mark suddenly starts to develop strange characteristics he wears sunglasses sleeps during the day in a box has a taste for raw meat  begins to dress in black. The Countess needs to drink Marks blood two more times but she finds it difficult as Robin notices the changes in Mark  sets out to protect him before he to is turned into a Vampire for good...Directed by Howard Storm Once Bitten didn't really work for me. The script by David Hines Jeffrey Hause  Jonathan Roberts tries to be a gentle horror comedy but in my opinion it falls pretty short on both counts. For a start the humour just isn't funny the gay servant to the Countess who is as camp as he is embarrassing to watch a scene when Mark accidentally drinks a glass of blood or a fancy dress party sequence when everyone keeps telling him he has a great Vampire outfit on to which he keeps saying he isn't wearing a costume the character's aren't funny the dialogue isn't funny the situations aren't funny  the story itself isn't funny which is a very bad thing when Once Bitten is far more comedy driven than horror. There is only one even half way funny scene it's when Marks two friends try to check his thigh for a Vampire bite in the school showers  everyone thinks they're all gay yes that's really as funny as it gets folks. So the comedy side of things fails miserably what about the horror? Well don't expect the film to improve in this aspect either as there's a bit of blood drinking  Mark is chased through the Countesses house at the end by lots of Vampires but there's no blood or gore in it at all. Having said that I thought it told a reasonably decent story it moved along at a fair pace  was sort of watchable in a silly innocent kind of way.Director Storm doesn't do much to liven things up Once Bitten isn't much to look at to be honest  it has no real style or visual flair. The film is neither funny nor scary so Storm fails in everything he set the film out to be. Forget about any blood or gore as there isn't any.With a supposed budget of about 3200000 Once Bitten is competent  it's well made that's about the best thing I can say about it. I must admit the production design was quite nice especially the Countesses mansion which looked rather tasty  stylish I wouldn't mind living there myself. Once Bitten was the first major role for Carrey he does OK but you wouldn't have guessed from this that he would go on to become one of Hollywood's biggest earners. Hutton didn't do much for me as the Vampire I just didn't think she was good looking enough  Cleavon Little as Sebastian her servant was awful.Once Bitten may hold a certain curiosity value for being Jim Carrey's first film but that's no real reason to watch it. I found it all very flat unfunny  uninspired. Fails in to many departments for me watch only if desperate.".

I saw that it had  Jim Carrey in it one of my favorite actors and I thought it was very interesting seeing Mr. Carrey as this young man. I liked the random jokes and hilarious scenes that make this movie a hit in my book from Mr. Carrey from the 80's. I enjoyed the plot and it really seemed to interest me a lot because I am a teenager myself. It has the basic teenage sex drama that many people can relate to in real life. Sure they do not have Countess Vampires seducing them or anything but just the way they arranged this old favorite plot of Sexy Bad Girl vs. Cute Sweet girl will just attract any young viewer. Great movie that makes me want to live in the 80's!".

Before he runs into the delectable Countess at a speed dial dating bar in Hollywood Mark struggles to get his high school sweetheart Robin Pearce Karen Kopins of Creator to spread them and grin. She is deeply in love with her boyfriend Mark and prefers their dual deflowering to be a special occasion.

Meantime Mark and his two pals Jamie Thomas Ballatore of Detenator and Russ Skip Lackey of Mindbenders hang tight with him as he tries to get his ashes hauled. Eventually our heroine visits an old book store and learns female vampires like to sink their fangs in the spot closest to the genitalia. Robin ask Jamie and Russ to see if Mark has bite marks on his upper thigh. The guys try to do this in the gym shower and botch things so badly that somebody yells Fags in the shower and everybody panics. The nude scenes are as chaste as you can imagine. Nothing reproductive is shown except for the bottom curves of buttocks. Our heroine Robin uses the Fword once. After Robin begins to take Mark seriously she decides to end the affair that Mark is having against his will with the Countess by having sex with him.

Reveling on the alluring number 3 and hellbent on going all the way for a home run it stars the holy trinity of Carrey Hutton and Little in humorous and lovable roles. The story revolves around the vampire Countess Hutton and her need for a blood transfusion from a virgin. No bite in the neck but further down is required. She's guided and aided by the brilliant Sebastian Little with a certain feminine twist that makes for many laughs. Juxtaposed to this duo of very light darkness we find a trio of restless youngsters and the protagonist of the movie  Mark Carrey who is trying so hard to get to fourth base with his girlfriend but not getting anywhere. He tries to metaphorically go to third base at a drivein movie when the gear stick gets in the way of the couple and he says Here let me put it in third.... That's all he manages to do tho and they sit and watch the movie while all the other cars around start to bounce one after the other. Frustrated and let down he is talked into going to town to get...sorry... 'meet' girls with his two comic relief friends and soon enough he meets the countess and she lures him into her Hollywood mansion to get the first of three blood transfusions in order to retain her good looks. From there on strange and humorous things start to happen to the main character. It's a definitive 80's movie for sure. It's lighthearted and fun and if you expect some serious vampire business and action you will be sorely let down but if you're expecting comedy teen desires Carrey and light entertainment you will have a very enjoyable hour and a half of pure 80's nostalgia with a twist and you won't regret seeing it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mel Brooks' parodies are like your favorite wornout couch.  You know it's not the greatest in style taste and quality but it just feels so damn comfortable.  Of late most of Mel's spoofs have been off the mark his work mellowing into predictability.  In fact you really have to go all the way back to 1974 to see Brooks at his sharpest.  In that year we were awarded Blazing Saddles AND Young Frankenstein.Perhaps Young Frankenstein is not definitive Mel Brooks although he directed it.  Gene Wilder who not only stars but cowrote it with Mel was the inspiration to make this movie.  And it's his influence I think that brings the best out in Mel.  When spoofing a historical era movie genre or legendary tale Brooks' satirical bag of tricks always included a hodgepodge of crude sight gags burlesque schtick and stale Jewish jokes done at rapidfire pace.  The plot became an afterthought working around the barrage of unsubtle humor.  In targeting the classic Frankenstein' series however Brooks worked in reverse wisely focusing on plot tone and atmosphere then complementing them with clever carefully constructed bits.A rich staple of comedy pros from Brooks' fun factory Mel graciously did not cast himself here were employed to wring out the most laughs possible out of the fresh inventive material.  Gene Wilder plays the frizzyhaired eruptive college professor Frederick Frankenstein pronounced FRONKenSTEEN grandson of the infamous scientist who gives in to the maniacal tendencies of his mad ancestor after inheriting the late Baron's Teutonic castle.  His simmertoboil antics have seldom been put to better use while only popeyed Marty Feldman who gets to break the fourth wall as Igor prounouced EYEgor the dim oddball assistant could milk a hump for all its worth.  Kenneth Mars too gets a lot of mileage out of his onearmed slushmouthed inspector.  In the film's most difficult role Peter Boyle's appearance as the Monster is jarring at first looking like a cross between Herman Munster and Uncle Fester.  But he increasingly wins you over earning even a little empathy along the way.  His character is the most crucial for this parody to work right and he succeeds figuring in a high percentage of the comedy highlights.Representing the distaff side Madeline Kahn is one cool cucumber stealing focus whenever she's on camera as the placid meticulous hopelessly stuckup fiancee Elizabeth Cloris Leachman sinks her teeth into the role of the grotesque Frau Blcher whose mere mention of her name sends horses into panic and Teri Garr is delightful as a dinghy Deutschlander who assists Frankenstein in his wild experiments and other things.An amalgamation of Universal's earliest and best Frankenstein' movies Frankenstein Bride of Frankenstein and Son of Frankenstein this spoof relies on close imitation and Brooks took painstaking methods to recreate the look and feel of James Whale's original sets blackandwhite photography and musical score.  It pays off in spades.Nearly 30 years later this movie still leaves me in stitches.  Wilder and Garr's revolving secret door bit is still priceless as is Cloris Leachman's ovaltine' routine and the WilderBoyle Puttin' On the Ritz tieandtail duet.  Boyle and the unbilled Gene Hackman in the Blind Hermit scene ripped off from Bride of Frankenstein are uproarious easily winning the award for sustained hilarity in a single sketch.  Add Feldman's hump and Mars' troublesome mechanical arm and what you have is ribtickling entertainment from start to finish.  Madeline Kahn's postcoital cigarettesmoking scene with ol zipperneck' who leaves her in a sexual snit must go down in Hollywood annals as the funniest scene ever caught on camera.  Certainly Jeanette MacDonald's puristic rendition of Ah Sweet Mystery of Life will never have quite the same meaning again after you've heard Madeline's spin on it. Blazing Saddles indeed has its insane moments but when it comes to toasting Mel Brooks in the years to come Young Frankenstein should certainly stand front and center when representing this clown prince of comedy.".

His character is the most crucial for this parody to work right and he succeeds figuring in a high percentage of the comedy highlights.Representing the distaff side Madeline Kahn is one cool cucumber stealing focus whenever she's on camera as the placid meticulous hopelessly stuckup fiancee Elizabeth Cloris Leachman sinks her teeth into the role of the grotesque Frau Blcher whose mere mention of her name sends horses into panic and Teri Garr is delightful as a dinghy Deutschlander who assists Frankenstein in his wild experiments and other things.An amalgamation of Universal's earliest and best Frankenstein' movies Frankenstein Bride of Frankenstein and Son of Frankenstein this spoof relies on close imitation and Brooks took painstaking methods to recreate the look and feel of James Whale's original sets blackandwhite photography and musical score.  It pays off in spades.Nearly 30 years later this movie still leaves me in stitches.  Wilder and Garr's revolving secret door bit is still priceless as is Cloris Leachman's ovaltine' routine and the WilderBoyle Puttin' On the Ritz tieandtail duet.  Boyle and the unbilled Gene Hackman in the Blind Hermit scene ripped off from Bride of Frankenstein are uproarious easily winning the award for sustained hilarity in a single sketch.  Add Feldman's hump and Mars' troublesome mechanical arm and what you have is ribtickling entertainment from start to finish.  Madeline Kahn's postcoital cigarettesmoking scene with ol zipperneck' who leaves her in a sexual snit must go down in Hollywood annals as the funniest scene ever caught on camera.  Certainly Jeanette MacDonald's puristic rendition of Ah Sweet Mystery of Life will never have quite the same meaning again after you've heard Madeline's spin on it. Blazing Saddles indeed has its insane moments but when it comes to toasting Mel Brooks in the years to come Young Frankenstein should certainly stand front and center when representing this clown prince of comedy.";

	schema:reviewBody "Dr. Frankenstein's Gene Wilder has stated that this is his favorite of all the films he's made grandson after years of living down the family reputation inherits granddad's castle and repeats the experiments carried out many years ago . He says goodbye his pretty girlfriend Elizabeth Madeline Kahn and travels Transylvania . In the castle he finds a funny hunchback called Igor Marty Feldman a gorgeous lab assistant Teri Garr named Inga and the old housekeeper Frau Blucher Cloris Leachman . Later on  he successfully reanimates a body Peter Boyle which soon flees and creates wreak havoc . Hilarious Mel BrooksGene Wilder comedy filled with horror satire  amusing events  nice settings and lots of laughters . This spoof of the old Universal terror movies is fun from start to finish . The original cut of the movie was almost twice as long as the final cut and it was considered by all involved to be an abysmal failure  it was only after a marathon cutting session that they produced the final cut of the film which both Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks considered to be far superior to the original product  at one point they noted that for every joke that worked there were three that fell flat  so they went in and trimmed all the jokes that didn't work. Enjoyable support cast such as Madeline Kahn as Elizabeth  Cloris Leachman as Frau Blcher  Kenneth Mars as Inspector Kemp and brief acting by John Carradine  Leon Askin played a lawyer but was cut out  final film of Oscar Beregi Jr and of Richard Haydn  but most of his role was deleted from the final print . And uncredited Gene Hackman as the Blind Man in fact parting line I was gonna make espresso was not in the script but was adlibbed by the same Gene Hackman during shooting .

He says goodbye his pretty girlfriend Elizabeth Madeline Kahn and travels Transylvania . In the castle he finds a funny hunchback called Igor Marty Feldman a gorgeous lab assistant Teri Garr named Inga and the old housekeeper Frau Blucher Cloris Leachman . Later on  he successfully reanimates a body Peter Boyle which soon flees and creates wreak havoc . Hilarious Mel BrooksGene Wilder comedy filled with horror satire  amusing events  nice settings and lots of laughters . This spoof of the old Universal terror movies is fun from start to finish . The original cut of the movie was almost twice as long as the final cut and it was considered by all involved to be an abysmal failure  it was only after a marathon cutting session that they produced the final cut of the film which both Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks considered to be far superior to the original product  at one point they noted that for every joke that worked there were three that fell flat  so they went in and trimmed all the jokes that didn't work. Enjoyable support cast such as Madeline Kahn as Elizabeth  Cloris Leachman as Frau Blcher  Kenneth Mars as Inspector Kemp and brief acting by John Carradine  Leon Askin played a lawyer but was cut out  final film of Oscar Beregi Jr and of Richard Haydn  but most of his role was deleted from the final print . And uncredited Gene Hackman as the Blind Man in fact parting line I was gonna make espresso was not in the script but was adlibbed by the same Gene Hackman during shooting .

He inherits his demented grandfather's castle in Transylvania and becomes curious about his experiments to the point that he is enticed into repeating them.Lending great support is Marty Feldman as Frankenstein's incompetent hump backed assistant Igor pronounced EGOR Madeleine Kahn as Frankenstein's seemingly frigid fiance who comes visiting at the castle at an awkward time Terri Garr as Frankenstein's buxom assistant and Peter Boyle as the monster. Cloris Leachman almost steals the show as Frau Blucher Victor Frankenstein's girlfriend who dreams of her dead beloved's experiments coming to fruition and whose name seems to scare horses. It is full of sight gags slapstick one liners and an outrageous spoof of Puttin on the Ritz that should have brought an irate Irving Berlin author of the song rising from his grave were this an actual horror film. The only problem is Berlin was still alive when this film was made. I really can't tell you anymore or I'd ruin it for you.Gene Wilder cowrote this one with Mel Brooks and I just can't see anybody but Wilder with his manic style of comedy that matches his wild hair starring in this one. Filmed in black and white to imitate the style of the 30's Frankenstein movies  and it borrows from all of the first three  Frankenstein Bride of Frankenstein and Son of Frankenstein I do make one suggestion. It borrows so heavily from 1939's Son of Frankenstein that I suggest that if you have not seen that film that you watch it before this one. Otherwise you will find yourself breaking out into laughter in Son of Frankenstein where laughter was never intended. Highly recommended as one of the great comedies ever filmed.".

	schema:headline " AH SWEET Mystery Of Life At Last I Found YOU";
	schema:reviewBody "Mel Brooks set his comic genius to satirizing the horror film genre by taking one of the classic Universal horror characters the monster created by Baron Von Frankenstein. Young Frankenstein brings the saga of the monster saga into the first half of the 20th Century. After several generations of experimentation with the origin of life do you think that in Young Frankenstein the current scientist has finally got it right?Well to find out you'll have to see Young Frankenstein and Gene Wilder's take on the mad scientist the current 20th century version of that most misunderstood family of geniuses. Fascinating though that some of the same mistakes were made in bringing the monster played by Peter Boyle to life. Didn't they watch any of the old films?However when physical science fails psychology takes over as Wilder just thinks it might be a problem of soothing his fevered brain. The monster is also given a sex life in Young Frankenstein as Cloris Leachman finds certain attributes most attractive.

	onyx:emotionText "Mel Brooks set his comic genius to satirizing the horror film genre by taking one of the classic Universal horror characters the monster created by Baron Von Frankenstein. Young Frankenstein brings the saga of the monster saga into the first half of the 20th Century. After several generations of experimentation with the origin of life do you think that in Young Frankenstein the current scientist has finally got it right?Well to find out you'll have to see Young Frankenstein and Gene Wilder's take on the mad scientist the current 20th century version of that most misunderstood family of geniuses. Fascinating though that some of the same mistakes were made in bringing the monster played by Peter Boyle to life. Didn't they watch any of the old films?However when physical science fails psychology takes over as Wilder just thinks it might be a problem of soothing his fevered brain. The monster is also given a sex life in Young Frankenstein as Cloris Leachman finds certain attributes most attractive.

	schema:reviewBody "Victor Frankenstein's grandson has inherited his castle and everything in it. Although at first hesitant of embracing his controversial work he soon changes his mind when he realizes what this would do for his career and science. But some problems arise when trying to revive the creature...Young Frankenstein is hugely popular scoring 8 out of 10 on IMDb and considered by many to be Mel Brooks' best and one of the funniest comedies of all time. Is it good? Yes. Is it worth seeing? Yes. But I neither think it's the funniest of Mel Brooks' work History of the World The Producers and maybe even Silent Movie are funnier or one of the greatest comedies. Maybe it's not aging well or I just don't get it but I just don't get it.The bulk of the jokes are vaudeville and slapstick takes on the classic Universal Studios version of Frankenstein even going so far as to use many of the same props. And while some of the scenes stand out as funny the Puttin' on the Ritz scene for one the bulk of the plot is very nearly the same as the classic film. I respect the homage even the use of the black and white film but it does not deviate enough to be unique in my mind.In contrast consider Brooks' Spaceballs. Yes it is a parody of Star Wars. But it does not follow the plot too closely deviates in almost every way incorporates other plots and science fiction references... and has a whole variety of humor styles mixed in. While maybe not the best of Brooks' work this film is a much more solid comedy and stands up better for a variety of audiences. IMDB rates it lower but I cannot agree on that. Marty Feldman Igor is often overshadowed by his costars and Brooks but he makes a strong Igor and his eye condition could not have been better utilized. This character is the one clear improvement from the original film and should not be overlooked.Gene Wilder and Gene Hackman were both great of course. Many consider this to be Wilder's best role. I simply cannot accept that Frankenstein as great a character as he is somehow trumps Willy Wonka. As made clear when Johnny Depp  a brilliant actor  tried to be Wonka there is no replacing Wilder even by the best stars of our day.Don't get me wrong. The film is great the directing and cinematography are excellent. The cast is amazing particularly some of the supporting cast like Teri Garr as Inga. But to say this is Mel Brooks' best film one of the best comedies of all time or Gene Wilder's best role is just not correct in my opinion. A second viewing might change my mind but for now I would like to be convinced that this film is more than above average.".

As far as I know Transylvania is not and never was a part of Germany so why the thick German accent. No honestly for a whizkid like me there weren't any sophisticated jokes and hardly a scene managed to crack me up. Mel Brooks success is and will remain a mystery to me and I don't know how more movies of him I have to see in order to find out what's so great about him. I worked in a cabaret once and I found out that a lot of people just laughed because the guy on stage was a comedian not because he was funny.

A great film to be sure but not a very successful one in the comedy department which is a shame since it's a huge problem in an otherwise fine film.It may count as cheating since I've been a fan of this film since adolescence but even after all these years I knew I would encounter no such problem in this Mel Brooks classic.'Young Frankenstein' has the distinction of being one of those few comedies which can be just as funny for those who have never seen the source material that's being spoofedNo problem for me as I was a fan of the Universal horrors since I was even younger and had read the book even earlier and that still offers plenty of insight for those who have. And as unpromising as it sounds to make a comedic send up of Universal's horrors which had displayed their ability to laugh at themselves as early as 1932 it ironically emerges as the very model of how to do a successful parody and even more amazingly it also offers some surprising insight into the themes of the Frankenstein legend itself or at least much more than Kenneth Branagh's overrated 'faithful' adaption ever did.The plot is basically a comedic remake of Rowland V. Lee's 'Son of Frankenstein'1939. The setup is virtually the same A descendant of the original DoctorGene Wilderreturns to his family castle where he is ostracized by suspicious villagers led by a onearmed inspectorKenneth Mars and is coerced into taking up his ancestor's mantle by an unhinged former associate. The difference is that the protagonist is the grandson of the original monstermaker the Ygor characterMarty Feldman whose character actually is more closely patterned after Dwight Frye as Fritz  Karl than he is Bela Lugosi as Ygor is benevolent and rather it is a sinister housekeeperCloris Leachman who influences the protagonist it also involves the creation of a new monsterPeter Boyle giving a comedic take on the monster that is worlds beyond Clancy Brown's in 'The Bride' rather than the reviving of the original one. This doesn't stop Brooks from managing to work in references to the original from 1931 and the 1935 sequel. In less skilled hands this could have been disastrous but thankfully Brooks was hip to the fact that 1935's 'Bride of Frankenstein' was already a horrorcomedy and he wisely didn't attempt to poke fun at things already meant to be funny. Instead he does his best to IMPROVE them. It's this approach that shows that Brooks is smarter than your average satirical filmmaker and it's what separates himwell besides actually being talented from the myriad of other 'satirists' who would have either attempted to point out 'flaws' the original filmmakers were clearly aware ofMst3k lifted scenes verbatimWayans Bros.or made up random unfunny jokes that had nothing to do with what was being spoofedFriedberg  Seltzer.What's also remarkable is that if one overlooks some small continuity issueswhich the original Universals were JAMPACKED withsuch as names and locationsIt's because this film takes place in 'Transylvania' that I am reviewing it for this marathon as well as the comedic tone this could actually be seen as a followup to the first 3 Universal Frankenstein films. Just imagine Gene Wilder's character as an adult version of Donny Dunagan from 'Son of Frankenstein' with a changed nameHe mentions being embarrassed by his lineage and this leads to a running gag where he insists his name is pronounced 'Fronkensteen' making him not a selfhating Jew but a selfhating mad scientist...who's also a Jewto escape publicity and it works. They even have the same curly hair and Americanized personality. This suggest Brooks was aiming not at a meanspirited comedic attack on decades old films but at a loving homagesequel to them instead. I can respect that.I could ramble on all day at how well it does justice to the original films and even the novelFor example lots of people mention how when the Monster says 'You are my creator but I am your master' to Victor in the book how the Monster is in some ways a twisted reflection of Victor in that he exceeds him in all levels proving more cunning more sympathetic more powerful and even has longer 'lustrous black hair' and how he actually succeeds in 'nailing' Elizabeth' by killing her long before Victor ever has sex with her suggesting that the Monster through a symbolic rape is even better in bed than his creator! In 'Young Frankenstein' this subtext becomes overt Here the Monster DOES 'rape' Elizabeth and she falls in love with him because of his 'Enormous schwanstucker' and deserts the doctor leaving him to marry a busty servant girlTerri Garr he was sleeping with anywaybut I think I'll rap up by saying that this film is as perfect as a parody can get good atmospheric music great production values and Oscarworthy performances by all.Still as much as I like experiencing 'local color' in foreign countries and as much as I enjoyed Kenneth Mars's character I hope that the Romanian police don't have accents THAT thick when I visit.".

	schema:headline " Decent and typical Bigas Luna film about a stubborn girl with big dreams and aspirations.";
	schema:reviewBody "Commercial and big boxoffice Spanish film upon a pair of women leave their small town and dud sweethearts behind for fun in Madrid . Juani Vernica Echegui comes from a very poor background  having grown up in a poor suburban village of Spain from little town outskirts . She has problems at home and argues incessantly with her boyfriend Diego Martin who cheats her and with whom she has been since she was 15 . Soon his infidelity with the abusive relationship she has with her boyfriend and overall uselessness  as well as the limitations of her poor and small town become unbearable for Juani and she along with her best friend Laya Mart decide to go the big city  Madrid . At first the big city a complete opposite of their hometown couldn't seem to be a better place for their teenager expectations of life . In a visit home Juani almost decides she will not return to Madrid  and will instead come back to old relationships and live again in her parents' house . She expresses these sentiments to her mother who tells her that she loves Juani's father Jose Chaves  but always asks herself what her life would have been like had she left  like Juani . After speaking to her mother Mercedes Hoyos Juani realizes that she can not give up though she has less Nave expectations  hoping to escape her exsweetheart and the future she would have were she to stay in her town . But she goes on her dream because La Juani is the best  in spite of her way is full of flops and disillusionments.Entertaining and modern picture about a young girl called Juani who along with her best friend leave for Madrid in search of a better life . First part of Bigas Luna's Trilogy about ambition followed by Di Di Hollywood with Elsa Pataky in a similar role . This stirring as well as erotic story is a passionate retelling and moving tale about wishes  lies and disappointments  but including strong sex scenes with loads of nudism . This is a moving tale about ambition  luxury  desire in which a mean young attempts to build her ambitious future  to be a Hollywood actress . The storyline relies heavily on the continued ambition of the starring  including a lot of sexual scenes  almost softcore  but it doesn't make boring  however the film is fun . As usual in Bigas Luna films  Yo Soy La Juani explores the darkest depths of eroticism and stereotypical Spanish machismo represented on the character played by Diego Martin . The moral of the story becomes clear  never forget what you set out to get despite the struggles that come your way and never give up on your dreams . Nice acting by Vernica Echegui as an obstinate young whose nave dreams are soon shattered by the ruthlessness of their dream city  Madrid  where she has been having a hard time . She won Sant Jordi Awards Best Spanish Actress  Spanish Actors Union Newcomer Award Female  and Nominated Goya Awards Best New Actress .

	onyx:emotionText "Commercial and big boxoffice Spanish film upon a pair of women leave their small town and dud sweethearts behind for fun in Madrid . Juani Vernica Echegui comes from a very poor background  having grown up in a poor suburban village of Spain from little town outskirts . She has problems at home and argues incessantly with her boyfriend Diego Martin who cheats her and with whom she has been since she was 15 . Soon his infidelity with the abusive relationship she has with her boyfriend and overall uselessness  as well as the limitations of her poor and small town become unbearable for Juani and she along with her best friend Laya Mart decide to go the big city  Madrid . At first the big city a complete opposite of their hometown couldn't seem to be a better place for their teenager expectations of life . In a visit home Juani almost decides she will not return to Madrid  and will instead come back to old relationships and live again in her parents' house . She expresses these sentiments to her mother who tells her that she loves Juani's father Jose Chaves  but always asks herself what her life would have been like had she left  like Juani . After speaking to her mother Mercedes Hoyos Juani realizes that she can not give up though she has less Nave expectations  hoping to escape her exsweetheart and the future she would have were she to stay in her town . But she goes on her dream because La Juani is the best  in spite of her way is full of flops and disillusionments.Entertaining and modern picture about a young girl called Juani who along with her best friend leave for Madrid in search of a better life . First part of Bigas Luna's Trilogy about ambition followed by Di Di Hollywood with Elsa Pataky in a similar role . This stirring as well as erotic story is a passionate retelling and moving tale about wishes  lies and disappointments  but including strong sex scenes with loads of nudism . This is a moving tale about ambition  luxury  desire in which a mean young attempts to build her ambitious future  to be a Hollywood actress . The storyline relies heavily on the continued ambition of the starring  including a lot of sexual scenes  almost softcore  but it doesn't make boring  however the film is fun . As usual in Bigas Luna films  Yo Soy La Juani explores the darkest depths of eroticism and stereotypical Spanish machismo represented on the character played by Diego Martin . The moral of the story becomes clear  never forget what you set out to get despite the struggles that come your way and never give up on your dreams . Nice acting by Vernica Echegui as an obstinate young whose nave dreams are soon shattered by the ruthlessness of their dream city  Madrid  where she has been having a hard time . She won Sant Jordi Awards Best Spanish Actress  Spanish Actors Union Newcomer Award Female  and Nominated Goya Awards Best New Actress .

But Yo soy la Juani is like this for just about the first 40 minutes. The core of the story is set far from the suburbs as Juani and her friend Vane leave for Madrid to make their way to happiness.Juani is attracted to acting i.e. serious entertainment more than say reality shows and such stuff which sounds a little strange. In Madrid while she pursues her dream of becoming an actress Vane attains her personal and humbler objective having a breast implant. The Madrid segment is a bit confused above all because it contains too many subplots castings parties football players surgery.... It is effective though in that it conveys a general feeling of tremendous distance between capital and suburb. Overall it works because of the strong presence of Echegui.This actress is amazing very effective perfect as the determined almost ruthless Juani a girl with a high opinion of herself and a gigantic personality the ringing tone of her cell phone is a recording of her own voice saying Viva la Juani. Plus Echegui is gorgeous... Am I wrong or she bears a striking resemblance to Natalie Portman?Onscreen SMS writing and video game sequences are edited in the movie which may sound like old and cheap tricks to someone but instead I think they are used in a good way. Cell phones and VGs are in because they are somehow important to these poor suburbanites but at the same time they are used as funny cinematic tricks. The risk of representing cell phones SMS writing and video games is high and in proportion to the age of the directorscreenwriter but Luna avoids the trap by placing those paraphernalia in the right context without describing them in an overenthusiastic or moralistic way.I felt that something was missing in the description of the world of car tuning and nengs. Why these people live for their cars is never said. The topic of drugs is absent and should have been mentioned somehow even if Laya Mart can be seen rubbing her nose at the VIP party in Madrid. But I think the story is about La Juani a very strong and fascinating character and not thanks heaven a sociological treatise on suburban Spanish youngsters.".

Though the rawness and honesty in this film are not very shocking in 2010 this film is reminiscent of the 1995 film Kids. You get to see what young kids do and the issues they are forced to deal with. If you're looking for a life changing experience this movie is not for you however if you want a glimpse into what it's like to be in your early twenties in this part of the world this movie is great.".

	schema:headline " The Space Marine the Vikings and the Alien Space Dragon";
	schema:reviewBody "I stumbled upon this move by accident but being a scifi and fantasy nerd I watched it despite the fact that scifi movies nowadays tend to be rather poor.The story begins with Kainan James Caviezel crash landing his spaceship into a lake in the middle of Vikingland in 709 AD. With his copilot dead and his ship in ruins sunken to the bottom of the lake he uses his only working piece of technology to teach himself the norsk language. I laughed my head off when the first word he utters in Earth language is the F word D Wandering around in a forest he is found by Wulfric Jack Huston and brought back to his village. They think Kainen is responsible for brutally ransacking a nearby village and when Kainen tells them he is hunting for a dragon he is labeled as a liar and enemy. When in fact the dragon he is referring to is a monster from another planet now hunting the viking populace and fauna of the land. Soon when the villagers start vanishing and turning up as mutilated corpses the vikings realize that Kainen might be telling the truth after all...I gotta say combining space marines and alien monsters with a fantasy Viking setting intrigued me to no end. Outlander is the living proof that such a combination can result in a very good and entertaining 115 minutes. Although the story is a little shallow lacking in huge plottwists and deep character development but it is enough to keep the attention between the awesomely gory fight scenes.The acting is good enough with the Christian Bale lookalike Caviezel and the great but short performance of Ron Perlman it manages to be captivating. We see far more swordplay than pulse rifle shootouts so the scifi part of the film is largely suppressed to make way for the epic battle between the vikings and the moorvens but that's just how it must be in this movie. The fight scenes are nicely choreographed and acted the special effects are more than awesome and the whole is movie is just great.I'd like to point out that the Moorven is most astonishing space monster I've ever seen. With the clever colored pulsing and the well thoughtout anatomy of the beast it manages to be best so far.It's not the best movie I've seen but it's still great and every scifi and fantasy fan should go see it.".

Nice cast Nice Script and everything is handled a hell of a lot more intelligently than what you'd expect from a movie which is essentially 'Giant Alien Vs Vikings'. Why this is only getting such a limited release is beyond me I think it could actually do quite well if given the chance. Basically anyone who enjoys SciFi ActionAdventure done well should be looking forward to checking this one out when and if they get the chance.".

My instinct told me that this was going to be another of those horrible Bmovies with a stupid story subaverage effects and mediocre acting at best. I was however pleasantly surprised. Not that it is a masterpiece. The background story could have been a tad bit more elaborate the plot more original and the final outcome a little bit less predictable but all in all one has to acknowledge the decent effort to make this movie convincing and suspenseful. The end result is a solid piece of entertainment with ample effects directing I'd call 'by the book' workmanlike acting and a few kicks and thrills along the way. So if you happen to like action movies and don't ask for too much depth in the story this will provide you with a 120 minutes amusement worth the time.".

It is MUCH more value for ticket money than a number of other recent offerings and its faults are minor compared to the good qualities.The story is basically a scifi plot but since the lead character's space ship crashes in the Iron Age among Vikings you can understand that most of the movie takes place with Viking themes and scenery.The basic plot is quite sound and for the first 40 minutes the movie is VERY gripping. It tends to go a little flat at the end of the middle act and the start of the third act but effects gore and very tense action compensate for those not too engrossed in the intricacies of the story. A pity about that because it looked like the story had more to offer and was chopped up somewhat to fit in a bunch of set pieces. I realize this is now making the movie sound a little lame it isn't Lord of the Rings but it is definitely worth the price of the ticket. See it expecting to be entertained for about 95 of the time and you wont be disappointed.".

	schema:headline " Beowulf from Outer Space";
	schema:reviewBody "Outlander is a great surprise by director Howard McCain  honestly never heard of him before but I'll be keeping an eye on his work from now on! The movie opens with a spaceship crashing down on Earth Norway 700 AD. The only surviour from the crew Kainan James Caviezel is soon captured by vikings who blame him for the slaughter in a nearby village. The outworlder claims he is not responsible and he has come to these lands hunting for dragons. The vikings don't trust a word... until their own village is attacked by a mysterious creature  something that Kainan brought with him from outer space...Proving himself in battle Kainan gains the trust of the vikings and gets himself some trusty friends... and some interest from the King's daughter Freya Sophia Myles. Together they have to face the alien beast Moorwen and find a way to destroy it. But Kainen is hunted not only by a monster but by guilt and memories as well. He couldn't protect his beloved wife and son from the very same creature.The story is simple and yet gripping. The idea that a pack of vikings and a spaceman battle an alien beast was exciting enough to make me interested and willing to see the movie. I approached it with no great expectations and I found myself pleasantly surprised! The movie is in fact very entertaining and involving. Jim Caviezel is an excellent choice for a tragic hero haunted by his past  a true Beowulf from outer space. The rest of the cast does a good job as well. I loved Sophia Myles in Tristan  Isolde and I was pleased to watch her again this time as a bold Viking princess. In the supporting cast we have John Hurt and Ron Perlman they've collaborated before on the Hellboy movies.The Moorwen is designed by Patrick Tatopolous and if you're familiar with his work you can sense his style in it. I'd say there is some Godzillanuance to the Moorwen but the luminous abilities of the creature were something new and exciting.The production design the sets and the costumes were also very good but what really impressed me were the flashback sequences of Kainan's life before falling down to Earth. The Moorwen planet war scene is truly great and the only thing I regret is that they were not longer  I can enjoy outofthisworld landscapes anytime! The CGI was impressive. I would play the movie again just to watch them once more.The movie could use some faster pace at times and I find it slightly longer than it should have been but by no means boring or trying. Outlander delivers an excellent scifi actionadventure  something we don't see too often these days!".

This release dumped unceremoniously into theaters in the early year scrap heap is certainly a movie that is fully aware of its preposterous nature and approaches it with a straight face a talented cast and premier production values that all work oddly well to produce an entertaining if far from perfect Scifi cult classic.Originally slated for a normal wide release a series of setbacks plagued production to an extent where it was deemed no longer feasible for such distribution. Why is this important you may ask? Well thanks to the original and best laid plans producers threw a whopping 50 million into the film which provides us with some damn good effects for a film you would all but assume to be a low budget straight to DVD release.The plot is as tantalizing as they come an alien Kainan played by James Caviezel crash lands in ancient Nordish territory in the age of the Vikings.

Caught in the middle of two warring Viking clans headed by Rogthgar John Hurt on one side and Gunnar Ron Peralman on the other the primitive tribes must ban together to defeat their new common foe. oh yeah it is in fact that awesome. The 'modern' story is framed by an interesting if slightly preachy backstory of past betrayal and genocide throughout the history of Kainnan's homeland.After all this financial mumbojumbo is put to the side what we are left with is a deliciously acted well made periodscificreature featureaction film that only works at all due to all originality and the bizarreness of the plot. A few elements keep Outlander from being a cultmasterpiece however it is too long there are too many false climaxes and the goofy plot only just holds up. That being said the good news is that this film will make a quick trip to your local movie store bargain bin which means that you can score it for about the cost of a rental.

While chasing the alien monster he finds a village completely destroyed and he is arrested by the warrior Wulfric Jack Huston that believed he killed the locals and is brought to Herot as prisoner. But sooner he proves his innocence and courage to King Rothgar John Hurt and his daughter Freya Sophia Myles falls in love for him. Kainan and Wulfric become friends and together they chase the Moorwen.Outlander is a wonderful adventure and a great surprise for me indeed. The cast is excellent leaded by James Caviezel the lovely Sophia Myles from Tristan  Isolde and Hallam Foe the veteran John Hurt the always efficient Ron Perlman and the unknown nephew of Anjelica Huston Jack Huston. The engaging story has elements of Starman Beowulf and Predator and is developed in a perfect pace. The special effects are decent and this movie is a great entertainment. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Outlander  Guerreiro Vs Predador Outlander  Warrior Vs Predator".

The year is something hundred BC there is nothing superhuman or extraordinary about him armed just with a gun version of a lightsaber  soon he is captured by the local tribe. The prehistoric people are nothing out of the ordinary eithera wooden fortress animalskin clad villagers and monarch based ruling system. I really liked the political element in the tribe's interactions with the opposing tribe and the logical tactical choices made by its leaders. It comes to show that politics in its essence is just a plain and simple common sense for the people's wellbeing.The two fighting tribes eventually join forces against the common evila pretty red illuminated monster that kills and eats everything on its way. The monster is CGI but it is given almost a human name Moorwen I have to admit very well done CGI. It blends very well with the rest of the sequences and the monster itself is quite original. All the encounters with it are really gory though so I do not recommend it for the fainthearted. There is the musthave love story as well between the outlander and the daughter of the king of the tribe who eventually took over his throne after the monster killed him mercilessly. There is a little cameo from Ron Perlman doing what he does best as a ferocious leader of the opposing tribe i.e. acting really tough.This movie has everything you want in one aliens great action sequences politics pretty female romance with the pretty female a bit of gory horror and a happy ending with an inevitable casualty of a loved onewhat not to like?".

It was still well within my acceptance level of good CGI and some of the background compositing was awesome. I know that the artist who worked on this put nothing less than love into what little they had for tools.I call the story Groundbreaking in that NO ONE ever before has truly combined Scifi and Vikings and pull it off so well. Yes I could see a lot of Borrowed ideas such as Predator Pathfinder Alien and Beowulf but that only added to the fun beauty and down right authentic Pagan and Scientific styles that are blended. The story was in depth enough to keep you interested and well mixed with action. Ron Perlman once again demonstrates how great an actor he is. Like always you do not see his prior roles There's no Hellboy or Reinhardt here. Also the very HOT Sophia Myles made a great love interest to create a spiritual pull between the two heroes.This is the best StraighttoDVD movie I have seen in years.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Hurt has plays so many roles it is difficult which he personally would select as his best. For Me I've seen him play mad emperors tyrant Dictators and pleasant storytellers all with the same conviction of a true Thespian. In this film  The Outlander  his role is relegated to playing the courageous Rothgar the Danish Chiefton of the Northland Vikings. From out in the distant galaxies and far from his own home world comes 'Kainan' a space traveler James Caviezel who's spacecraft has been damaged and sent careening towards Earth. Upon crashing he discovers he is on 'Old Earth' circa 10th century Norway. Unfortunately he quickly ascertains one of the creatures he was battling in space has joined him when he lands. Here he must not only adapt to the Viking way of life but hunt down and destroy the last of a race of creatures called the 'Moorwen.' Sophia Myles plays Freya the chieftain's strong willed daughter and Wulfric Jack Huston the brave heir apparent. Ron Perlman is Gunnar and displays some excellent acting as does young Bailey Maughan who is Erick. The movie is a surprising blend of Alien the 13th warrior and Beowulf. The dramatic action theme is way above par while the physical confrontational scenes and special effects are incredible. A superb movie and a worthwhile entry on it's way to becoming a memorable Classic. Highly recommended for all! ".

	schema:headline " What Could Have Been...";
	schema:reviewBody "It's always frustrating to hear of how the Hollywood 'suits' treat some films whilst throwing money at others. Outlander has been the unfortunate victim of bureaucratic idiocy.Outlander was an independent feature made on a moderate by today's standards budget of nearly 50 million around which 35 or so went on actual production and the rest on various legal fees etc. The production direction and effects help it stand out as a much more professional film than many of the recent crop of bloated bigbudget pictures. Yet as a result of the 'Weinstein' company's decisions The 'Weinstein' company in America gained the rights to cinematic and DVD release in the U.S. it was essentially forgotten. They had apparently made little initial investment and therefore presumably decided just to make a chunk of money back through the minimal effort of a DVD release while avoiding the expense and effort of giving it a cinema release. So it is a tragic shame that we didn't get to see this as a sleeper hit which I believe it may well have been along the lines of something like Pitch Black.But what of the movie itself you ask? Spaceship crashlands amongst the Viking Fjords on Earth during the iron age. So enters our hero the lone survivor of said ship who joins with the local populace to defeat the terrible alien that was also on board and has started slaughtering the nearby inhabitants. Yes it sounds cheesy on the surface but it's great fun. It's all been well thought out and given far more depth and story than you would otherwise expect.The production has managed to gather a fantastic cast including James Caviezel Frequency Passion of the Christ John Hurt Alien Nineteen Eighty Four Hellboy Harry Potter Sophia Myles Underworld Thunderbirds TV's Moonlight Ron Perlman Hellboy Alien Resurrection and promising upandcomer Jack Huston. They all have great fun with their parts without hamming it up Though Ron Perlman's role is somewhat shorter than expected.In terms of general production oftused creature designer Patrick Tatopoulos Stargate Godzilla Pitch Black has created probably his best creature design since 'They' trying to come up with something original for the alien. Its face is perhaps a bit too reminiscent of his earlier Godzilla design but the fiery glows and shapes really make the Moorwen As the creature is called stand out. Meanwhile Geoff Zanelli Hitman Disturbia has written a suitably stirring and epic soundtrack score. Since this is one of his first few feature film scores he could well be one to watch.There are plenty of interesting characters in Outlander all used in ways that are not too stereotyped. For example Kainan The lead character played by Caviezel bonds with a young boy 'Shane'style yet this is not forced or overplayed. Likewise the slight hints of romance with Freya played by Myle's. Other characters start off with certain stereotypical expectations only to turn out more nuanced and interesting than you thought. Even Kainan has a story that you enjoy learning about as he tells it in hushed tones. His personal tale is nothing original but uses those types of clich that only become that way because there are few better ways to motivate and emphasise a character.Outlander is a wonderfully fun adventure in the greatest old style. The action is gory and exciting. The characters are interesting and make you want to follow their story. The filming is slick and polished modern while not bowing to overused 'trendy' techniques.The director Howard McCain should be applauded for the job he's done here considering he has only really started his career and created a movie that given a chance puts to shame most of the recent blockbusters. There's not too much to say about Outlander other than just enjoy it for what it is. There are so many films you could say it has similarities to from Alien to Lord of the Rings but even they have their own prior influences. Outlander adds enough of its own twists and fairly original turns stand out and hold its head proud. If you get the chance just enjoy an oldfashioned sciencefiction adventure.".

This movie is well done well shot well produced the props look good enough the sets are good enough the CGI is well done and the actors do a decent job.The Screenplay seems to be cut just right it does not have too many lengths or shorts the conversations have the needed information without venturing off too far into the romance story within the action.

	schema:reviewBody "Vittorio DeSica's wonderful Umberto D was one of the last films of the Italian neorealism movement and by far its best one. It is also one of my favorite movies ever. The movie's premise is simple it is a slice of the life of a poor lonely pensioner Umberto. Throughout the movie we see Umberto struggle to find money to pay rent to his horrible landlady love his dog Flike and deal with the loneliness and disillusionment of the postwar era.Umberto D is a characterdriven film. It works very well because of its sharp observations on loneliness and poignant gestures. The gestures evoke powerful feelings without necessitating dialogue. Many of the scenes even the ones that do not necessarily advance the plot are hypnotically beautiful in their simplicity. Take for example a beautiful scene where Umberto finally needs to beg for money but cannot physically bring himself to do it. He extends his palm up but when a passerby stops to give him money Umberto quickly flips his hand over as if testing for rain. The film is full of these small gestures that quietly emphasize the desperate loneliness and poignancy of Umberto's situation.The acting in this film is absolutely superb. Carlo Battisti despite having never acted before is wonderful as the titular character his face is a fascinating blend of stubborn dignity and weariness of life. Maria PiaCasilio who plays the maid is just as good as evoking life's loneliness and quiet desperation. The supporting cast is also very strong.One of the very few criticisms I have heard of this film is that it is too sentimental and borderline sappy. While some scenes with Umberto and his dog Flike are sentimental never is it too sentimental. DeSica knows how far he can push his film without making it sappy and he wisely shows it as it is. Nothing feels forced. The subject material itself and the simplicity in which it is presented will bring tears. If you don't cry in this movie you need to have your heart professionally dethawed. But Umberto D is never dumbed down into sappiness and clichd corniness. It is a very powerful film.Umberto D is the masterpiece of the Italian neorealist era. It's a rather bleak and very realistic movie but it makes some fascinating commentary on the human condition specifically the loneliness we face. Highly highly recommended. 1010.".

Therefore one can see him in a sense for what he is he's us merely you and I at the end of our lines of life with one wrong step sent to us after another.Battisti's Umberto is retired known fairly among his past employees and living in a dank infested one room who seems to be on the standard downward spiral for such a neorealist effort indeed like The Bicycle Thief many of the elements against him are from society's natural pitfalls. His health starts to go as he gets a fever and is sent unsympathetically to the hospital and returns to find the place being torn at each wall. The landlady wants him out since she will only accept full rent instead of partial rent and the maid of the house Maria PiaCasillo while kind and friendly lives in a similar prism of fear and emptiness.

This leads him out into the streets outside of Rome where the film plays out like a Chaplin movie without the humor and female companion only with his best friend in the world a little dog named Flag.By the 3rd act of this epitome of heartbreaker moviemaking a quote passed through my head that Michelangelo Antonionni once stated The actor is a moving object. That sentence I can guess is true of Battisti as well as for his little dog. Aldo Graziati's camera follows him and his companion like another piece of the frame which makes our focus on them all the more compelling. They're just their acting the ways an old man and his pet act with one another which is care and devotion. Battisti in turn delivers for De Sica an overwhelming performance of emotion. The very last scene is one of the definitive milestones of the movement at the time in Italy  despite it all a relationship between a man and his best friend can be stronger in desperate times than a man can have with a fellow human being. Truly this ending is quite suitable for one of the best films of it's time and for De Sica a memorial tribute to his father. A".

I first saw it with my parents as a young man in high school at the Uptown Columbus Theatre in Providence and at the age of thirteen I was thoroughly moved by this story of old age poverty and neardespair! Perhaps that was a precocious reaction from a youngster but as the years moved on and I've become closer in age to its sad hero and am retired just as he was I've never ceased to be moved by this story. The truly stirring scenes are those between Umberto and his dog Flaik. The moment when he saves it from impending death in the dog pound and clasps it to himself as the only thing in the world he can love and be loved by is utterly overwhelming. Willynilly the dog returns the favor the gift at life at the end by saving his master from a suicidal leap before an oncoming train. These scenes are justly extolled by Martin Scorsese in his documentary tribute to the Italian cinema IL MIO VIAGGIO IN ITALIA. Yes the film seems to have an almost Dickensian outlook on the world. The bad are truly bad gargoyles in fact like that hideous couple that shelter dogs and to whom Umberto wisely decides not to abandon Flaik and like the caricatured bitch of a landlady that is Umberto's nemesis. And the good are longsuffering like the unwed pregnant servant girl and like Umberto himself. Through it all the message of director Vittorio De Sica and screenwriter Cesare Zavattini radiates. Life is a treasure. This film celebrates that idea so poignantly and so wisely. We live. We suffer. We are Umberto D.".

One could say that for long parts of the film nothing much happens for instance when we follow Maria's early morning routine of grinding some coffee but from these detailed vignettes we learn a great deal of the thoughts feelings and emotions of the characters. These sequences are why it is a great film. The acting is wonderful the impossible situations of the old man  and of the unmarried but pregnant Maria are really brought to life for the audience.

Umberto is a man who once had a very respectable job and has an immeasurable amount of pride. He has to think about begging in the streets but just can't go through with it. One of the great things about these Italian neorealist films is that we really do see what conditions are like in postwar Italy. The authentic locations are priceless to these films and it also creates a docudrama feel. DeSica's The Bicycle Thief is my favorite of these type of films but this is also a classic gem! SPOILER ALERTThe last 20 minutes of this film is tough to watch and it can easily bring tears to the most jaded eyes. Unable to find a new home for Flag Umberto tries to commit suicide by walking in front of a train with Flagg in his arms. A gut wrenching scene where Umberto is unable to go through with it and Flagg is temporarily upset with his master. The last scene of them together is classic neorealism. Umberto realizes he is a survivor and is just going to try and eke out an existence. The two of them playfully bounding down the road. Umberto's fate is unsure thats the way life is. We have all come to expect these ambiguous endings and when they're done properly like in this film it helps to create a truly haunting and memorable experience.

You don't have to be old you don't have to be a doglover although it helps and you certainly don't have to be a fan of neorealist Italian cinema. All you have to be is a good human being. Watching this movie is a sort of 'humanity test' and thankfully most of the reviewers here have passed it.I'm sorry Cinema Paradiso you've just been relegated to Second Best Foreign Film.".

This film remedies for me what I find so troubling about Chaplin efforts like City Lights and Limelight. There's something so false about the Chaplin characterizations and they seem designed to force aahhhs from the audience. This is the real McCoy and the relationships seem so unstrained and real.I especially loved the friendship between the servant girl and the old man. Again no moralizing. Each seems stuck in their own set of circumstances and help each other as much as they can and no more though its obvious that they respect each other enough to understand that without saying it they each have lives to lead. We all have our own problems. I was most struck at how subtle the camera seems to float pan and track without being obtrusive or obvious. The scene that's shot through the hole in the adjacent room to his and the slow track seems symbolic of so much of the film. Every single element serves the story and the characters.FYI  according to something I read the dog's name is Flick pronounced Flyke.Sigh.Sometimes a dog is enough.".

The story is simple  one might even say sentimental  yet poignant it tells the tale of a crumpled old man struggling to retain what he has left in the world which consists of little more than an apartment run by a spiteful landlady and an affectionate young dog. Though the world is ignoring him and as De Sica hints perhaps many of the elderly he feels the necessity of hanging onto these things  but he is old and more importantly he is poor.Thus his apartment one which he has kept for twenty years slowly ceases to be his. But the dog does not and herein lies the crux of the story when our man gives up on his apartment he decides to give up on life. Yet the dog the young and living dog is still with him and he can find nowhere to dispose of it.Like himself this dog is unloved and unwanted and thus the protagonist must remain with it and more importantly remain with life.This plot sounds syrupy and cheap on paper an old man who can only go on living because of his lovable pet dog? And yet nevertheless De Sica manages to take the surface simplicity of the tale and fabricate it into a deeply moving story and that is just because De Sica is a 'NeoRealist' director the film never tries to pluck our sentimental heartstrings or wetten our eyes rather it remains comfortable in simply presenting itself. The execution of the film is sparse the characters are not heavily elaborated on the plot is kept confined to its core and the images  though stunningly handsome  never become overly sumptuous. A viewer might point out that many find their inner selves 'plucked' and twanged by the movie but this is because De Sica knows how to use those few moments of sentimentality a movie need and thus the glorious moments when the old man leaves his sole friend the young maid or when he decides on life again and dances with the dog are all the more powerful. Umberto D. is a sentimental film but it is its simplicity of style and modesty of emotion that prevent it from becoming a syrupy one.7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Minor SpolerUmberto Domenico Ferrari Carlo Battisti is a lonely retired old man with no family. His companion is the dog Flike. His small retirement pension does not allow him to pay for his room his food and his debts. The first part of the movie shows Umberto trying to resolve his life participating in a public protest for improvement of pension selling his few assets and trying to borrow and even begging for money. Then the owner of the pension asks him to move from his room and he tries to save his dog. And the last part when the old man tries to suicide with Flike. Vittorio de Sica together with Roberto Rossellini and the Taviani brothers are the masters of the Italian NeoRealism filming with nonprofessional cast. This touching drama about third age solitude selfish society and misery is remarkable and unforgettable. The fight of the character trying to keep his dignity and save his only friend will certainly touch even the most hard heart viewer. Only yesterday I have the chance to watch this movie which has not been previously released on video. Fortunately again the great Brazilian distributor Verstil offered the chance for us lovers of great movies to watch this film completely restored in a marvelous DVD.

	onyx:emotionText "Minor SpolerUmberto Domenico Ferrari Carlo Battisti is a lonely retired old man with no family. His companion is the dog Flike. His small retirement pension does not allow him to pay for his room his food and his debts. The first part of the movie shows Umberto trying to resolve his life participating in a public protest for improvement of pension selling his few assets and trying to borrow and even begging for money. Then the owner of the pension asks him to move from his room and he tries to save his dog. And the last part when the old man tries to suicide with Flike. Vittorio de Sica together with Roberto Rossellini and the Taviani brothers are the masters of the Italian NeoRealism filming with nonprofessional cast. This touching drama about third age solitude selfish society and misery is remarkable and unforgettable. The fight of the character trying to keep his dignity and save his only friend will certainly touch even the most hard heart viewer. Only yesterday I have the chance to watch this movie which has not been previously released on video. Fortunately again the great Brazilian distributor Verstil offered the chance for us lovers of great movies to watch this film completely restored in a marvelous DVD. Unfortunately we realize that this sad story in a postwar Italy still exists in our present days where a great part of the retired persons live in a situation similar to Umberto D. A mandatory film! My vote is nine.";

Italian director Vittorio De Sica evidently also understood the bond between man and dog and this touching relationship forms the centrepiece of 'Umberto D. 1952' arguably the final major film in the Italian neorealism movement that was established in the mid1940s. De Sica is of course best known for 'Ladri di biciclette  The Bicycle Thief 1948' a masterpiece that remains one of the most powerful films I've ever seen. For my muchawaited New Year's Eve doublebill following Sidney Lumet's '12 Angry Men 1957' I decided to try another of the director's mostrespected works 'Umberto D. 1952' which though initially unsuccessful in its home country has come to be considered one of the foremost examples of the distinctive Italian filmmaking style.As was typical for neorealism films the title role was played by a nonprofessional actor Carlo Battisti a retired professor of linguistic science. Considering that 'Umberto D.' was his sole film appearance Battisti gives an incredibly sincere performance his dreary downcast eyes betraying a lifetime of fruitless existence. Umberto Domenico Ferrari having completed a mildly successful career in public service wishes for nothing more than to live out his remaining years in peace and security but the minuscule government pension doesn't afford him many luxuries his debts with the wealthy heartless landlord professional actress Lina Gennari are regularly compounding and so Umberto struggles to feed himself let alone his faithful canine companion Flike occasionally translated as Flag played by animal actor Napoleone. Though he occasionally comes across some wealthier friends from his younger days Umberto has too much dignity to ask them for money and his halfhearted attempts at begging result in some genuine Chaplinesquire flourishes of humour a characteristic that sets 'Umberto D.' apart from many other absolute works of neorealism. Indeed aside from the everenthusiastic Flike Umberto's only other avenue for friendship comes from the young maid in his apartment building Maria MariaPia Casilio who is currently pregnant but cannot decide which of her two boyfriends is the father.All things considered not very much happens in 'Umberto D.' but it is the hapless plight of the title character that keeps us dutifully watching for his eventual fate is continually shrouded in uncertainty. When all security and dignity has been stripped from him Umberto decides that it is time for him to die but his love for Flike prevents him from taking an drastic measures for the greatest tragedy imaginable is a loyal dog without the care of his master. The ending of the film after Flike fearfully thwarts Umberto's attempts at a noble murdersuicide the shot of the train roaring past Umberto heaving a cloud of dirt about him is absolutely incredible is something that would not have looked out of place in a Charles Chaplin film. Having returned to each other's arms Umberto and Flike descend down the road playing amongst themselves their futures uncertain both hopeful and bleak. Where are they going? What will they do now?

And was the housekeeping so abysmal that there was no concern about ashes being scattered on the floors? Such scenes compromised the realism for me. Was the mood in Italy after the war so cynical that everyone would treat a decent older man as a cypher? It would have been good to know just how Umberto wound up in his situation. Partway through the movie someone asks Will there be war? What was the meaning of that? I thought the time frame was post World War II.I watched this on the Criterion Collection DVD and can report that the film quality is pristine.Umberto's situation is the nightmare we all fear as we age and if presented one can only hope to face that situation with Umberto's quiet dignity and acceptance.

	schema:reviewBody "On the heels of all the neorealism coming from Roberto Rossellinni and others during the mid'40s to '50s Vittorio DeSica gives us UMBERTO D a film that tells the story of an aged man's devotion to his pet dog but no means of providing food and shelter for himself during hard times due to a small pension. The indifference to his plight from a hardhearted landlord lady provides the conflict.His only human relationship is with a young girl who happens to be pregnant and works as a maid in the apartment building he inhabits. Their relationship is at the core of the subplot that runs through the simple story and is nicely handled.The scenes with the dog are poignant and tender moments that give the story some sense of depth but DeSica ends his film on an ambiguous note after a heartwrenching moment when the man tries to give the dog away to a happy childand then almost takes his own life before an oncoming train when the dog manages to escape his clutchesand in doing saves his life.However the final scene of reunion between dog and master doesn't really resolve the situation and it's here that the film is a letdown for this viewer. There is no future for either of them so it's essentially a bleak ending to a sad situation. It's also a manipulation of audience sympathy.Despite its faults this is a sometimes moving and eloquent but somber look at the desperation of one man's old age.".

The indifference to his plight from a hardhearted landlord lady provides the conflict.His only human relationship is with a young girl who happens to be pregnant and works as a maid in the apartment building he inhabits. Their relationship is at the core of the subplot that runs through the simple story and is nicely handled.The scenes with the dog are poignant and tender moments that give the story some sense of depth but DeSica ends his film on an ambiguous note after a heartwrenching moment when the man tries to give the dog away to a happy childand then almost takes his own life before an oncoming train when the dog manages to escape his clutchesand in doing saves his life.However the final scene of reunion between dog and master doesn't really resolve the situation and it's here that the film is a letdown for this viewer. There is no future for either of them so it's essentially a bleak ending to a sad situation. It's also a manipulation of audience sympathy.Despite its faults this is a sometimes moving and eloquent but somber look at the desperation of one man's old age.";

Because of this the plot is VERY simple just as in his film The Bicycle Thief and the actors are not really actors but real people from the Italian streets. You might think this would make the film seem cheap or amateurish like Plan 9 From Outer Space but thanks to exceptional direction and writing this is definitely not the case.While I would not want a steady diet of these sort of films they are a very welcome relief to the completely unreal and overthetop characters and plots so often found in films. This movie is a work of art and deserves your attention.UPDATESince seeing this gutwrenching film I've seen quite a few of DeSica's other films such as THE BICYCLE THIEVES and MIRACLE IN MILAN. Amazingly enough despite giving UMBERTO D a 10 there is actually another barely known film DeSica made before all these films that is his best movie. Like these other films THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US is a neorealist film but it manages to make one of the strongest emotional impacts of any film I have ever seen. Like UMBERTO D it is brilliant and a must for any serious film lover or film student. Because the film debuted during WWII it was not seen in much of the world and that's a pity. Now that it's on DVD you must see this movie as well as UMBERTO D.".

My copy taped from TCM's Italian film festival introduced by Scorsese's VIAGGIO clearly identifies the pup as Flag.That said Umberto D is one of the greatest masterpieces by any Italian filmmaker and with each viewing comes ever closer to being my favorite European movie.The film is everything other posters have claimed terribly sad deeply moving and yet with a gentle wisdom behind the tears which enables us to endure our human tragedy just another day.Umberto himself is a wonderfully realized character.  Embittered by his fall from the respectability of civil servant to the poverty desperation and irrelevance of a needy old man in an uncaring world he still has pride and pride along with his deep attachment to his nice little pooch Flag and his own real humanity keeps him alive.Umberto is not always pleasant to be around sometimes he is querulous and curmudgeonly and you want to scream at the unbending pride which prevents him from directly asking for help from old friends but who can blame him for being human?  To him the poorhouse is a fate worse than death and he's probably right.  A previous poster referred to the great scene where Umberto ALMOST summons up the will to hold his hand out for spare change...and what about what immediately follows that scene where Flag sits up on his hind legs and holds his master hat in his mouth to beg?  He'll do anything  even sacrifice his own dignity  to help Umberto survive even if Umberto himself can't.  Whatever his flaws you quickly come to care very much about Umberto and Flag and it's because you identify with him for Umberto ultimately is you and every other person who is born and dies.All of the characters in Umberto D are wonderful  even Lina Garrari's callous landlady is a full human portrait.  Sure she's mean to the old man and wants to evict him for nonpayment of rent and because he is declasse but she IS running a business she's a person of some culture and sophistication and her friends seem to like her.  When Umberto suffers a heart attack and calls to be taken to the hospital she is transfixed in the doorway her face an ambiguous mask of...guilt for her treatment of him? And something more of course...maybe a little shame that now she'll get her way?Umberto's only human friend the maid Maria is the perfect complement to these characters.  Young but not innocent...kind and caring but completely aware that life sucks and that that's just is the way things are.  She empathizes with Alberto and shows him whatever kindnesses she can but she accepts his tragedy as inevitable.  She is pregnant but understands that neither of her lovers will recognize her child and that it's her problem  that's life.And then of course there's Flag.  His acting in the final scene at the park and railway track is just magnificent.There are many many wonderful moments in this movie which remain indelibly marked on the memory the acting is superb across the board and it just goes to show that lowbudget has never stopped a great master from creating a great movie as de Sica has done here.1010  one of the very best ever.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's recalled now for the star's performance which netted her her first Oscar. In 1960 the performance of Elizabeth Taylor as Gloria Wondrous was considered a fine one for that up and coming actress but despite her acting performance most people then and since have believed that it was not her sad portrayal of the selfdestruction of a beautiful call girl that merited the award but that she was recovering from a near fatal illness at the time. Taylor's performance was first rate  probably the best reason today to see this film. Despite an apparent hard shell she is quite vulnerable and her tormented relationship with socialite Laurence Harvey leads up to his degradation and her demise. John O'Hara's novels are still in print. He was a master of American idiom  the class and background of his characters could be seen by reading their dialog. He had a great eye for details and for social class conflicts. This first comes out in his first novel Appointment In Samara but it appears in Butterfield 8 as well where the class problems that arise from Gloria's affair with Weston Liggett can be called the tragedy of the purloined fur coat. Gloria as the novel opens has had her one night stand with Liggett at his home a ritzy uppereast side apartment in Manhattan. She is unsatisfied with leaving so soon so she takes a fur coat out of the closet to cover herself in. It is this theft that leads to the gradual revelation of the affair with Liggett and it's affects on Gloria Liggett her mother and friend Steve Eddie Fisher and his wife Dina Merrill and their family and friends. The coat symbolizes the sexual relationship that Gloria threatens to take away from Emily Liggett and how the social order is shaken by the affair.O'Hara based the story on a tragedy that happened in the summer of 1931 in New York City and Long Island and that also affected Boston. A very beautiful young woman Starr Faithful was found dead on the beach at the city of Long Beach in Nassau County New York. Starr was soon revealed to have had a number of socially prominent acquaintances one is hard put to call them friends. She and her sister Tucker and their mother and stepfather lived in Greenwich Village  their next door neighbor was Mayor James J. Walker to be fair to Beau James it is not very likely that he ever really knew Starr and her family. She did have a habit of popping up at parties all over the place rumor put her at a party to celebrate a Broadway production of Aristophanes' Lysistrata thrown by Bennett Cerf and in honor of the star of the production Miriam Hopkins. She also slept around one of her boyfriends being a ship's doctor on an Atlantic liner. But finally it came out that in her youth she was sexually abused by Mr. Andrew J. Peters a former Mayor of Boston. Peters actually was a cousin by marriage of Starr's mother. He continued seeing her as she grew up she was a minor when the relationship began and paid the family large sums to keep their mouths shut.None of this background is in the novel or film. The novel does have a character a respectable college professor who has had a relationship with Gloria and is coming to New York to pay her some extortion money but the tragedy of the Long Beach death is only approximated in the novel where Gloria drowns in a freak accident on an aging steamboat and is changed in the movie I won't explain how. In any case the death of Gloria is an accident in the novel and the movie  although Gloria's final actions may have been based on a death wish. Was that what killed Starr Faithful? Actually her last biographer Johnathan Goodman in The Passing Of Starr Faithful makes a case for her being murdered by gangsters who were after important secrets she might have had knowledge of. O'Hara would not have known of that theory but would have just worked on the general assumption that his model committed suicide which was accepted as likely in 1935 when the novel was written.

In 1960 the performance of Elizabeth Taylor as Gloria Wondrous was considered a fine one for that up and coming actress but despite her acting performance most people then and since have believed that it was not her sad portrayal of the selfdestruction of a beautiful call girl that merited the award but that she was recovering from a near fatal illness at the time.

The film like Liz's character is a big tease. Taking small but wellplaced stabs at sexual mores of the time period but never really going further. Add Laurence Harvey's womanizing alcoholic Dina Merrill as the waspy compliant wife Eddie Fisher La Taylor's current hubby at the time in the nonessential role as Liz's pal and Mildred Dunnock as Liz's annoying mother in denial and you'll be hard pressed to find a likable character. Liz herself did not consider this her best performance. Shirley MacLaine called it the Oscar I lost to the tracheotomy referring to Taylor's near death from pneumonia complications in 1960. B8 like other films that were based on camp sex novels of the 60's would make a great remake if it remained set in the 60's but kept the shocks of the original book intact.

She hurls the money away scrawling No Sale on the mirror with her lipstick. But she seems to forget that she is a call girl and call girls accept money for services rendered. Unfortunately Gloria is in love with Liggett her john but he is married to someone else  a society matron poorly played by the cold patrician beauty Dina Merrill. As Gloria is leaving she steals Ligget's wife's 7000 fur coat and starts all kinds of trouble. It certainly would have caused trouble today  the entire film is a PETA nightmare as Gloria can be clocked wearing suede lynx coyote mink sable beaver and something that looks like skunk. The whole movie has Liz in her last fading bloom of youth girdedtothegills and at the peak of her eyebrowsofdeath period. Her Gloriaously voluptuous figure is beginning to bulge and sag but she is decked out to the nines in dropdead stylish early60s glamour. At the time Liz and Jackie Kennedy were neckandneck in the glamour department and the Jackie look is unmistakably present in Liz's styling. Though Jackie's never would be Liz's cleavage is on abundant display. Cleavage was such a powerful metaphor for sex then  a setpiece whose effectiveness would be impossible now you practically have to show actors rutting on the floor to satisfy the modern taste. Liz was also at the peak of her Eddie Fisher period  playing a harlot on screen after stealing Fisher away from his reallife wife Debbie Reynolds only added to Liz's plummeting reputation. Fisher plays Gloria's friend who loves her but is not taken seriously by her. He's such a drip on screen that you can't help wondering how in real life this guy managed to attract one of the most glamorous women in the world. The suave and very continental Harvey is equally dull especially as he commandeers that last 20 minutes of the film. The part of Gloria won an Oscar for Liz Taylor  mysteriously since the work is far inferior to many of Liz's previous films. Liz has proclaimed that this is the least favorite film she ever made  she was simply fulfilling the requirements of her contract. But when Liz is good she's very very good but when she's bad she gives it all she's got. Director Daniel Mann definitely had a way with leadingladies. In addition to guiding Liz towards her Oscar he did the same for Shirley Booth in Come Back Little Sheba and Anna Magnani in The Rose Tattoo. Also directing Susan Hayward in I'll Cry Tomorrow Mann certainly excels in these heavyhanded soapers. Based on the racy John O'Hara novel the dialogue is dreadful. At one point Gloria tells her shrink I don't need you any more. I have no problems. I'm in love as well as Someday Wes is going to find himself and I want to be there. The script was so bad we veered off into a conversation about the yogurt shop murders and missed a scene full of lots of drinking ultimatums and arched eyebrows but we were riveted to the screen as Gloria is screaming Mama face it! I was the slut of all time! But even when shrieking Liz is irresistible. And like Gloria says in the movie I loved it  every awful moment of it I loved!".

Too bad they never worked again!The movie was wellcast.  The surprising performance was by Eddie Fisher who is not an actor.  He did a good job.  My first complaint about Butterfield 8 is the description of the plot summary calling Ms. Taylor's character Gloria Wandrous a call girl.  In the movie Gloria Wandrous was portrayed as a model who liked to party.  The point of the movie was Gloria was insulted that Weston Liggett portrayed by Lawrence Harvey gave her money for their first night together.  Throughout the movie she kept complaining she never took money for sex.  Well I never heard of a call girl not getting paid.  Perhaps in the book Gloria was a call girl.  It seems censorship confused the storyline. My second complaint about the movie was it should have been filmed in black and white.  This movie was a black and white story and many of the colors were in black and white.  MGM did the same thing years earlier in the movie That Forsyte Woman.  Very distracting and what a waste of money!  Both movies would have been accepted better if they were in black and white.".

	schema:reviewBody "Or The Fur Coat.So clich yet so unusual. Sheer nonsense but fun to watch. Coffeetable philosophizing and constant advicegiving and adviceseeking even the cop who pulls over Taylor gives her soaperly advice! The most ironic line in this soaper is delivered by Harvey's wife when she says in all sincerity This is real life not a television serial. Wonderful stuff. I wouldn't go as far as to say that the film is fun purely because it's unintentionally funny. It's unintentionally amusing but not in the badfilm sense like an Ed Wood film. Let's just say that it's alternately interesting in a normal way and unintentionally amusing. Harvey and Taylor are like an older Romeo  Juliet except that their socalled problems are totally blown out of proportion by their egocentric and constant poor poor me whining. Harvey in particular has nothing to moan about in his life even if his wife ceaselessly  and inexplicably  keeps coming up with her own unconvincing theories to justify and explain her husband's unhappiness. She is so understanding of her husband's selfindulgent selfpity and womanizing that it's no wonder he wants to leave her she must be insane! And Taylor plays a totally clich Hollywood highclass prostitute she has a heart of gold behind her tough exterior she places values over materialistic things like money she is deeply sensitive and actually looks for Mr.Right and so on. What malarkey! Taylor is far too glamorous to be a callgirl. In fact she has rarely looked sexier than in this film. Strangely enough she looks older than 28 which she was at the time. The film's first ten minutes have no dialog at all it's just Taylor posing around in an apartment showing enough skin to make any normal male wonder just how spectacular those breasts must be. My guess is that they are just as spectacular as they promise to be. I have no idea what the director andor writer wanted to achieve by this introductory scene but all I could think of while watching it was how great it would be if chubby ol' Taylor would take her clothes off. I'm sure this wasn't the intention  at least that would be THEIR claim. Taylor's platonic relationship with Fisher lacks credibility they're supposed to be childhood friends  and nothing but friends. What heterosexual man on this entire planet has a lifelong friend looking like Taylor  who is willing to jump into bed with anyone  and doesn't go further than the friendly kiss on the cheek?! Exactly.The woman playing Harvey's wife is a mediocre actress there are one or two scenes in which she is amateurish. Fisher is bland. I will never understand how the hell that little roundfaced potatoface got both Reynolds AND Taylor. Voodoo? As far as the ending is concerned I must say that although it's totally overthetop it's also highly original for a soaper how many soapers end with a carchase  the guy chasing the girl? It was the damn French Connection for a while there. The moment Taylor speeds away and Harvey starts chasing her it was obvious she'd get killed. Juliet snuffs it. But Romeo goes back to his wife and tells her something about how he will leave her for a while until he finds his pride and then he'll come back to see if things will work out. Soapier than soap.".

	onyx:emotionText "Or The Fur Coat.So clich yet so unusual. Sheer nonsense but fun to watch. Coffeetable philosophizing and constant advicegiving and adviceseeking even the cop who pulls over Taylor gives her soaperly advice! The most ironic line in this soaper is delivered by Harvey's wife when she says in all sincerity This is real life not a television serial. Wonderful stuff. I wouldn't go as far as to say that the film is fun purely because it's unintentionally funny. It's unintentionally amusing but not in the badfilm sense like an Ed Wood film. Let's just say that it's alternately interesting in a normal way and unintentionally amusing. Harvey and Taylor are like an older Romeo  Juliet except that their socalled problems are totally blown out of proportion by their egocentric and constant poor poor me whining. Harvey in particular has nothing to moan about in his life even if his wife ceaselessly  and inexplicably  keeps coming up with her own unconvincing theories to justify and explain her husband's unhappiness.

	schema:reviewBody "The most desirable girl in town is the easiest to find. Just call Butterfield8!'  So trumpeted the posters of this Elizabeth Taylor's first Oscar winning performance.  The film is a modernization of the 1935 novel by John O'Hara which was based on the real life of the 1920's New York City call girl Starr Faithful.  Miss Taylor was dead set against playing Gloria Wandrous. She felt was a deliberate play by M.G.M. to capitalize on her recent notoriety in the LizEddieDebbie scandal. Also she was anxious to move on to her first ever milliondollar role in Fox's Cleopatra. She was told by M.G.M that if she did not fulfill her contractual obligation to her home studio for one final film on her eighteen year contract that she would be kept off the screen for two years and miss making Cleopatra all together. She swore to the producer Pandro S. Berman that she would not learn her lines not be prepared and in fact not give anything more and a walk through.  Mr. Berman knew her better than she suspected. In the end Elizabeth Taylor turned in a professional classic old style Hollywood performance that ranks at the top with the best of her work.   She brings a savage rage to live to her searing portrait of a lost girl soaked through with sex and gin. A woman hoping against all hope to find salvation in yet one last man. Weston Leggett a man who is worse off than she is in the selfesteem department.    In her frantic quest for a clean new life Gloria finds that the male establishment will not allow her to step out of her role as a high priced party girl. She is pigeon holed by her past and the narrow mores of the late 50's are not about to let her fly free.  Not the barbuzzards of Wall Street not her best friend Steve who abandons her at his girlfriend's insistence. Not even her shrink Dr. Treadman believes in her. The three women in her life are blind to who she really is. Her mother will not admit what Gloria has become. Mrs. Thurber will not believe she can ever change and Happy the motel proprietor is too self involved in her own past to care who Gloria is She is the dark Holly Golightly and this is the lurid red jelled MetroColor Manhattan that is the flip side of Billy Wilder's The Apartment also 1960. Wilder's New York is cynical. Liz's tony East Side phone exchange rings only one way the hard way. This New York is dammed. Recrimination and death are Gloria's final tricks and she goes out in a melodramatic blaze that Douglas Sirk might have envied in place of his usually unsettling unconvincing happy endings. In the end we have a bravura performance by the last true star of the old system.  Yes she deserved the Oscar more for Cat'. Yes it was given to welcome her back from the brink of death in London. And even Shirley MacLaine's lament on Oscar night I lost the Oscar to a tracheotomy.'  can not diminish this must see performance by Miss Taylor.  In what one could call a perfect example of what an Oscar scene' is all about she says it all. I loved it! Every awful moment of it I loved. That's your Gloria Steve. That's your precious Gloria!'   She gave it to us with both barrels blazing and Metro and Berman be dammed.".

It's an ambitious and striking beginning to what's an odd kind of soaper one with a different plot and decent performances all around.There is a major misconception that Liz' character Gloria is a prostitute but she makes it clear she's looking for control and eventually love not money and when she sobs I took MONEY! near the end it's apparent it was a onetime thing and mixed up with love her real goal and that she's what we'd call today a party girl or a player. Her confession about being an abused 13yearold I LIKED it!!! also makes it plain her sex life started early though without her consent and that her emotionally confused life was thrust upon her. Determined never to be abused again she's modeled dresses and dated successful men always in control of them until bored married Laurence Harvey finally makes her fall in love. He's basically a rich failure propped up by his wife's money and a figurehead job in her family's chemical company. He's drifting just like aimless amoral Gloria.Gloria finally tells her shrink I'm in love obviously thinking love will conquer all while the doc cautions her to keep his number handy just in case it's not everything you hope it is. The love affair ends badly for all as a nervous unsure Harvey insults and leaves Gloria treating her like the cheap whore she's always been afraid of becoming. He comes back the next morning pleading to marry her but by then it's too late Gloria's made a lifechanging decision to move away and start over. As Harvey chases her down the highway a tragic accident takes her from him forever. Back at home Harvey tells his wife he's going out to find his dignity and that if she's still there when he returns they may still have something to talk about.Are these characters believable? Some may see Harvey's wife as so understanding as to strain credulity but Dina Merril's stoic performance gives her a kind of dignity as she patiently waits for her husband to find himself. Harvey and Gloria make an odd couple but it seems fair to say that real life is full of stranger characters than these.What's usually overlooked is the frequentlywitty script and dialog. Cat fights abound with a fusillade of barbs directed at badgirl Gloria from her mother's judgmental best friend Betty Field and from the jealous girlfriend Susan Oliver of Gloria's childhood pal Steve Eddie Fisher. The main course of course of course is the constantly shifting pasdedeux between starcrossed lovers Gloria and Ligett Laurence Harvey. Not only did Liz Taylor win an Oscar for this film but the movie plays on the reallife drama of pop singersuperstar Eddie Fisher who left America's Sweetheart  actress Debbie Reynolds  and daughter Carrie Fisher for Liz Taylor. Given Taylor's reallife role as a home wrecker at this time her being cast as a slut in this film seems inevitable and makes one wonder if Taylor could have even gotten the part without it. Just to be sure that absolutely no one could miss the connection to the reallife love triangle Fisher's onscreen girlfriend Susan Oliver is made up to look as much like Debbie Reynolds as possible. At first we weren't sure we wanted to see this picture again but from the striking opening scene on we found it intriguing. Eddie Fisher was no thespian and Susan Oliver isn't given much of a part but Laurence Harvey Liz Taylor and Dina Merrill bring this old chestnut to life.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie starts with Gloria Wandrous having a bad morning. She wakes in a strange apartment with no more cigarettes so slugs down some 20yearold scotch instead. The whisky and the apartment belong to Weston Liggett who brought her there the night before in a mutual blackout. After ripping her costly gown off her back and doing who knows what else he had the nerve to tuck 250 into her clutch bag with a note asking 'Enough?' Wounded to the quick she scrawls 'No sale' across his mirror in frosted pink lipstick grabs a decanter of hooch age unknown as well his wife's best fur to throw over her slip and hails a cab home. As she explains it later 'I borrowed something spiteful and elegant.'Gloria was a call girl who the doubletalking script insists is not a call girl at all. Rather she gets paid to model chic frocks at chic bistros all across midtown Manhattan where she sips Champagne perched atop pianos and flirts with the ad execs and Wall Street's finest. But she still lives officially with her mother a poor old thing though few are the nights she sleeps there. She takes lovers many if briefly but her only pal is songwriter Steve Carpenter a relationship that might make sense if he were presented as gay instead he's saddled with jealous girlfriend Norma.Harder to fathom than Gloria's source of income is her attraction to the perpetually scowling and sulking Weston Liggett. He's a Yale man married into money and serving as a functionary in a company owned by his wife Emily's family. With her oldmoney breeding she feels like she's making him suffer at one point her own mother sets her straight about family solidarity. Yet when she discovers her mink missing she goes crazy. I thought that this was the wrong detail on which to hang the turning of the plot even if it wasn't insured it's no more a loss than a nylon windbreaker for a woman of her wealth.The bond between Gloria and Weston is plainly sexual at first. In the most memorable scene he twists her wrist while she grinds her stiletto heel into his instep. He hates her for so freely granting her favors but loves her for granting them to him. And so it goes with both of them undergoing crises neither of them has enough maturity to handle and for which resolutions must be sought in the mechanics of melodrama. When in a rare moment of truth telling Gloria's mother slaps her. Gloria exclaims 'If only you'd done that before!' She can't simply be a freethinking woman who enjoys the high life her looks can buy her but a selfloathing and selfdestructive victim of sexual abuse by one of her mom's beaux when she was only 13. Butterfield 8 pretends to take a hard look at bigcity social mores in mid20thcentury America but really delivers a clucking sermon. The runofthemill sexual messes the characters find themselves in are hardly fodder for the judgments visited on them. A movie that was received as 'daring' in its day now dates badly revealing the 'racy' writer John O'Hara was.".

Liz's Oscar was the Hollywood equivalent of a Purple Heart for defeating the oldguard Studio system while enduring the worst script ever written. A dying MGM attempted one last show of force by punishing Taylor the last star it created for her wanton ways with a tawdry film designed to exploit the homewrecker reputation she'd gained by breaking up Eddie Fisher's marriage to Debbie Reynolds. Bad move. On screen and off Liz proved herself superior to this goldplated pigsty picking up an award for a movie she refused to even see as she waltzed off to bigger paydays better scripts and more husbands.Most comedies should be this funny. BUtterfield 8 has the exact same plot as Pretty Woman  New York tramp meets and falls for wealthy executive  but we're supposed to take it seriously. Liz plays Manhattan model Gloria Wandrous subtle eh? who's technically not a prostitute but rather a single woman who has multiple affairs a merely academic difference according to 1960 Hollywood. After sleeping through the opening credits which are superimposed over her in bed Liz wakes up alone in a penthouse following a onenight stand with rich stiff Laurence Harvey wanders around wrapped in a sheet has a drink nabs a mink and cabs it to the apartment of Eddie Fisher for whom Liz secured a role as Gloria's childhood best friend and the first of many doormats she will trample in this film. Even better Eddie is engaged to a perky blonde with a Debbie Reynolds hairdo. If you aren't giggling yet just wait until Harvey reappears. As the married lawyer who falls for mantrap Liz he spends the movie looking slightly less dazed than he would two years later throughout The Manchurian Candidate and has to deliver all the dumbest lines  when he escorts Liz onto his yacht she asks where are you sailing Captain? to which he responds Out of frustration and into ecstasy! There's no reason except script contrivance that a babe of Liz's caliber should ever fall for a rude ugly selfloathing dullard like Laurence a metamockery of Fisher?. However he has plenty of reason to fall for her  despite the movie depicting her as damaged goods Liz is actually fun witty sexy and roughly a 1000 improvement on Laurence's on screen wife the blonde bland and blankfaced Dina Merrill who can't decide if she's playing a willfully or genuinely naive woman and splits the difference by acting really really stupid. If only BUtterfield 8 were made in an era of sex comedies say the 30's or 70's Liz could have been a heroine Harvey's zombified affect could have been exploited for comic value and the filmmakers would have recognized the humor in the following exchange between Harvey and Merrill I can't go on disappointing you! Couldn't you try? But Butterfield 8 was made during the Golden Age of bigbudget soapscum like Peyton Place and Written on the Wind so viewers have to endure the era's hypocritical moralizing . . . these bad people will pay for their sins but not until a reel or two after we've been titillated by same.".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly profound farce possible spoiler";
	schema:reviewBody "LES BRONZES is an ensemble farce in the CARRY ON tradition.  Except it's French.  I watched this with a predominantly French audience and was astonished at the bombardment of laughter in the first ten minutes at scenes I wasn't getting.  I feared it would be that dreaded thing  a culturallyspecific comedy.  But once you settle down you can enjoy an oldschool farce about desperate scrambling for sex and not getting much stereotypes humiliation and failure.The film is set entirely in an African holiday resort focusing on a group of club holidaymakers and the staff.

	onyx:emotionText "LES BRONZES is an ensemble farce in the CARRY ON tradition.  Except it's French.  I watched this with a predominantly French audience and was astonished at the bombardment of laughter in the first ten minutes at scenes I wasn't getting.  I feared it would be that dreaded thing  a culturallyspecific comedy.  But once you settle down you can enjoy an oldschool farce about desperate scrambling for sex and not getting much stereotypes humiliation and failure.The film is set entirely in an African holiday resort focusing on a group of club holidaymakers and the staff.

Like a 'babyboomer 'ratpack' all these comedians would play a significant part to the evolution of French cinema in both comedy and drama by starring in the most popular tobemade French movies. On that level one of the exquisite delights of French Fried Vacation is to see all these wellestablished actors looking so young with this sparkling innocence in their eyes before stardom would extinguish it. Hell Even Grard Jugnot with his bald head and iconic mustache looks incredibly vulnerable beyond his averageJean attitude. To those who grew up with these actors French Fried Vacation carries a certain nostalgic feeling by depicting a slice of average vacationers' tumultuous lives at a time when everything wasn't centered on suburbs drugs or AIDS. Interestingly most of these actors grew up to become rightwing supporters when French comedy hadn't been overtaken yet by politically correct liberal artists and the dictatorship of cosmopolitanism the same that condemned a film like Amlie because it didn't feature racial minorities. The 'Splendid Troop' is seen now as oldfashioned but it's still the most authentic depiction of a portion of French workingclass youth. This is not to say that French Fried Vacation is dated of course it has this strong 70's womenlib sexual liberation feeling but the humor displayed in the film didn't lose its appeal and is still relevant by today's standards.Indeed never too militant or patronizing a trend that tends to damage the credibility of French comedies today the tone in French Fried Vacation is more realistic and satirical and tactfully flirts with a crude but never gratuitous vulgarity. I would say it's politically incorrect in the correct way because it shows the typical French people with no other purpose than mocking their own traits in a sympathetic way. The 'Glorious Thirty' referring to the days of economical expansion that followed the World War II were over and the time of Louis de Funes who was incarnating the good old pettyminded hotheaded successful businessman lost its touch. In the late 70's France was struck by the crisis outdating the France of Grard Oury and the 'Gendarmes'. That's another thing that I knew about French Fried Vacation the film was a landmark in French Comedy.And deserving more than a mention there's one the most iconic French movie songs' adapted from a hit by Dalida the unforgettable Darladirladada that became the quintessential vacation's themes elevating French Fried Vacation to its classic level as it's impossible to talk about the film without having this catchy tune in mind and its ridiculous yet classic choreography. The music defines the era's insouciance and freespirited liberation. In French Fried Vacation they're sexually liberated open to each other and just want to have fun. It was the days where everything didn't have to be political social or to carry a deep social meaning before French comedy would be taken over by an irritating selfrighteous dogma. French Fried Vacation is like a breath of fresh air that swept off the dust over old French comedy but makes new Comedy look even worseAll that I knew before watching the film wasn't disappointed when I did and the film only got better after each viewing. Directed by Patrice Leconte who'd make more ambitious films in the future it has this awkward directorial debut feeling but nonetheless it's carried by powerful performances from every single actor. It really shows that these actors started on stage. Every movie fan know these characters with the same tenderness as if they were family members there is the average couple with some emotional problems  Bernard Grard Jugnot and Nathalie Josiane Balasko the handsome staffmember Popeye Thierry Lhermitte who behind his womanizer's facade hides a more poignant touch of immaturity Jerome the doctor played by a more subtle and nuanced Chritian Clavier before he would be the clowny Jacquouille from The Visitors and of course at the top there is Jean Claude Dus the ultimate loser magnificently played by Michel Blanc the perfect anti model for all the wannabe womanizers.Not only are all these characters wonderfully played but they're all extremely welldeveloped with a level of threedimensionality that raised the film above all the other comedies. They're flawed people but with a touch of realism and authenticity that beautifully combines between the laughs and the pathos we both laugh at them but feel empathetic at a same time a credit to the clever writing. Naturally the film is not perfect and the structure made of series of sketchlike situations create the feeling of an inexistent narrative of storyline but the payoff is still positive and the film doesn't lose its time creating a 'story' for the sake of it it's just the joyful sometimes depressing sometimes ironic journey of a group of vacationers exporting their everyday issues even in vacation.Indeed if the movie opens with Gainsbourg's hit 'Sea Sex and Sun' we kind of expect from the sight of the vacationers that only two of these three premises would be fulfilled.".

It is an ambitious attempt for its time and it works pretty well as long as you are familiar with the story. It is no surprise that later adaptations of the material were able to get more of the story across but Pyotr Chardynin's effort is at least a creditable one.Chardynin seems to have had some real enthusiasm for the project. Although the camera technique is mostly straightforward most of the settings and details are carefully done and each scene seems to have been carefully planned.Somewhat surprisingly Chardynin made a couple of significant alterations to the original story and it would be interesting to know how it was received in its time given the reverence for Pushkin that many Russians of the era surely would have had. Certainly there have been far lesser literary works whose admirers are vocal in their criticism of filmmakers who change the details for the sake of cinematic effect.It would probably be much harder to follow this version without having read the story since even with the intertitles there is still much that viewers are expected to know or grasp on their own. In Russia in 1910 it was probably a perfectly reasonable expectation to assume that everyone knew the original story which is a masterfullycrafted classic of psychology and human ambition with a strong dose of the supernatural.It's worth seeing for the story alone even if you first have to take the time to read the original story which is not that long. It builds up the suspense about as well as you could expect for its time and the compelling climax comes off well enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although La Boum 2 is more than 30 years old it is heartening to learn that it has not lost an iota of its emotional appeal. It is known by cinema goers as far as in faraway Japan where Sophie Marceau went to promote her film. La Boum 2 talks about the world of youngsters and their parents especially from a generation gap angle. It shows that their world has not changed due to the control some parents continue to exert on their children. We get to see that the attitude of parents has remained same as they like to continue to spy on their kids fearing that their kids would no longer be in their control. It is as if somebody is afraid of losing them.Leading French actors Claude Brasseur and Brigitte Fossey play their roles with great finesse as parents of a young lady named Vic who is loved by everybody around her. Although La Boum is considered a cult classic it is also a perfect family film as any member of the family can easily watch it.LastlyLa Boum 2 is a film for all those who like their comedies to transform their worlds into a stress free world.".

The way she discusses the little details that compose a person and what she missed most in him. Like I remember the way your beard has a bit of red it in and how the sun was making it glow that...that morning right before you left.2 The scene in the van where they finally unburden themselves. One of the most emotionally raw and honest interplays I've seen on celluloid. The way she reaches out to touch him but holds back at the last second. Much different in tone from the way Hawke reached out to brush her hair aside in the first film.3 Celine's song. So simple yet so endearing. The way her voice fades to a whisper as she sings My heart will be yours until I die.4 The ending which is in all ways PERFECT. The slow fade the utter charm of her Nina Simone impression the ambiguity and the wonderful look in his eyes as his youth hope and happiness come rushing back to him while watching Celine dancing and singing foreshadowed in the opening scene. This is perhaps one of the ten best endings in the cinema.Hawke and Delpy are sublime of course. This film requires incredibly subtle acting and these are Oscar worthy performances that will not be recognized because they are not showy. Much of this film like life is acted with the eyes. Witness how Hawke stares at Delpy as she discusses her failed relationships on the ferry or the sadness and longing in Delpy's eyes as she sings her love song. As in the first film the chemistry between them is indelible. My candidate for best onscreen couple ever.This film is better than the first because it provides a more unique perspective. In Sunset we see the sobering effects of age and disappointment etched in their faces and clouding their lives. There is more at stake here for they are nine years older have made their share of mistakes feel imprisoned by responsibilities and must confront their shortcomings and problems. It's comforting to believe that hope and love will prevail in their case.".

The characters are picture perfect and the movie itself is breathtaking. The aura of the movie is so spectacular that it will inspire young directors out there to pick up their video cameras are start filming.An 80 minute movie about two lovable characters and what they have to say may sound boring. But the way it's done in Before Sunset will sweep this impression right off your feet. Julie and Ethan play two of the most honest and true characters I have ever seen they are known as Jesse and Celine. And while much of the credit must go to the characters themselves you musn't forget the actor and actress who played them.Julie is perfect as Celine. The young french actress is so natural in front of the camera. Definitely has potential. Ethan is also very very honest he seems so comfortable character that that you forget your watching a movie and not a homemade video.Both play with such honest expression and such trueness that they are so natural Before Sunset becomes no longer a movie. It feels as if you are eavesdropping on two extremely developed people. It's such an intimate environment that you never want to leave.Before Sunset... 9.90110".

SPOILERS FOLLOW The death of Celine's grandmother brings up two issues the role of chance and that of our responsibilities to ourselves. Jesse knows Celine missed their planned meeting in Vienna because her grandmother died. But this does not prevent his pained question on the boat something to the effect of 'Why weren't you there?' He is referring to rotten luck the dark side of fate that is capable of robbing us of what we most desire. What were the odds that her grandmother would have died within those few days? Tiny. But it led to them not meeting again.However Celine still chose to not meet Jesse. Yes her family may not have understood had she skipped the funeral. But life is for the living and her grandmother wouldn't have known if she hadn't been there. So Celine must take responsibility for the fact that their lives didn't include each other.Another precious dialog occurs when they discuss why they didn't exchange addresses or phone numbers nine years ago.

But she has been depressed since reading Jesse's book because she misses the kind of total intimacy they briefly shared and realizes there is no easy solution to this dilemma. One cannot simultaneously be intimate and distant and all relationships involve finding a compromise.Jesse's marriage is an ordinary one. He married his wife because she was smart pretty and pregnant and marriage is about commitment. But even on his way to the church he was thinking of Celine. Are we being warned of the danger of staying in a mediocre relationship? He says his wife and he are now like coworkers in a preschool a description that will ring true with many viewers. So is the lesson that you should throw caution to the wind and sacrifice all for someone who thrills your heart for a day? Before Sunset offers no such easy solution as Jesse and Celine admit they may have discovered they didn't like each other after all. As I see it the primary role of film is to give voice to emotions and aspects of life we all know to be true but are not acceptable to discuss in polite society. In this regard Before Sunset excels. I can't help but think that when Linklater Hawke and Delpy decided to do this brief film it was not about profit at allthey simply had some things they thought people should hear and this was their gift to the public.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before Sunrise was one of the most beautiful independent love stories of the 90's. Part of its appeal came from the open ending. We didn't know how the lives of these two young people would continue and what would become of them. The whole movie was like a snapshot that left the rest to our imagination. A sequel to such a story seemed to be unnecessary but apparently director Richard Linklater himself couldn't stop thinking about these two intriguing characters and had to envision their lives after this one fateful day in Vienna.Here it is now the most unlikely sequel I have ever seen Before Sunset  made not for money but for pure artistic purpose only. Much of the magic of part one could have been destroyed but somehow Linklater and his two main actors managed to pull it off. Before Sunset takes place nine years after Jesse and Celine first met and as soon as the movie starts you feel like you meet old friends you haven't seen in a long time. You know these people and immediately feel at home with them. I was afraid that Before Sunset might give answers to questions that shouldn't be answered in the first place. If Before Sunrise was a dream that two young people had then this movie could only be the rude awakening the confrontation with reality. And somehow it is just that. It's a bit disillusioning to hear that all did not turn out as well as one might have imagined. We learn that Jesse and Celine are not particularly happy in their lives and that they are not really the romantic persons they used to be nine years ago. The soothing thing to see however is that they are still here. They both have passed their 30th birthday they have jobs and their future is more or less decided but they're still longing for passion in their lives and as soon as they meet each other it's there again. They might have given up a lot of their dreams and beliefs but one thing remains true their feelings for each other. While they're talking it's like they turn back time and become the young hopeful people they once were again. I'm getting a bit carried away but that's the beauty of these two movies Sunrise and Sunset. The story sucks you in and you're not able to stop thinking about it for a long while.Another thing Before Sunset did it made me reflect on my own life. How have I changed in the past nine years? What has become of my dreams? Obviously I have gotten more cynical because at times I was irritated by Celine's talk about environmental problems and her emotional outbursts. It took me way longer than last time to bond with her character this time around.Anyway the performances by Hawke and Delpy are wonderful once again. Their acting is as natural as can be and thinking of Hawke's recent divorce in real life you wonder how much of his character in the movie is based on his own personal experiences.Unfortunately the movie is over way too soon. After about an hour you have already arrived at the final scene  a scene that is just amazing. It makes you hope that somehow everything will work out for Jesse and Celine and that maybe they will stay together this time. As part one Before Sunset doesn't have a definite ending though.It's sure nice to see that apparently Linklater cares about Jesse and Celine as much as I do and made such a good sequel. He could probably even make a third part. Before Sunset has convinced me that it could work.".

	schema:reviewBody "I will be the first to announce that I was not a huge fan of the original film. While I thought that it was interesting to see as well as an untapped concept in Hollywood I felt that the characters were too forced coupled with a very amateurish and repetitive moments. It was an average film that seemed to be lacking bits of the human element. It needed something more. At the time I couldn't put my finger on it but after seeing Before Sunset I could see what it was. Maturity. This may sound strange but I felt that Jesse and Celine were too perfect in the first film. They lacked connectiveness to the average person. I couldn't see myself in this situation. Perhaps if I would have seen the original film in 1995 instead of a couple of years ago it would have been closer but I just couldn't capture the moment. In Before Sunset I feel head over feet for both Jesse and Celine.They seemed to have grown and experienced a life that was all their own. They seemed more passionate more powerful and especially more human. From their first meeting in the bookstore until the finale in Celine's apartment I was fully immersed in their conversation. I wanted to know everything I could about both of them and I did. I loved hearing about Celine's passion for the environment and Jesse's distraught marriage. It brought these two characters out of the screen and into our lives. Whether it was a scripted story or if Hawke and Delpy were playing off each other it worked. I witnessed in this film two people who were made for each other. It was more obvious in this film than in the prior outing. What made this film work on such a higher level than the first were the actors. They have grown and emerged as two important commodities in the Hollywood community. This is probably Hawke's greatest performance in years. His relaxed actions made us feel relaxed around him yet quietly pushing for him to be closer to Celine. His pushy sexual advances seemed less forced and instead more like honest love. He looked and felt like a man that has been dreaming of this encounter all his life and it finally happened. You could see the excitement in his eyes to see Delpy again. It was more than just acting he put so much heart into this performance that it was clearly displayed for all to see. The same goes for Delpy. At the beginning of this film I didn't like her character. She seemed rough and rigid around the edges constantly giving off that feeling that she was harboring a secret that she didn't want Hawke to know. As her character grew in this film I understood why. She had a different life after the encounter than Hawke did. While he still longed for Celine in his heart he did move on. She longed for Jesse in her heart and to this day could not find anyone to replace his purity. I loved Celine much more in the sequel because she kept us guessing. Did she remember their night together? Did she really loose her grandmother or did she just not show up that day in Vienna? Was the song just for Jesse? So many questions left me wanting more and more and more. Finally I would like to say that Linklater is growing with his films and this was a crowning achievement for him. He powerfully and delicately built a sequel that was for superior than the original. He continued with a similar format as the first but gave us stronger characters and another beautiful city. The language in this film is intense. Listen to the words that come from Ethan and Julie they embody so much of our culture and our lives. There were moments when I felt they were speaking thoughts directly from my mind. Everything in this film was connected and worked to the fullest extent of cinematic possibility. Overall this was a brilliant film. Linklater captured the essence of these two heartstruck people and proved that it could be filmed. This is one of the ultimate love stories that will remain on your minds far after the film is over. The intimate final lines will continually reverberate as the best ever in a movie. This was a huge step up from the original and is one of the best films of the year. If you were not a fan of the Before Sunset I suggest that you check this out. It is a mature film that explores the power of love in a way that no other Hollywood film could. I would not be surprised if we saw the title of this film in the Oscar celebration this year. Check out this film to hear social commentary of our lives fall in love and especially to see the beauty of Paris. Grade  out of ".

	schema:headline " Suave sequel a new genre is born";
	schema:reviewBody "Before Sunset is one of those movies that look superficial romantic weepy crowdpleasing but really is original smart analytical and challenging. It stands by itself but is richer seen in relation to Before Sunrise made nine years earlier of which it is the sequel and besides that it's richer and subtler than the original. The characters and the actors are older more experienced and more sophisticated. It's got a documentary element reminiscent of Michael Apted's wonderful 7 Up 14 Up series. Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke who also stared in Before Sunrise don't have to pretend to be nine years older in this sequel they are. They're only thirtythree now but Hawke has the ravaged gauntness his breakup with Uma Thurman seems to have imposed on him. Delpy is more mature less angelic more businesslike but still beautiful. Before Sunset is a leaner film than Before Sunrise. It's realtime and without frills. Venues or backgrounds are simpler. Jesse and Cline largely just walk and talk. Hawke and Delpy are more accomplished actors less selfconscious people. The talk flows more effortlessly. The continuity of the scenes is a seamless tour de fource almost as if this were all a single take like Sokorov's Russian Ark. There isn't flirting or a developing attraction a growing physical intimacy as in Before Sunset because Jesse and Cline spend most of the film talking about that earlier meeting and how it has haunted them and dominated their lives. Gradually it comes out particularly during the car ride that leads to where Cline lives that her current relationship is limited and his marriage is largely sexless redeemed only by his adoration of his fouryearold son. She pretends not to remember that they made love that night in Vienna nine years before. Maybe that means their sudden passion never really was consummated because their affinity wasn't something one night's sex could fulfill. The premise is this Jesse has published a novel that's a bestseller in the US and he's doing a signing in Paris. Hawke's real life identity fits here since he's published several books. Suddenly as he's coming to the end of his talk Cline appears outside the window of the bookstore which is one every American in Paris knows Shakespeare  Company. He's supposed to go to the airport in a couple of hours but his bags are packed and a car is ready and he and Cline agree to go and talk. She leads him to a caf called Le Pure. This is real time but not real space the places where they go are far apart. Then they take a boat ride on the Seine finally they get in the car and wind up at Cline's apartment which turns out to be a lovely enclave where her neighbors are together outside having a party.A movie in real time consisting mostly of conversation is impossible to summarize it would take twenty pages. But it does emerge that both still think about each other a lot that meeting nine years before has remained important. The flame still burns bright. Jesse did go back to Vienna six months later in the station to meet Cline as they'd promised but her grandmother was buried on that day and she couldn't be there. Later he says that perhaps his dream of romantic love was shattered forever by her failure to appear. They rue the fact that they didn't exchange addresses or phone numbers. There's little touching or kissing but there doesn't have to be. It's obvious that this is a climactic reunion for both of them and the attraction is as strong as ever probably stronger  except that there are obstacles. They're not young and free any more. They have lives commitments involvements. . . What will happen? As the film ends its obvious Jessie is quite happily going to miss his plane. But while Linklater  Company keep us guessing the partial answer that comes is quite charming. Before Sunset is a superb sequel. It's touching but surprisingly unsentimental.

	onyx:emotionText "Before Sunset is one of those movies that look superficial romantic weepy crowdpleasing but really is original smart analytical and challenging. It stands by itself but is richer seen in relation to Before Sunrise made nine years earlier of which it is the sequel and besides that it's richer and subtler than the original. The characters and the actors are older more experienced and more sophisticated. It's got a documentary element reminiscent of Michael Apted's wonderful 7 Up 14 Up series. Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke who also stared in Before Sunrise don't have to pretend to be nine years older in this sequel they are. They're only thirtythree now but Hawke has the ravaged gauntness his breakup with Uma Thurman seems to have imposed on him. Delpy is more mature less angelic more businesslike but still beautiful. Before Sunset is a leaner film than Before Sunrise. It's realtime and without frills. Venues or backgrounds are simpler. Jesse and Cline largely just walk and talk. Hawke and Delpy are more accomplished actors less selfconscious people. The talk flows more effortlessly. The continuity of the scenes is a seamless tour de fource almost as if this were all a single take like Sokorov's Russian Ark. There isn't flirting or a developing attraction a growing physical intimacy as in Before Sunset because Jesse and Cline spend most of the film talking about that earlier meeting and how it has haunted them and dominated their lives. Gradually it comes out particularly during the car ride that leads to where Cline lives that her current relationship is limited and his marriage is largely sexless redeemed only by his adoration of his fouryearold son. She pretends not to remember that they made love that night in Vienna nine years before. Maybe that means their sudden passion never really was consummated because their affinity wasn't something one night's sex could fulfill. The premise is this Jesse has published a novel that's a bestseller in the US and he's doing a signing in Paris. Hawke's real life identity fits here since he's published several books. Suddenly as he's coming to the end of his talk Cline appears outside the window of the bookstore which is one every American in Paris knows Shakespeare  Company. He's supposed to go to the airport in a couple of hours but his bags are packed and a car is ready and he and Cline agree to go and talk. She leads him to a caf called Le Pure. This is real time but not real space the places where they go are far apart. Then they take a boat ride on the Seine finally they get in the car and wind up at Cline's apartment which turns out to be a lovely enclave where her neighbors are together outside having a party.A movie in real time consisting mostly of conversation is impossible to summarize it would take twenty pages. But it does emerge that both still think about each other a lot that meeting nine years before has remained important. The flame still burns bright. Jesse did go back to Vienna six months later in the station to meet Cline as they'd promised but her grandmother was buried on that day and she couldn't be there. Later he says that perhaps his dream of romantic love was shattered forever by her failure to appear. They rue the fact that they didn't exchange addresses or phone numbers. There's little touching or kissing but there doesn't have to be. It's obvious that this is a climactic reunion for both of them and the attraction is as strong as ever probably stronger  except that there are obstacles. They're not young and free any more. They have lives commitments involvements. . . What will happen? As the film ends its obvious Jessie is quite happily going to miss his plane. But while Linklater  Company keep us guessing the partial answer that comes is quite charming. Before Sunset is a superb sequel. It's touching but surprisingly unsentimental. And it's as graceful a piece of filmmaking as you could ever see with the gracefulness of art that conceals artifice. Richard Linklater is one of the most interesting younger American directors. His work is authentic and personal but has real range from the slacker movies through the romantic encounters of Delpy and Hawke and the tight theatrical drama Tape to the inspired philosophical musings and fresh use of animation of Waking Life and Hawke has been involved in four of Linklater's movies.

It's obvious also the audience would like another sequel and so would the actors. It's only a question of when. The inventive Richard Linklater has created a new genre the real time sequel.";

	schema:reviewBody "The first question I had before seeing Sunset in fact ever since I heard that Sunset was coming was Why?... Why mess with Sunrise given that it was such a great stand alone film... Would they live up to answering the what ifs? would the chemistry still be there? etc. etc. ... needless to say I think the answer is a resounding yes.The film picks up nine years after Jesse Ethan Hawke and Celine's Julie Delpy magical chance encounter in Vienna. This time around we find them in Paris where Jesse is wrapping up a European roadshow to promote his newly published bestseller about what else? that one special night. We find them now older and Ethan looks a bit more worse for wear than Julie more experienced more cynical with hearts that have hardened a bit over time in spite of  or perhaps due to  the whimsical possibilities of that fateful night nine years prior.From the outset of the film the director does a sublime job of drawing the viewer in with long easy takes as Jesse and Celine embark on a stroll from the bookstore to the caf  almost seems as if the first exchange is captured by one long uninterrupted take with no cuts though there are a couple. They ease into their exchange very comfortably. The questions and dialogue have the same familiar natural feel and tone and Hawke and Delpy both do an incredible job slipping into their earlier roles  the chemistry has not been lost. The playful sarcasm the sexual tension the flirting the wit the insecurities. All there.You can sense the longing that Jesse has has always had for Celine from the getgo. In fact my take even from Sunrise was that Jesse's attraction to Celine was always more stronger  almost as if he needed her. His vulnerability and ability to put it all out there  things that guys in general have such a hard time doing.The film moves on to the boat which echoes the scene from Sunrise where Jesse convinces her to take a ride with him. The journey symbolizes a trip to the past where Celine realizes that Jesse's life isn't the picture perfect life that she imagined i.e. the successful author the wife and the kid. She almost seems to want to know  needs to have  the affirmation that Jesse still carries a torch for her even though she and the viewer already should KNOW this  because WE know Jesse and his book about that one night is a tangible testament to that this is the one plot element which I found a bit annoying.The car scene is symbolic as well as they are in an enclosed space and need to deal with the things that are bottled up inside  claustrophobic yet no escaping it. They both reveal what they have both always wanted to hear from one another albeit in different ways and different circumstances that they have both been truly alone since they last left each other that fateful night in Vienna. The raw emotion the honesty  incredible moments.The culmination is the walk up the staircase to Celine's apartment in relative silence some things are better left unsaid  the choices the reasoning left unsaid. And then Celine's song which symbolizes a lot of things and demonstrates how much Jesse has meant to her even though she has a difficult time saying it in words.Nine years later they have of course grown into full adults with all the superficial trappings that come with that  a career relationships etc. But still they are both drawn to that one fateful night and the redemption for both people is that it was just as meaningful to each person as it was for the other for different reasons and for similar ones. The bittersweet anguish of having those memories and carrying that emotional baggage over that time echoes even deeper in the respective voids in their lives as Celine puts it memories are a wonderful thing if you don't have to deal with the past  almost sums up that anguish. When people are young they worry about not becoming someone  but as they get older  everyone worries about not being WITH someone.In Sunset they are both vindicated in realizing that they did not waste the last nine years living as damaged emotionless zombies  that their chance encounter was a truly magical moment changing both of their lives that they were both incomplete without each other ok cue the corny music that they really do complete each other. The true beauty of Sunset is that it allows them to indulge in the luxury of what many people do not get the opportunity for a second chance at best and at worst an opportunity for some measure of closure.And so it fittingly ends with the viewer pondering yet again what happens now? which in retrospect is a much more hopeful and infinitely more enviable question to answer than what if? In sum a wonderful film  bravo.12 out of ".

Perhaps it is a bit like cooking use fresh and quality ingredients and you can make something great without a lot of unnecessary stuff. Unfortunately Hollywood just doesn't seem to have the ambition to make these type of movies anymore.In any event this is one of the few sequels that matches the intensity and integrity of the original. First it has many simple yet stylish and honest shots. Perhaps the Scorcese shot is used too much i.e. following the actors on a long walk without cutting a la Goodfellas kitchen scene but I don't think so because it makes sense in the context of the movie. Second many of the shots have interesting emotive effect. For instance towards the end of the movie after these lovers are fighting the clock because Ethan Hawke's character needs to catch a flight and are cruising down the river they are so engrossed in their conversation and the fact that they are trying to get so much out of the last few minutes they don't notice their ride is coming to an end. However we the viewer can see what the characters either don't see or don't want to see that the boat is crossing over the river to its destination and the departure no one wants to deal with. The viewer is given a wonderful sense of dread as the bank approaches in the background because we know what is going to happen when the ride ends and like the characters we don't want it to end either. Even if the film borrows heavily from other great movies e.g. My Dinner with Andre it is independent of those influences.Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke were great per usual. Making the dialogue ring true is difficult but they pull it off. As before they completely capture the nature of the intimate and friendly conversational style of friends or lovers that is normally edited out of most movies. When people talk things are not always sequential or rationale and unlike most movies this movie doesn't try and correct that. Not for a moment does the audience find themselves thinking that this is some sort of charade and no one would ever talk like that. The dialogue is intelligent and insightful but that is because the characters are intelligent and have a knack for being brutally honest with their thoughts and feelings.This is movie excellence and I'm glad some film makers are still trying to make art. Despite the romantic themes this isn't a date flick so be prepare to deal with the difficult and often unresolved issues of love and relationships that arise.".

Having enjoyed the first movie so much I was really looking forward to the sequel but was also feeling some trepidation. What if they made a mess of it? Fortunately when I finally got to see the film any concern was put to rest. Before Sunset is everything I wanted in a sequel. The characters had matured in a way that made sense. You could see how the young Jessie and Celine had come to be these thirtysomething people. There was no sickly sweet romantic perfection. These characters were clearly the product of real life effected by their decisions good or bad making compromises sometimes insecure a little scarred but still holding on to memories and dreams of perfect moments. They are still on a journey but no longer sure that their destination is the right one. Unsure whether they can change direction or even if they should but afraid of what will happen if they don't.While an obvious link to the first movie the title adds to that grown up feeling of fear that time might be running out. Before Sunset emphasises that feeling of something needing to be done before it its too late. Most people have a What if? somewhere in their past. You might not think about themit often but on some level you have a question. This movie lets the characters of Jessie and Celine explore their What if nine years later something most of us will never get to do. That that exploration is so satisfying for me as a movie goer taking a second look into their lives is a tribute to the Director and the two stars. It was obviously a great collaboration.I think the fact that Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy wrote with the Director makes this a wonderfully organic script. Both of the actors seem comfortable in the skins of their characters. They carry their baggage around Paris with them and the audience isn't insulted with the fantasy that their lives stopped when they parted. There were moments of casual lightness in the dialogue and also moments that left you raw with their honesty.Sometimes the ending of a movie is a foregone conclusion. You can mentally hear the romantic music rise before the opening credits have even finished. This movie was different. In the beginning I didn't know how the movie would end or how I wanted it to end. The romantic and the realist in me couldn't quite reconcile. When the end came it surprised me with its suddenness then stunned me with its perfection. I cannot remember seeing a movie whose ending so perfectly fit its story and its characters. The moment when Jessie laughed and acknowledged as much to himself as to Celine that he wouldn't be catching that plane was the perfect place to leave not finish their story. A moment more would have been too much a step towards schmaltz a compromise to the conventional. A moment less would have left us wandering forever in the What If. I am so grateful that having found the perfect moment they had the vision to stay with it.".

When the end came it surprised me with its suddenness then stunned me with its perfection. I cannot remember seeing a movie whose ending so perfectly fit its story and its characters. The moment when Jessie laughed and acknowledged as much to himself as to Celine that he wouldn't be catching that plane was the perfect place to leave not finish their story. A moment more would have been too much a step towards schmaltz a compromise to the conventional. A moment less would have left us wandering forever in the What If. I am so grateful that having found the perfect moment they had the vision to stay with it.";

Is it just a coincidence that three best films of the year all deal with ability to connect with other people with meeting one's true love and losing it with memories that will not go away and with possibilities of second chances?Before Sunset is one of the best sequels ever made but it stays on its own. It is so perfect so simple so sublime so clever so romantic and so moving that it makes me happy to know that the films like that exist and there is hope that as characters get older we may witness their next meeting and conversations.Who would think that watching two people talking may be that fascinating? That's what the power of great dialog does. As much as I loved dialogs in Before Sunrise in this film they are even better  the characters are older wiser more interesting I'd say. Ten years is a long period in a human life  our characters are still young and attractive but they've gone through losses and changes disappointments and some sad realizations about life. It is privilege of the young age to hope that there'll be many people with whom you'll connect with. Later in life you realize it only happens a few times. If we only knew how to cherish and keep these unique and unforgettable connections. If we only knew that they were unique...Julie Delpy along with Ethan Hawke contributed to the screenplay and there is no doubt that their contributions made the characters interacting on the screen absolutely honest and believable.Julie Delpy gives one of the best performances of the year as Celine. She is amazing in showing mystery charm disappointments dreams and the dark sides of this woman. Her singing and Nina Simone's impersonation in the last scenes of Before Sunset are among the most charming and seductive ever  oh yes baby you will miss that plane. 9.510".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie with my husband. He is usually a diehard fan of action thrillers special effects and horror movies but he allows me to coax him into seeing a really thoughtful movie every once in a while. So this was my choice for the evening. Neither one of us had seen the first movie Before Sunrise although I knew of it by reputation. Well my husband absolutely loved the movie! He sat up and became totally engrossed in the story frequently patting my hand at intervals as he identified with the the characters in the story. He forgot about the dreadful uncomfortable movie seat. He let up a big sigh of disappointment when the credits came up... Personally I grew up in Paris France I came to the US for graduate studies and I had an environmental protection career for 20 years. So I could strongly identify with Celine a young woman of French origin with a patina of US graduate schooling and a career in environmental protection work. Her vulnerability shines through her modern chatterbox exterior. The acting is absolutely superb with the intimate extended conversations drawing us into the characters' lives. Certainly this movie can stand on its own. For Jesse and Celine the opportunity to pick up once more their romantic relationship is here! A smart couple would not let the moment pass. I doubt that they would just have a quick passionate affair... I think that the characters already know how lonely their souls can be without true love and commitment and they are emotionally ready to grasp this chance of a lifetime. They have been around long enough to know how rare their type of romantic feeling and connection can be. They will cherish their unique relationship and nurture it forever. My husband and I agreed that the movie could only be watched by couples of a certain age rather than young couples still searching for life's meaning. Only people who have lived through the throes of searching for a lifelong mate then living through the disappointments and joys of struggling relationships can recognize and appreciate what true love is and how important it is to go with one's heart and seize the moment. I am 48 years old and have a wonderful romantic relationship with my husband. We are each other's first and only love. Even so we have worked very hard to keep our marriage alive and mutually passionate. Over the past 2530 years both of us have noticed that satisfying relationships are very difficult once people hit their thirties and forties. We have noticed that many older couples never work out their differences and end up bitter and disappointed with life. Many acquaintances of our generation are divorced or still single never having experienced the sweetness and stability of a true romantic and committed relationship. Romance can be found all the time from fleeting moments to shortterm relationships. One sees it all over the place nowadays in TV shows and movies as well as in most modern relationships. However I would like to emphasize the lasting contentment that a loving commitment brings to one's soul. This is a rare and unique blessing that is missing from too many relationships nowadays and I find this immeasurably sad. This is a classic movie excellent story line and top of the line acting which goes into my list of top romantic movies of all times.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a review of Before Sunrise Before Sunset and Before Midnight three films by Richard Linklater.Released in 1995 Before Sunrise finds Ethan Hawke playing Jesse a young American who's travelling across Europe. On his way to Vienna he meets Celine Julie Delpy a young woman on her way to Paris. From the moment out duo lock eyes they're drawn to each other. They share a meal savouring the conversation more than the food and when they arrive in Vienna Jesse persuades Celine to keep him company wandering the streets. Thus begins an unforgettable screen romance.Like most of Linklater's films Sunrise is both dialogue heavy and boils down to a series of discussions or ruminations on life. Our duo talk incessantly touching upon subjects which range from language and reincarnation to sexuality and religion. Some of it is cringeworthy but for the most part Linklater's dialogue rings true. His banter is casual natural lacking in artifice and we at times feel like voyeurs eavesdropping on the sort of unimportant dialogue that most films shy away from. But the film is sexy as well. Celine and Jesse crackle with electricity and Linklater pays great attention to subtle shifts in body language. There's one scene where Jesse restrains himself from brushing away a stray lock of Celine's hair and another wonderful moment in a music listening booth where our duo nervously avoid eye contact. Elsewhere the film indulges in numerous long takes Linklater's gliding camera making the most of some gorgeous European locales as he dips in and out of romantic alcoves and cosy spaces. Linklater's long steadicam takes lend Sunrise an energy and intimacy that many of his other films lack.Released in 2004 Linklater's Before Sunset is a sequel to 1995's Sunrise. Equally good the film joins Celine and Jesse almost a decade later. Speaking to both the mind and the heart it finds our duo still obsessed with the night they first met fell in love and then somehow forgot to exchange contact details. This time around Jesse is in Paris to promote his new novel he's now a writer and it is Celine who tracks him down. Our couple then embark on an 80 minute chat the fact that Jesse must leave on an afternoon flight tightening like a hangman's noose around their conversations. The film then ends with a sequence which packs an emotional wallop.Hawke and Delpy so easily reinhabit these characters you have to wonder how much they're based on themselves. Simultaneously dopey and intelligent their conversations cycle through hilarity pain and misery. On the downside both characters are obviously the product of an artist Celine and Jesse are a couple of unashamed hipsters.Once again Linklater utilises long uninterrupted takes his gliding camera capturing vast chunks of banter and beautiful Parisian architecture. A few gentle flashbacks give glimpses of the original film but we don't really need them. This story stands on its own as a second chance to change fate. And as is typical of Linklater cinema's chief slackerphilosopher at least since the death of Hal Ashby Linklater has his film abstract several profound human truths placing them all in a series of dialogue driven vignettes. In a way Jesse and Celine become everyone and everything and at times represent more than themselves.Released in 2013 Before Mightnight finds Jesse and Celine as a committed couple. It's been eight years since we last saw them and they now live in Europe with twin girls of their own. Unsurprisingly the puppylove of the first two films has given way to middleaged weariness parental responsibility regret and pragmatism. The film is somber even pessimistic and Linklater cleverly introduces several other characters who represent life and love at different stages most notably an elderly writer and a young couple who conjure up images of Jesse and Celine's own romance almost two decades ago. If Sunset and Sunrise evoked Eric Rohmer or Bresson's Four Nights of a Dreamer Midnight recalls Abbas Kiarostami and Rossellini's Journey to Italy. Again dialogue heavy and again reliant on long takes the film is colder harder and more caustic than its predecessors. Our couple now view everything with scepticism and seem to exude a mood of grim acceptance and resignation. Most of the film's conversation revolve around death career disappointment transience the world ending or technology's negative influences the rants of a dying generation. At one point Celine even paints a dour image of the future in which society devolves into masturbation and death. In another Jesse insists that man is 99 percent automated and even goes so far as to denounce the concept of selfhood. Other conversations mock the way men measure accomplishments and of course male obsessions with the phallus. Elsewhere an elderly man explains that couples are never one person always two. Unlike its predecessors Midnight's sceptical of romance and even soulmates. After a wholly contrived argument in a hotel room a forced segment designed to set up another sequel our duo then seem to patch up their problems though you nevertheless suspect that this relationship has reached its end. Expect a possible fourth film to be about loneliness or separation.Early in Midnight Jesse reveals to us characters in his new book. One character lives in an unending wondrous present the very behaviour that brought Jesse and Celine together so many years ago whilst another views all experiences as being second hand. Jesse later talks about being lost in perception and introduces us to the patron saint of eyesight moments which exemplify Celie and Jesse's own anxieties. Both fantasise about different better futures and both are unsure of their partner's role in this desired world.910  Whilst as good as its predecessor Sunset may rub people the wrong way. The idea of successful selfreflexive middle class hipsters incessantly yapping will prove irksome to many.".

	schema:reviewBody "This followup to the cult hit 'Before Sunrise' takes place nine years after the original masterpiece. The wisdom of making a sequel nine years later to a film that doesn't really need a sequel is questionable. Or at least it would be if this film was anything less than brilliant. While the first film depicted an energetic and youthful romance between two young people this sequel is a more mature tale all about reflection. Before Sunset plays out almost as a tribute to the one night that the characters spent together in the first film and analyses what happened to them after those events. The film takes in themes of missed opportunity and the effect that time has on character. Just like the first film time is of the essence again and we follow Jesse now the writer of an international best seller who meets up with Celine again this time in Paris. The two take to the streets and begin discussing their relationship with each other with their respective partners and how life has been treating them in the last nine years.The tone of this film is very different to 'Before Sunrise' as the characters are now older and wiser and have lost some of that reckless stupidity that made the first film such a delight to observe. The anecdotes that the characters profess to one another takes a worldlier stance and this allows the characters to revel in their newfound maturity and also develop even further than they did in the original film. In my opinion this sequel is not as great as the first film. It comes down to personal preference in the end but I preferred the higher energy exchanges of Before Sunrise to the more mature reflections in this film. That's not to say that Celine and Jesse have completely matured into wellrounded adults on the contrary in fact the immature irresponsibility that the characters once revelled in still remains and this comes to a head at the film's conclusion.Amazingly enough in spite of the fact that it's nine years since their first outing as Celine and Jesse both Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply have managed to step back into their characters and have once again achieved a glovelike fit. Julie Deply in particular is incredible this time round. There's a scene in the back of a car when she explodes into a mass of insecurity that is one of the most heartfelt showings of releasing pentup emotions that I've ever seen on screen. Paris provides a new setting for the characters to walk around and it makes for one that is even better than Vienna was in Before Sunrise. The city is beautiful that's elementary but it's the way that Linklater captures the life going on around our characters that really makes it special. While the two talk people chat away on mobile phones walk their dogs and drive their cars and the life around the two characters creates a wonderful atmosphere.You really need to see Before Sunrise before seeing this follow up in order to appreciate the tones and the beauty of this picture. Of course you need to see both films anyway as they're essential viewing so what are you waiting for?".

That's not to say that Celine and Jesse have completely matured into wellrounded adults on the contrary in fact the immature irresponsibility that the characters once revelled in still remains and this comes to a head at the film's conclusion.Amazingly enough in spite of the fact that it's nine years since their first outing as Celine and Jesse both Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply have managed to step back into their characters and have once again achieved a glovelike fit. Julie Deply in particular is incredible this time round. There's a scene in the back of a car when she explodes into a mass of insecurity that is one of the most heartfelt showings of releasing pentup emotions that I've ever seen on screen. Paris provides a new setting for the characters to walk around and it makes for one that is even better than Vienna was in Before Sunrise. The city is beautiful that's elementary but it's the way that Linklater captures the life going on around our characters that really makes it special. While the two talk people chat away on mobile phones walk their dogs and drive their cars and the life around the two characters creates a wonderful atmosphere.You really need to see Before Sunrise before seeing this follow up in order to appreciate the tones and the beauty of this picture. Of course you need to see both films anyway as they're essential viewing so what are you waiting for?";

	schema:headline " what fascinates and interests almost works to annoy the viewer but Linklater does come closest to Bergman here";
	schema:reviewBody "Before Sunset provides us not so much a sequel as a continuing development in the lives of these characters who are starting to embody the neuroses and deeplyheld desires that neither want to admit to until it's at the most crucial and tragic of times. Jessie Ethan Hawke and Celine Julie Delpy who first met on a train in Vienna in 1994 meet again nine years later as Jessie has published a book which is based on that night they had together. He's in Paris they meet again and before he has his plane back to the states they talk and talk and talk and unlike in the first film there are no asides. It's just two people who at first talk about concerns that came up for them the first time if a bit more pragmatic what it is to have concern over the environment to live in the USA to be involved enough in a relationship. There's even a moment of dejavu where they talk about reincarnation and a respect for faith if not an embracing of it. But then we also get to see something much deeper in each side that Jessie's book and mere reappearance for Celine brings out a memory that has become hyperrealized and viceversa.Like Bergman's films in particular Scenes From a Marriage if not as wholly successful because of its short running time here Linklater provides us with characters who have no problem saying what's on their mind in the immediate sense anyway. Jessie is even more diggingin with his cynicism and wit and Celine with her opinions on the world at large family and on past relationships. But when it comes to getting at their connection it's very fragile and even unattainable because of each side's own flaws. If the two of them were happy to be certain there would be no movie but it's the characters' connection to that one night in Vienna and the second meeting that was supposed to take place six months later and never happened and how it cripples their own romantic lives that becomes very interesting yet shallow at the same time. Perhaps this is the best way to show how smart functional people become dysfunctional in their respective social stratospheres Jessie is married and with a kid but not very happy in it and Celine is in bad relationship after bad relationship but the singular glossy night of years past has become a bitter shrine of sorts amid their respective neuroses.Linklater shares that incredible Bergman quality of cutting past the already sharp intellect to the emotional matter of the parties even if it doesn't feel totally complete I want to see how their story might end however obvious it should and probably would be. One knows this could never work in real life aside from the practicalside of it all yet it's this that makes it all the more watchable. This plus the incredibly natural repore of the actors as Hawke and Delpy as to be expected seem like they aren't even on a script but are being filmed by Linklater on the fly as his camera captures the givenluscious scapes of Paris in afternoon and the dialog is still as fresh and inviting as ever. If it lacks anything from the first it's an greater sense of the possibility for romance since this time the sense of romance is entangled in loss and questions that Celine and Jessie want answered however conscious they want them answered or not. But as with the first one I still loved being around these two who can expound a mouthful on a subject that we all might talk about almost shockingly similar one bit I liked a lot was Celine's story of going to Poland and then in a slight cloud of romanticism.It ends ambiguous maybe too ambiguous as I found myself saying 'huh what' but it ties into what Jessie tells the reporters at the press conference early in the film one may take away something from this tale or someone else another but there it is clear as day. Before Sunset is a straightforward romance and proud of it being both straightforward in romantic connection and as sharp as anything you'd never find in your local cineplex. One of Linklater's best.".

Where he tried to impart introspective layers with Waking Life those layers were trite threads of fake profundities. Well never mind. Artists aren't required to be particularly smart  even about who they are and what they do.What is required is the ability to discover and convey something that resonates. Usually in films the resonance is a sort of nervous recognition in the characters and situation. Sometimes the manner of the film the nature of the world presented is enough to engage. Such is the value of Kieslowski  and how he managed Delpy.This film tries something different something commonly attempted and almost never achieved the direct drama of discovery between two people. This hosts the construction not in any story or setting or even situation though they are all employed in the service of the goals. Instead the whole thing revolves around the tentative motions toward intimacy between two people.Why this usually fails is because of the unwieldy mechanics. In order to seem real most reviewers call this film veristic the dramatic projection has to be hyperreal but not so much that it appears artificial. So how do you dramatically amplify lightly probing intimacies? Its all in the most subtle hesitations of the actors in that range beyond what really might happen and them forthrightly telling us what's happening.The construction is perfect all movies are about other movies. In this case we literally have the last chapter of the romance as a movie with movie values and memories. More those are romantically captured in a book that one character carries from the previous movie into this one. Thus all their discussion all their reluctances are about having the present film approach the previous one.I'm astonished at the perfection of the idea as astonished as I am about how well the two especially Delpy support it.

By contemporary standards it is still a story of a scandalous love affair with an interesting plot but certainly the movie is not pornographic or unusual Asylum is somewhat similar for example. It is as much a sexology of 1920's British social class mores as anything else.

While the GoGo Twins a nickname coined by Michael Winner probably couldn't care less about such fate this was clearly more of a concern for Just Jaeckin craving respect in the wake of topgrossing titillation. Alas it was not meant to be. Casting Dutch actress Sylvia Kristel who  like Jaeckin  could not escape the curse of EMMANUELLE in the lead role didn't help.

Initially intended to be made by the outrageous Ken Russell who wound up doing a disappointingly bland TV version with Joely Richardson and Sean Bean a decade later with Sarah Miles and Oliver Reed slated to portray the singleminded protagonists the eventual outcome was quickly written up as a sellout to crass commercialism by the kind of ivory tower print journalists who are now receiving their just desserts courtesy of the Internet. They did not pay attention to the faithful screenplay provided by Jaeckin regular Hammer scribe Christopher Wicking and American author Marc Behm who wrote The Eye of the Beholder filmed by Claude Miller as MORTELLE RANDONNEE and Stephan Elliott under the original title. They casually overlooked Shirley Russell's sumptuous costumes dating back to when it was still her husband's project no doubt and the splendid sets by a then fledgling designer named Anton Furst who had the last laugh garnering welldeserved kudos for his outstanding work on Neil Jordan's COMPANY OF WOLVES and Tim Burton's BATMAN. Pressed for praise they were willing to concede that the efforts of cinematographer Robert Fraisse Oscarnominated for JeanJacques Annaud's THE LOVER and composer Stanley Myers worthy of minor consideration though both were thought of as slumming it.Okay this is where I discard all pretense of professionalism and possibly where part of my respected readership's concerned take leave of my senses.

Stuck in a loveless marriage for which I don't blame my late father as they proved a poor match from the start by all accounts my mom relished the vicarious thrill the flicks provided her with. Needless to say we both adored this one so much in fact and I can't believe I'm making this public but you will soon find out I have no shame that we would call each other Connie and Ollie ever since until her untimely passing in February 2003.I developed a major crush on Nicholas Clay. He had caused a stirring in my loins playing Lancelot in John Boorman's magnificently overblown Excalibur but now the lid was off entirely. As a starryeyed gay teen I vowed to keep myself chaste until we could be together. Oh my resolve weakened  or was weakened for me  within a couple of weeks or so and I grew into the slut beloved by many to this very day !

Six and a half years since her death and still not a day goes by that she's not in my thoughts.

He plays Oliver Mellors the gamekeeper of an estate that is having an affair with the lady of the house. She is married but her husband cannot do his husbandly duties because he came back from World War 1 in a wheelchair. She is an upper class rich woman while he is considered low class and poor. She doesn't work and in the beginning tends to her husband until he decides to get a caretaker for himself. This leaves her with time on her hands to wander the grounds of her estate where she comes upon Mellors nude and bathing himself by the chicken coop. She lusts after him and they strike up a relationship although rocky at first. The have a passionate affair. I won't reveal the ending. I truly believe this is Nicholas Clay's finest work although he is probably known best as his role of Sir Lancelot in Excalibur he is naked in that movie too. I think this version is best. Lady Chatterley was made into another film in 1993 starring Joely Richardson and Sean Bean but no one compares to British hottie Nicholas Clay.".

	schema:headline " Lowbrow but oddly appealing version of the famed novel.";
	schema:reviewBody "One of literature's most controversial and secretly read novels ever is given a somewhat shallow but surprisingly faithful and opulent treatment in this dewy film. Kristel plays a young woman of high social standing whose husband Briant is badly wounded during WWI. He cannot walk nor more importantly make love and the passionless lonely world Kristel inhabits on their expansive but bleak estate begins to take its toll on her. Briant encourages her to take a lover an idea that she finds unpleasant until one day she chances upon the gamesman Clay giving himself a soapy wash behind his shelter. Fascinated by what she's seen yet aware that he is of another class and manner they embark on a tenuous friendship that eventually turns sexual. Kristel is physically reawakened and finds much solace and pleasure in Clay's company sexually and otherwise. However her relationship with Briant suffers when he suspects that she's done what he asked of her but with someone far beneath them in the social strata. An overbearing nurse Mitchell only adds to the estrangement taking on a maternal role with Briant and wavering between wishing happiness for Kristel while beginning to take her place at the same time. Kristel not someone who's ever been known for her incredible acting skills is decent here if a bit vacant at times. She's on hand primarily because of her exotic looks and her lack of modesty about performing nude. She's undeniably striking and does manage to perform several scenes with freshness and commitment. Briant overacts tremendously not aided at all by two very obnoxious eyebrows and plays his role with a lack of dimension. He's annoying nasty and condescending practically all the time taking most of the chances for compassion or empathy away. Clay is wonderful. Like Kristel he was never one to shy away from abandoning his clothes but he also presents a multifaceted character one who knows his station in life but can't help but wish for more. His bathing scene is a real eyeopener. Mitchell is hard to read perhaps intentionally but certainly excels at playing the controlling and overstepping nursemaid aspects of her character. Considering the director and producers and cast this could have been a lot worse. A decent atmosphere is established thanks to a truly magnificent house filled with many lovely furnishings and with sizeable grounds. Considering the budget the makers accomplished a lot with a little. Costuming leans toward the impressive too with only an occasional misstep Lady Chatterley in pants?! Though the film does away with some of the supporting characters of the novel and glosses over some of the deeper aspects of it this remains a pretty valid representation of the story and manages at least a bit of suspense for those who don't know the outcome. This was a staple of pay cable television in the early 80's affording many folks to pore over the attractive bodies of it's stars in their extended and frank love scenes.".

Instead of smoldering with forbidden passion she seems listless and uninterested in the affair that is central to the story's power. Nicholas Clay also seems unconvincing as the virile but coarse Mellors. Why he would be the object of romantic fascination for any woman of class seems a mystery not worth investigating. The pastoral look of the film is pretty nice plus it also features good period detail and costumes but the script is extremely weak and the dramatics  especially among the supporting performances  are just not sharp enough to properly drive a story of class betrayal and social scandal.

The acting of the husband was a bit stiff and he occasionally seemed to be reading his lines. The twists along the way kept my wife intrigued and the love scenes did not offend her as they were done in good taste. The plot is not terribly difficult to predict but interesting to watch unfold just the same. A good movie to get the romantic fires ignited for a good evening of love making.".

	schema:reviewBody "I read one of D. H. Lawrence's novel in university as part of an English course I was taking and I found it utterly boring and not making me want to seek out his other works. The only reason why I rented this Lawrence adaptation was that it was produced by famed schlockmeisters Menahem Golan and Yorman Globus who made some really entertaining trashy movies. This was one of the few times they tried for respectability though they chose a story that could also be mined for exploitation material.But the movie fails both at its serious attempts and with its attempts at exploitation. The script has too many faults that distance the audience. The setup of the situation at the beginning of the movie goes so fast that there's no time to set up characters and make us see what they are feeling. This flaw with the characters continues as the movie goes on and I was not sure why many times characters did what they did. Oddly there are also a number of scenes that serve no purpose  if they had eliminated those scenes and used the extra few minutes to pump up the characters I'm pretty sure the movie would be a lot better.As for the erotic element of the movie it's not there. Even for 1981 the idea of taking a lover must have seem old hat to audiences. The nudity and sex in the movie is not the least bit erotic despite full frontal nudity and explicit sex scenes. Some of this might be blamed on the below average production values  the movie has a murky look throughout and there's not much effort to beef up the backgrounds with extras or anything that might have taken time and expense to make.Even if you are a GolanGlobus fanatic like I am odds are you'll find this as dreary as I did.".

The film for a British erotic flick of the time has relatively high production values and a slew of classy but less wellknown British character actors in the supporting roles.

The upper class life of the Chatterleys is well delineated there's some breathtaking tracking shots around the Chatterley mansion and the war sequence is convincing. The first sighting of by Lady Chatterley of Mellors naked and soaping himself by his hut is sexy and ripe. But once the affair begins and the two of them are making love on a regular basis the film's pace slows down and its dramatic level evens to a flatline. There's some intriguing cutting between the lovers in each others arms and the crippled Lord Chatterley languishing in his bed but it's all a bit too tastefully done  Lawrence's earthy eroticism isn't captured nor is the script wise to have lost his salty filthy dialogue. What you get is a sort of motion picture version of highclass erotic prints.Some of Lawrence's diagnosis of the crippled state of the British aristocratic class after WW1 remains intact and the film is helped by a very fine performance indeed by Shane Briant as the emasculated Lord. Kristel is never less than watchable as milady and Nicolas Clay has the looks to suggest Mellors' virility even though the director never lets him exercise it. The last quarter of the film seems rushed and a promising sojourn to France only scratches the surface of what might have been a Sirklike interlude of realisation that the protagonist's class and social circle offers nothing that a virile man can bring her.Best filed under intriguing failures artistically and to Cannon Films' chagrin at the box office.".

And deliver she did. I read this book years later and just watched the DVD I had bought for a couple of dollars. It follows an abbreviated plotline from the book but barely captures the characters in their full breadth. The actors that were chosen were almost perfect for their characters and I wish there was a little more time for development. The location was beautiful as well as the twenties costumes. The film should be attacked as a literary work of art not so much sex although sex was an important part of it. I would deem this version of Lady Chatterley's Lover as women's erotica. That's how it served me. 1981 and the era of the seventies seemed to produce lots of soft core frontal nudity and simulated sex and in viewing it again I had to adjust my thinking to that era. The British miniseries made for Masterpiece Theater seemed to capture the spirit a bit more. I see there are other versions but the best way to view this story is to read the uncensored version.".

Lady Chatterley Sylvia Kristel in particular is obsessed with her own body. Partially nude she stares vainly at herself in a mirror. For his part the groundskeeper Nicholas Clay likes to do outdoor chores with his shirt off convenient for any sensual woman who just happens to be strolling by. It's all rather obvious and superficial. Only toward the end does the story actually get interesting.I do like the majestic musical score. And the cinematography isn't bad at all with some good outdoor scenes in the fog. There are lots of closeup camera shots and quite a few extreme closeups. This film is obviously a Sylvia Kristel vehicle. But her acting is stilted and selfconscious.Maybe the film was sexually daring in its time.

The script is very underwritten and banal it is difficult to take seriously anything that the actors say while the storytelling is really dull with nonexistent passion in the first half the main reason being that while the basic story of the book is intact the prose characterisations and passionmostly are barely scarce.

	schema:reviewBody "D. H. Lawrence's tale of class distinctions and nature versus culture turned into soft porn but pretty good soft porn as these things go.Sylvia Krystel is Constance Chatterly whose wealthy titled husband Shane Briant returns to their vast estate from World War I only half a man confined to a wheelchair but cheerful enough about it. Krystel spends her time taking care of him until Briant brings in a toughminded elderly nurse. This leaves Krystel out in the cold and terribly bored.Briant is insensitive to her needs but he does want an heir a future baronet and the couple more or less agree that she can take a lover who will impregnate her. So she does. But she picks the wrong guy.It takes no more than a glimpse of Mellors Nicholas Clay the caretaker washing himself in the nude to put her in a lather and soon they're rolling around in the hay. Briant figures out that something is either up or in the offing and becomes petulant. Mellors is declasse. I mean the man is some kind of GARDENER or something always needing a shave dirt under his fingernails. Not the proper father of a future baronet. He humiliates Mellors by ordering him around and making him undertake unpleasant tasks.Anyway the wind up Krystal becomes pregnant and runs away to Canada with the caretaker while under the tutelage of the nurse Briant becomes strong enough to walk on crutches and the pair of them live happily together in their mansion.Lawrence's novel was something of a cause celebre when first published in the USA. All that sex. The movie has captured all that sex including a notorious purple passage involving wildflowers and pubic hair. It's the equal of the earth moved as a description of orgasm in Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls. It's quite a laugh getter today. I don't know exactly how realistic the sex scenes in the film are. One instance of simulated coitus involves Krystel sitting on the rough bark of a fallen elm which I can't imagine to be anyone's idea of a good time.It's not a junky movie though. The photography and the location shooting are well done and a good deal of attention is paid to wardrobe and makeup. You won't find any fashion statement here unlike the pastel splendor of Robert Redford's The Great Gatsby. My God these clothes are ugly here right down to the underwear. People wrap themselves up like mummies. And Krystel doesn't wear dainty slippers like Daisy.

Who for instance can better capture the crunch of gravel beneath shoes? With only one or two sentences Lawrence was able to project volumes of information about a place or person. The class distinctions that obsessed Lawrence and the people in his story were roughly the same as those that captivated F. Scott Fitzgerald in The Great Gatsby. They don't mean as much to us today.

And I suppose that Briant's going to war and being horribly wounded was a cultural act while stringing wildflowers in your lover's pundendum was a natural one but the fact is that all through the movie I kept thinking about how much Briant's character had sacrificed for his country while Mellors was petting his doves in the gamekeeper's cottage.

	onyx:emotionText "D. H. Lawrence's tale of class distinctions and nature versus culture turned into soft porn but pretty good soft porn as these things go.Sylvia Krystel is Constance Chatterly whose wealthy titled husband Shane Briant returns to their vast estate from World War I only half a man confined to a wheelchair but cheerful enough about it. Krystel spends her time taking care of him until Briant brings in a toughminded elderly nurse. This leaves Krystel out in the cold and terribly bored.Briant is insensitive to her needs but he does want an heir a future baronet and the couple more or less agree that she can take a lover who will impregnate her. So she does. But she picks the wrong guy.It takes no more than a glimpse of Mellors Nicholas Clay the caretaker washing himself in the nude to put her in a lather and soon they're rolling around in the hay. Briant figures out that something is either up or in the offing and becomes petulant. Mellors is declasse. I mean the man is some kind of GARDENER or something always needing a shave dirt under his fingernails. Not the proper father of a future baronet. He humiliates Mellors by ordering him around and making him undertake unpleasant tasks.Anyway the wind up Krystal becomes pregnant and runs away to Canada with the caretaker while under the tutelage of the nurse Briant becomes strong enough to walk on crutches and the pair of them live happily together in their mansion.Lawrence's novel was something of a cause celebre when first published in the USA. All that sex. The movie has captured all that sex including a notorious purple passage involving wildflowers and pubic hair. It's the equal of the earth moved as a description of orgasm in Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls. It's quite a laugh getter today. I don't know exactly how realistic the sex scenes in the film are. One instance of simulated coitus involves Krystel sitting on the rough bark of a fallen elm which I can't imagine to be anyone's idea of a good time.It's not a junky movie though. The photography and the location shooting are well done and a good deal of attention is paid to wardrobe and makeup. You won't find any fashion statement here unlike the pastel splendor of Robert Redford's The Great Gatsby. My God these clothes are ugly here right down to the underwear. People wrap themselves up like mummies. And Krystel doesn't wear dainty slippers like Daisy.

It just comes down to everything she does. I really found her performance mature and very sexy here where she really held her own and never lacked. Clay Lady Chatterly's husband is a paraplegic and IMPOTENT so our delicious Ms Chatterly must seek sexual fulfillment somewhere else so why not the estate's fit stud lumberjack. This really brings out his angry and enraged side something I see in these scenarios from other films one I previously mentioned. Another example but out of this scenario where I was drawing on the very erotically charged. Cage pic Zandalee.

	schema:reviewBody "Nekromantik is an authentic piece of horror. And that is what many people feel about this work. Some people wish had not cross paths with something so dark. That is true horror.Nekromantik is very hardcore and graphic. There are only a few movies that can be in the same league in its genre. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre the first one and original had demented characters that finally are not punished like they always are in moral guided horror films. Cannibal Holocaust has a graphic approach similar to this film. Some moments of the first Hellraiser it included a romantic scene of a woman and a resurrected corpse could be compared. But Nekromantik dares to go further than those movies with less money there's no moral view over the necrophilia... it is treated lightly like ordinary everyday stuff. I don't want to spoil anything but I suggest you to pay attention to the last scene... if that's not completely disgusting I don't know where is the disgusting stuff in cinema. Buttgereit like many filmmakers used horrifying and gory elements in his first steps. In most cases when an amateur director does 'zombie movie' intentionally or unintentionally the final result is a comedy. Even if they want to be taken seriously in most cases people just laugh at what they see. This author made a comedy that most people feel it's not funny at all. Maybe it's because of the particular German sense of humor or something else. Buttgereit's cinema is shocking and bizarre. Those are two compliments that Buttgereit achieved with Blood many blood and guts also sweat and tears. But I don't want to be misunderstood I challenge people to see this movie because it's ground breaking even today not like the typical 'Screamclones' out there.".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't stumble on this film by accident in fact I purposefully sought it out and I'm glad I did  but only because now I'm not searching any more. I feel like a bit of a hypocrite for criticising this film for being sick given that many of my favourite movies can be described with the same adjective but Nekromantik crosses a line and it doesn't even do it in a way that's interesting. The movie features quite a few brutal and sickening scenes but most of them have no relevance to the plot and even the ones that do don't serve the film in the way that they should. Nekromantik looks like a trashy piece of crap and make no mistake that's exactly what it is. As if the title doesn't give it away the plot handles the theme of necrophilia. We follow a sewage worker who brings home body parts for his twisted girlfriend. One day he manages to lay his hands on a full corpse and unlike most women she is delighted with this present. We then get 'treated' to seeing the three of them ... in bed together etc etc and it's all very difficult to enjoy.The film obviously wants to examine love but it just continually fails. No points are made even the fact that the girlfriend ends up choosing the corpse over her man isn't explored at all. It would seem that the sick pervert who wrote it had a great idea about making a film that handles two of life's most important elements namely love and death but had no idea of exactly how he would go about doing it. The result is this film. Necrophilia is undoubtedly a perverse subject but it's also one that automatically generates intrigue yet this film also fails even in that respect. The whole plot line is just too silly to take seriously and even if you look at the movie as a black comedy it still fails because it's not funny. The necrophilia element isn't even the most shocking thing about this movie the most shocking things are the animal violence pointless and the fact that some people actually like this film! If I really had to come up with positive things about Nekromantik I would say that I liked the score and the fact that it's not on for long is a very good thing. On the whole this movie is a piece of garbage  don't waste your time! Wayward cinema has produced far more satisfying goreporn flicks than this.".

Even the scenes supposed to shock you are really that shocking. Maybe because its hard to tell what's going on since the director filmed in soft focus and constantly layered the edits to give a hallucinogenic effect. I found it all kind of dull and pointless. Sorry screwing a corpse just isn't my idea of a good time.".

As if the nauseating sight of someone getting busy with a putrefying corpse isn't bad enough the film also throws in a spot of animal death both fake and real full frontal male nudity some random urination the murder and rape of a prostitute in that order! a wonderfully bloody decapitation by shovel and a final scene that has to rank as one of the most unforgettably repulsive acts ever committed to film.Technically speaking Buttgereit's film is a little rough around the edges but he tells his tale with confidence even experimenting with some artsyfartsy visual effects during a love scene between Betty and the body and throwing in a hilarious dream sequence that is reminiscent of avantgarde French cinema albeit with a severed head and gut slinging. Nekromantik also benefits immensely from a surprisingly good score by Daktari Lorenz Hermann Kopp and John Boy Walton which lends certain scenes a strange sense of beauty despite the repugnant visuals.Needless to say this isn't a film to share with the whole family unless your family happens to have furniture made from human bones and an extra large freezer out back in which case share away on the other hand fans of low budget German splatter extreme horror or transgressive cinema in general should consider the film essential viewing.".

	schema:headline " Incredible independent film from German film maker duo Jrg Buttgereit and Franz Rodenkirchen";
	schema:reviewBody "Nekromantik 1987 is written by Franz Rodenkirchen and directed by Jrg Buttgereit and I think this is their first feature film after couple of short films. This German classic yeah! tells us a fascinating story of a couple who has strange emptiness in their affair and death seems to appeal to them and since the male can get some dead bodies or body parts I'm not sure what is his job but at least he goes to car crash scenes in his work etc. he starts to take them home and soon the couple finds their real love....and it is pretty rotten and decayed love! Scenes of necrophilia are something that will repulse even jaded cinema fanatic because necrophilia as a thing is very disgusting and taboo as a subject matter. But this little film makes ugly things look incredibly beautiful with the power and magic of cinema.This film shows exactly how talented film maker can show things in personal way and show disgusting things beautifully and with a taste. This film is not ugly or disgusting but to say that I think one has to be pretty tolerating and difficult art loving viewer since this is not easy to view if one cannot interpret movies. The scenes of necrophilia are shot gorgeously with different techniques and the most important element in Nekromantik is again the music the unimaginable and hypnotic music. The music is among the most beautiful and gentle and very dark and ominous at times I've ever seen and it is as touching as Riz Ortolani's music in Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust Italy 1979 one of the most important films ever. Nekromantik would not be Nekromantik without the music. Totally unforgettable element.The infamous rabbit killing scene is often judged and not accepted but the fact is that the film makers did NOT kill the creature they only shoot the farmer doing his job and the rabbit would've died without the film too because we eat meat everyday with or without Nekromantik in existence. And this is the meaning of the scene and we definitely should realize that eating meat means always that an animal has given its life that we can eat its juicy meat. I love animals very much but still I eat meat because I know that they are the only source to get it and in my opinion the rule of nature is that way that human beings are meant to use the resources of nature but as we know the nature of human beings do we really deserve all this from the nature as we exploit and destroy it every minute? The movie's end is unforgettable and also the most shocking scene in the film but so releasing and gives the final relief and salvation to the protagonist and it is very beautiful scene with the music again as a strong element. This is something that is never before seen on screen and it is way too much for many. There are also other over the top gore and splatter scenes in the film and they are the ones that alienate the casual viewer. The disturbing snuff scene where a woman is sliced is a part of the interpretation about exploiting Nature or other human beings which I explained in the rabbit paragraph above. Do we have any right to live or be in existence not to mention eating and consuming the sources of Nature since all this trash and sick entertainment exists and has its consumers? And this film itself is NOT that kind of a sick trashexploitation as many consider Nekromantik is a very challenging and symbolic piece of underground cinema which has many things bubbling under its surface and the movie's core has to be found in order to understand it.Nekromantik is one of the most noteworthy marginal and independent films I know and definitely one of the most unforgettable experiences in the field of cinema. I have seen this two times now first on a videocassette and then in one festival in big screen! That latter was without a doubt very unforgettable experience and this is rarely seen in the big screen. So I recommend Nekromantik and other Buttgereit's films to the fans of intelligent and wonderful looking nonmainstream cinema and the cinema that has thousands of things to say and give to the interpreting viewer.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "PLOTThis German flick was made by Jorg Buttgereit back in 1987. Later Buttgereit also directed Necromantik 2' and Schramm'. Necromantik is a simple story about a guy named Robert  who works in a morgue  and as we later get to know  is a necrophile. When an accident or a murder occurs   Robert and his mates among his mates is the director himself  J. Buttgereit come to take away the corpse. Robert himself looks like a really nice guy  but something is bothering him throughout the whole movie  and we never get to know what is it. After work Robert comes home where he lives with his girlfriend. In his small flat  there are lots of jars filled with various human organs  and blood. The atmosphere in the flat is very chilling and gloomy. One day some guy gets drowned and Robert comes to take away the corpse. Instead of taking it to the morgue  he takes it home. His girlfriend gets very exited about the corpse and later we see Robert his girlfriend and the corpse having sex all together. Later when Robert is fired  he returns home and finds out that his girlfriend left him and ran away.with the corpse. As the letter says  which Robert finds at home  the corpse is a better lover..  After loosing his job and his girl  Robert slowly starts loosing his mindCOMMENTSNecromantik is not exactly a horror movie. This movie shows how far can a man go if he looses what he really cares about. In Necromantik this process is shown in a really bizarre manner and  I think J. Buttgereit did a great job directing it. The movie itself is really violent  it has some animal violence which I really hate and one of the most incredible final scenes I've ever seen. Music creates a really gloomy atmosphere but in my opinion music is a bit boring. Acting is poor but while watching  you don't think about it. Maybe its because this flick has some moments that can really disturb.Movie is shot with a hand camera  so it looks like Buttgereit was filming it in his own yard. But being a nonbudget' flick  Necromantik is directed really good. OVERALLI would recommend this sick flick to Jorg Buttgereit's fans  or to Japan Shock Video fans. This flick is German so don't get disgusted by what is shown here  if you get the Uncut version. For those who cant watch animal violence   please avoid.".

Later when Robert is fired  he returns home and finds out that his girlfriend left him and ran away.with the corpse. As the letter says  which Robert finds at home  the corpse is a better lover..  After loosing his job and his girl  Robert slowly starts loosing his mindCOMMENTSNecromantik is not exactly a horror movie. This movie shows how far can a man go if he looses what he really cares about. In Necromantik this process is shown in a really bizarre manner and  I think J. Buttgereit did a great job directing it. The movie itself is really violent  it has some animal violence which I really hate and one of the most incredible final scenes I've ever seen. Music creates a really gloomy atmosphere but in my opinion music is a bit boring. Acting is poor but while watching  you don't think about it. Maybe its because this flick has some moments that can really disturb.Movie is shot with a hand camera  so it looks like Buttgereit was filming it in his own yard. But being a nonbudget' flick  Necromantik is directed really good. OVERALLI would recommend this sick flick to Jorg Buttgereit's fans  or to Japan Shock Video fans. This flick is German so don't get disgusted by what is shown here  if you get the Uncut version. For those who cant watch animal violence   please avoid.";

I hope he manages to get distribution for a wide release with this one but there's no telling where that'll end up. We saw it as a premiere at SXSW 2002 in front of a general audience and it got a great response from the crowd for both the dramatic elements and the moments of humor.

	schema:reviewBody "'Feardotcom' was filmed in Luxembourg apparently standing in for New York I think. and hasn't been officially released yet. I saw it as one of the featured films during the Luxembourg International Film festival. Cinenygma  One of the executive producers who introduced the film said it wasn't 100 finished yet and that even the title might change. However since every second of the film was even more tortuous than the depravities depicted on the screen I believe no amount of focus groups or editing could save this film. I'd say 'straight to video' but that would be a major waste of plastic and cardboard. I suppose if they market it as a parody they might salvage the cost of um the catering during the film.Stephen Dorff plays a hardboiled detective who's haunted by that one case that was never solved. You know he's haunted because he walks around with a 3 day growth of beard. Which stays at the same length the whole film even though the film covers quite a few days it was hard tell nothing was very coherent And guess what! His old nemesis from the unsolved case is killing again! Oh boy! And since we now have new cases to solve AND they're dying from what looks to be a virus we need to bring in the woman scientist and nominal love interest Natascha McElhone  who displayed quite amply in 'The Truman Show' that she can't act. She must work cheap or maybe they needed someone to make Dorff look good. We know she's a scientist because she wears glasses. And just for grins we get Jeffrey Coombs as Dorff's partner whose main role appears to be running around spouting nonsequiturs. Speaking of which there was a writer listed for the film but I'd bet a Ben Franklin that they were making up the dialog as they went along and probably for a different film. It's too bad 'Deep Space 9' went off the air  it might have prevented Coombs from getting caught up in this travesty. And there's Stephen Rea as the mad scientist looking vaguely like Geoffrey Rush mad scientist character in 'Mystery Men.' Now I could have sworn Rea could act so maybe they are two of them? Amazingly a director is also listed but from what I can tell they pretty much turned on the camera came back later took the film to the editing room forgot to turn on the lights and just started editing. That would explain a lot.And what of the plot? Ha! There isn't one! Well OK maybe a little one. I think the deal was that the girl killed in the unsolved case somehow inhabited the internet and is killing people if they log on to the mad scientist's site where HE tortures women until they beg him to kill them  and all for 9.95! but just for grins they the unfortunates who log into fear.com only die after 48 hours because I think that's how long it took her to be killed But I think you'd need a broadband connection because somehow when you login this girl living in the internet puts a hex on you which involves you falling off your chair and eventually trashing your apartment and nose bleeds and um dying from the fright of your worst fear like being cast in this movie and I really don't think that could happen with a dial up connection. Um anyway she's going to keep on killing people unless the mad scientist is caught. And her body is found too. I mean they threw that bit in there about finding the body but then when it was found it didn't count for anything! Now doesn't that just bite. Damn fickle internet ghosts.SPOILERActually this whole film was a spoiler at least it smelled spoiled to me. Anyway  the final scene where Dorff and the McElhone rush into the mad scientist's lair located in an abandoned steel mill or nuclear plant  the film couldn't make up it's mind what it was  it identified it as both during different scenes in the film and stop him only seconds before he's going to kill his latest victim had me rolling in the aisle with laughter. It was just like watching an old horror film from the 30's or 40's. Maniacal laughter bugeyed expressions of madness flashing lights tilted camera angles. So they manage to save the girl but then the mad scientist shoots Dorff and then stabs McElhone then Dorff grabs a keyboard and logs into feardot.com which drives the mad scientist so mad  he dies from fear! Then Dorff dies and McElhone who was in love with Dorff oh did I leave that part out?  apparently they fell madly in love in some 30 second scene earlier in the film  some real indepth character development going on here. sort of cries over his body but um somehow she's no longer stabbed! Maybe it was her Multivitamin.END OF SPOILERSo um in conclusion  I can't imagine any changes to this film possibly making it watchable. I'll be surprised if gets released at all though the executive producer said Warner Bros had picked it up for US distribution and ColumbiaTriStar for the rest of the world. Let's hope they come to their senses. You have been warned. Go watch 'Donnie Darko' instead!".

So we rented the DVD from a video store. We were delayed from seeing it yet again you'd think we would've taken the hint and left the DVD disc at my house. After getting down to watching the movie I was excited and ready to be scared. We'd watched The Ring a few nights ago and it easily gave me nightmares. But despite our hopes that this movie would do the same job we were sorely let down. The movie had a strong start even if it was confusing. A man is hit by a subway train when he sees a little girl on the tracks. Why did he jump back out in front of the train? Then you meet the male lead and his associate in the police department. Why do they both sound like the stupidest cops you'll ever see? The female lead knew more about policing than the both of them. Most of the other actors sounded like they were reading off cue cards and the plot quickly because unbeliveable ah yes I'll let my sick daughter play in an old steel mill even if she's supposively afraid of sharp things and on top of that how did Terry know to listen to the half blind old lady in the mill? and let's not forget to get to the site its feardotcom.com not fear.com. the doctor got ripped off on his site By this point in the movie I begged my boyfriend to let it keep playing just to see if it saved itself. It didn't. The ending was cliche' and the special effects when they killed the doctor were the only positive things in the movie. The basic story for FearDotCom was a creative one...but poorly executed no pun intended. Save yourself a rental and go see something else. You'll thank yourself later.".

I do not know if I blindly bought it was given it as a gift or if someone lent it to me and I just forgot to return it but whatever way it is in there now. I watched it quite some time ago expecting it to be decent enough entertaining at least because I really liked the tagline and the premise seemed fun though I have learned to stay away from a lot of technology killing horrors over the past few years now and I remembered before I watched it again recently that I hated it the first time I watched it a lot and it was very negatively reviewed as well. Watching it again confirmed my feelings.The film itself is just entirely ridiculous and absurd from beginning to end with a horrible storyline and lame performances and thrills. There is zero to none interesting scenes that make the viewer feel creeped out or enticed in any way and the whole film is a joke within itself. I especially hated the ludicrous characters and twists and also the way the story was executed in a poor manner not being able to stay with one main idea for too long that it is infuriatingly annoying to watch the plot what plot there is at least unfold. The movie resembles a little diddy of a film titled RinguThe Ring an awful lot though both of those renditions are spectacular and this pales entirely in comparison and even though there are some nice settings in this movie that is really and truly the only plus side to it.There are many noticeable errors and plot holes the dialogue is for our inconvenience not as laughable as one would hope but corny enough to get a few giggles now and then especially some of the deliverances from the female lead and the climaxending is not anywhere near heartracing or interest sparking just bland and hardly tolerable. There are many useless scenes of violence that have no importance whatsoever except to try and get a rise in the viewer which was not accomplished in my situation and a lot of material is just thrown in there randomly which goes back to how I stated it is poorly executed and extremely mediocre. My summary pretty much warns anyone and everyone away from this movie unless you are a masochist and want to be put through this pain.".

The movie resembles a little diddy of a film titled RinguThe Ring an awful lot though both of those renditions are spectacular and this pales entirely in comparison and even though there are some nice settings in this movie that is really and truly the only plus side to it.There are many noticeable errors and plot holes the dialogue is for our inconvenience not as laughable as one would hope but corny enough to get a few giggles now and then especially some of the deliverances from the female lead and the climaxending is not anywhere near heartracing or interest sparking just bland and hardly tolerable. There are many useless scenes of violence that have no importance whatsoever except to try and get a rise in the viewer which was not accomplished in my situation and a lot of material is just thrown in there randomly which goes back to how I stated it is poorly executed and extremely mediocre. My summary pretty much warns anyone and everyone away from this movie unless you are a masochist and want to be put through this pain.";

	schema:headline " Utter Nonsense";
	schema:reviewBody "Having watched this last night on SyFy without having heard of the movie prior to watching it I am SHOCKED to find out based on the IMDb info that FearDotCom was a real movie. By 'real movie' I mean a movie released in theaters that actually had a big budget 45 mil? What was that spent on?! Certainly not the movie I watched and that people paid money to see it because I just assumed based on the quality of the film as well as where I watched it that it was one of those low budget poorly acted nonsensically over the top made for TV SyFy original movies. I am honestly taken aback by the fact that this wasn't  I don't even know what to say. It wasn't even reminiscent of a good original SyFy movie  it was at the low end of the stick. FearDotCom is horrible  everything about it is bad. The acting. The script. The camera work with the flashing images that are more annoying than impactful or scary. The weak plot with epic plot holes. The fact that it's like a poor man's rip off of 'The Ring' only that is even too generous of a critique for this dreck. It was just boring and bad and not worth even watching for free on TV late at night. Heck I couldn't resist flipping the channel quite a few times and am questioning why I even stuck around most of the time in the first place. Wait I know.. nothing else was on. Lastly the movie is about a website feardotcom.com that when visited causes death in exactly 48 hours. What I found amazing was the lack of actual victims mentioned on screen. Where were all the victims? We saw what... 3? mentioned and of course I am not including those who fell victim bc they viewed the site while working the case of the initial people killed. I don't expect feardotcom.com to be the most popular website ever BUT I do expect more than 3? 4? people to visit it. This is the internet  people are on it all the time and sites spread and word gets out. Where were the hundreds if not thousands of people who must have visited the site and also died? It surely wasn't painted as some worldly epidemic  it seemed to be contained to the few people mentioned on screen. Huh? This is not some video tape like in 'The Ring' where you physically need to have the tape to watch it and get your death sentence. It's a WEBSITE  anyone can view it at any time  the death count should have been monstrous. HUGE plot hole.Skip this  110 .. and I am still in absolute awe that this was a real film and not a made for TV horror attempt. Ridiculous.. and if I didn't think the movie was bad enough the preposterous ending was something unreal. SMALL SPOILER WARNING Lots of plot holes but the spoilerish one I need to voice was the lipstick tube swallowed by the victim who was found in the steel mill. Just like the new victim who we saw taken on screen she must have been accosted by the Dr.  immediately grabbed sedated and stripped so how did she magically not only get a chance to swallow her lipstick case which apparently stayed water proof for years but plant the note in there and wait a minute.. actually write that message about justicerevenge on the back of the address?

	onyx:emotionText "Having watched this last night on SyFy without having heard of the movie prior to watching it I am SHOCKED to find out based on the IMDb info that FearDotCom was a real movie. By 'real movie' I mean a movie released in theaters that actually had a big budget 45 mil? What was that spent on?! Certainly not the movie I watched and that people paid money to see it because I just assumed based on the quality of the film as well as where I watched it that it was one of those low budget poorly acted nonsensically over the top made for TV SyFy original movies. I am honestly taken aback by the fact that this wasn't  I don't even know what to say. It wasn't even reminiscent of a good original SyFy movie  it was at the low end of the stick. FearDotCom is horrible  everything about it is bad. The acting. The script. The camera work with the flashing images that are more annoying than impactful or scary. The weak plot with epic plot holes. The fact that it's like a poor man's rip off of 'The Ring' only that is even too generous of a critique for this dreck. It was just boring and bad and not worth even watching for free on TV late at night. Heck I couldn't resist flipping the channel quite a few times and am questioning why I even stuck around most of the time in the first place. Wait I know.. nothing else was on. Lastly the movie is about a website feardotcom.com that when visited causes death in exactly 48 hours. What I found amazing was the lack of actual victims mentioned on screen. Where were all the victims? We saw what... 3? mentioned and of course I am not including those who fell victim bc they viewed the site while working the case of the initial people killed. I don't expect feardotcom.com to be the most popular website ever BUT I do expect more than 3? 4? people to visit it. This is the internet  people are on it all the time and sites spread and word gets out. Where were the hundreds if not thousands of people who must have visited the site and also died? It surely wasn't painted as some worldly epidemic  it seemed to be contained to the few people mentioned on screen. Huh? This is not some video tape like in 'The Ring' where you physically need to have the tape to watch it and get your death sentence. It's a WEBSITE  anyone can view it at any time  the death count should have been monstrous. HUGE plot hole.Skip this  110 .. and I am still in absolute awe that this was a real film and not a made for TV horror attempt. Ridiculous.. and if I didn't think the movie was bad enough the preposterous ending was something unreal. SMALL SPOILER WARNING Lots of plot holes but the spoilerish one I need to voice was the lipstick tube swallowed by the victim who was found in the steel mill. Just like the new victim who we saw taken on screen she must have been accosted by the Dr.  immediately grabbed sedated and stripped so how did she magically not only get a chance to swallow her lipstick case which apparently stayed water proof for years but plant the note in there and wait a minute.. actually write that message about justicerevenge on the back of the address? Makes no sense at all  poor writingplot to go with the poorly made movie. Go figure.";

Use of Rammstein song major check! But then after the first major death scenes and Dorff decides to check out the website himself the movie starts to go downhill. Maybe it was because of how confusing the movie got afterwards or my mind just doesn't choose to remember it at all or maybe even both but I can't remember too much of what happens in the second half right until the predictable climax. The characters are just too uninteresting too no matter who is playing them. It just ticked me off how Combs was given a crap role and a small one too. OK maybe he didn't have a big one in HOHH but he still owned a lot more than what he does here.So in summary I guess everyone has a few speed bumps in their career of movies.

Second what mother of a child in such a condition lets her daughter play in AN OLD ABANDONED STEEL MILL?!?!?! I've seen some mighty farfetched plot contrivances in my day e.g. the wolves in Day After Tomorrow comes immediately to mind but this was terrible. I actually groaned. My displeasure was abated however by the rest of the audience outside of me and 3 friends the audience consisted of 4 other people  opening night revolted! That's right we no longer watched the movie as atomistic movie fans. Oh no. We banded together to fight back this cinematic horror MST3K style.

Director William Malone did an entertaining job before this mess with the remake House On Haunted Hill but here the story has clearly got the better of him and everyone involved! Meaning that there is no story of course! It's a rambling mess of set pieces that have no tension and zero scare factor. Stephen Dorff is one of those actors who needs to fire his agent he is talented and easy on the eye and has made some good films like Blood and Wine and World Trade Centre. Still more often than not we find him in the midst of films such as this and Alone In The Dark where he so obviously is searching for a way out presumably so he can kill his agent! Natasha McElhone is an actress who's work I genuinely enjoy films such as The Truman Show and Ladies In Lavender show how good she can be. The poor thing had no chance she looks worried for her reputation the entire running time ... and please dear who goes swimming in some flooded factory with a homeless woman as your lifeguard?! And why were you asking her questions about some girl? Oh sorry Natasha you didn't know either did you? Stephen Rea ... I can't even think of why he is here ... no excuse at all. After this and In Dreams a big mistake for Neil Jordan! he is gonna need about 10 movies as good as Interview With The Vampire The Crying Game and The End Of The Affair for him to sink his acting chops into again before he can wash the taste of this experience out of his mouth! Cinematography was basic and effects were so forced as to make me wonder if the film was set in the future. It's not it's trying to push for a reaction to the growing threats that the internet can bring on society but instead it looks terribly dated. Commentory from the director is useless ... he talks of mixing old and new looks ... blah blah blah it didn't work Billy your film makes everyone look like they need a good wash and a shot of tequila ... if only to wake up from the nightmare of being in this stupid incoherent story! Phew so glad to have got that off my chest ... please save yourselves and don't see this film. To follow what I could of the films it'll be the last site you visit story ... this could be the last film you watch ... that's how much it will make you cry for the state of cinema!".

Third estabishing mood lighting for a 'scary movie' instead of having everything take place in a dark room or two.Part of the movie takes place via digital cameras. It worked for The Blair Witch Project. It kinda worked for Halloween 8. It did not work here.William Malone the director favored CGI over story telling. Too many of the scares were laughable too many of the scenes pointless.The only saving grace for my 5.50 was the trailer for Ghost Ship before the movie.The lead actress Natascha McElhonelooks like a cross between Crystal Gayle and Meryl Streep with the acting ablitiy of Tawny Kitaen. She's just that bad.Stephen Dorff emotes like a wood board. Only one expression for fear confusion and insanity.Please I urge you to say home and stare at the wall. Save your money.

I am not even sure if I understand everything. After you have seen the internetsite you die of your worst fear in 48 hours that I did understand but why do 'infected' people see the little girl over and over again while she herself was killed as an adult? I probably missed it but like I said it doesn't really matter. The scary visuals have something admirable. The images are really haunting but again I liked the videotape from 'The Ring' a lot more.

There is also no sense in me going over the plot or the differences between this and the original because that is covered in so many different reviews and I am guessing this isn't the only review that you will read. I am 29 years old and I wouldn't even consider myself a Russell Brand fan but after seeing this movie that is starting to change. I went into Arthur with an open mind. I did not have another movie to compare it to since I didn't see the original and I throughly enjoyed the movie. Russell Brand was OK in 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' and I really didn't enjoy his movie Get Him to the Greek but Arthur was a different type of comedy compared to his typical work. The best thing I can compare this movie to is The Wedding Singer. Not because of the plot or the actors but because The Wedding Singer put Adam Sandler in a slightly toned down more caringromantic version of things had done before. There was less slap stick and I actually ended up liking Adam Sandler more because of it. The same can be said about Arthur. This isn't OVER THE TOP Russell Brand like most of his other movies. I wouldn't say it's 'down to earth' Russell Brand either more like some place in between.Even if you have seen the original try to go to see this movie and not compare it to the original. It's the same as The Dark Knight vs Batman with Michael Keaton. Both were good movies but you couldn't really compare them. What surprised me at the end of the movie was my brother 32 years old saying he actually liked this better than the original which he watched last weekend. He said the one liners were better and Russell Brand made a more convincing drunk. My guess is because Russell is probably always this drunk when he isn't filming movies!Arthur made me laugh out loud which is something I typically don't do. The story was decent typical romantic comedy and even though the movie slowed down about 34 of the way in it had to because of the story. Do yourself a favor and see this movie at some point. It doesn't have to be in the theater since there aren't any eye popping sound effects or state of the art 3D in it...though the city of New York was a GORGEOUS back dropGo see it. Turn your brain off for a bit and enjoy the movie for what it is. Don't compare it to the original but compare it to the other things Russell has done and you will see that he might actually have a great future at comedy ahead of him. Final Verdict 8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "The original Arthur was and is a great film. It was funny well written and well acted. It garnered 4 Oscar nominations and 2 wins. It won 4 out of 5 Golden Globes. John Gielgud so deserved his award so well that year. Dudley Moore in the title character had the same lovable charm that Russel Brand has in this remake. But there are several things missing which make the 2011 version an OK film and not a part of cinema awards. First its 2011 and not 1981. The original version would never be made today. Plain and simple. Arthur was a drunk. A hard drinker who fell down slurred wordsand yes even was driving drunk in several scenes. No way would that get approved today or anyone think it was funny. It was this funny drunk that made Dudley's Arthur so much fun even though today we would rush for interventions or rehab. Second the director forgot this is a New York film. It is set in New York but so much changed from one film to the other that the setting was indifferent here. No more neighborhood bars dinners landmark shopping sites or eateries. There is one really good scene involving Grand Central but it does not make up for the lack in the rest of the film. Linda becomes Naomi in the new film. She is not a New Yorker. Does not look like one or act like one. She plays the part well but its just not the same. Again this remake could be set anywhere. Can you imagine the original anywhere but NY! Third as good as Helen Mirrim is she is not the Hobson that John Gielgud presented. She will not get any awards for this presentation. So if you do not make any comparisons you will like the film but most likely not fall in love with it for 30 years. The film is well acted written in parts but it steals one lines too much from the original that just seemed forced here or are not well placed. Whereas we see Arthur drink he never really seems drunk. The relationship with Hobson is presented as a motherson rather than fatherson. It was hard to believe in the relationship as much as the previous film. The chemistry between Arthur and Naomi was believable and flow very well throughout the film. Susan Johnson played by Jennifer Garner had much more of a role here than the original. It needed to be reverted back. It was just not funny. Lastly Nick Nolte was just plain horrible and nasty. He could have been written out completely. It made no sense for plot development. So the new Arthur is as an OK remake but not as good as it could have been.".

Yes once again it is a movie set in New York but there's a reason why they can't having them there. It's an amazing city. And this movie showcases that very well. I appreciated the range of humor they had in there as well. Some of it was raunchy and then at other times it was mild and a relief from some of the over the top jokes. The climax was well done humorous yet tasteful at the same time and the conclusion was very appropriate. I heard some people complaining about how this movie was showcasing how rich people have it made and it wouldn't be received well today because of the economic climate. That was ridiculous. If anything it shows how money really can't buy happiness and that the most important thing in this world is that we have each other. Overall very enjoyable film that one should go into with an open mind and just have a good time.".

Yes once again it is a movie set in New York but there's a reason why they can't having them there. It's an amazing city. And this movie showcases that very well. I appreciated the range of humor they had in there as well. Some of it was raunchy and then at other times it was mild and a relief from some of the over the top jokes. The climax was well done humorous yet tasteful at the same time and the conclusion was very appropriate. I heard some people complaining about how this movie was showcasing how rich people have it made and it wouldn't be received well today because of the economic climate. That was ridiculous. If anything it shows how money really can't buy happiness and that the most important thing in this world is that we have each other. Overall very enjoyable film that one should go into with an open mind and just have a good time.";

	schema:reviewBody "I don't jump on the bandwagon of immediately hating on a remake as there are some great ones out there. I watched the Arthur remake as I do like Helen Mirren a lot and I personally don't mind Russell Brand. But I was hesitant too as to me the trailer didn't wow me over I didn't laugh once and by the end of last week I was starting to get annoyed at Offenbach's Can Cana fun piece especially to dance and sing along to but can get on your nerves sometimes depending on the time and place being played for the hundredth time.Arthur wasn't for me quite the abomination that I heard it was but in all honesty I didn't see much point to it. It is better than the Psycho and Wicker Man remakes both of which almost made me lose the will to live but for a good remake look towards The Thief of Baghdad The Magnificent Seven and especially The Thing. If I were to compare this to the 1981 film the 1981 film is much better being very funny and charming and I actually preferred the muchmalignedbutin my opinionbetterthanitsreputation sequel over this too.I will get the good things out of the way. I did like very much how the film looked and the location shooting is very striking and the soundtrack is infectious. But here come the many negatives. While I admire that Arthur tried to stick faithfully to the original film I think there are times when it tries too hard and it comes off as being too faithful. Except here while there was wit fun and charm in the original and in its sequel there is not enough of that here the severe letdown that is the ending pretty much epitomises this. The script is often unfunny and juvenile severely lacking in the acidity and drollness that worked so well before and the gags are really quite weak predictable and poorly timed.I don't mind a movie where it has moments of predictability a lot of movies do but it does bother me when there are too many moments throughout where it is. That is the case with Arthur and I can't count the number of times where I was saying to myself now where have I seen this before. Again I don't mind when a movie show little or nothing new but the difference is Arthur in the end didn't make me overlook that because it was lacking in charm.The direction is rather poor as well often rushed and smug and there were times where I felt there should be more time to breathe. And there are some moments where there is little or no humour that are really quite dull. The acting overall fares little better. I have to say though Russell Brand did have very big shoes to fill and he does do an admirable job trying to convey some spontaneous cheeky charm. The problem is not only is his material unfunny and dreadfully weak but his titular character clichd and unlikeable. Arthur in the original was clichd in a way but I found as the film progressed you warmed to him here I grew tired of him.I cannot deny that Greta Gerwig is talented but she too is illserved with her material. She has no snappy lines no funny joke no witty gag to write home about so overall it was the prettybutbland acting performance. I'd say the same for Jennifer Garner as well and also that her frothy acting style didn't entirely work within the tone and style of the film. I was most saddened about Helen Mirren bless her she tries so hard but in the John Gielgud role she can't do anything with her lines she has some decent delivery but there is none of the droll and acidic quality in the oneliners to go the extra mile. Then there are talented actors such as Nick Nolte and Geraldine James who are largely wasted.All in all not an abomination but pointless. 210 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody " out of After giving such a rancid review to The rite making the claim that it was the worst film so far of 2011 well... 2011 has a new contender. Even going in I knew this film was going to be atrocious from start to finish. Why see it then? Apparently my friend's fun night out consisted of buying my ticket to a movie I didn't ask to see then having to reimburse himher later and eventually just seeing the damn movie. Honestly I kept in open mind in the beginning but this film just did not do it for me. Even in the most stale comedies I can laugh here or there. I NEVER laughed or chuckled. Not even a heartfelt smile. I honestly sat there with the same blank expression. What's even worse is that I predicted absolutely every scene guessed every punchline and even knew going it what I was going to get. First of all let's talk about the performers. Russell Brand is seriously the most irritable pretentious actor or at least in this film. I swear I did not care at all about him. He didn't bring any charm or wit he was just flat. Jennifer Garner was as equally obnoxious but at least she didn't take up the majority of the film. As for the others? Honestly I didn't connect to any characters. There was no development no depth no purpose. The characters were just there. Not to mention this story has been told a thousand times before. Can Hollywood stop beating a dead horse? Remake or not the script is just very uninspired. Rich pretentious dude has to marry an equally rich pretentious dude but falls for an arrogant so called sweatheart and doesn't care about the money. Maybe this would be interesting had it not been projected on the screen so many times.All in all Arthur is just another waste of celluloid. It isn't funny it's not entertaining and it's not worth seeing. Plain and simple. Had I not been forced to see this movie trust me I wouldn't have. If you MUST see it please just rent the original. It's probably better than this movie. All I'm glad is that 2011 so far has had only two stinkers or at least I've seen.".

	onyx:emotionText " out of After giving such a rancid review to The rite making the claim that it was the worst film so far of 2011 well... 2011 has a new contender. Even going in I knew this film was going to be atrocious from start to finish. Why see it then? Apparently my friend's fun night out consisted of buying my ticket to a movie I didn't ask to see then having to reimburse himher later and eventually just seeing the damn movie. Honestly I kept in open mind in the beginning but this film just did not do it for me. Even in the most stale comedies I can laugh here or there. I NEVER laughed or chuckled. Not even a heartfelt smile. I honestly sat there with the same blank expression. What's even worse is that I predicted absolutely every scene guessed every punchline and even knew going it what I was going to get. First of all let's talk about the performers. Russell Brand is seriously the most irritable pretentious actor or at least in this film. I swear I did not care at all about him. He didn't bring any charm or wit he was just flat. Jennifer Garner was as equally obnoxious but at least she didn't take up the majority of the film. As for the others? Honestly I didn't connect to any characters. There was no development no depth no purpose. The characters were just there. Not to mention this story has been told a thousand times before. Can Hollywood stop beating a dead horse? Remake or not the script is just very uninspired. Rich pretentious dude has to marry an equally rich pretentious dude but falls for an arrogant so called sweatheart and doesn't care about the money. Maybe this would be interesting had it not been projected on the screen so many times.All in all Arthur is just another waste of celluloid.

	schema:reviewBody "How can a comedy a movie usually designed to make people laugh bore me to tears? Throw in a thoroughly unlikable protagonist making unfunny witty jokes while acting like a man child and you've got yourself one of the best sleeping pills to ever hit a cinema near you.Arthur Russell Brand is a spoiled rich 30something wasting money every 30 minutes to enjoy his life while being watched over by his disapproving nannysurrogate mother Hobson Helen Mirren. When Arthur's mother the owner of a multibillion dollar corporation has had enough of Arthur's immaturity she threatens to cut him off unless she marries the responsible and completelyoutofhermind businesswoman Susan Jennifer Gardner. While Arthur begrudgingly plans to go through with the marriage to keep his fortune he struggles with the prospect when he meets and connects with the parttime con artist Naomi Greta Gerwig. Wackiness ensues. For two boring hours.I was coming into this film ready to hate Russell Brand who's very appearance makes we want to take a shower to wash away the filth. For his first lead role he doesn't really bomb it completely but... he's just not a funny guy. The sad part is you can see him try to be funny when he starts acting out and behaving like a child. So he pretty much looked at Will Ferrell and decided to copy what he's been doing in his very very worst movies. So it doesn't come across as funny it's just sad. Brand never reaches the level of annoyance he stooped to in Get Him to the Greek and Forgetting Sarah Marshall but he's definitely not a leading man. He has no charm no attraction and no likability. And he does this for two unforgivable hours.While you never care about Arthur you oddly care more about the supporting cast. You really feel for Helen Mirren's Hobson and her exasperation with putting up with this rich spoiled little brat. She's dry and sarcastic and the film's best moments which are few and far in between all belong to her. Even Greta Gerwig is more charming than the lead and you actually feel sorry her when she gets hurt in the movie. Jennifer Gardner has fun as a psycho for all 10 minutes she's in this film. That's right she can only be here ten minutes of this two hour waste of time.But a comedy needs funny situations and this film is sorely lacking in that department. Even though Brand plays with the famous movie cars and rents out Grand Central Station there's nothing to laugh here. I'll admit I giggled at a snarky remark here and there but like I said it never comes from Russell Brand. You see a couple of ridiculous things like the DeLorean or the Batmobile the bad one and you feel like you're ready to smile but the movie does nothing with them. While this film didn't anger me it commits the cardinal sin of being boring. They have two montages of nothing interesting happening and there came points while dialog was going on and I almost started snoozing. And did I mention this comedy is two unholy hours long? At the end of the day Arthur is an irritating movie with a thoroughly uncharming and unfunny protagonist. It's a waste of time and money that only has a few funny moments peppered in. Rent it to pass the time but do not expect to laugh. Expect to catch some Zs.".

I don't think I'd be alone in saying she is one of the premier actresses in Hollywood. Her character's dry humor but strength and caring shined through perfectly and was the highlight of the film. Garner and Gerwig's characters are also pretty interesting. Garner doesn't really step outside the box with this performance but it was still solid. I was pleasantly surprised with Gerwig though. I had never seen her in a meaningful role and she was very solid in portraying her emotions. All in all the movie was just a pretty good film and it was definitely worth watching.".

	schema:headline " This Remake of Arthur Lacks Art!";
	schema:reviewBody "Everything that made the original Arthur 1981 such an appealing but politicallyincorrect romantic comedy is conspicuously missing from the lackluster remake costarring Russell Brand and Helen Mirren. Freshman director Jason Winer's slick glossy 40million rehash of Arthur includes several hopeless changes from the original that don't improve the finished product. Moreover Warner Brothers looks like it was banking heavily on Arthur to make millions because they let the producers shoehorn one of the studio's hottest milliondollar plus properties into the plot Batman. Arthur opens and closes with our irresponsible hero joyriding through the streets of New York City in a replica of the Batmobile. Winer and Bruno scenarist Peter Baynham have updated the story line and sharpened the focus. Unfortunately this overt realism detracts from what essentially was a hilarious Cinderella fairy tale for adults. Mind you the chief charactersparticularly the eponymous zillionaire playboyemerge as more often obnoxious than sympathetic. The idea of casting Russell Brand in the role that Dudley Moore immortalized with his considerable wit and subtlety had some modicum of merit. After all Moore and Brand both hail from England and Brand is an exotic misfit. He takes himself no more seriously than Moore took himself. Sadly the comic sensibilities that differentiate them from each other doesn't make Brand's Arthur Bach either more interesting or sympathetic. As his nanny Helen Mirren succeeds far better than anybody in a biological role change. Meanwhile Nick Nolte is a perfect fit as the grumpy father of the woman Jennifer Garner who our protagonist is fated to wed against his wishes. Baynham fails to replicate the sparkling dialogue of the original and none of the lines are quotable. When everything is said and done Arthur amounts to an inferior remake and none of Brand's antics can compensate for these shortcomings.Arthur Bach Russell Brand of Forgetting Sarah Marshall doesn't know the meaning of work. Indeed Arthur has never earned a dime by the sweat of his own brow in his life. Nevertheless he has more money to blow than most people ever dream about and he indulges his every whim and desire with his millions. Such is Arthur's notoriety that the police are already familiar with his outrageous shenanigans. Nothing that he does surprises them. When the authorities pull over his devoted but simpleminded chauffeur Bitterman Luis Guzman of Mystery Men at the outset of the action they know that only Arthur has enough money to not only buy his own Batmobile replica but also careen around the streets in it. Furthermore it comes as no surprise to them that Arthur is sloshed. Arthur rarely does anything without an alcoholic drink in his hand. Mind you the cops catch up with Arthur not because they are better drivers but because Bitterman and Arthur cannot handle their Batmobile. The humor here is our tipsy hero crashes into the famous statue of a huge bull on Wall Street. When Arthur tries to extricate himself from the wreckage he finds himself wedged up against the bull's abundant scrotum.Eventually Arthur's longsuffering mother Vivienne Geraldine James of Gandhi who manages the family business tires of her son's excesses and forces him to grow up. Namely Vivience plans to deprive Arthur of his 950 million inheritance unless he bows to blackmail and marries a wealthy heiress Susan Johnson Jennifer Garner of Catch and Release who she holds in high regard for her business acumen. Naturally Arthur doesn't like his mother's ultimatum. Initially he tries his hand at working. Predictably Arthur's attempts at holding done a job at Dylan's Gotham's most illustrious candy store end in disaster. Arthur's lifelong nanny and confidante Hobson Helen Mirren of Red believes that a trip to the altar might straighten him up. Hobson has spent most of her life picking up after Arthur and forcing his hookers and onenight stands to cough up his expensive toys and valuables than they tried to steal.Along the way rebellious Arthur discovers penniless Naomi Quinn Greta Gerwig of No Strings Attached the woman that he has spent his entire life looking for. Naomi works as a Manhattan tour guide without a license. Indeed like Arthur the authorities know about her and have repeatedly warned her about her illegitimate job. In the original Arthur the girl of his dreams Liza Minnelli's hardworking waitress Linda Marolla was a shoplifter who liked to steal ties for her unemployed father. Naomi and Arthur hit it off splendidly because our hero knows how to spend big. Arthur makes a major mistake when forgets to inform Naomi about his predicament. When she learns that Arthur is about to marry Susan Naomi washes her hands of him. It doesn't help matters that Arthur has pulled strings to get a publisher for her children's book.As remakes go Arthur seems rather pointless no matter how well Winer and Baynham have updated the protagonist's antics. Sadly those antics are more tasteless than amusing. Worse in an effort to differentiate themselves from the original they have poor Arthur sober up following the TwelveStep Alcoholics Anonymous program. Brand possesses none of the charm and wit that made the original Dudley Moore character so infectiously funny. Instead Brand tries to convert the title character into the rock'n roll miscreant that he portrayed not only in Forgetting Sarah Marshall but also Get Him to the Greek. Arthur fails to generate any chemistry between its leads. Brand and Mirren don't bond and she doesn't get to deliver the acidtipped barbs that John Gielgud in the original administered with such relish.".

And thus when this remake came about I purposely avoided it. After all  why try to top a classic? Then one evening when absolutely nothing else of worth was on this was just starting on HBO. So... I decided to give it a shot. And I ended up absolutely enjoying this film.I must confess to not having seen any prior Russell Brand movies nor have I seen any other movies w Greta Gerwig so I went into this w positively no expectations. Jennifer Garner does a great job of making herself unlikeable  which is a tremendous feat for an actress that most of us adore.Helen Mirren is quite enjoyable in the role of Nanny Hobson and Luis Guzmn is his usual offthewall self as Bitterman. But the movie comes down to two essential characters Arthur Brand and Naomi Gerwig. And there is a chemistry between the two that translates well on the screen.I usually avoid this type of romantic comedy and look for deeper movies w much substance but Arthur just hit a spot for me. I gather from the other reviews here that some people have lost that ability to allow themselves to just get swept away in a film and take it for what it is.Arthur isn't anything that is going to change the world but it is delightful in its own way. Who can't watch this and imagine themselves as Arthur  living life carefree and having fun w absolutely no concern for money? Yes  for most it is simply a fantasy  but it's also nice to have that fantasy for a couple of hours occasionally.The only thing I found disturbing about the movie is that Hollywood is so bereft of original ideas that they've turned to remaking movie after movie. Hopefully that will change though I doubt it.All in all I enjoyed the new Arthur and if you go into it w out expecting anything more than a brief respite from life I imagine you will enjoy it as well.".

	schema:headline " Helen Mirren a smart script and nuanced direction make this a great remake";
	schema:reviewBody "I can't say I was particularly looking forward to the remake of Arthur. I'd seen the original on HBO at some point as a teen and it didn't do much for me. I didn't understand the Oscar wins for John Gielgud Supporting Actor and Best Original Song win for Christopher Cross' Arthur's Theme Best That You Can Do. I never really got Liza Minnelli's appeal either.The film fared considerably better when I watched it on Netflix Streaming earlier today. Gielgud's sandpaper dry wit impressed. Liza was more likable than I'd recalled. The songwell I still hate the song. But the screenplay and direction by Steve Gordon is solid throughout and Dudley Moore is perfect in the lead role.Which brings us to the new Arthur and the trepidation I felt even more strongly after watching the original. The commercials and trailers have focused on Russell Brand's Arthur as an evenmore cartoony playboy than Moore's version including overthetop adventures such as dressing as Batman and driving around in the Batmobile. I've also never been completely sold on Brand who at 62 stands about a full foot taller than did Moore. I've liked him in small portions as in Forgetting Sarah Marshall but found him a bit tiring in larger doses. The casting of Jennifer Garnerand her prominent billing on the posteralso seemed strange This is the role of Susan the bride in Arthur's arranged marriage not the female lead. Instead indie queen Greta Gerwig who is so art house she actually starred in a film entitled Art House would be playing the Liza Minnelli role Linda then Naomi now of Arthur's workingclass true love.Only the presence of Helen Mirren taking over for Gielgud in the genderswitched role of Hobson left me feeling much hope that the new Arthur wouldn't be a complete wreck.I was way off. This movie's actually quite good. And if you're factoring in it being a remake most suck and a romantic comedy most suck the new Arthur is especially impressive. The commercials are doing it a disservice The new Arthur is very funny throughout its running time updates the story to modernday sensibilities in an intelligent fashion and manages to broaden and expand upon the more dramatic aspects of the original. In some ways quite honestly it's a better film. Hats off in particular to screenwriter Peter Baynham who handled this tricky assignment with aplomb. His script actually is fairly reverent to the 30yearold original selectively using plot lines scenes and even occasional dialogue where it fits. But he also brings the relationships and sexualclass politics into the 21st century and finds an intelligent way to address the elephant in the room in both films Arthur is an alcoholic.The original film for example has Moore swigging from a bottle of rum in a paper bag while driving on the highway... without any consequences. His alcoholism is treated simply as an aspect of his immaturity. Brand's Arthur never drives drunkhis chauffeur Bitterman Luis Guzman in the remake handles all the drivingbut his drinking causes real consequences and he's forced to address them.Does that sound too heavy for a romantic comedy? It doesn't play that way thanks to Baynham's script savvy performances by the leads and nuanced direction by Jason Winer making his feature film debut. It's not surprising that Winer is the coexecutive producer and a regular director of Modern Family because Arthur replicates that show's mix of believable character interactions and laughoutloud humor.Anyone who's seen the original will know all the major plot points because this truly is a remake in that sense. You reach the same destination you just take a few different roads including a couple of gender twists.Arthur an immature playboy who has never worked a day in his life will be cut off from the family fortuneclose to 1 billionunless he marries Susan Garner whose family ties can be beneficial to the corporation run by Arthur's mother father in the original. Unfortunately Arthur has fallen in love with another Naomi who runs illegal albeit popular tours of Grand Central Station and other NYC landmarks. The casting is mostly on point. Mirren is pitchperfect in the plum role of Hobson giving the relationship with Arthur an intriguing maternal slant absent from the original. Gerwig finds just enough grit in her character to keep Naomi from becoming too pixielike. And Garner fits perfectly in a role right in her range providing the toughness and attitude the character of Susan desperately needed in the original.As for Brand... he's really not too bad. The comic scenes are his forte of course and he's a blast throughout thosefunny smart charismatic appealing. He's a bit less successful in the dramatic scenes but still not too bad. We don't quite get a peek into the darkness we know is dwelling deep inside Arthur but Brand certainly goes a few places he's never gone before and shows promise.A few small problems hurt the film. It runs a bit long at 110 minutes an even 100 would have worked better especially near the end. Those trims would have been welcome in a few scenes around the film's middle where Arthur tries his hand at gainful employment they felt like studiomandated bits of broad humor that don't play well with the drier wit and general smarts of the rest. Finally Nick Nolte appears in a couple of scenes as Susan's toughguy father and he's frankly hard to understand.Despite those issues the new Arthur really is a lot of fun. Compared to most romantic comedies it's funnier smarter sharper and even occasionally touching and Mirren's performance is worth at least an Oscar nomination of her own.".

Well yes I can understand if he speaks fast enough and uses x number of big words he is seemingly intelligent to the average sheep. The film is a remake of an 80s film and also stars the endless bore that is Helen Mirren. The second 'queen' of england has the ability in any interview to talk a glass eye to sleep. She outright dismisses the original normally the kiss of death as 'boring' as alcoholism is not a funny subject. Anything is a funny subject  if its funny. Get it Helen? I seem to recall around the time the original was made Mrs Mirren was busy getting her kit off in every film she made so leave it out love. Anyway stay well clear unless you are a fan of Brand in which case I am obviously a 'hater'. However the opinion of anyone who would use that word wouldn't really matter to me anyway.".

Only thing is that this waste of celluloid is not a movie. It is just another product of contemporary Hollywood  a heartless and soulless Hollywood that has absolutely no clue on how to make a real movie. About the only good thing in this bomb are some of the onlocation New York sites where this was filmed but Grand Central Station looks like a leftovcer set from Superman II. Do yourself a favor. Save your gas and 11 bucks stay away from the multiplex playing this atrocity and rent the Dudley Moore original. There is absolutely no comparison between the real thing and the remake. The kind of film that should never have been made in the first place. If you are sucker enough to pay good money to see this Dudleyless dud demand a refund!

I FELT for Arthur I liked Helen Mirren's portrayal of Hobbs I even liked that Jennifer Garner was so unlikeable.Is this movie a 10 of course it's not...but it's good entertainment give it a chance.";

I was pleasantly surprised with the sweet romantic plot and deeper underlying plot. Not having seen the original I had no expectations and I really loved the laugh. I think the motherly relationship between Arthur and Hobson added to the complexity of the situation between Arthur and his mother as did the parallel between the death of Arthur's father and Naomi's mom. The depth of Naomi's character also added to the growth of Arthur's character and promoted an emotional connection. Surprisingly sweet Arthur 2011 is a secretly lovely romance with the added seriousness of alcoholism and the complexity of deep loving relationships.".

Arthur 2 if anything gives us the film that Dudley Moore and Steve Gordon were trying to back in 1981. One of the main criticism's is that it gives out a bad message the alcoholism is good. The film does nothing of the sort Arthur strives through out the film to change his drinking ways and succeeds in the final part of the film. The film itself is not as funny as Arthur was but you hardly notice this because it tells a good dramatic story.Bud Yorkin handles the direction excellently and the movie contains a magical back drop of Christmas time New York. Dudley is again funny and likeable just as he was in Arthur allthough both the Actor and the Character have matured. Liza Minelli is again kookie as Linda allthough she plays the role like the preceeding seven years took place within a week. Nothing changes with her performance and one is greatful. One really feels for Arthur and Linda as they struggle with the fact of first not being able to have children and secondly being destitute. Without spoiling the movie for those who have not seen it there is a happy ending. Burt Bacharach's score is again heartbreaking and wonderful and the title song sung by Chris De Burgh is as good as the Chris Cross original. And finally Sir John Gielguid makes a heart breaking and beautifull return as an Obi Wan Kenobi like Hobson. A christams ghost if you will.A Beatifull film. One ready for reevaluation.

	schema:headline " He's Back!";
	schema:reviewBody "Arthur 2 On the Rocks is the story of how Arthur Dudley Moore the drunken title character loses his 750000000 fortune and sobers up so he can adopt a baby. It starts out very good and right on target but towards the last 45 minutes the film loses not only all credibility but also all sense of cohesiveness. It's as if the writer wrote himself into a wall and tried to cut through it with a spoon. I'm not sure if that analogy was any good but it's a bit better than the end of the movie.Of course I haven't seen the original Oscarwinning Arthur 1981 which may be a part of the reason I enjoyed the first half of Arthur 2 1988. I still remember when I first saw The FlyI had read all the positive reviews I was really pumped up and after the credits started to roll I just sort of sat back and let out a sigh. But I had already seen its sequel aptly named The Fly II and I had enjoyed it. Why? Because prior expectations can truly ruin a great movie. If I had gone into The Fly expecting nothing I probably would have come out of it satisfied. But in hindsight I expected too much. And I hadn't expected anything going into The Fly II which may amount to why I prefer it to the first film despite its goofy nature and campy effects.Maybe that's why Arthur 2 On the Rocks didn't seem so bad when I watched it. I didn't find a single positive review of the film on the Internet. IMDb's average user rating is currently 3.6 and a year ago it was lower. Rotten Tomatoes' rating is 0 with not a single positive thing to say. And I can understand why people might not like this movie but if they think it's one of the worst films of all time...they've got another thing coming.Arthur and his wife Linda Liza Minneli are living freely. They own five homes in and around New York City and Arthur's only worry in life is that he may get some. Linda on the other hand has a single worry she can't have children and she wants some. So they visit an adoption agency downtown run by Mrs. Canby Kathy Bates who promises she'll do her best to fix them up with a kid. Joy!But then Burt Johnson Stephen Elliot buys out Arthur's family company promising to sell out if Arthur is cut off from the family fortune  all 750000000 dollars. Johnson's scheming is because he wants his daughter Susan Cynthia Sikes to be happy  and she still wants to marry Arthur. If Arthur divorces his true love Linda and marries Johnson's snobby daughter he can get his money back. But soon Arthur learns that money isn't the most important thing in life.This is an interesting premise of course but the fact that the entire character of Arthur is one built upon the sole theory that there's nothing to worry about in life is contradictory. If Arthur were a television show it would have been a decent half hour of laughs to see him hit the streets in an attempt to sober up. But as a 107minute film Arthur 2's premise just isn't Arthur as far as I can tell. At the end Arthur cleans up and gets sober and  without spoiling how  wins the day like there were any doubts as to whether that would happen. But the lasting image of a sober Arthur is far from the central idea of the character in the first place.And I must complain about something else I noticed  something more disturbing than anything else in the film. At the very end Kathy Bates delivers an adopted baby to the couple as they reunite on the street only for Linda to announce on the spot that she's pregnant. Wouldn't Mrs. Canby Bates take the baby back and give her the baby that is to a couple that can't have children? No she just smiles and stands back from the scene. This is an example of poor scriptwriting. Arthur 2 On the Rocks is a hilarious film in its first half and a bumbling messagedriven snoozer in its second. If only all comedies could sustain laughs at a steady pace throughout. I can't necessarily say that Arthur 2 is a very bad movie but I can't necessarily say I can recommend it either.2.55 stars.John Ulmer".

	onyx:emotionText "Arthur 2 On the Rocks is the story of how Arthur Dudley Moore the drunken title character loses his 750000000 fortune and sobers up so he can adopt a baby. It starts out very good and right on target but towards the last 45 minutes the film loses not only all credibility but also all sense of cohesiveness. It's as if the writer wrote himself into a wall and tried to cut through it with a spoon. I'm not sure if that analogy was any good but it's a bit better than the end of the movie.Of course I haven't seen the original Oscarwinning Arthur 1981 which may be a part of the reason I enjoyed the first half of Arthur 2 1988. I still remember when I first saw The FlyI had read all the positive reviews I was really pumped up and after the credits started to roll I just sort of sat back and let out a sigh. But I had already seen its sequel aptly named The Fly II and I had enjoyed it. Why? Because prior expectations can truly ruin a great movie. If I had gone into The Fly expecting nothing I probably would have come out of it satisfied. But in hindsight I expected too much. And I hadn't expected anything going into The Fly II which may amount to why I prefer it to the first film despite its goofy nature and campy effects.Maybe that's why Arthur 2 On the Rocks didn't seem so bad when I watched it. I didn't find a single positive review of the film on the Internet. IMDb's average user rating is currently 3.6 and a year ago it was lower. Rotten Tomatoes' rating is 0 with not a single positive thing to say. And I can understand why people might not like this movie but if they think it's one of the worst films of all time...they've got another thing coming.Arthur and his wife Linda Liza Minneli are living freely. They own five homes in and around New York City and Arthur's only worry in life is that he may get some. Linda on the other hand has a single worry she can't have children and she wants some. So they visit an adoption agency downtown run by Mrs. Canby Kathy Bates who promises she'll do her best to fix them up with a kid. Joy!But then Burt Johnson Stephen Elliot buys out Arthur's family company promising to sell out if Arthur is cut off from the family fortune  all 750000000 dollars. Johnson's scheming is because he wants his daughter Susan Cynthia Sikes to be happy  and she still wants to marry Arthur. If Arthur divorces his true love Linda and marries Johnson's snobby daughter he can get his money back. But soon Arthur learns that money isn't the most important thing in life.This is an interesting premise of course but the fact that the entire character of Arthur is one built upon the sole theory that there's nothing to worry about in life is contradictory. If Arthur were a television show it would have been a decent half hour of laughs to see him hit the streets in an attempt to sober up. But as a 107minute film Arthur 2's premise just isn't Arthur as far as I can tell. At the end Arthur cleans up and gets sober and  without spoiling how  wins the day like there were any doubts as to whether that would happen. But the lasting image of a sober Arthur is far from the central idea of the character in the first place.And I must complain about something else I noticed  something more disturbing than anything else in the film.

He's unemployable destitute and on the street.Never having worked he desperately attempts to secure the most menial occupation but each time those obdurate relatives put their boot in. At one stage he is cleaning windscreens at traffic lights and finally sleeping in a hostel for the homeless.Gielgud as his eversupportive butler Hobson  who died at the end of the first movie  makes cameo reappearances in ghostly form. Bach is depicted as walking and talking with him. He is only visible to Bach who resembles any other alcoholic lostcause conversing with invisible familiars.This movie is darker than the first which was more a celebration of the wealthy drunken playboy lifestyle. Here he is coming to terms with his demons in the bottle and elsewhere. At one point he elects to visit his socialite wouldbe wife and resolve their dilemma once and for all. But by then he has become so shabby and neglected that the doorman will not allow him entry. There is conversation The doorman asks 'Is she a friend of yours sir?' Before Arthur can reply invisible Hobson observes 'That's a very good question isn't it Arthur? Cuts right to the heart of the matter.' Perhaps inevitablythere is less comedy in this movie and sometimes what there is is slightly strained. Arthur's rehabilitation pulls less laughs than his drunkenness. Even so there's plenty of funny moments and a fairybook happyending.Still worth a watch because the thoughtful elements make for a more indepth character evaluation but the first movie is the one for hilarious comedy.".

That stigma is why I put off watching it for so long only deciding to give it a look when it appeared on free TV in my city. After watching it I am puzzled by its reputation. To be sure it's not as good as the first movie. It does have a number of faults with it such as there not being any gigantic laughs a surprisingly sedate tone for the most part a limited amount of plot and Minnelli disappearing for almost all of the last third of the movie. Still the movie has some strengths. While there are no gigantic laughs there are a good number of chuckles along the way. The cast is enthusiastic and has great chemistry with each other and the characters at least the ones not in the evil family that strips Arthur of his fortune are very likable. So while the movie is no comic masterpiece it's nothing to really be embarrassed about  it's a perfectly okay movie especially when you consider how bad sequels usually are.".

	schema:reviewBody "The original Arthur was pretty much a cartoon where there was no consequence to behaviour so Arthur could remain permanently sozzled drink and drive insult people and create havoc with impunity. In Arthur 2 he enters the world of adult responsibility. I guess that it is this element of reality the drunk as a pitiful creature which makes fans of the original hate the sequel. Those expecting more of the same were sadly disappointed. The premise of a man being forced to fend for himself after a lifetime of privilege is vastly more interesting to that of a drunken playboy and the film for the most part rises to this. The ensemble performances are much stronger than in the first film which relied heavily on acerbic one liners and Dudley's comedy drunk routine. Here the interaction between Minelli and Moore is more fleshed out and is delightful. It reminded me somewhat of Jane Fonda and Robert Redford in Barefoot in the Park. The comedy throughout is more subtle and more satisfying than the original. Unfortunately certain cartoon elements from the first film are introduced. Moore's previously innocent exgirlfriend turns up as a Cruella Deville character before strangely reverting to her former self at the end. And her father hounding Moore wherever he goes is rather silly it makes him seem like Gargamel. The denouement is especially feeble with the sudden unexplained character change just mentioned and suddenly everything's alright. This terrible finale is the reason I cannot give this a higher mark although I do consider it a genuine improvement on Arthur 1.It is a pity that this even more than the original did not follow the courage of its convictions and end with him being poor but following his heart. Now that would be a lesson worth learning.".

Some of the script and jokes are hit and miss the jokes about the drunkeness of Arthur were better than the ones about the rehabilitation and the pace slackens in the second half. John Gielgud does do with what he can which is still very enjoyable but his material isn't as acidic or as droll which was a disappointment seeing as that made his performance in the original even more enjoyable. However there are many entertaining parts to make up for the misses as well as some touching parts with Arthur and Hobson the film still looks great and if I noticed two improvements I'd say Arthur is more likable here with some fun oneliners and the first half is slicker than that of the first's. The performances are fine Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli show good chemistry and are fun to watch and John Gielgud and Kathy Bates do what they can. All in all a decent sequel and better than it's made out to be. 610 Bethany Cox".

In fact the sequel gives Liza more to do than the first one since John Gielgud's Hobson is now relegated to a ghostly appearance to show Dudley Moore's title character what he was missing in a sort of It's a Wonderful Life spoof.Ironically Golden Girls featured two appearances by the legendary Geraldine Fitzgerald repeating her role here as Arthur's matronly grandmother and also getting more to do. Liza takes on an interesting comparison to her own life playing a woman unable to have her own child and trying to find a baby to adopt. The main plot about Arthur's exfiance's father going out of his way to bankrupt him in revenge is the only weak point but that is overshadowed by the heart and soul of Moore and Minnelli's romance.

But I felt they swung a little too far having Cynthia Sikes be enamored with the over aged too short Moore who offers nothing to the table. I can see that this is a dilemma to most people. The original story wasn't about his relationship to Minelli. It actually was about him and Gielgud. A manchild who finally confronts serious issues and grows up. There is no sequel here.

	schema:reviewBody "1922  Germany was in political turmoil and spiralling into a hyperinflation crisis. Meanwhile in cinema the German Expressionist movement was coming of age with the release of FW Murnau's Nosferatu and this the first in Fritz Lang's series of epics Dr Mabuse der Spieler. While perhaps not as classically expressionist as Murnau or Robert Wiene Fritz Lang arguably put his finger on the mood of times better than any other. With Mabuse his unique style develops to convey a picture of the chaos of the era.The opening sequences of Dr Mabuse are evidence of screenwriter Thea von Harbou's growing strength as a storyteller and Lang's economy of expression. The first shot  a closeup of Mabuse's hand holding cards showing his various disguises  presents and defines the title character. A frantic rapidly cut action scene then hooks the viewer whilst introducing us to Mabuse's network of minions. After that we see Mabuse's elaborate scam at the stock market. In one particularly striking image the crowd of traders panic and jostle whilst Mabuse stands calmly on a pedestal above them  a perfect metaphor for his position of power amidst social chaos.At one point in his youth Lang trained as an architect and this fact is central to his style as a director. There are hints of this in his earliest films but in Mabuse the architectural touch is fully matured. Throughout the set design and dcor is almost more important than the actors. Whereas other expressionists would evoke mood most frequently through use of light and shadow Lang does it primarily through use of space. He composes shots in straight lines and geometric patterns occasionally seeming to form eyes or faces. Often characters are dwarfed by the sheer cavernous size of the rooms they are in. Also look at how many scenes take place on a stage or lecture hall and how Lang contrasts opposing shots of speaker or performer and audience  a metaphor for master and masses. He even has Mabuse sitting at his desk facing the camera as if to make the reallife viewers his audience  a touch Lang used a fair bit throughout his work.A frequent complaint about Dr Mabuse is its gargantuan length and I have to admit it does drag in places. Lang's following silent features although also very long were extremely tight in structure and worked like a classical symphony in the way different parts complemented each other. Dr Mabuse is not quite up to that standard yet. While some of the individual acts are wellbalanced little dramas in themselves as a whole it is a little uneven. Mabuse also suffers from wordy title cards and a lack of convincing action sequences  again problems that Lang would have solved by the time of Metropolis. It's worth remembering though that on its original release parts one and two were shown on consecutive nights and it's much easier to digest this way. I wouldn't recommend any firsttime viewer try to tackle the whole thing in one sitting.Holding the whole thing together is a mesmerising performance from Rudolph KleinRogge in the title role. While acting in Hollywood was becoming increasingly naturalistic at this time Germany was a little way behind and performances still tended to be a bit too theatrical and exaggerated. Lang however softens the impact of melodramatic acting by never letting the characters get too realistic in the first place. Cinema was like a comicbook for Lang in his urban thrillers as much as in his exotic adventures and this approach saves Dr Mabuse from becoming too strained and ridiculous.Although it's not as polished as any of his later silents Dr Mabuse was perhaps Lang's most influential film. The idea of revealing the identity and methods of the villain to the audience was no doubt a forerunner of Hitchcock's mode of building suspense. A young Sergei Eisenstein was given the task of cutting a shortened version of Mabuse for the Russian public and the way Lang imbues each shot with meaning may have contributed to the concept of intellectual montage. This is not to mention the impact of the Mabuse character on generations of cinematic villains to come. Dr Mabuse der Spieler is a far from perfect film and can be tough to watch although it's not as dull as some would claim and it's certainly a key film in several strands of cinematic development.".

In both films the identity of the central evil character changes Dr. Mabuse assumes many disguises Dr. Caligari remains himself until he appears as a psychiatrist at the end. The sign on Mabuse's door reads Psychoanalyse. Caligari's somnambulist predicts a man will die within hours Mabuse hypnotizes a man into driving himself over the bank of a canal.

MABUSE operates on a wider canvas than CALIGARI. Whereas Caligari's only instrument is his somnambulist slave Mabuse operates an extensive network of henchmen. At the climax of both stories a word CaligariMelior is animatedly superimposed over the screen action to intensify the impact. The whole of CALIGARI is designed expressionistically expressionistic sets are used minimally and subtly in Mabuse but the subject of expressionism is briefly discussed in one scene wherein Mabuse describes it as another game or words to that effect. The expressionism in CALIGARI is allencompassing in MABUSE it is under control part of a larger design. In both films there are scenes in prison cells.

In the Kino edition of MABUSE there is one apparent technical glitch a car chase near the end starts at night and suddenly flips to daylight with no sense of transition. If this was Lang's idea of day for night shooting he overshot the mark hugely.On display here is Lang's penchant for mixing exotic pulp unadorned realism and pure fantasy. In MABUSE it is the doctor's magical hypnotic powers that stretch and finally break credulity woven as they are into an otherwise naturalistic crime melodrama. This mixture of the fantastical and the ordinary occurs in all of Lang's 1920's work right through WOMAN IN THE MOON 1929. Only with M 1931 does he begin to abandon fantasy and concentrate on social issues whereupon he steered clear of pulp and exotica until late in life when he returned to the genre in the late 1950s with his India trilogy. But by that time film audiences had long outgrown the conventions of the 1920's. And so ended Lang's career. But the sheer scope and expert execution of this film under the conditions that prevailed in Germany in 192122 supervised by a man barely 30 years old is quite an achievement and should be seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "In this review I refer to the Transit Film DVD edition from the F W Murnau Foundation or Stiftung if you understand German!. This 2 DVD set is an excellent restoration of thisthese? movies. At three and a half hours some may argue that it is a little daunting for the uninitiated silent film viewer but in my humble opinion it is so well made by Fritz Lang that it still stands up today as a masterpiece of gangster cinema. Shot between November 1921 and March 1922 the film was made only a couple of years after Lang's directorial debut Halblutt  1919 and five years before Metropolis  perhaps Lang's masterpiece. It can be argued that it represents the start of a 'series' of gangstercrime related movies by Lang and parallels can be drawn to Spione Spies of 192728 and M 1931  Lang's first talkie and of course The Testament of Dr Mabuse 193233. There was also a final addition from 1960 The Thousand Eyes of Dr Mabuse but that is obviously of a different era. It is interesting to observe that Langvon Harbou clearly were attempting to create a screen detective character something like Sherlock Holmes in the form of Commissioner Lohmann superbly played by Otto Wernicke for it is he who is the detective in both M and Testament. However I digress. Where both M and Testament concern themselves with the work of the police in an almost documentary fashion especially M Der Spieler is almost exclusively concerned with the working of the criminal mind. Mabuse is played by Rudolf KleinRogge one of Lang's favourites  though one wonders what KleinRogge made of Lang  Thea von Harbou the screenwriter married Lang in 1921 after divorcing KleinRogge! He gives a masterful performance as Mabuse and dominates the film. Even when not on the screen his omnipotence pervades the entire proceedings. Whilst I wouldn't go so far as to describe the picture as 'gripping' it still has the power to hold the attention for most of its mighty three and a half hours. For me at least this is aided in no small measure by the magnificent new soundtrack by Aljocha Zimmermann whose use of leitmotif in true Teutonic style adds immeasurably to the overall enjoyment of the film. I strongly recommend this picture not only to serious students of German Silent Cinema they'll have seen it anyway! but to anybody who enjoys a good gangstercrime story. If you have a hangup about silent movies then in all honesty this isn't going to change your mind  but give it a try. I think its worth the effort in the end. Trivia Although made in Berlin and the numerous vehicles all drive on the right as one would expect they are without exception all right hand drive!".

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADWhat separates film noir from the standard crime or gangster film? Psychology.  Where the common criminal is simply interested in money the film noir villain has a profound understanding of human nature and enjoys playing with the lives of others as much for pleasure as for gain.The year is 1922.  The place is post WW I Germany.   It was a time of inflation so great and so accelerated that a loaf of bread costing a mere 20 thousand marks in the morning could be priced at 5 million marks by evening. Restaurant prices skyrocketed while diners were eating.  Businesses paid their workers twice a day so their money would have some buying power.  By November of 1923 it took 4.2 trillion German marks to buy a single American dollar.  Moral chaos ensued.To set the amoral mood of DR. MABUSE people are shown climbing the ladder of success by exploiting the vices of others.  But no value judgments are made.  We see only that vice is profitable not that it is wrong or right. The economic instability of the period gives rise to extraordinary moral decadence a dancer performs a stage show with blatant sexual imagery drug addicts are everyday characters and prostitute children are openly soliciting in the streets.  It's indicative of this film's milieu that even the good characters are allowed to enjoy Schadenfreudepleasure at the misfortunes of others.    The Countess Tolst for instance enjoys watching the faces of gamblers when they lose at cardssuggesting that even angels can become devils when they live in the hell of social chaos.The German people of 1922 needed a savior to believe in.  But he didn't have to have wings and a halo.  He could be a criminal mastermind.  Dr. Mabuse is such a man.  He has no compassion no mercy no friendsno equalsonly servants.  He's professor Moriarty and the insidious Dr. Fu Manchu rolled into one.  He isn't simply a mastermind who sits in a sterile room directing his criminal activities he's also a master of disguise who enjoys becoming a different person to commit his crimes. His cohorts are so dedicated to him that they willingly sacrifice their livessome by suicideso that he can continue his great work.   He is convinced of his mental and psychic gifts and lesser humans are only toys for the various games he plays.   But like a child he's unaware that any harm can come to him and is unprepared for police commissioner Von Wenk to be as ruthless and as merciless as he is.The film is filled with noir moments  One of the crisises of the film comes during the card game between Mabuse and Commissioner Von Wenk when both men are heavily disguised.  Mabuse tries to psychically overpower Wenk's mind and in a highly cinematic noir moment the room totally darkens obscuring everyone but them to emphasize the contest of wills.   Another highly symbolic noir moment comes when Count Tolstwho is socially disgraced because Mabuse hypnotized him into cheating at cardswalks from the shadows a defeated man toward Mabuse standing in a bright beam of light symbolic of the German people's yearning for a savior.  Still another is when Countess Tolst pretends to be arrested and is thrown into the same prison cell as Cara Carrozza to get information on the man Von Wenk calls The Great Unknown.    Cara tells her of Mabuse's greatness and of her love for him causing the Countess to admire her for protecting the man she loves.   The noir moment comes when Cara sits alone in her cellwondering if Mabuse has betrayed herthe shadow of the prison bars shine on her face and we realize she is not only in a physical prison but an emotional prison of Mabuse's making.It's not difficult to see DR. MABUSE as the first film noir and one of the finest films of the German silent period.  Definitely a film of its time it could have predicted the rise of Adolph Hitler had anyone been paying attention.The message of the film is that theft and murder in pursuit of a great cause are permissible but that cheating is dishonorable and will be punished by fate.   Mabuse is a gambler who played with life.  He lost because he committed a gambler's only sin.  He cheated and his punishment is to be haunted by the ghosts of his own misdeeds.Originally a two part film running nearly three and a half hours but mostly seen in a highly edited version of half that length.   While I haven't seen the upcoming Image DVD and can't comment on its picture and sound quality it restores the film back to its original length and adds a music track.    It's a film every student of cinema should see especially if you enjoy film noir.Jay F.".

	onyx:emotionText "WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADWhat separates film noir from the standard crime or gangster film? Psychology.  Where the common criminal is simply interested in money the film noir villain has a profound understanding of human nature and enjoys playing with the lives of others as much for pleasure as for gain.The year is 1922.  The place is post WW I Germany.   It was a time of inflation so great and so accelerated that a loaf of bread costing a mere 20 thousand marks in the morning could be priced at 5 million marks by evening. Restaurant prices skyrocketed while diners were eating.  Businesses paid their workers twice a day so their money would have some buying power.  By November of 1923 it took 4.2 trillion German marks to buy a single American dollar.  Moral chaos ensued.To set the amoral mood of DR.

What the protagonists in these films experienced as a world of fertile opportunous chaos and would therefore exploit to their own advantage was eventually revealed to be a chimera of the mind led astray the world was being supervised and kept in ledgers all along.This is pretty amazing stuff to have then we can see the manipulator inside the manipulated world and the motions that bring consequences on both ends of the illusion. The first scene shows Mabuse dealing cards with on them the faces of the players the actors who are about to perform in the orchestrated fiction  Mabuse's inside the film and also Lang's film about Mabuse. And there is a woman who is our surrogate viewer in all this she watches the gamblers from a distance searching faces for thrills and sensations. All this touches at the heart of selfreferential cinema in ways that still astound by how erudite how insightful. Viewers who are looking for films about the mind weaving films will be delighted. There is one scene that will be absolutely unequaled in film until the second great cinema of Resnais and Tarkovsky some forty years later. It shows Mabuse operating an illusion on stage before a packed theater the entire audience watches transfixed at people magically walking out of a screen into the middle of the auditorium  and vanishing at a snap of the fingers  none of them realizing the confrontation that is actually playing out within the fantasy.But there is an extra layer that further elevates this. So what is perceived by the players as unluck or the chance turn of a card from our double perspective rooted in Mabuse's mind is revealed as part of the same decisive plan. Yet Mabuse is not a godlike presence he is steeped in human passions icy but on occasion petulant seething lusting the mask full of emotional cracks.So on one level we have a controlled reality as a puppet show of absurdities but on the other end finally we get a glimpse of the mind cracking under the weight of what it must control under the burden of the operated illusion. The final vision is a nightmare where these controlled images animate themselves against their tyrant. Tellingly it happens in a locked room the blind people that were tasked by Mabuse to deal with his fortunes in fact his counterfeit fortunes now transform into apparitions of guilt.Few films have so deeply influenced our cinematic vision from Vertigo to Lynch. It has been since disguised and embellished but it's revealed here for the first time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dr. Mabuse is a name familiar to almost everyone in Germany but most Americans would have to be told that he's a criminal mastermind psychiatrist gambler and hypnotist with supernatural powers. Mabuse is notable for his brilliant disguises and his gang of minions who conspire against people and institutions for the sole purpose of bringing power and wealth to himself. This evil genius is known only as The Great Unknown to those who wish to stop him. Mabuse was created by Norbert Jacques for a novel which has never been out of print in Germany. The director of this film Fritz Lang claimed him for his own and now Mabuse is known not as a character in a novel but as a character in three Fritz Lang films the first of which is this innovative and hugely influential silent movie.Lang's storytelling techniques are especially innovative but later spy films including Lang's own have greatly improved on what's here and leave modern viewers alert to the slow pace murky details and confusing plot twists. What hasn't been improved upon is the artistry behind the photographic effects. I don't mean the effects themselves modern special effects are infinitely more sophisticated. This film's effects have a great impact evenor especiallyon today's viewer who is accustomed to a rapidfire series of elaborate gaudy computergenerated pictures like those in say Peter Jackson's King Kong. Nothing in that film is as memorable to me as this movie's scene where the camera closes in on Mabuse and everything around him goes dark leaving only one glowing malevolent head floating in the blackness.The highly exaggerated style of acting from everyone in the cast would look idiotic if seen in isolated bits. Von Welk Bernhard Goetzke tilting back his head and crossing his eyes as Mabuse Rudolf KleinRogge hypnotizes him would have been a perfect clip for Jay Ward's Fractured Flickers. As part of this film every melodramatic moment from the cast is effective in a way that a more naturalistic style can never be.Fans of the Mabuse films which number many more than just Lang's three are sometimes disappointed by this first incarnation. This Mabuse allows himself violent emotional outbursts while the later version is marked by icy selfcontrol. The more familiar Mabuse may be an improvement over this one but they don't quite replace him and those films don't quite replace this one. This is a treasure for film historians and indirectly a treasure for fans of the countless movies influenced by it.For those who simply want a good movie there's plenty here to reward them provided they are very very patient.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the movie that features one of fist archcriminals Dr. Mabuse. A manipulative character who by hypnosis manipulates people and set them up against each other and steal their money by letting him play card games against him while he lets his opponents deliberately loose even when they have the better cards. He manipulates for more money and the love from respectable woman but also most definitely purely for his own pleasure. It doesn't need to be explained why Dr. Mabuse is evil he just simply IS. That is what makes a great and memorable movie villain.Definitely true that the second halve of the movie is better than the first. In the second halve the movie really starts to take pace and form. Does it make the first part obsolete? I think not. It perfectly shows how manipulative Dr. Mabuse and the characters also get strongly developed in it. But yes it's definitely true that the movie is a long sit. Almost 4 hours is of course a long time and there even is a longer version. It does not ever make the movie bad or boring but it does make it a bit tiresome at times. The movie also isn't easy to follow but that often is the curse of early narrative fulllength movies from the '10's and '20's of the previous century.For 60 of the movie the movie concentrates on card games. Some of the sequence involving the games are made to look more exciting and and tense than in any James Bond movie ever had been the case.The movie uses some good early cinematic ticks and also some interesting storytelling techniques such as some interesting fast flashbacks to help to remind to the viewer of what happened earlier in the story.The movie also shows some early filmnoir tendencies and other thriller and mystery elements. Not just with its story psychological thriller elements or style of filmmaking but also with its characters. The main villain Dr. Mabuse is of course the best example of this. He plays an early fullblooded big movie villain who is also being accompanied by a couple of typical crooklike looking henchmen. All elements that later would become defining for the genre. The movie is about good versus evil in good early cinematic form.Some of the tricks make sure that the movie is filled with a couple of memorable and effective sequences mainly regarding the manipulative hypnosis sequences by Dr. Mabuse. It makes the movie highly imaginative and original though it all obviously is not as revolutionary as the other Fritz Lang classics Metropolis and M.Of course by todays standards the acting in the movie is definitely overthetop. Fritz Lang never casted actors just because of their acting skills but also because of their powerful looks. It all helps to make the early acting in Lang movies still fascinating and powerful to watch. Bernhard Goetzke as the state attorney von Welk is a great 'mainhero' for the movie. Of course Rudolf KleinRogge is also great as Dr. Mabuse and so is Alfred Abel though I liked him in Metropolis even better. Definitely worth seeing if you can handle its long running time.910httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

The dynamism for an early '20s pic before the era of easy camera movement is simply phenomenal. And where else will you find an intertitle as glorious as 'Eat some cocaine you weakling!'";

	schema:reviewBody "Dr. Mabuse has to be the bestwritten and most harrowing villain ever created in the 20th century and it's pretty amazing that he came so early. Fritz Lang's fourhour actionadventure mystery silent film is anything but an epic and also is so good it doesn't even feel epic. Instead for once a four hour movie has been created where every scene and every moment has character development and meaning.It's no wonder this film comes from postwar preNazi Germany. It's filled with anxiety and angst about the times... and indeed says in many different places of the times. It is a work of public psychology that revels in the fear of hegemonic control structures itself around what is perceived to be a downward spiral and fills the screen with every reminder of the decay. Indeed the villainous Dr. Mabuse does not only inhabit physically most of the screen time are you sure he's not there? Look again but his nefarious presence seems felt in even the most remote circumstance within the narrative.Dr. Mabuse is not the only character however. This film is filled with such good character development I don't think anything matches it up until Seven Samurai. There's Mr. Hull the playboy victim of Mabuse who manages in his short time in the narrative to develop extreme sympathy for him before he dies. There's Ms. Carozza the woman who falls for Mabuse so hard that she manages to subvert her own love for him through her own piety to him. And there's my favorite character of all the Duchess who's quixotic and energetic presence not only lights up the screen with splendor but also captures the affections of the silent era's greatest villain.But you want to know something cool? Not only is this movie a veritable work of characterconstructed art it also has explosions gun battles intrigue gambling and sex! You can have your art and entertainment too! I can see why Fritz Lang returned to these characters over and over again. Not only are they fascinating in their own right but they inhabit a world darkly appealing in its excesses and shadow play. This movie despite its strong connection to the times is as much a work of consummate fantasy.PolarisDiB".

Lang's distinctive approach and Rudolf KleinRogge's portrayal of Mabuse give it some lasting images to go with the involved story.Movies about master criminals are hardly rare and even the more popular movies of the genre are often shallow and overpraised. In some respects the story of Dr. Mabuse is similar to most he has an extensive bag of tricks that he uses to pull off his schemes and the movie often holds your attention simply by making you guess what he is planning to do next. But there is more psychological depth to the Mabuse story than there is in most such movies and this is complemented by the distinctive array of settings and the overall portrayal of society which at times suggest themes that go well beyond the personal battle between Mabuse and the law.While quite entertaining this is not really a truly great movie because on the whole it just does not have that much to say. It is all too easy for filmmakers to depict a decadent morallyneutral society in a way that seems more profound than it really is. Lang is markedly superior to most of the presentday filmmakers who try to create Mabusestyle characters and stories which is why this has enough substance to have held up pretty well over the years.As entertainment Dr. Mabuse The Gambler compares well with almost anything of its kind and it is as good as any of Lang's own films. As a work of art though even in Lang's own filmography it has to take a back seat  though perhaps not by a lot  to Metropolis and other more profound works.".

The ending inside the tunnel and the follow up of Mabuse being haunted contains terrific atmosphere and manages to be quite creepy as well.

	schema:reviewBody "It is interesting to discover or rediscover Fritz Lang. He was well known for one film Metropolis and then for a few American films films he shot in the USA. But the full set of Dr Mabuse's films is fascinating in a way because it provides a rare vision on the German cinema from the early 1920s to 1960. The eye looking at the world from a German point of view that spans over Hitler Nazism and the Second World War is Fritz Lang's. We know him for his highly symbolical Metropolis in which the meaning is built by visual and numerical symbols. In this Dr Mabuse it is different. There are quite a lot of symbols but inherited from the silent cinema of the old days symbols that are there only to make clear a situation that had been depicted previously with pictures and no words or a page of intertitles. Fritz Lang still uses that technique in his 1960 film which is a long time overdue for a silent cinema technique. But that is a style nothing but a way of speaking not a meaning. The meaning is absolutely bizarre. Dr Mabuse is a highly criminal person but his objective is not to commit crimes in order to get richer or whatever. It is to control the world through his criminal activity. The world is seen as basically negative leading to chaos and overexploitation leading to anarchistic crime and nothing else because the only objective of this modern world is to make a profit by all means available. Dr Mabuse is a master mind of his time and for him crime is the only way to destroy that capitalistic world that he never calls capitalistic or Kapitalismus and to replace it with pure chaos that should be able to bring a regeneration a rejuvenating epiphany a refounding experience. We find in his mind what we could find in some of the most important criminal minds in this world like Carlos in France or Charles Manson in the USA or those sects that practice mass suicide in order to liberate the suicidees and to warn the world about the coming apocalypse. It is the mind and thinking of those who practice war as a revolutionary activity with a fundamentalist vision of their religions or politics and the world that is supposed to reflect that religion. They do not want to build a different society and when they are in power they are constantly aiming at antagonizing their own population and the world because they cannot exist if they do not feel some opposition that they can negate bring down crush like in Iran or in Germany with Hitler though later on it was not much different under the Communists in East Germany. These visions need opposition to exist and they provoke that opposition by aiming at taking the control of the world with violence and imposing their control with more violence. That's Dr Mabuse the main brain of a criminal decomposition and recomposition of society on an absolutely antagonistic vision of life. But that vision is very common. Just as common as this phrase a half full glass is nothing but a half empty glass. Add antagonism to that dual vision and then you have a struggle to the death between the half empty glass that wants to be full and the half full glass that wants to be empty or full? one half only wanting to take what the other half has and impose his half to the other half to make the world one by the elimination of the other side of the coin. That dual antagonistic vision is the popular and shrivelled up approach of the communist catechism of Stalin inherited from Marx's French son in law Paul Lafargue or of course in all dictatorship that reduces life to a little red book to one hundred quotations from the master thinker of the revolution. That's the world you feel in these films. Fritz Lang embodies this ideology of the mentally poor in that criminal character of his kill rob steal counterfeit. Even if you die when doing so the world will change and remember. The master criminal has to die in his activity in order to regenerate the world. What Fritz Lang introduced in his double main feature of the early 1920s and in his Testament is that the master brain of this vision internalizes this paranoid and psychotic vision of the world into himself and has to become psychotic himself and it is in his psychosis that he finds the energy to conquer the world again. In the third film Dr Mabuse has been dead for a long time and is reincarnated by someone who finds his inspiration in the doctor. That is a farfetched cinematographic and fictional antic that is necessary as a reference but brings nothing to the vision itself. A few years later that ideology was to conquer our imagination in many ways. First the Berlin Wall became the symbol of that vision the way it was carried and conveyed to the world by the EastGerman communists. Then we have to think of the various revolutionary movements like Der Baader Meinhof Komplex Die Rote Armee Fraktion to take some German examples. But think of the French Mesrine and the Italian revolutionary urban guerrilla warfare movements and you will have a fair picture of this psychotic criminal mind copied and pasted into the political field. The Maoist Red Guard and Cultural Revolution movement was quite typical of this approach. All that was going to come in 1960 and we must admit Fritz Lang was seeing ahead of his time just as he had seen Hitler in his Testament of Dr Mabuse a political leader based on hypnosis and mesmerizing people into blindly following a band of criminals.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne University Paris 8 Saint Denis University Paris 12 Crteil CEGID".

Is it reputation of the director? Is it the fact this movie probably is the first noteworthy film featuring a supervillain? Is it the good reviews from 1922? Or is it that the sequel to this movie Testament of Dr. Mabuse is brilliant and frankly everything this one is supposed to be? Watching this film  it is hard to figure out the answer. Because this film is a pretty good example of a talented filmmaker gone wrong rather than anything intrinsically brilliant.First of all this film is far far too long. Much of the film is spent with the exposition of Dr. Mabuse's fiendish plots which are somewhat less well earthshatteringly fiendish than one might expect. There are long scenes of silent actors chatting in front of indifferent sets with lengthy title cards outlining the Doctor's miserable plots or the investigator's complicated investigations.Second rather surprisingly for a film this length the characters are not well developed. Mabuse as a human being as opposed to a mannequin for the makeup artist's art really does not emerge until the second hour of the film. The film's only interesting character  the countess who is so bored with life that she goes to the gambling dens to watch everyone else destroy themselves  gets good moments in the second half of part one but then just becomes a damsel in distress for most of the second part.Third  quite honestly the plot is stupid. The great scheme occupying Mabuse for the bulk of this picture is the good doctor using his skills at hypnotism and disguise to force rich people to lose to him at cards. He could have saved us all a lot of bother if he just hypnotized those same rich people to write him a check. While in many films of this type the plots are equally daft one is forced to spend more time with it because of the length of the film. There are plot twists in this movie that would be embarrassing in a B minus PRC film featuring Lionel Atwill. And in this one we get the prototype of a villain so in love with complicated methods of murder that he has trouble actually getting his murder's accomplished.Fourth for a crime film the action scenes just aren't that suspenseful. This a bit of surprise  in Lang's immediately preceding film Destiny  he displays an extraordinary mastery of pacing and generating suspense. But in that movie Lang crowds a lot of plot in a reasonably brief running time and creates a core of sympathetic characters. In this one there really is not all that much going on for large spaces of the film and the main character is decidedly not sympathetic.This is not to say this is a bad film. It isn't. There are some great sequences scattered here and there  particularly when Mabuse and the investigator out to destroy him sit down to a game of cards. Also there is no denying that it has been influential. But if you are searching out good Mabuse The Testament of Dr Mabuse is a better choice.".

By November of 1923 it took 4.2 trillion German marks to buy a single American dollar.  Moral chaos ensued.To set the amoral mood of DR.

The economic instability of the period gives rise to extraordinary moral decadence a dancer performs a stage show with blatant sexual imagery drug addicts are everyday characters and prostitute children are openly soliciting in the streets.  It's indicative of this film's milieu that even the good characters are allowed to enjoy Schadenfreudepleasure at the misfortunes of others.    The Countess Tolst for instance enjoys watching the faces of gamblers when they lose at cardssuggesting that even angels can become devils when they live in the hell of social chaos.The German people of 1922 needed a savior to believe in.  But he didn't have to have wings and a halo.  He could be a criminal mastermind.  Dr. Mabuse is such a man.  He has no compassion no mercy no friendsno equalsonly servants.  He's professor Moriarty and the insidious Dr. Fu Manchu rolled into one.  He isn't simply a mastermind who sits in a sterile room directing his criminal activities he's also a master of disguise who enjoys becoming a different person to commit his crimes.   His cohorts are so dedicated to him that they willingly sacrifice their livessome by suicideso that he can continue his great work.   He is convinced of his mental and psychic gifts and lesser humans are only toys for the various games he plays.   But like a child he's unaware that any harm can come to him and is unprepared for police commissioner Von Wenk to be as ruthless and as merciless as he is.The film is filled with noir moments  One of the crisises of the film comes during the card game between Mabuse and Commissioner Von Wenk when both men are heavily disguised.  Mabuse tries to psychically overpower Wenk's mind and in a highly cinematic noir moment the room totally darkens obscuring everyone but them to emphasize the contest of wills.   Another highly symbolic noir moment comes when Count Tolstwho is socially disgraced because Mabuse hypnotized him into cheating at cardswalks from the shadows a defeated man toward Mabuse standing in a bright beam of light symbolic of the German people's yearning for a savior.  Still another is when Countess Tolst pretends to be arrested and is thrown into the same prison cell as Cara Carrozza to get information on the man Von Wenk calls The Great Unknown.    Cara tells her of Mabuse's greatness and of her love for him causing the Countess to admire her for protecting the man she loves.   The noir moment comes when Cara sits alone in her cellwondering if Mabuse has betrayed herthe shadow of the prison bars shine on her face and we realize she is not only in a physical prison but an emotional prison of Mabuse's making.It's not difficult to see DR. MABUSE as the first film noir and one of the finest films of the German silent period.  Definitely a film of its time it could have predicted the rise of Adolph Hitler had anyone been paying attention.The message of the film is that theft and murder in pursuit of a great cause are permissible but that cheating is dishonorable and will be punished by fate.   Mabuse is a gambler who played with life.  He lost because he committed a gambler's only sin.  He cheated and his punishment is to be haunted by the ghosts of his own misdeeds.Originally a two part film running nearly three and a half hours but mostly seen in a highly edited version of half that length.   While I haven't seen the upcoming Image DVD and can't comment on its picture and sound quality it restores the film back to its original length and adds a music track.    It's a film every student of cinema should see especially if you enjoy film noir.Jay F.".

	schema:reviewBody "From other reviews I see that there is pretty much only two polarizing opinions on this film. Either they really love it or it bored them to death. Mine is the latter unfortunately. I watched a version that went on for roughly 4.5 hours. It consisted of two parts the first being around 2.5 hours the second being slightly under 2 hours. And man it felt like it would never end. Actually I watched it already a couple years ago and didn't really like it back then either but the high rating it has here made me curious enough to give it another go and hope I'd appreciate it more this time as I possibly just wasn't attentive enough the first time. The opposite was the case. It was one of the most boring 5 hours of my life.The film was directed by Fritz Lang between the two World Wars and shortly after the Black Friday that resulted in a global economy crisis. It is very vaguely related to that with the occasional reference early in the film to bank contracts. Basically it's about a super criminal Dr. Mabuse and his gang going against a public prosecutor. I really can't go much into detail here as even with intertitles it was practically impossible to follow the action and it can't be required to read constantly plot summaries to understand what is going on in a movie. This would have been necessary here though. The only thing that kept me at least slightly interested was the solid score from shortly after 2000 and I wouldn't want to imagine how these poor people in previous decades had to watch this neverending film completely silent.Now you probably think I react so negatively to this film because silent films are not really my cup of tea. Wrong. I like Lang's Nibelungen at least the first part I really liked Metropolis. Is it that I don't like blackandwhite films or crime films. Negative too. I had a good time watching Lang's M. Or is it the length? Nope. I watched Edgar Reitz' most recent Heimat chapter not too long ago and quite enjoyed it. It was only insignificantly shorter than Dr. Mabuse der Spieler  Ein Bild der Zeit. Maybe it was an interplay of all these factors. But most of all it was just the story doing absolutely nothing for me and the characters being uninteresting and their actions weird if not completely incomprehensible.That's why I can say that there's most likely no way I will ever watch this film again and to silent movie enthusiasts who are interested in watching it I say Don't. Pick another Lang movie. Or maybe watch a 4hour compilation of the works of Georges Mlis Alice Guy Segundo de Chomn and William Dickson instead. They have created some real movie magic that this film here unfortunately can't even be remotely classified as.".

	schema:reviewBody "Following their ruinous defeat during the War Germany found itself in what is now commonly referred to as the Weimar era. It's a uniquely fascinating point in the country's history dominated by a stark contrast between impoverished casualties of war and lavishly wealthy benefactors soaking in aloof decadence. This divide between societal poles was not exactly one unlikely to be crossed by any daring enough to grab a boat and travel the uncertain waters however and director Fritz Lang frequently visits this idea throughout his first major feature film still highly regarded to this day. Bouncing back and forth between seedy gangsters the hoitytoity elite and those unfortunate enough to be tasked with keeping everything in order the law Lang embellishes his film with a unique and varied palette of both character and tone for its time. Based on the novel Dr. Mabuse der Spieler by Norbert Jacques the story follows psychoanalystbyday undergroundcriminalmastermind bynight Dr. Mabuse as he manipulates his way up the rungs of society seemingly with ease through various nefarious means including stock market manipulation and psychological mindcontrol during card games at highprofile gambling joints. The central theme here warns of granting overwhelming dominance through terror and misdirection at the hands of a charismatic megalomaniac misleading an already misled and fractured society a warning that evidently fell on deaf ears before the eventual rise of the national socialists a little more than decade later at which point Lang promptly packed his bags and headed for the States. While at its heart The Gambler may simply be something of a protonoir gangster movie with light fantasy elements lurking somewhere in the foreboding shadows that dominate most the film's sets is a thinlyveiled sociopolitical commentary that canfor the most partbe a fascinating and engrossing thriller all at the same time.Mabuse is played by Rudolf KleinRogge best known these days as Rotwang the Inventor from Lang's most famous film Metropolis released five years following The Gambler. While his performance in the sciencefiction epic is limited but nevertheless memorable it's a true delight to see him take center stage here as he delivers an iconic performance of the madbutbrilliant Dr. Mabuse. As one of the character's central traits is psychological manipulation which he delivers through various fictional guises to further distract his victims KleinRogge is given plenty of room to jump between personas which vary between the bizarre and ruthlessly callous all of which he excels in bringing to life vividly. Supporting actors and actresses back up the leading man well specifically Alfred Abel also of limited Metropolis fame and Gertrude Welcker who together play a husband and wife soon at the mercy of Mabuse's twisted puppeteer hands. Bernhard Goetzke is fine as State prosecutor Norbert von Wenk but his character sticks too closely to convention to make him stand out as anything more than a pawn serving as the plot's catalyst to chug along with its rich character drama.Those who have seen Metropolis and are less familiar with Lang's earlier works may be surprised or disappointed by the director's more restrained approach to expressionist sets and effects here in The Gambler. While his contemporaries at the time Murnau Nosferatu and Wiene Caligari had fervently adopted the popular art movement in their respective films from the early 20s Lang was still something of a critic and instead opted to lightly season Mabuse rather than to glaze it every 15 minutes. Nevertheless much of the film's most memorable and compelling moments arise from these experiments in expressionism that often mirror the film's otherwise dark and brooding atmosphere with surreal imagery that conveys the characters' inner madness isolation torment and despair. It's no wonder then that Lang would go on to make Die Nibelungen and Metropolis each one more expressionist and surreal than the last.So having said all that it must also be noted that The Gambler is somewhere near 270 minutes long.

	onyx:emotionText "Following their ruinous defeat during the War Germany found itself in what is now commonly referred to as the Weimar era. It's a uniquely fascinating point in the country's history dominated by a stark contrast between impoverished casualties of war and lavishly wealthy benefactors soaking in aloof decadence. This divide between societal poles was not exactly one unlikely to be crossed by any daring enough to grab a boat and travel the uncertain waters however and director Fritz Lang frequently visits this idea throughout his first major feature film still highly regarded to this day. Bouncing back and forth between seedy gangsters the hoitytoity elite and those unfortunate enough to be tasked with keeping everything in order the law Lang embellishes his film with a unique and varied palette of both character and tone for its time. Based on the novel Dr. Mabuse der Spieler by Norbert Jacques the story follows psychoanalystbyday undergroundcriminalmastermind bynight Dr. Mabuse as he manipulates his way up the rungs of society seemingly with ease through various nefarious means including stock market manipulation and psychological mindcontrol during card games at highprofile gambling joints. The central theme here warns of granting overwhelming dominance through terror and misdirection at the hands of a charismatic megalomaniac misleading an already misled and fractured society a warning that evidently fell on deaf ears before the eventual rise of the national socialists a little more than decade later at which point Lang promptly packed his bags and headed for the States. While at its heart The Gambler may simply be something of a protonoir gangster movie with light fantasy elements lurking somewhere in the foreboding shadows that dominate most the film's sets is a thinlyveiled sociopolitical commentary that canfor the most partbe a fascinating and engrossing thriller all at the same time.Mabuse is played by Rudolf KleinRogge best known these days as Rotwang the Inventor from Lang's most famous film Metropolis released five years following The Gambler. While his performance in the sciencefiction epic is limited but nevertheless memorable it's a true delight to see him take center stage here as he delivers an iconic performance of the madbutbrilliant Dr. Mabuse. As one of the character's central traits is psychological manipulation which he delivers through various fictional guises to further distract his victims KleinRogge is given plenty of room to jump between personas which vary between the bizarre and ruthlessly callous all of which he excels in bringing to life vividly. Supporting actors and actresses back up the leading man well specifically Alfred Abel also of limited Metropolis fame and Gertrude Welcker who together play a husband and wife soon at the mercy of Mabuse's twisted puppeteer hands. Bernhard Goetzke is fine as State prosecutor Norbert von Wenk but his character sticks too closely to convention to make him stand out as anything more than a pawn serving as the plot's catalyst to chug along with its rich character drama.Those who have seen Metropolis and are less familiar with Lang's earlier works may be surprised or disappointed by the director's more restrained approach to expressionist sets and effects here in The Gambler. While his contemporaries at the time Murnau Nosferatu and Wiene Caligari had fervently adopted the popular art movement in their respective films from the early 20s Lang was still something of a critic and instead opted to lightly season Mabuse rather than to glaze it every 15 minutes. Nevertheless much of the film's most memorable and compelling moments arise from these experiments in expressionism that often mirror the film's otherwise dark and brooding atmosphere with surreal imagery that conveys the characters' inner madness isolation torment and despair. It's no wonder then that Lang would go on to make Die Nibelungen and Metropolis each one more expressionist and surreal than the last.So having said all that it must also be noted that The Gambler is somewhere near 270 minutes long. What I've highlighted above are areas where around twothirds of that runtime fully take advantage of what Mabuse has to offer. The other third is more problematic and occurs mostly during its middle section where the catandmouse game between Mabuse and Norbert von Wenk goes around in circles. Though there are highlights here and there a long stretch of 90 or so minutes occurs that feels like it could have been chopped down to 30 without much consequence other than to make the pace of the film easier to digest. And yes I know the movie is in fact a twopart deal but the fact that this means the first movie's ending is lacklustre and the second movie's opening lacks the enthralling immediacy of its predecessor doesn't change anything and still hurts an otherwise wellpaced film.Dr. Mabuse's first outing on the big screen is for the most part a rewarding and compelling experience but nevertheless presents the viewer with a challenging middle half that tugs along lethargically rather than with the brisk pace that bookends the feature.

	schema:reviewBody "Dr. Mabuse the Gambler aka Dr Mabuse der SpielerThis is a twopart film by Fritz Lang. The first part is called Dr. Mabuse the Gambler An Image of the Times and the second is Inferno People of the Times. Together the movie is over three and a half hours long. It is based on a novel written by Norbert Jacques and the script for Lang's film was written by his wife Thea von Harbou who had been married to one the film's stars Rudolf KleinRogge. The film is difficult but interesting for a number of reasons.The gist of the plot is that Dr. Mabuse played by KleinRogge is the archfiend of all society an evil genius who can rule the world by the force of his will. He has a gang of henchmen that he controls in various ways violence hypnotism corruption money. Mabuse is wealthy from various schemes stock market fraud counterfeiting and gambling. Mabuse affects a series of disguises when he gambles. He wins by overpowering the minds of the fellows at his table and making them lose even when they have winning hands. As an arch fiend Dr. Mabuse is the godfather of all the James Bond movie villains. The will of Dr. Mabuse is an irresistible force.Our hero is State Attorney von Wenk played with admirable restraint by Bernhard Goetzke. I'd put Goetzke in the same league as Sam Shepard in terms of looks and acting. Even though it's a silent movie we can tell von Wenk is laconic  there are lengthy scenes of him clenching his jaw as he ponders whatever he's pondering the camera lingering on his handsome face. Von Wenk is made aware of numerous complaints of cardsharking at clubs and casinos but it's always a different man we know of course that it's Mabuse in disguise von Wenk goes out to various gambling halls to ferret out his prey. And the game is afoot.Mabuse and von Wenk meet both in disguise and fail to recognize each other. One of the fascinating parts of the movie is that von Wenk has heard of Mabuse as a psychiatrist and actually recommends to one of Mabuse's dupes that the dupe see Dr. Mabuse for treatment naturally it ends badly. The bulk of the first part of the movie sets us up to see Mabuse as the archfiend with his hordes of dupes doing his bidding whether they know it or not whether they want to or not. Mabuse runs by his watch and the beginning shows him constantly checking it and taking his servants to task for not being timely. His stock market manipulations require timing and he carries them off with aplomb as all around him panic. He's silent throughout the chaotic scenes except for two statements I'm buying then I'm selling.The film is set in 1922 when the Weimar Republic was at the height of inflation and the depths of morality. Lang gives us An Image of the Times. Mabuse's speculations and criminal schemes fit into the milieu of the times in Germany. Mabuse has no morals no scruples his goal to to get whatever he wants when he wants it. From his point of view there is only will. Mabuse has the will and he will have his way.In the second part we see the havoc wrought on the people Mabuse has well abused. Suicides protracted prison terms deaths all at the will of Mabuse. The inferno is in the mind and Mabuse burns people up then discards them as the trash they are.I don't recommend this film for beginners in the experience of silent movies. It is very long and the pacing is leisurely. Lang sets up long portraits of his actors and shows them moodily staring for long seconds. The script is not realistic and the characters are not naturalistic. The acting sidles toward the stylized armthrownacrossthebrow to show anguish but because nothing is natural in the movie this style works here without being laughably histrionic. The sets verge toward German Expressionism but maintain a certain reality that makes the apartments and rooms more believable as actual homes than for example the sets in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Dr. Mabuse the Gambler is a long series of long portraits of characters and settings. Lang establishes his characters by showing them in inaction.The movie can be seen as a portrayal of the corruption of the Weimar Republic. The years immediately preceding 1922 were fraught with violence in the streets as extremists battled each other for control of cities and states within the republic. The government had started printing money to repay huge debts but there were no goods to sell to other countries to earn the marks. This led to hyperinflation one of Mabuse's counterfeiting schemes was to print only US dollars because other currencies devalued before he could dispose of the counterfeits.But this was also an era of unparalleled creativity of which Dr. Mabuse is a prime example. The cabaret scene in Germany in the Twenties was unrivaled in its sexuality the various treatments of Cabaret bear this out but also unrivaled in its success as entertainment. The Bauhaus school of architecture and Expressionism in theatre art and cinema are just two of the Weimar Republic's contributions to culture.Be that as it may instead of the triumph of the will expected by Dr. Mabuse we find him at the end insane. His attraction to Countess Told is worse the fatal  Mabuse's will is impotent in the face of her refusal of him. Perhaps Dr. Mabuse the Gambler foretells the rise of Hitler and his minions and dupes. Or perhaps the decadence and collapse of the Weimar Republic spawned arch villains willy nilly. Who can tell?".

	schema:reviewBody "It looks as if the communist rule in former East Germany is a nice source of inspiration for German film makers. First there was the lighthearted comedy Goodbye Lenin. Then the heart wrenching drama Das Leben der Anderen. And now there's Barbara. Another drama about a human being whose life is ruined by the regime. The film is mainly about trust. Or about not being able to trust anyone in a police state like East Germany. Barbara is a doctor who is banned from Berlin and put to work in a hospital in a provincial town in the north of the country. Soon enough we find out why she has a lover in West Germany and wants to escape from the country. She is bitter and full of resentment but cares a lot about her patients especially about a young girl who lives in a nearby labour camp and turns out to be pregnant. Several times we learn how oppressive this country was. 'No one can be happy here' says Barbara when her lover proposes to come and live with her in the East. 'I want my baby to go away' says the pregnant girl and she doesn't mean abortion. 'Do you think they will let me go if I marry him?' asks a girl who also has a Western lover. 'No' is Barbara's short and clear answer. The film is very strong in atmosphere but there is also suspense. There are even some Hitchcocklike moments. One is a scene where Barbara tries to locate a colleague and finds him in the house of the Stasiofficer who has searched her apartment. It makes you wonder if the doctor too is a Stasiinformant. One of the other strong points is the acting. Nina Hoss is very convincing as the bitter distrustful Barbara who only really can relax in the company of her Western lover. And there is the cinematography that adds to the almost claustrophobic atmosphere. The camera hardly moves the shots are static and show exactly what needs to be showed. The end is quite surprising and adds a nice and meaningful twist to a beautiful movie.".

	schema:headline " much more accurate than 'Lives of Others'";
	schema:reviewBody "It's a challenging task to depict a bygone era which hasn't yet passed into history but is a living memory in the minds of many. Distant events may be easily interpreted at will because no spectator can expect a minute reconstruction of a reality past. Adaptations of recent events however fall under close scrutiny of those who were actually there and any attempt to 'tell the whole story' will invariably meet with criticism from those who feel left out of the picture or who remember differently. It is therefore the best solution for the film maker to focus on atmosphere rather than events and a simple story rather than a complex rendition of society as a whole. And that's what director screenwriter Christian Petzold does he tells the story of a doctor displaced from the capital to the province for an application to leave the country and confronting an atmosphere of distrust while preparing her escape to the West. This routine of hostility is a little ameliorated by the interest of a male colleague who may however be an assigned informer and the friendship to a pregnant patient who apparently escaped from a juvenile offenders camp only to be recaptured.What makes me consider this film as far superior to the much lauded Oscarwinning 'The Lives of Others' is that it does not sacrifice atmosphere to film making conventions. For instance there is no music because there was no music. 'The Lives of Others' tormented any actual witness of the times it described with a sappy soundtrack. It also did not correspond to my recollections of East Germany because it limited the supervision of ordinary citizens to the Stasi 'State Security' and its collaborators. It did point out that this supervision was omnipresent but it created a division between good and evil which was slowly eroded from the evil side's end. 'Barbara' however focuses on the way ordinary citizens not intellectuals were treated and the fact that virtually everyone collaborated in the supervision of the individual whether they were working with the Stasi or not. Barbara is fully aware of her situation and tries to make friends with her colleagueinformer Andr Reiser to win him over to her side while at the same time not giving anything away about herself. Reiser on the other hand tries to gain her trust as a person because he needs her competence at work and may be romantically interested in her while at the same time fulfilling his obligations to report on her.This constant game of hide and seek illustrates what Socialism was really like  a permanent grey zone in which you had to measure your steps carefully and no clear distinctions between good and evil existed as 'The Lives of Others' would have you believe and the young patient side characters show that quite a few cracked under this immense pressure. By focusing on one woman's story director Petzold delivers an accurate portrait of the realities of life at that time it did not matter whether you were good at your job or not and being too good made you automatically suspicious while being lazy made you the target of accusations of boycotting society it was dangerous to open up to colleagues because they would almost certainly be inquired about what you said but at the same time it was dangerous to distance yourself because then you'd be suspected of having something to hide. Everything was tactics nothing was spontaneous everybody wanted to get out but chastised those who actually tried. This authenticity has probably prompted this film's selection as the German candidate for the foreign language Oscar 2013 but it may also have hampered its chances to win the Golden Bear upon its premiere at the Berlin Film Festival where Petzold won the director's prize though. Realism makes for an accurate portrayal of the recent past but for those who have not been there 'Barbara' may be a bit too stiff and gloomy because it does not compromise its authenticity to the expectations of Western audiences.".

In Barbara Petzold has fashioned not only a superb character study but a film that illuminates the effects of oppression on the human psyche an oppression that ended in Germany only with the dismantling of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of East and West many years later. The film shows the East German security apparatus' Stasi use of intimidation and disorientation as tools in operating a system of control and surveillance directed at those suspected of opposing the GDR.Portrayed by Nina Hoss in a performance of remarkable nuance and authenticity Barbara an East Berlin doctor has been exiled to a small clinic in the provinces after applying for an exit visa to visit her boyfriend in the West. She is a tall stately and attractive woman yet taciturn and distant her face filled with an indescribable sadness. Trying to serve her patients as best she can she knows that she is under surveillance by the Stasi particularly by Officer Klaus Schutz Rainer Bock who does not hesitate to conduct unannounced searches of Barbara's apartment even her person and whose presence in her life is all too visible.Not knowing whom to trust thinking perhaps rightly so that her friends and colleagues may be police informants Barbara's aloofness leads her colleagues to give her the nickname of Berlin to describe what they think is her bigcity attitude. On the job however she does not allow her fears to get in the way of her professional responsibilities and her relationship with her patients shows her hidden warmth. Dr. Andr Reiser Ronald Zehrfeld a softlooking slightly heavyset doctor solicits her friendship and offers repeatedly to drive her home but she keeps him at arms length suspicious of his possible connections.In spite of this tense atmosphere Barbara manages to befriend Stella Jasna Fritzi Bauer a young patient who escaped from a work camp at Torgau. Correctly diagnosing her with Meningitis a diagnosis that the other doctors had overlooked she reads The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn to her in the evening a story of two people on the run. More tension is added when we see Barbara's surreptitious exchange of black market cigarettes and packets of money with people unknown. In a rapturous meeting with her West German lover Jorg Mark Waschke in a secluded forest area she is given the choice of leaving the country with him reassured that because of his circumstances she would no longer have to work.Barbara and her friend make plans but her growing relationship with Andr and ties to young Stella become complicating factors. Andr's own story of how he ended up in the village only adds to her confusion and uncertainty. Barbara is an understated gem that never hits us over the head with its message but leaves no doubt about its implications. While the film depicts the circumstances in a particular country it transcends its limitations to become a universal experience. A compelling and riveting film it begins in resignation and ends in transformation.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story is set in East Germany in 1980 when it looked like Communism would last forever. Central character is Dr. Barbara Wolff played by the classically beautiful blonde Nina Hoss who I've previously seen in A Woman In Berlin. Dr. Wolff was a fast track young doctor at the Charite the big teaching hospital in Berlin before she fell in love with a West German businessman and applied for an exit visa. That got her a short spell in prison for ingratitude to the workers and farmers who paid for her medical education together with a transfer to a one horse town in Mecklenburg where she seems to be the second doctor in a two doctor pediatric clinic. We know all this because as she is getting off the bus the local Stasi man is going through her file with Andre the head doctor at the clinic. Andre is what they used to call an Inoffiziale Mitarbeiter or unofficial cooperator. We find out why later on. He's also an attractive shambling 30 something bachelor in a kind of teddy bear way a skilled dedicated doctor with a good bedside manner and notwithstanding his work as an informer a pretty decent guy by the standards of the time and place.Barbara twigs immediately that Andre's an informer when he offers her a lift home from work on the first day. As they drive through an intersection in his piece of crap Trabant she says you were supposed to ask me which way to turn but then you already know where I live. She is resentful understandably so and standoffish which the clinic staff put down to stuck up Berlin attitude. That may have something to do with the open surveillance by the Stasi guy and regular searches of her apartment complete with strip searches by a female agent. But Barbara is also a first class doctor who takes a real interest in her patients. Andre is quietly smitten  if you've seen Hoss you'll know why  and keeps chipping away at her resistance. Despite knowing who else he works for she can't help responding.What neither Andre nor the Stasi agent know is that Barbara is contriving to meet her Wessi boyfriend when he's in the East on business and they're scheming to smuggle her out. He's crazy about her even saying that he'd move East if she wants but there are slight intimations that life in the West with him might not be exactly as she's dreamed of. In any event there's a lot of sneaking about and Hoss has a good line in tense body language and over the shoulder glances. Everybody knows everybody's business in a small town anyway and in a small town in Mecklenburg your landlady your coworkers or anyone you pass on the street could be an informer. Complications ensue involving Andre the escape plan and Barbara's obligations to two young patients in whom she has taken a special interest. I won't tell you how they play out except that nothing goes quite as expected. The movie gives you a very good sense of a society in which everyone is compromised in some way trust and intimacy are not really possible but life has to go on nevertheless. It's not as showy as The Lives of Others but it gives a better sense of what everyday life was like in the German Democratic Republic where it has been estimated that there was one Stasi employee for every 165 citizens and one informer for every 6.5.".

Everybody knows everybody's business in a small town anyway and in a small town in Mecklenburg your landlady your coworkers or anyone you pass on the street could be an informer. Complications ensue involving Andre the escape plan and Barbara's obligations to two young patients in whom she has taken a special interest. I won't tell you how they play out except that nothing goes quite as expected. The movie gives you a very good sense of a society in which everyone is compromised in some way trust and intimacy are not really possible but life has to go on nevertheless. It's not as showy as The Lives of Others but it gives a better sense of what everyday life was like in the German Democratic Republic where it has been estimated that there was one Stasi employee for every 165 citizens and one informer for every 6.5.";

	schema:reviewBody "The clever doctor Barbara Wolf is by the authorities placed out in the provincial parts of the Eastern German Republic die DDR. We're in 1980 nine years before the fall of the Berlin wall and the Iron curtain. She has a lover from the free West Germany and wants to move to the West which is out if question for the paranoid communist government which became famous for the surveillance techniques and spying systems. It's later revealed that 17th of the population was forced to spy on others even family members to prevent opposition as well as getting too much contact with Western ideas and ideologies.In the province she meets another clever doctor placed in the province after a mishap pending at a Berlin hospital. Or is this just a cover up story of a spying agent? Barbara can't tell. She knows there are possible spies all over. She rightfully trusts no one. For her it's an impossible idea for her lover to move over to Eastern Germany as opposed to her getting to the West.For those living today it's almost impossible to comprehend how it was like to live in DDR Eastern Germany during the communist years. It was a society impossible to imagine only possibly equaled today by North Korea. The state intelligence police Stasi was almost everywhere planting spies and surveillance equipment.This film doesn't explain the system. You're just put right into it. This might make it hard to understand without having the knowledge of how extreme this society was almost like George Orwell's great and scary novel 1984 in real life. Barbara is under constant surveillance when she's not far away from people. She's so suspected to do illegal things that she frequently body and anally strip searched when the Stasi visits her.I visited Eastern Germany 1988 before the wall came down. The visit marked me for life both as a Westerner and a Norwegian being able to visit ad a tourist where they equaled the value of Western currency marks to the Eastern marks though only valued 120th. Still they thought they could keep the longing for the Western freedom from being planted into the DDRinhabitants. I visited the concentration camp Sachsenhausen and I experienced the railways where there was no smile to see the feel of total depression and bleak or hardly any colored lights as an opposite to the sparkling neon lights of the West and the total surveillance of the center of Berlin. No western lyrics and western music was allowed hardly any Western cars. If it could have any kind of opposition interpreted into it or dreams of the Western freedom it was disallowed. If you tried to flee to the West you would be instantly shot! I was terrified for four hours in my last trip back to Western Berlin was halted for four hours when they took my passport and ran away with it.Today it seems we're not afraid of being under constant surveillance. This is just another reminder of how terrible it s not to have a free will and not have the right to your own life. It's so inhumane and humiliating. But we're in our way right into the same kind of society.It's a very god film but the understated telling and explaining is really too difficult to understand for most today. When Barbara is giving away her opportunity to flee she's giving up her dreams of freedom. I think most without having the background to understand this will understand the film. For most it will seem slow and leave too many questions. So read yourself up on what the DDRpolitics where before you see this.And remember that freedom is something we can't give away! Ever!".

There is work that she loves doing. And there is this openhearted sympathetic doctor that seems to have affection for her. This is a love story told subtly.

	schema:reviewBody "Barbara 2012A somber tightly scripted almost oldfashioned film. I can picture this in black white or a movie not only set in 1980 but shot then too. I mean this all as a compliment.It's key to know that this is Communist East Germany a closed country under Soviet influence and generally struggling to keep up with West Germany. The doldrums depicted and the lower quality of medical care at this small provincial clinic are very real. The title character is a downtrodden doctor who was caught trying to escape to the West and was sent to the boondocks as punishment. And she is periodically searched by the authorities who go through her apartment her body cavities her entire personal life while she passively waits. It's awful. And very real.There is a steady vague story line showing Barbara's contacts to sympathetic Germans and it seems one or two of them are visiting now and then from the West. Clandestine meetings with money and sex continue in the woods but these are minor points in her steady work as a doctor in the clinic.More important it turns out is the cute and steadyhanded male doctor who runs the clinic. She doesn't trust him. If he asks questions out of curiosity she isn't sure if he's a spy or just a nice guy. We aren't sure either. His life is simple and has simple pleasures and he likes her and tries to make her open up and actually smile which turns out to be the hardest thing in the whole movie.Barbara's plans to escape seem to be threatened by her job commitment which she can't shirk because it'll draw attention to her irregularities. And so things go in this windy North German countryside. It's so beautifully patiently wrought you have to watch and wait just as passively as Barbara. It's sad for sure and yet there are these small glimmers. For one thing there is the idea that no matter what your circumstances there is always the ability to be good and to do good. The male doctor is the example of this and Barbara begins to see something more genuine at work than her own superficial we assume strivings for a consumerist West.It's odd to see such a balanced and yet truthful view of Communist Germany. The oppression is real and bad but the strivings of regular people doctors and others make hope possible. I loved this movie even though fairly little happens and there are few turns of the plot that are clearly for dramatic impact more than an integral building of character. But these are small caveats. The total effect is simple and penetrating with a beautiful ending.".

At that time the Berlin Wall had already been fallen down but Germany had not reunited yet.People could freely come and go over the borders between East and West Germany. I went through Checkpoint Charlie to East Berlin and I visited retrofuture TV tower and saw Ladas running on street.In a night train from Berlin to Prague I asked a passenger who sat next to me if Germany would reunite in a year and he answered that he didn't believe it would happen so early. In fact Germany reunited in October 1990.Although I actually visited East Berlin now it is hardly for me to believe that the half of Germany was a communist state just twentythree years ago.Barbara is a German film about people living in East Germany in 1980. Barbara is a female doctor who was watched by the secret police.It is one of the greatest German films that I have ever seen. There is no exaggeration and omission in this film. Every element in it is necessary and I couldn't find that any things were unnecessary.This film is very quiet because there is no background music. That makes audience concentrated in every tiny sound. Barbara was always nervous about the secret police so she got surprised when the doorbell started to ring and the audience also got really surprised with the sound of the doorbell and fully understood her emotion.Nina Hoss as Barbara was also great and attractive. She didn't overplay at all but accurately expressed how Barbara felt in her mind. After seeing her performance most actors and actress became to look unnatural.This film is a quiet simple and elegant. If you love films I strongly recommend you to see it.".

There she is still being spied on by the Stasi. The chief physician of the hospital likes her but is constantly rejected because she fears he is also a collaborator.The movie gave me a real good feeling under which oppression intellectuals must have suffered in the Stasi era especially how this constant climate of mistrust negatively influenced their ability to building normal relationships to any othernew people. Acting by main actors scenery and screenplay are excellent.To me in general most movies from Germany are very uninspiring this country could do so much better But this one is outstanding one of the best things coming from there in the last years. 910 only for the little bit unrealistic ending which I will not reveal of course".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was shown last night at the Bath Film Festival and was a sell out. Personally it was a huge disappointment. Let me begin by saying that my wife spent the first 12 years of her life in a communist state leaving Hungary in 1964 I would add that we spent many long holidays in Hungary before 1989 which on more than one occasion involved making use of the Hungarian health service. So I would start my review by saying that in the details of the East German health service and of life behind the Iron Curtain generally the film has it spot on  the lack of drugs poor hygiene buildings homes and hospital falling to bits rubbish cars a senior doctor has a Wartburg one of East Germany's better cars but definitely NOT a BMW warnings to order coal in the spring if you want it in the Autumn etc. They also have it right about who you could trust or not  after my FiL left Hungary in 1956 he found out that a 'friend' had been spying on him and the everpresence of the 'security' services. My problem with the film is the laziness of the script. Nina Hoss is pitch perfect in her role and her character doesn't really do anything wrong it is the others which are at fault. To a certain extent the film is about her choosing between 2 men but one the one she hopes to join in the West is shown to be a callous jerk who seems to want her purely for sex indeed almost to be paying her for it the other is a very good looking and b drawn in ludicrously sympathetic light almost as some kind of communist Dr Kildare. I also don't like films where the outcome is decided by an enormous coincidence as someone has pointed out above how does Stella know where Barbara lives and secondly how very convenient that she turns up on the night that Barbara's escape to the West is supposed to take place. I am not the smartest cookie in the jar but I had spotted that coming from halfway through the film. An opportunity missed I am afraid.".

	schema:reviewBody "Christian Petzold was born in 1960 so it's not a given that he is familiar with Jacques Prevert's poem 'Barbara' which was subsequently set to music and recorded by Yves Montand amongst others despite the esteem in which it is held  for many years and possibly even today for all I know every school child in France was required to learn it by heart. I bring it up because Prevert's poem was antiwar specifically the second World War and by extension Germany and Petzold's Barbara is antiEast Germany for roughly the forty years when it was under Communist rule. The film is held together by Nina Hoss who is more than up to the task of carrying a film singlehanded. She plays a doctor exiled from Berlin to a onestethoscope town in North Germany where she is harassed and humiliated by the Stasi because she has a lover in Western Germany and clearly has eyes to follow him. If that were all it would be a case of so what but she is also a dedicated and humane doctor and more than half of her wants to stay where she is and do something worthwhile. About two thirds of the way through it occurred to me I was unaware of any background music  I checked the credits on IMDb and there is a 'music' credit so either I was so engrossed in the film  and it's deliberately 'measured' pace tends to draw you in  that I didn't hear such music as was there or else it was edited out. Only once was I a tad disappointed by sloppy writing  one of Barbara's patients who has grown attached to Barbara has been brutally removed from hospital as soon as she is well enough presumably never to be heard of again. Towards the end of the film this patient appears at Barbara's door yet clearly she could have had no idea where the doctor's private flat was. Though I registered this immediately I see a lot of films sue me it failed to mar my enjoyment of an excellent effort.".

Barbara does do something nice for underdeveloped Stella allowing her to get away with the money she raised for herself to get away this causes her to return to the young boy who tried to commit suicide and came to the hospital.The main performance by Nina Hoss is OK because most of her performance is in her eyes and that's why I think she is best in the film making this complicated character more likable to everyone. Other actors Ronald Zehrfeld Mark Waschke and Jasna Fritzi Bauer are OK but to me the film all belongs to Hoss and she carries the film on her shoulders making it better then in could have been.Nice film but I found it very boring even nodding off sometimes but Hoss was very good and that's why I stayed to watch the film.MOVIE GRADE D MVP Nina Hoss".

She used to work at the prestigious Berlin hospital but has been transferred to a small rural hospital for reasons that aren't immediately obvious but it is clear that she has done something that the regime didn't approve of. While working at the hospital it becomes clear that the Stasi are keeping close tabs on her her boss clearly knows more about her than one would expect and when she disappears from their surveillance she gets a less than subtle visit from the Stasi. We later learn that she was punished for applying for permission to leave the country and she hasn't given up her plans to leave.We see that she is a caring and competent doctor just the sort the hospital needs she diagnoses a case of meningitis that others have missed and later realises another patient needs an urgent operation. During this time she grows professionally closer to her superior Dr Andr Reiser despite suspecting that he is informing for the dreaded Stasi. As time passes and the day of her escape to the west approaches she must decide between freedom in the West and staying at the hospital where her skills are needed.Having seen 'The Lives of Others' I was expecting another grim urban setting but this was set in beautiful countryside something that contrasts with Barbara's basic apartment and the underequipped hospital where she works. The story is told with a surprisingly light touch given the subject matter the scenes of Barbara cycling through the countryside are positively bucolic. Nina Hoss carries the story as Barbara but is ably supported by Ronald Zehrfeld who played Dr Reiser and Rainer Bock who plays the sinister Stasi Officer Klaus Schtz. While there is little actual violence there is the feeling that there is a real danger for Barbara especially when the Stasi search her flat and more disturbingly her body. The dilemma of whether she will try to escape or not is nicely depicted and her final decision is depicted in a believable way. Overall I think this German drama is well worth watching it may not be fast paced but it is still fairly gripping.".

The Stasi remains present naturally.If you stereotype Germans as taking a grim approach to things then this movie will confirm your assumptions. Practically every scene is minimalist and there's the possibility that the man running the clinic is a spy. Barbara can only do her best to help people namely the young woman who ran away from a labor camp.The complex characters and subtleties of the plot make this one movie that you have to see. Focuses on repressive regimes are a common motif in cinema but this one makes clear that an autocratic government isn't necessarily one that sends death squads through the countryside to indiscriminately massacre people although that was what the USbacked juntas in Central America did. In the end Barbara does the only thing that someone in her predicament can do.Good one.".

If you are an avid filmmaker wanting to know exactly what not to do watch this movie. And if you are in disbelief about what I have said then go watch the movie. Either way you will never laugh more. And the deleted scenes will also provide a few more sideaching crackups see even I can make stupid fart puns.There are also surprisingly a few familiar faces such as Paul Giamatti from Sideways American Splendor and Man on the Mooon why Paul why!! as well as Stephen Fry from Blackadder and Kiera Knightley in a 5 second cameo.

The film is silly the acting is over the top the entire premise of the film is that a boy farts a lot  how can anyone expect that it should be seen as anything serious?I think that the movie is funny  silly yes but still funny. It is also touching and actually has a quite heartwarming story about friendship about being special and about turning your uniqueness from a weakness into a strength. It is also a critique of adults and their tendency to lie cheat and misrepresent everything for their own gain. There is a small scene set in a courtroom where a metallurgist is pressed to express opinions beyond his professional knowledge and to me it conveys how everything in the adult world is about politics and power rather than about friendship and respect as in the children's' world.I also find it interesting that just as the main character describes every experience as either the worst day of my life ever or the best day of my life ever  the reviewers seem to think that this is the worst piece of film ever  or the best ever.It may not be the best film ever but it is great fun nice for an afternoon's laugh and just so plain silly that you can't but smile at every single scene or character.Enjoy!".

And thats it the rest of this annoying film just focuses on toilet jokes. And I don't mean classy toilet jokes like Dumb and Dummer I mean stupid unfunny toilet jokes like Thunderpants.Every so often literally every 6 seconds the paragon of gluttony breaks wind. This is usually followed by a long pause as if the cast are waiting for the audience to laugh that laugh never comes. In fact after the first hellish 15 minutes of this tosh I could distinctly hear groaning coming from the back of the cinema as the 219th fart in the film went off followed by the abnormally long pause for laughter. Some people would defend this film its just a kids movie they would say this may be but I don't think the 30 children shuffling in their seats and whining to their parents about how much longer the movie was on for were entertained. One child even started crying I'm bored I'm bored and burst into tears when the parents demanded him to stay and watch the rest of this sht. No no he wasn't entertained. The only people who could enjoy this film and I mean REALLY enjoy are Harry Potter fanboys. They would only watch it for Rupert Grint though marvelling at him and then make up some lie when the credits roll and say they liked it for the plot the special effects or maybe even the music score. I truly believe if it was some other kid playing the part of the geeky kid and not Rupert nobody would like this film. Except the director and maybe even he would be lying.FEAR THIS FILM LIKE THE BUBONIC PLAGUE".

The acting by Rupert Grint AKA Ron Weasley from Harry Potter and Bruce Cook Patrick Smash is terrific.

The acting was fairly poor too despite the undeniably talented cast. Stephen Fry Paul Giamatti Celia Irmrie and Simon Callow quite visibly put some enthusiasm into their performances but are given very little to work with and came across as wasted. Same with Rupert Grint. And the direction was literally nonexistent. Overall a real stinker that is too childish crude and predictable for my tastes and when we saw this at the cinema my mum looked as though she wanted to go home less than 10 minutes into the movie. 110 for the talented cast.

None of the special effects are bad either  not even the outer space scenes are badly done. I don't really care what anybody else thinks  I think Thunderpants is a great British kid's film that will entertain anyone. Of course it is as predictable as hell but which film isn't these days? At least it is understandable and not insulting and actually carries a very important message that you should ruminate on after the film finishes.This is fart humour at its very best and should really be a high 6 or a low 7. So I say this to every IMDb voter  get Thunderpants off the bottom 100! 910 P.S.

At least it is understandable and not insulting and actually carries a very important message that you should ruminate on after the film finishes.This is fart humour at its very best and should really be a high 6 or a low 7. So I say this to every IMDb voter  get Thunderpants off the bottom 100! 910 P.S. To everybody who gave this a 1  I'd like to see you make your own films and see how bad they truly are before you mouth off about other people's work.";

	schema:reviewBody "Born with two stomachs Patrick Smash is a normal boy in that he constantly farts however for Patrick it is different as he doesn't do it for laughs  he actually cannot stop. His father cannot cope and leaves his mother turns to drink and his only friend at school is a ginger genius boy whose nerdy ways make him equally a target for bullies. Patrick has one dream  to become an astronaut but he knows that to do this he must solve his problems and discover the gift that will make him a unique member of any team. With Alan's help he gets a pair of trousers which contain his gases and make him normal. When Alan goes away in mysterious circumstances Patrick thinks he will never get the other half of his goal  to discover his gift but then a series of chance events sees him starting the most important journey of his life.I don't really feel like I have any reason to complain because at the end of the day I sat down to watch a children's film called Thunderpants in full knowledge that the plot was pretty much about a young boy with uncontrollable flatulence. Regardless of this I sat to watch it and found a film that had some things going for it but was overwhelmed by a film that revels in the silliness of the affair in a rather childish manner. I suppose that this will draw giggles from an audience of young children but then this still leaves adults with nothing to do. At least in some kids films the product is good enough to at least distract adults but here they will struggle to get over the fact that unless you like fart jokes then there won't be much else for you. That said I did actually laugh a few times and it did have at least one aspect that kept me engaged  the cast.This is not to say that they were any good but more that I was constantly taken by surprise by how many big names seem to have thought this material fit of adding their weight to. Cook is fairly bland although with such a poor character this is no real surprise his flat and unfunny voiceover is an irritation though. Grint is pretty simplistic as well with no real imagination in his genius character. The film features a bewildering number of wellknown faces in small roles and I really did wonder what made them feel that this film was worth supporting with their presence. Callow is pretty poor Fry is amusing in his usual upperclass rather clipped fashion Beatty seems to be at least entering into the spirit of things but Giamatti just seems to be getting through the film rather than getting into it. However even he looks like he has made a good choice when compared to the presence of the great Leslie Phillips who has nothing to do at all to do.Overall this is a poor film but it is not as awful as some would have you believe. The fart jokes will amuse kids although it is likely that at the age to find it funny they will then get bored when the plot proper kicks in. Adults will find it all too childish and silly but will perhaps get some laughs here and there and will at least be bemused if not actually entertained by the presence of so many famous faces for no discernible reason. The ultimate message of overcoming etc is a bit smug and obvious and you do have to wonder whether parents will really want their kids to watch a film that encourages farting as an admirable quality.".

Patrick Smash has a dream like everybody. He is the main character in the movie Thunderpants. His dream is to become an astronaut. Beside that he cant stop farting. This is the biggest problem ever for Patrick as he is always excluded because of his problem. His father leaves home his sister hates him he is a laughing stock and item of abuse by his schoolmates and teachers. His gift inspires his friend Alan A Allen to invent different stuff. Anyway Alan leaves Patrick without a trace and that breaks Patrick's heart. Patrick is discovered by a tenor who uses his farting disability for his success and takes Patrick to a world tour which allows Patrick to find Allen. It turns out that Alan is also discovered by USA for inventions for space trips. In the end Patrick and Allen meet Patrick is offered the best offer he has ever had to go to space and save the American astronauts stuck in the space. He has to start the ship with his farts though. In the end he becomes a national hero and his dream comes true. Thunderpants is not a very very bad movie. But for me its theme and characters are unbelievably bad. Look at Paul GiamattiI think this must be the lowest degree in his career since he did Sideways and fighting for an Oscar with Cindrella Man. Rupert Grinn is so annoying as a kid who talks like a kid trapped in a 80 year old's body.Thunderpants might be a great fun but only for children around ten years old. For adults Avoid Thunderpants.  out of ".

Farting is THE universal common denominator it's probably the one thing everyone in the world has in common we all fart. And we all have dreams. And that's what this film is really about finding your dream and realising it. From the We've got a flier! during the birth sequence at the start of the film to the shot when Patrick opens the wardrobe in the plane and finds all the stripy Tshirts to the wonderfully touching moment when Paul Giamatti's CIA man tells the pilot that Patrick is crying the movie is chock full of wonderful little touches and lines.Maybe that's the problem that people can't get round. Maybe it's too subtle for them if all they can see is the farting then I can understand why they don't think much of it. Fart jokes even wonderfully timed ones and some of the timing in this movie is superb can't sustain a whole movie. They don't.

Set on a long English summer in the early '80s SON OF RAMBOW is a comedy about friendship faith and the tough business of growing up. We see the story through the eyes of Will the eldest son of a fatherless Plymouth Brethren family. The Brethren regard themselves as God's 'chosen ones' and their strict moral code means that Will has never been allowed to mix with the other 'worldlies' listen to music or watch TV until he finds himself caught up in the extraordinary world of Lee Carter the school terror and maker of bizarre home movies. Carter exposes Will to a pirate copy of Rambo First Blood and from that moment Will's mind is blown wide open and he's easily convinced to be the stuntman in Lee Carters' diabolical home movie. Will's imaginative little brain is not only given chance to flourish in the world of film making but is also very handy when it comes to...";

	schema:reviewBody "I recently took this movie in at the 2007 Sundance film festival and am quite glad that I made the effort to sneak this little gem in. The movie was made by the very talented Garth Jennings of the famed music video production team Hammer and Tongs known for their visionary music videos and previously Hitcherhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Set in an average English town in 1982 the movie revolves around the interesting life of a 1213 year old boy named Will whose family is part of a strict religious group that prohibits him from having any friends outside the group and strictly forbids him from watchings any TV or Movies. Without these usual sources of childhood entertainment Will finds other ways to pass the time namely in drawing out his flourishing imagination that he scribbles and doodles all over the pages of his bible. One day Will unexpectedly crosses paths with the school terror Carter who also happens to be an amateur bootlegger at the local movie theater. Will whose never seen a movie before is caught off guard when at Carters home he sees Rambo playing on the TV the visuals of the movie explode in Will's imaginative mind and from there on out Will is forever changed. An unlikely friendship begins between Will and Carter as they begin production on Carter's home movie masterpiece Son of Rambow. The two children begin coming closer before their friendship is tested by a newwave French exchange student Didier Revolve. As the friendship between Will and Carter begins getting twisted so does his relationship with his family as the church group starts taking notice of Wills more worldly interests. In the end Will must stay true to himself and the film must go on.The performances by all the children were exceptional especially Carter who is the movie's sparkplug and provides comic relief frequently. As well as Didier the french exchange student who is a text book example of how absurd the whole new wave trends of the day were his appearances are all wildly amusing. The movie also has a fair amount of quirky animations and dream sequences that offer visual pleasures for the eyes and bring childhood doodles to life. The movie is just a brilliant little idea and it plays out so very well in all the settings and the characters are extremely likable in all manners the movie should play great for almost all ages".

	schema:reviewBody "Son of Rambow set in 1980's England tells the story of two young schoolboys making a homevideo addition to the Rambo series. This promising theme gives rise to one of the most hilarious comedies in recent cinema memorable not only for countless laughoutloud moments but also for its engaging and unexpectedly moving story.Will Proudfoot Bill Milner and Lee Carter Will Poulter are a chalk and cheese pairing thrown together by chance after being summoned to detention at school. Will from a fatherless family in the grip of the austerely religious Brethren is a heartwarmingly polite boy harbouring a boundlessly artistic imagination Carter from a parentless household is a lonely rebel with a total lack of respect for everyone except his astoundingly selfabsorbed brother marvellously played by Ed Westwick. And yet following their chance encounter the situation where nave and amiable Will is exploited by sharpwitted and seemingly cynical Carter is replaced by mounting empathy and friendship between the two alternately spurred and severed by their family backgrounds and their turbulent filmmaking.The two leads are remarkable debut actors making the story touching and believable and realising the film's comic potential. Poulter is hilarious in the role of Carter delivering stinging wit and outraged putdowns with aplomb. The shooting of the film provides some hysterical contrasts between grownup pretensions and childlike absurdity with gunbattle sequences ripped straight from 'Rambo First Blood' interspersed with footage of a flying dog attack.The overlapping secondary story portraying the schoolplayground infatuation with the New Wave style of French exchange student Didier is also a rich seam of humour the stinging parody of teenage culture culminates in Will and Carter's visit to the school common room populated by posing pogoing teens. The supporting cast of adults also includes some fine comic actors including Jessica Stevenson notably of TV comedy Spaced and Adam of the Adam and Joe Show fame.Writerdirector Garth Jennings skilfully weaves together the overlapping worlds of children teenagers and adults in this film with excellent dialogue and cinematography. The camerawork is striking in many places particularly the opening montage of front gardens with Lee riding his bike past and casually causing havoc. The film also benefits from its bubbly soundtrack composed by Joby Talbot. This is a superb comedy and definitely the best Rambo film ever.".

A kid's movie with a mix of laughoutloud moments and weirdly clever ones Son of Rambow plays out like an Eagle and Shark vs. Terabithia where unconventional morals collide with redeeming themes and several overactive imaginations.Sheltered to the point of solitude by an overprotective mother and a smothering religion young William Bill Milner resorts to expressing his creativity in elaborate illustrations in unlikely places. His diminutive world is forever changed when he crosses paths with school troublemaker Lee Carter who bullies him into helping film an amateur action movie. Initially reluctant his outlook changes after unintentionally viewing a bootlegged tape of First Blood. The explosive violence and unrestrained mayhem ignites Will's imagination and an unlikely friendship forms when the mismatched duo set about making Son of Rambow. The storyline follows a rather predictable progression but what makes the film unique is the multitude of exaggerated stereotypes and offthewall characters. Will's heavily sheltered childhood has created an introvert desperate to escape the confines of his lifestyle and he is alternately eccentric and sweetly innocent. Conniving and obnoxious terror Carter is contrary to Will in almost every way. Clearly a product of his disruptive upbringing he rebels against authority as often as possible and scoffs at the idea of order. Both boys suffer from a common ailment  the lack of a father figure and a stable home and watching their friendship grow is easily the most entertaining aspect of the film. Complementing these two are several conflicted characters whose eccentricities easily rival their own. Most notably is Didier a French foreign exchange student whose outrageous style and attitude awes the English boys into forming a cult of followers. Even many of the teachers and the nononsense Brother Joshua seem infused with peculiar traits in their personalities.While the most recognizable themes of staying true to one's heart and the bonds of friendship readily exist on the surface more unconventional morals frequent the underlying story. In this offbeat tale of growing up rebellion is viewed as comical and a necessary implement for combating the evils of order. Religion is shown as a suppressing tool of control confining both creativity and imagination as well as forbidding socializing with those outside the faith. Rarely in kid's movies do we see religion as the villain and rebellion the key to success.Paralleling the overactive imaginations of youth the fantastical characters and events are both the highlight of the film and it's only downside. So often the visuals and madcap occurrences will leave you torn between laughing out loud and raising an eyebrow in bewilderment. In the end this refreshingly bizarre take on the delirium of growing up entertains with its unconventional characters and antics  plus seeing a dead crow knock a kid off his bike never fails to amuse.Joel Massie".

It's worth seeing this film just for their performances.The film the two boys make within the film is quite charming too and is itself better than most of the crap being made today even if it is essentially a home movie being filmed in some woods with a camcorder.Quite simply a modern day classic and will no doubt hold a space in all film buffs DVD collection.Well Done!".

I loved the fact the film was set in the mid80's when I was also a student in junior high school. The soundtrack to the film was a lot of fun with hits by Depeche Mode and Cars by Gary Neuman. Also I swear that I saw the band members of Travis in a scene shot in the faculty lounge of the school. I think the film is equally rewarding for both children and adults and will also be appreciated by anyone who love the art of cinema.

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw the trailer for this film it looked like another corny British comedy. The film itself is much much better than that as someone else has said it feels more like a Michael Gondry film. Very idiosyncratic quirky and confident in what it does with many laughoutloud moments. What I enjoyed most of all was how some really nice themes and subplots started to innocently dovetail with the story never feeling contrived or overly sentimental. There were some great touches where the writerdirector chose to imply or suggest something without going overboard  which makes for a much more warming experience than the usual obvious and clunky approach in British screen writing. The acting was superb. This film will appeal to many many people for different reasons  I just hope they are encouraged and inspired enough to go and see it. I hope that word of mouth does this film the justice it deserves. Go see it!!".

Along the way many topics are addressed ... family religion friendship loyalty idolworship etc.Bill Milner as Will Proudfoot and Will Poulter as Lee Carter are the newcomers who play the boys. Poulter is a near reincarnation of River Phoenix as Chris Chambers Stand By Me as he carries so much bottled up emotion stemming from his longing for attention. Milner's character is the more sensitive creative type being suffocated by his family's religion. Quite a pair.As a commentary on film and celebrity the two boy's world is rocked when their filmmaking is discovered. Now everyone wants a piece including the French exchange student Didier played hysterically well by Jules Sitruk. Character issues to follow! The boys are so endearing that most kids would enjoy the film and certainly most adults who were still growing up in the 80's will get a kick out of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Polaropposites have never been so compatible particularly with Garth Jennings The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 2005 latest outing with Son of Rambow. Introducing two new comers Bill Milner Will and Will Poulter Lee Carter as two young school kids who find that even in the unlikely of places there can be a common interest.It is in this movie of bonding friendships and Sylvester Stallone that this English summer of 1982 has our heroes sweating their days filmmaking fighting off religious beliefs' struggling against indifference and putting up with French patter and pose. With their social differences one belonging to the Plymouth Brethren and the other a feral child. This wild child's dream is to win the BBC's Screen Test short movie competition a U.K. children's television show about Film with its fifteen year lifespan ending in 1984 and take note of who is presented with the winning prize toward the end no other than a young real life Jan Ratatouille Pinkava himself.An English movie at heart and with French overtones adding too a little quality and that finer touch to the proceedings we are given the wonderful Eric Sykes O.B.E. C.B.E. who plays his part with comic professionalism. This is one comic caper of kids using imagination wit and determination to pass their long summer days breaking down barriers and building new paths to tread. Wonderful stuff and with great dialogue too from director Jennings funny heart warming and blissfully satisfying to watch. While not too deep with character development with what we have we are most entertained and at times moved. Moved by its simplicity its richness in the dealings of connections and conflicts between all involved on screen albeit young Will's overbearing religious values and loving mother Lee Carters isolation from his never present parents and of course la tour de force the Son of Rambow The home movie.The Son of Rambow is more than the sum of its parts its about that old aged fable shown in many kids films but in a different light great comingofage movies as Christina Ricci's Now and Then 1995 River Phoenix's Stand by Me 1986 to the magic of The Goonies 1985. Son of Rambow is amusing to the point of hilarity touching to the point of sentimentality and rewarding like a good home movie should be made well with imagination wit and determination.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you are in the mood for a story from the heart about friendship and identity growing up in a world foreign from your sensibilities and against what it is you want to be despite the need to conform Son of Rambow is just the thing. Be aware however that this is a British film with story at its core. There are slow moments throughout but only in a bid to enhance the overall work. People walked out of my screening saying that they were boredthis is what happens when you get a free movie pass and go without knowing anything about what you are about to see. I had been anticipating Garth Jennings' followup to Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy with baited breath ready to be taken into an original world straight from his mind. Being one part of the dynamic duo Hammer  Tongs I knew he'd have something up his sleeve a la Michel Gondry by watching his inventive music videos. This film allows him to step out and put his imagination out there for all to experience. I can't wait to see what he comes up with next.Everything is authentic here from the time period of the 80's complete with soundtrack dress and VHS camcorders to the homemade quality of the amateur film young Will and Lee are crafting. When the kids go behind the lens and start filming you won't be able to remove the smile from your face. The two act like they are best of friends and go through the good and bad times that the stigma of bloodbrothers brings with it. Their interactions make the film succeed completely because the bond they share is strong. When two outsiders find each other amidst the carnage that is Middle School even if they are polar opposites it is a hard thing to break. Finally able to live life knowing there is someone else to share in the fun is a drug that won't be kicked easily no matter what family and school tells you. The more people that want you to separate the more you will see that what you have together is the true reality no one has the right to end it but you.Just the setup of having a boy from an Amishlike upbringing in the Brethren mix with the class miscreant and bully is ripe for laughter and fun. From the onset we are privy to the clash of their two cultures. Lee Carter is a mischievous delinquent attempting to use Will Proudfoot as his slave and stunt man for the movie he is trying to enter into a contest inspired by First Blood. With his parents gone and only a brother who uses him as a servant Lee needs this in order to compensate for the life he is leading. Only someone who is bullied becomes a bully himself it is the only life he knows. Blackmailing Will into being his actor for some really crazy stunts complete with wonderful montage may play to his needs but it plays to the sheltered boy's as well. Will finally has an excuse to let his imagination run free from the pages of his drawing books and the walls of the bathroom stall. In a culture that is not allowed to watch TV making a movie himself can be a very strong temptation. When he shows up at Carter's door in full Rambo garb you know how the rest of the film will go. Lee curses under his breath because he sees he doesn't know what he has gotten himself into. Never in a million years does he think this boy would end up being the one person on earth he could count on.Bill Milner Will and Will Poulter Lee hit it out of the park. I don't know how much of it is acting or them just intuitively going where the script takes them but it is fantastic. The fact that they are so young and able to be so natural when behind the camera yet so selfconscious and hammy in front of itdespite being in front of the real camera every secondjust blows my mind. Milner is the nave boy raised to be weary of the outside world always cheery and completely gullible. When he gets a taste of fame he doesn't quite know what to do with it. Poulter on the other hand is the smartmouthed kid building up a stone faade to hide what is really going on inside. His delivery of oneliners is priceless definitely helping to make him the shining star of the movie.I'd be remiss to not mention the wonderful supporting cast and creativity of director Jennings. His use of animation is integrated perfectly and the mix of watching what is happening along with how it filmed on the boys' camera is well orchestrated. As for the support a lot is going on around these burgeoning filmmakers. Between the cliques at the school and the arrival of French exchange students the small world is everchanging around them. Jules Sitruk as Didier is absolutely amazing oozing exotic chic and French confidence despite what we find out about his true nature at the end. This kid is Michael Jackson here that is a good thing we are in the 80's after all and everyone girls and boys flock to him. The teachers and the old folks and even Lee's brother help add to the aesthetic going on but what truly leaves its indelible mark is the culmination of all the hard work seeing the finished short filmed displayed. The movie encompasses all that has been going on permanently etching the bonds that have been forged and those that have been repaired to video.Feel good movie of the year? Quite possibly hands down.".

The sad thing is as Jimmy the Saint also pointed out is it movies to slow for most kids nowadays. I say staple them to the chair and make them watch it and Labyrinth too little brats.

	schema:headline " Hope and Glory v. 8.0";
	schema:reviewBody "Garth Jennings' hilarious Son of Rambow is a nearly perfect GenerationY update of one of my favorite films from childhood John Boorman's vastly underrated masterpiece Hope and Glory. Whereas Boorman's Hope and Glory was tinted with melancholic Graham Greene era nostalgia and told the story of a young boy coping with Germany's blitzkrieg over England during WWII through the power of makebelief Jenning's laughoutloud Son of Rambow takes a postmodern 1980's popculture inspired look at a young boy's escape from a harsh religious upbringing through an obsession with the movie Rambo First Blood. When a religiously oppressed Will Proudfoot Bill Milner with the perfect comic timing only an untrained child actor could provide forms an unlikely friendship with a criminally neglected and movieobsessed Lee Carter Will Poulter first seen on screen smoking a cigarette while making a bootleg video in a packed theater showing the original Rambo the two decide to make their own Ramboinspired film to enter in a local contest. Insane stuntdriven Tom and Jerry inspired antics ensue while Will has to hide his new activities from the familyfocused Brethren and the familyimpoverished Lee can't help but get in trouble at school. When Lee gets suspended for a mishap with a dog statue a kite and a science teacher clipping his nose hairs at just the wrong time Will unwittingly attracts the attention of an inexplicably popular French exchange student and his bumbling British entourage who can't wait to take part in the film. What follows is a hilarious kidslevel satire of the movie world complete with an ingenious Boogie Nights style series of scenes that show an exclusive underground club on school grounds where kids dance to bad 1980's music while chugging soda after downing Pop Rocks and highlights the bizarre brotherhood of filmmakers and actors that inevitably arises from such shenanigans. And that's not the only connection to auteur Paul Thomas Anderson as like There Will Be Blood this Son of Rambo also features a pivotal scene of an emotionally distraught child covered in oil. And did I mention that like my novel The Thief Maker many scenes take place at a nursing home where Lee lives unattended by his jetsetting mother and stepfather? Trust me this is much funnier. Luckily like Boorman's clearly influential classic this film is also wonderfully photographed and chockfull of naturalistic acting from the young cast.Sure Son of Rambow lacks the gravitas and realism of Boorman's semiautobiographical Hope and Glory but it packs a similar emotional wallop for those in my age group who grew up pretending to make movies in their backyards with neighborhood kids after the latest GI Joe or Transformers episode aired and were inspired by the latest Star Wars or Indiana Jones film before those franchises were raped for opportunistic profit during our disenfranchised adult years. For a generation of late 20's and early 30somethings who spent their childhoods disengaged watching endless marathons of The Little Rascals and The Three Stooges on TV while action stars like Sylvester Stallone pounded movie theater audiences into a bloody pulp Son of Rambow is pure imaginationinspired movie magic that will tickle the funny bone while successfully playing for our sympathies. In an increasingly strange year of hidden gems and quiet sleeper hits from cathartic and clever documentaries like Man on Wire to wickedly dark Graham Greene tinted comedydramas like In Bruges Garth Jennings' touching and uproarious Son of Rambow just might be the most accessible and deserves to become a cult favorite on DVD.".

	schema:headline " Charming if uneven film that is creative and funny at times but poorly structured at others";
	schema:reviewBody "Will is a creative but ultimately repressed and shy boy whose family are very religious shunning television and other temptations of the modern world. It is during one of his regular exclusions from class as they watch a video that he meets bully Lee Carter who has been put out of his class for other reasons. Lee gets both boys into trouble and pretending to get Will off the hook bullies the weaker boy into coming back to his house and help out with a home movie he is making for the BBC show Screen Test. The film is to be a version of First Blood which Lee has pirated from the cinema. Seeing the film fires Lee's imagination and he takes no convincing to become Lee's stuntman and lead actor with the two continuing their strange relationship during the making of it.Although I understand why I would almost prefer if I hadn't seen Son of Rambow on every bus that I drove past for the last few weeks and had come to it as a small British film that is quite good rather than having a lot of hype and praise lavished onto it. The reason for this is because the film is not brilliant but is actually rather good. It is hard to fault its creativity and the way it brings out the good feeling of children in a simpler time letting their imagination run while also trying to deal with the world that is bigger than them and in this regard Son of Rambow does really well. The concept is imaginative and many scenes are a delight as they mix real action with animation reality with flights of fancy and so on and it is good enough that it is a shame that it doesn't really come together.The problem comes with the story as this does feel rather disjointed and uneven and it takes away more than it gives. Again in the sweep it works and I liked the theme of the outsiders of Will's growth of superficially strong or popular people being just as insecure than obviously so. However these things are moments and what the film fails to do is convincingly connect it across the running time. So what we tend to get given are fragmented moments of humour pathos creativity and so on but with very weak bridging and consistency in between. It is a shame because the moments are strong enough to make me enjoy the film and be frustrated at its unevenness. Fortunately it ends on a good note and left me with a warm feeling  but it was still a rocky road to get there.You will hear it praised to the rafters of course mainly by viewers who are overjoyed that a British film is made that people want to see and isn't rubbish but for all its weaknesses the one area the praise is very deserved is in the two main actors. With no tangible experience between them both Milner Will and Poulter Lee are natural and engaging. OK so Poulter has to be a bully for most of it but this is to his credit that he is able to be this way while also keeping the audience by wearing it like a front. Milner is effective as he does gradually come out of his shell during the film and be a difficult and flawed character himself at one point. Sitruk's Didier is not as good mainly because he is a visual joke rather than a character and I thought him and his character were a weakness in regards delivering the characterdriven story. For all his weaknesses Jennings cannot be faulted on creativity and he nails childhood imagination throughout.Son of Rambow produces plenty of wonderful moments as it works with its central concept and it will leave you with a warm feeling inside. Sadly though it is not a great film and it is a shame that it could not harness its strengths in a more effective and pleasing way because for all its good bits it just doesn't flow together in a way that is as satisfying or as engaging as it could.".

	schema:reviewBody "A very sweet film that is a refreshing alternative to the Richard Curtis version of English lovable comedy. The young leads do a remarkable job considering it's their first ever film they deliver the laughs. They use language which is probably like Chaucer to their 21st Century ears I was once dropped to substitute for writing 'is skill' after my name on the football team sheet posted on the wall.It's a bit flawed of course. I don't recognise the 'Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit' type family but I do remember a kid at school who's family wouldn't let him watch TV so I'll give them that. The 'away from home mother' seemed a bit convenient also and the 6th Form kids were all dressed like they were appearing on Top of the Pops and then moving on to The Wag. I wasn't like that.All in all though tons of fun. The French exchange student is a work of genius there's a wonderful cameo from Eric Sykes and I'm sure there's an homage to Wes Anderson's Barclaycard commercial in there. I hope so because it deserves one. Enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "On a wet Sunday afternoon you could do well watching this very sweet depiction of boy fantasy made real. Will Poulter and Bill Milner are well cast and provide the perfect foil for each other. They are completely believable. The relative neglect of the two boys is very nicely nuanced there is never any hint that the boys in any way find fault with their parents yet it is their parents who are responsible for the trouble they encounter in daily life. The cameo by Eric Sykes is at first quite maudlin but then becomes quaint. It has the same feel as the UK TV sitcom Gavin and Stacy. Affectionate realistic and accepting. Come out of the cinema and say Ahhhh!".

	schema:reviewBody "I had heard some good things about this film some time after its initial release on a TV countdown or something and apparently that it was a surprise hit so I was very interested in seeing it from director Garth Jennings The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Basically set in 1982 shy and quiet schoolboy Will Proudfoot Bill Milner with a family that attend the Plymouth Brethren religious sect which he is forbidden to watch television or films including during school lessons. One day in the corridor he meets badly behaved troublesome Lee Carter The Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader's Will Poulter and after both accidentally causing a fish bowl to fall and break Lee volunteers to take the blame and he pretends that there is torture involved in his punishment. To make up for it Will allows him to take his watch which belonged to his dead father and saying that he still owes him for taking the blame Lee wants Will's help to finish the film he is making inspired by the recently released First Blood at the cinema. Lee is making a film to be entered for the Screen Test Young FilmMakers' Competition and he is using the home video equipment that belongs to his older brother Lawrence Ed Westwick who bullies him and with this camera he secretly filmed First Blood and makes pirate copies. Will accepts helping make the film doing the stunt work he needs as he saw the film First Blood himself and can't get it out of his head he is very enthusiastic about being his own action hero doing some slightly dangerous stunts. As time goes by what started as nervous tension turns into friendship for the two boys they even make the pledge to become blood brothers but of course Will has to keep his friendship a secret as Lee is said to be a bad influence. New French exchange student Didier Revol Jules Sitruk arrives and quickly becomes very popular amongst the curious school boys and when some of the others find out about this film project he in particular is keen to be part of it Will says he can join but Lee feels he is no longer in control and quits. There is some filming done without him but he does come back when Will is trapped under some unstable structures that collapse at the abandoned power station even though he was only coming to get the camera back. Lee ends up getting injured himself and forced to go to hospital and when Lawrence visits him he is angry that he has been using the camera and that it is broken and even though Will's mother Mary Jessica HynesStevenson isn't happy she does allow him to be himself and even leaves the Brethren. Lawrence has a look for himself at the footage that has been filmed and he is impressed and with Will's help he makes his own participation in the film a message to his brother. Lee leaves the hospital and as a surprise he is taken to the cinema and before the main film Yentl their completed film is Shown Son of Rambow at first the audience are tittering but as they settle into it they love it and it ends with applause and Lee and Will are reunited. Also starring Neil Dudgeon as Joshua Eric Sykes as Frank EastEnders' Anna Wing as Grandma and Sam KubrickFinney Stanley Kubrick's grandson as Danny. Newcomer Milner gives an adorable performance as the quiet and then brightened up boy and Poulter is also really good as the misbehaving and bully like for a while but slowly changed for the better friend together they make a great duo. It is a good fun story about two boys making their own film based on the popular Sylvester Stallone hero the friendship is believable and the actual filmmaking process makes for some good giggles and the subplots with the two boys and their home lives makes for realistically dramatic moments this will appeal to the younger and older audience members a fun to watch comedy drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for the Carl Foreman Award for the Most Promising Newcomer for Jennings writer. Very good!".

It looks raw and seems like a really good independent movie that I always enjoy plus I always enjoy English humor. But after having seen it for myself I somehow find it pretty bland and pointless. It wasn't bad film but it wasn't good either.Synopsis A story about two school boys with two different backgrounds joint together to make the home movie where they were inspired from the movie First Blood for the competition along the way they met many obstacles that challenge their friendship.It took quite a long while before you will understand where the film is heading to there are quite a few good moment in the film but the lack of substance in the story making this movie so empty and thus not really hold the interest well. It wasn't like it was predictable story but the flow of the film was pretty uneven and the character wasn't really standout this might actually clash with other people idea I believe.I believe the best of the film was the casting of the two main characters Will and Carter and the kid did a good job portraying their character. Other actors also did pretty alright with their role specially the French kid though I still not really see main purpose of his existence despite the fact he is one of the few main character and the one who cause the rift between Will and Carter and other student with his Mr. Popular status. His character hasn't done anything much. I also feel that Will imagination hasn't been express to the fullest in the film.Otherwise I thought everything was pretty alright the film do consist of blend in score though sometime feel really strange nice location good dialogue neat wardrobe and so on. Not much has been emphasize that the film took place in the '80 but just the few accessories few words and wardrobe of the French kid that dress like Boy George and Cyndi Lauper combine and that seem like the trendiest thing then.All in all I can't really fully recommend this movie to anyone  first if you're not into this type of movie you will surely bored and  second if you do actually like to watch independence film this still is not really that good cause this isn't much of story driven.All I can recommend was if you still want to watch it catch it on free cable or rent it from DVD store.Reason to Watch Will and Carter are lovable character.Reason to Watch Not really hold interest.Rating 510 Grade D PS They do explain why the film spell Rambow with W inside the film at the end of the credit.".

Storywise it is between Be Kind Rewind and Is There? which features the same boy actor the same setting of an English privately run old folks' home in 80's England and the same parental issues.Here the main fold is a movie about a kid making a movie that is based on another movie. The following is true of both the movie we see and the movie we see being made the result is bad but we are told that it is endearing so we are supposed to let the poor filmmaking pass.The extra origami is planned to come from folding this into two other performances. One is the roles invented and played by schoolchildren to convince themselves and each other that they matter. This comes from the bully role of the buddy who starts the movie a situation of a preening cool French kid who is visiting and what appears to be a severely cut series of episodes involving older kids and their comparatively comic roles and costumes.The other is the notion of prescribed roles that must be played by parents here prescribed by religious rules.The folds as written are combined clumsily. The map to religion we see by visions of an imagined story that becomes the movie within but presented as drawings superimposed on the pages of a Bible. To map to the schoolyard bits we have similar drawings on the walls of the school. Its a bit literal but it gets worse when the inner movie takes off is when the role played by the French kid and his posse map into the roles in the Rambo film the merger literally happened in a church with some obviously deliberate staging.And there is even a focus on watching and watches and not one but two demented elderly watchers. Get it? Jees. So much for the writing but you have to give the writerdirector credit for also working on folding these elements in the cinematic sense. There are transitions between real life and the various inner roles and stories. Unfortunately this visual overlapping is done with two distinctly different kinds of animation neither of which match the various forms of drawings from the boy through whose eyes we see all this.If I had an annotation tool that pointed to scenes I could show how all this tries to work and could have with a bit more visual coherence.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.".

	schema:reviewBody "Other reviewers have said it well this is a wonderfully romantic film. I hate to make a statement like It's the Asian version of . . .  because the film doesn't need a comparison to any American film to have an identity BUT it has several things in common with The Way We Were Comrades follows an upanddown romance over the span of several years and has that same quality of bittersweet fate hanging over them throughout. The early scenes in which Li Xiaojun Leon Lai and Li Qiao Maggie Cheung begin their love affair are particularly entertaining. A favorite scene Li Xiaojun helping Li Qiao on with her coat they get closer and closer their lips brush together then they embrace then a full on kiss then mutual passion overtakes them as they both feverishly unbutton that same coat they had just been struggling to button. The scene is both sweetly romantic and humorous. Another similarity to The Way We Were is that both films benefit from a tearinducing song in this case a love song by Taiwanese singer Teresa Tang which plays a vital role in the plot. Great job of direction by Peter Chan and a wonderful script but it's the performance by Maggie Cheung that really sells the film. From the moment you see her behind the counter at McDonald's you're hooked by her energy spunk attitude and determination. Her character runs the gamut of emotions during the course of the film and there wasn't one false moment in her performance. She is totally believable whether she's flashing a selfsatisfied grin into her ATM machine or dealing with a devastating loss I won't give it away but Cheung's reaction is heartwrenching. Comrades is truly a wonderful film.".

The direction is flawless the casting is perfect. Leon's innocent face is exquisite and Maggie's strength and determination deem her a likable heroine. Perhaps slow for nonromantics this movie paints a beautiful portrait of ideal love one which surpasses time and place and confirms the ideal belief that certain things are meant to happen in our life.

	schema:reviewBody "I have just finished watching it. The emotions came out from deep down in my heart and I couldn't control myself to stop crying. This is the film of love reality and dream. It has nothing to do politically with HongKong before or after 1997. It shows the story of two young people who think they are young enough to not choose and avoid love as the dream of life instead they pretend to make their 'materialised dreams' come true. However after their dreams do come true they are not satisfied. When they turn over their faces and realise that having each other is the dream. This is a soft and gentle film that in some way affect your heart deep down inside. The struggle the characters experienced are somehow showing the contradictions that all the immigrants would encounter. Those two 'immigrants' from mainland of China into HongKong have the reluctance of choosing between 'dream' or 'love' just like all the foreigners live in a country would have confused with and took the wrong decision. It is difficult to settle into one culture when meet the people from your hometown you feel like as if they are closer to you than your family. From the fantastic performance from both two actors the whole structure of the film is satisfying and the pace of unwrapping the storyline is as exciting and surprising as the Christmas presents. The love in the film is somehow very 'pure' and 'simple' from the determination and patience that took them years to find each other. Finally there is only one thing to say Among the sea of people 'yuan'the invisible and chosen force that connect you with the others in a particular way is unchangeable and if you believe it you will never be able to miss 'the one' for you no matter what happens and where you will b. Just ask yourself billions of people in the world why do I meet you not someone else?".

After seeing every combination of the romantic comedy formula for years I did not expect much out of Almost which admittedly has plenty of its own clich's and coincidences.

Enough to touch even the most jaded and cynical of hearts.Comrades swept award after award upon its Hong Kong release. For example see the list for the Hong Kong Film Awards Best Picture Best Screenplay Best Director Peter Chan Best Actress Maggie Cheung Best Supporting Actor Eric Tsang. Plus Best Art Direction Cinematography Costume  Makeup Design and Score.The story covers a 10year span. In 1986 Li Jun played by Leon Lai arrives in Hong Kong right off the proverbial turnip truck. He's a Mainlander from some rural community up north. He has come to Hong Kong to make some money in order to eventually bring his fiance down and get married. This task is made difficult because he is rather naive and more importantly doesn't speak a word of Cantonese. His best hope is to work menial jobs until he can learn the language and better his circumstances.One day he goes into a McDonald's to pantomime his way into ordering a hamburger. The cashier Li Qiao Maggie Cheung is arrogantly frustrated with his inability to speak Cantonese and tells him he'd better get with the program because in the hustling capitalism of Hong Kong people like him don't stand much of a chance. He is drawn to her because she can speak to him in Mandarin and she is very cute. Are you from the Mainland too? he asks. Of course not! she says. It's hard to move up in HK with that stigma attached. Anyway they end up spending time together. She steers him toward an English language class. Out of friendship? Well not really because she gets a cut  for every Mainlander she delivers. She also has him running errands and such for her.They grow closer. At one point she confesses that she too is from the Mainland but from nearby Guangzhou Province not from up north hicksville. He replies I've pretty much known that all along. They why did you let me take advantage of you? I needed a friend and you're the only one I have. They become lovers of convenience and proximity. He still loves his fiance and sends her letters but she is distant and Li Qiao is near.So far this is the first half hour of the film. How it plays out from here is the magic of this movie. The backdrop of the next 10 years is the everchanging Hong Kong as it prepares for the 1997 handover. Fortunes made fortunes lost. Li Qiao and Li Jun go their separate ways but find themselves back in each other's lives from time to time. She meets someone else and he ends up marrying his fiance. But still their feelings for each other can never be suppressed entirely.I hope I have not made this seem like a typical boymeetsgirl romance. It is so much more than that and yet without all the trappings you might expect from a bigbudget Hollywood film. There are no wisecracking sidekicks no cute kids making fools out of the adults no slapsticky miscommunications. Just these two wonderfully engaging people and the lives they lead and the difficult choices they make.I know I am a romantic softie. A number of movies cause my eyes to get all misty. I've seen Comrades at least 6 times and I still get leaky. I know what happens I know how it ends  there are no plot surprises. Yet every time I watch it I can't help but be absorbed by the acting the pacing and the emotional impact of the story of these two people.".

	schema:reviewBody "TMM is also known as Comrades Almost a Love Story. The Chinese title comes from a famous song by Teresa Tang a Taiwanese singer who is important to the movie. In terms of plot this movie is essentially a very focusedHK version of Forrest Gump so the two major characters keep bumping into each other at very particular moments more on that in a moment. Basically there is an HK bias against those who come from the Mainland and Mainlanders like Teresa Tang so the characters' loves for the song is emblematic of how various characters deal with the transition from the Mainland to HK picture a very nuanced version of city mousecountry mouse complete with a different language. The movie basically will give some indication of when a scene is taking place then segue to another scene. So the fact that one character is making a killing means that this is a time when the HK stock market was booming or people were worried about the handover or the stockmarket crashed. Knowing that these characters are about to go through something that everyone in HK experienced adds a new level of meaning to the very very good dialogue. There is a great twist at the end that places every scene in perspective but spoilers are evil. Backstory Leon Lai plays the male lead he is essentially a one man Chinese Backstreet Boy. The gangster is played by a mainstay of HK movies. Maggie Cheung is one of the most beautiful and talented actresses in the world so seeing her portraying a McDonald's clerk is amazing. An English instructor is played by Christopher Doyle the cinematographer for Days of Being Wild Happy Together and Hero".

	schema:reviewBody "First let me agree wholeheartedly with all the coments posted here so far this is a great film really touching and fun to watch...a chick flick with brains?  So to speak!  Ultimately it's also a great window onto Chinese culture and how crass and materialistic it can be contrary to some Western notions of ancient Oriental wisdom and whatnot.  A very fatalistic thread runs through this film and were it not for some great acting and writing among other things all those coincidences would've wound up seeming staged.  For this alone the picture should be studied in film school its ability to get the audience to so willingly suspend its disbelief despite some really blatant plot developments and twists well it's also a cultural thing too here I am sure as many Chinese believe very much in Fate.... So I enthusiastically recommend this film much as everyone else  wow is there anyone who didn't like this one?? Now I have to take some issue with the people who apparently didn't like the portrayal of AfricanAmericans in this film.  I saw this film with an AfricanAmerican friend of mine who is by no means a  political activist sort and even he was slightly offended.  The two scenes involving blacks are to be sure not positive.  And it's true Asians particularly immigrants have a fear of blacks.  However whatever one's politics on race matters in the U.S. I do feel that as a movie concerned with immigrant protagonists such scenes were justified and even  necessary.  The INS agents weren't depicted much better and they were all white.  Incidentally the second and last scene including blacks seemed a bit of cinema verite quite real and not staged  by which I mean that I think the two young males fighting in the background and the old black lady trying to break them up was all happening for real accidentally  coincidentally serendipitously.  Note that this scene was one of those NY crowd scenes with Leon Lai's character walking about town in a mildly depressed and greatly reflective state and I think the camera just picked up something fortuitous and most interesting happening for real.  I say this because I doubt that the crowds were staged and director Peter Chan must be really a devious fellow to deliberately stage such a thing which actually distracts us for the moment from the male protagonist's melancholia. Anyway.  My pal and I talked at length over this issue of black representation in this film and agreeing that the movie had no social responsibility I mean some would say we're talking romanticizing adultery here! and no artisitic obligation to give a veritable crosssection of the innercity black community all I had to do to get him to stop complaining and being so politically correct was to ask him if he can recall the last time a Chinese kid mugged somebody.  Whereas Chinese and Asians are frequently attacked anyone remember the AfricanAmerican teens who lured and murdered a father of two for 60 worth of Chinese food here?  There have been more incidents since this one last year  none fatal yet though.... Anyway this is a great film and it has no flaws I can perceive.  If you want a vastly more sympathetic and liberal take on innercity crime and Chinese immigrants check out Clara Law's good Farewell China.  Just don't let the black representation red herring trip you up from enjoying this really interesting Chinese take on romantic unrequited love.  If you live in NYC you'll get a great kick out of trying to identify all the locations! Some are obvious but what's stumped me in cycling around here visiting them all is where Broadway where the murder takes place is located  the Brooklyn one or the Queens one?  Definitely not the worldfamous Manhattan one.  I've visted both Broadways and can't figure it  out....".

The first half of the film is mainly about the relationship development between the two comrades. Since I am not a fan of either actor to me it seems to drag on for quite some time on specific details one about a very popular singer which would prove to be significant later on. Chinese in their thirties should relate to some of the historical events. All the sentimental stuff happens in the second half some perhaps on the least likely of characters. As usual Maggie Cheung is brilliant with her subtle brand of acting. In my point of view the circumstances where the two surviving characters meet again sporadically after splitting up seem somewhat farfetched but so sweet you should give them a break. In general it manages to avoid pointless sentiment innocous humor and yet comes up with a bittersweet ending that is dramatic yet humble. I like The Umbrella Story from last year more because it is much gushier and there is more going on more characters to relate to but I could understand if an older audience said this movie had better taste.".

	schema:headline " Comrades Almost a Love Story The most authentic Hong Kong romantic film";
	schema:reviewBody "I am going to talk about four main things that I found pretty interesting about this movie The reality the plot the characters coincidence and my opinion.1. The plotComradesAlmost a love story is about a young and innocent man Xiao Jun that is played by talented actor Leon Lai. Jun was one of many Chinese people who escaped their country which was very poor at that time to come to Hong Kong a more modern and developed country. He left China and also his girlfriend Ting. As soon as he arrived in Hong Kong Jun stayed with her Uncle and Auntie Rosie who helped him to find a job as a shipper at a food store and learn Cantonese. It took Jun months to get used to a very fast and crazy speed Hong Kong. Jun then met Qiao a young girl from Guangzhou when he ordered food at a McDonald's store. They then became only friends of each other in Hong Kong then their relationship start to grow to friends with benefit relationship. However when Jun decide that they need to turn their relationship into something bigger Qiao denied. Jun then decided to married to his girlfriend Ting . Qiao got married to Pao a customer of the place where she works who truly falls in love with her. However Jun cannot get away from his love for Qiao so he decided to leave Hong Kong to go to America to run away from his love for two women. He left his wife in Hong Kong. Also at this time Pao's business didn't do so well he was dying with debts so he and Qiao escaped to the America too. In America Pao died in an accident and Qiao was forced to go back to Hong Kong. However she did find way to stay in the US. As years go by Qiao and Jun meet again in front of a electronic store by concidence this is the end of the film.2. The charactersI have to say that besides Qiao played by Maggie Cheung Jun played by Leon Lai and Pao played by Eric Tsang other supporting characters are all oneway characters which are understandable because this is a story between just those four characters. I have to say that I really admire the casting process for this film. Maggie Cheung's acting skills brings to me a actual feeling of a lonely Chinese immigrants who always try to be strong in front of everyone. Add she is so beautiful and charming I bet that every male audience would have a crush on her when they watch this movie. Leon Lai is actually a singer in real life but I was quite surprised by his acting skills very natural and he successfully shows us the characteristics of Jun innocent positive and always look for better things. Eric Tsang as always put his best effort in every film that he stars in. Especially in this film his character has obvious weaknesses and dark side in his soul. However I wish he had more minutes in the movie.3. Reality and CoincidenceIn this movie two things that are emphasized the most by Director Peter Chan is cruel reality of lowerclass people in Hong Kong and coincidence in love. Reality is shown through the way that both Qiao and Jun admit that they are the other half of each other. However the reality is that they have to leave the other because of poorness. Two poor people don't have a bright future together and there will never be a happy ending for both. So although this film was influenced by the French New Wave filmmaking style which are often very light and romantic this movie has a very harsh and cruel reality which I bet everyone who watches the film will feel sad for Qiao and Jun. Coincidence happens a lot in this movie which is often considered unrealistic. However the way the director use coincident elements in this movie is very effective. Immediately after every coincidence happens in the movie there is always be harsh reality. For example Qiao saw Jun once when she moved to the US but she couldn't catch up with him.4. My opinionIn my opinion this is the best Hong Kong movie of all time. It puts in a lot of Hong Kong's outstanding romantic elements with great music especially Tian Mi Mi. It also so sad and realistic that I cry everytime I watch it. Maggie Cheung again did a very great job as an actress and also Leon Lai too.".

	schema:reviewBody "Peter Chan's COMRADES ALMOST A LOVE STORY is a touchstone of Hong Kong cinema a decadespanning romance revolves around two Chinese mainlander finding their feet in HK from the bottomline and shoved together by loneliness camaraderie and simmering affection yet their life trajectory would bifurcate by checkered fate only to be reunited in a foreign land of New York City ten years after their first encounter serendipitously facilitated by the news of the sad demise of their favorite singer Teresa Teng 19531995.Li Xiaojun Lai and Li Qiao Maggie Cheung he is a wideeyed Northerner arrives in HK to stay with his auntie Tsu doesn't speak Cantonese but his dream is to earn enough money to bring her fiance Xiaoting Yang to HK and tie the knots she a Southerner from Guangdong Province who sports a fluent Cantonese initially she withholds her provenance from him is more opportunistic and all she wants to be is a successful Hong Kong citizen thus the biggest barrier between them is their disparate nature of their goals but that doesn't stop them from being friends and sometimes bedmates through the vicissitude of their lives. But the key is always in her hands from a MacDonald girl to various sidelines it is the unethical job of a masseuse introduces Li Qiao to the triad boss Pao Tsang an ostentatious chubby shorty whom she grows attached with in Ivy Ho's organically unforced script this reflects a limpid sensibility of don'tjudgethebookby itscover philosophy and this sidebar would culminate in a heartstringtugging crescendo where Maggie Cheung enthralls us with a textbook exemplar of how to turn on the waterworks.Both Xiaojun and Li Qiao would attain their dreams in due course but that doesn't automatically bring them the happiness they pine for it is a familiar scenario of right people meet in the wrong time which is wellintegrated into their backdrop of an unglamorous view of Hong Kong at its time a financial hub beckons a better life but also rifles with geometrical and language discrimination the Teresa Teng mythos speculative business dubious stock market nostalgia auntie's lingering on the beggarbelief history with William Holden and an undertow of uncertainty during that consequential decade before Hong Kong would be returned to its motherland in 1997 to bookend its colonial history.

	onyx:emotionText "Peter Chan's COMRADES ALMOST A LOVE STORY is a touchstone of Hong Kong cinema a decadespanning romance revolves around two Chinese mainlander finding their feet in HK from the bottomline and shoved together by loneliness camaraderie and simmering affection yet their life trajectory would bifurcate by checkered fate only to be reunited in a foreign land of New York City ten years after their first encounter serendipitously facilitated by the news of the sad demise of their favorite singer Teresa Teng 19531995.Li Xiaojun Lai and Li Qiao Maggie Cheung he is a wideeyed Northerner arrives in HK to stay with his auntie Tsu doesn't speak Cantonese but his dream is to earn enough money to bring her fiance Xiaoting Yang to HK and tie the knots she a Southerner from Guangdong Province who sports a fluent Cantonese initially she withholds her provenance from him is more opportunistic and all she wants to be is a successful Hong Kong citizen thus the biggest barrier between them is their disparate nature of their goals but that doesn't stop them from being friends and sometimes bedmates through the vicissitude of their lives. But the key is always in her hands from a MacDonald girl to various sidelines it is the unethical job of a masseuse introduces Li Qiao to the triad boss Pao Tsang an ostentatious chubby shorty whom she grows attached with in Ivy Ho's organically unforced script this reflects a limpid sensibility of don'tjudgethebookby itscover philosophy and this sidebar would culminate in a heartstringtugging crescendo where Maggie Cheung enthralls us with a textbook exemplar of how to turn on the waterworks.Both Xiaojun and Li Qiao would attain their dreams in due course but that doesn't automatically bring them the happiness they pine for it is a familiar scenario of right people meet in the wrong time which is wellintegrated into their backdrop of an unglamorous view of Hong Kong at its time a financial hub beckons a better life but also rifles with geometrical and language discrimination the Teresa Teng mythos speculative business dubious stock market nostalgia auntie's lingering on the beggarbelief history with William Holden and an undertow of uncertainty during that consequential decade before Hong Kong would be returned to its motherland in 1997 to bookend its colonial history. Burnished by Ivy Ho's topnotch diegesis one particularly coupdematre comes when Li Qiao accidentally honks her car which prompts Xiaojun into action of rekindling their affair with Teresa's autograph emblazoned as an oracular signpost it is one of those fortuitous incidents actually could become a gamechanger in one's life and two leads' deeply engaging performances Leon Lai is thoroughly uncontrived in a very sympathetic and goodnatured role without coming off as cutesy and Maggie Cheung the Hong Kong cinema goddess one just cannot overpraise her magnificence and versatility please come back to the silver screen!

The Chinese name of this movie is Tian Mi Mi a very popular song at that time one of the first things that brings some fresh air after the culture revolution. And there are many details and nuances in this movie that demonstrate that this movie is not just about love or relationship or romance it's about life the struggles of people between reality and dream love and lost etc.It tells me that what makes Chinese people still alive and happy after all those tragedies in life. Look forward don't look back. Maybe it's related to the atheism of most Chinese we know that 'this too shall pass for everyone and everything so we try our best to live to love to forget to move on.".

	schema:headline " A Story About Coincidence";
	schema:reviewBody "There are a lot of things to write about the film. It's a representative opus that builds great meaning from details. Is it real love between Li Xiaojun and Li Qiao? Would they been so engraved in the heart like this if there were not so many coincidences? If those two conditions establish both is that to say love can not be sublimed of stay in the story?In the movie before everything begins Li xiaojun and Li Qiao go to Hong Kong backtoback in the same train by accident. There is a wording Only sweethearts in love consider that everything happens by accident was destined beforeTwelve Night 2000 of another similar sentence There's no coincidence in the world but only the illusion of coincidence there exist something in the back of coincidenceV for Vendetta2005. It's just like Qingxia simply choose her lover anyone can extract my sword I'll treat him without reservation.Love may often begin with some simple coincidences. It's just coincidences make us full of motive power it's the biggest pill to stabilize their mind to the person who do not have much sense of direction or security. But in reality there are not so many coincidences in life. We always expect for coincidence live a calm life superficially but we are still peep coincidence occurs. We all have the wish that something would happen in the future. For coincidence we can surfer so many boring days we are waiting for miracle arrives and that's the time we can free ourselves. If not we can also keep the right to image.In those waiting days time goes by Li Xiaojun gets married and Li Qiao is successful in her career. There leaves them two after they sent Xiaoting to work. So many days passed and it just like they never lost it. Li Xiaojun has so many words want to tell her so many topic can talk about but traffic light passed one by one there is still not even one word in the car.Li Xiaojun sees Deng Lijun in the moment she was his spiritual ballast once upon a time. That can be a summary for his young years. Does it perfect? Does he satisfies even if he got the autograph? Those all because you keep them in your memory I loved you you abandoned me we can not go back to the way we used to be even if time machine gives me the feelings of that moment. They cannot help but say goodbye. Finally coincidence arrives.Heavy body run into steering wheel harsh klaxon tweets. Though there are weighty responsibility so many life goals that can not release those burdens that push down them and leave them no room are penetrated by the klaxon. Music stops Xiaojun goes back to her without hesitate and they kiss. That's my favorite moment of this movie. Then the story can stop the coincidence would be as a full stop for those suffering.But in fact they are separated even there is not 24 hours since they got back to each other. And this separation is more despair than any separations they had before. The movie approaches to reality till now. Coincidence is just presentation. People always attach it that is exactly their own wishful thinking. As reality events coincidences are what you eat today what you dreamed last night just like you read the passage I write. Coincidence is one part of life it has no particularity. Sperm and ovum meet then you born screened by society time and time again there you are. Those are all coincidences everything you experience and you not experience are all coincidences. Only you can not realize that reality would never respect the things you image all the time.I always believe that the essence of people is tender. We all move forward and wonder what would happen next second. The more you desire for success the more you love someone the afraid in your heart would be more powerful. Once you got desire and then you would afraid to lose it. In this way one could never grasp the sense of security in fact. And then coincidence turns to as our best spiritual ballast. Of course it's just a film they get back to each other again the ending is so beautiful. The moment they move their sight and then meet they are both caim in heart. That's because of the screening by time it's quiet after great rejoicing and great grief it's deposition after so many days. There eyes tell me that they would live a calm life till old even if there is no coincidence.".
