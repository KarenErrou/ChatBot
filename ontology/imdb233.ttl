	schema:reviewBody "For those anticipating Lu Chuan's epic Nanking movie City of Life and Death which will premiere this week you might also want to check out The Message now playing in cinemas and also set during the turbulent days of the SinoJapanese war in China in the early 40s. While Lu Chuan's film tried to portray history through an objective lens lending to it a documentarylike feel The Message showed how Chinese cinema has grown to tap upon those dark days to create what would be an extremely well made tale of espionage with insurgent and spies working effortlessly to bring misery to their Japanese occupiers.Based upon the novel by Jia Mai which Chen Kuofu has adapted the screenplay and shared directorial responsibilities with Gan Qunshu The Message is a top notch tale of bluff versus bluff and dwindling trust where a group of CounterInsurgency Chinese troopers got called into a mansion for close interrogation because one of them codenamed The Phantom is supposedly working for the resistance. It's curious times because you have the puppet Chinese government and their troops the Japanese officers seeking to weed out traitors and the resistance who have so far struck plenty of fear amongst the Japanese ranks because of their Basterdslike brutality which the opening few minutes would let you have a taste of.In essence it's a process of elimination and while it is engaging on many levels  the story the whodunnit the opulent and richly designed sets and costumes swooping camerawork that will leave you breathless and that pulsating musical score it somehow felt a little dragged out in its midsection as it lingered on playing everything out in relative sequential order and looked as if it's headed for a very straightforward espionage tale in smoking out the spy amongst their midst with some ingenuity of scheming counterscheming and baiting involved of course.It's also because we tend to equate the biggest stars here Zhou Xun and Li Bing Bing as probably the most highly suspicious and as the story continue to develop along that line which is why the film had this unfair sense of familiarity going against it which doesn't do justice to the film. What more the intertitles that frequently appear continue to provide one clue too many as to whether the Japanese have got their man or not. And that's probably the reason why some films work a lot better when it's a bunch of competent unknowns so that star power naturally to attract an audience doesn't factor in manipulating you. However it is the finale arc that elevated this film with its satisfying conclusion of the dangerous environment that resistance fighters often put themselves into. History has its fair share of tales on bravery and heroism and I'm game to see a lot more of such warespionage films coming out of the Chinese mainland especially those with a solid story backed by excellent production values such as this one. If through films one can exorcise demons of the past often through some form of escapism and fantasy then perhaps the time has come for Chinese cinema to do just that and to wow audiences around the world as well with universal themes.The Message clearly is that it's highly recommended and Hollywood better watch out!".

The struggle between Chinese and Japanese in the War time or to be more general between the righteous and the evil at that time is the permanent subject of all time.Performance of the actors and actresses are beyond reproach. My only disappointment is on Zhou Xu. Nothing in particular only say it can be better.I have heard that because of the censor some scenes were heavily cut. The cut part must be something even more bloody and scary. However what should I say without these scary scenes the impact of the whole movie would reduce to its half. And I would like to say the remaining torture scenes are not yet entirely convincing although they are quite enough for the mass majority in China.In addition the last scene is quite superfluous intending to highlight the old ghost.

I love the way it started too and it's fast paced. No long drawn out scenes and I didn't take my eyes off the movie once. The acting was fantastic powerful and intense. And the story was a high level THRILLER with many corners to keep us guessing! Seven to 10 main actors so don't expect to lose your way in all those Chinese names. That's a good thing! The storyline  plot was so good they had every loose end covered. It's rare to find a good flick with no holes. There's a lil twist at the end too. I'm not into spy films but this was kick a and the Chinese have been throwing out top notch films better than the U.S Japan and everywhere else in the past 5 yrs. They are truly getting better and better at their game heheh...I'm so serious. The 2 beautiful female stars were amazing  had our eyes glued to the screen. I loved the way their drama  expressions sucked us into the film and I heard they were nominated against one another for best actress award in this film in the Golden Horse Awards!

	schema:headline " Topnotch worldclass mainstream entertainment with an artistic flare";
	schema:reviewBody "Seldom if ever do I see three local English language entertainment magazines unanimously heap high praises on a movie from Mainland China. Still rarer is to see these normally cynical movie critics intimating to being moved by the heroism in a mainstream commercial feature. After watching The Message I see how deserving it is.This artistic achievement of this movie while not in the arthouse context is second to none as a mainstream entertainment. It scores an A in every department  direction script cinematography set and art direction suspense and twist and acting particularly acting.The story is simple and universal. While it in set in China in 1942 it would work perfectly with a French underground resistant group against the Nazis. The plot is simple. Five people in the counterconspiracy office of the unpopular puppet government are invited to attend a meeting to discuss security and codebreaking matters in a Gothic mansion. As the scenes unfold they are made to realize that one of them is an infiltrating undercover agent and the idea is to find out which one. At the same time this agent has just fallen for a hoax and sent a message to the organization to initiate an assassination. Now trapped in this mansion this agent has to find a way to send a countermanding and warning message or the entire organization is in danger of being wiped out. There are of course more twists and turns but all I'm going to say is that the audience will find the resolution of all the twists quite satisfactory.Even more engaging however is character development. While as part of the plot the suspects have their claws out against each other the audience in addition to being intrigued by the unfolding revelation is also fascinated by how their characters evolve shift and deepen. In order not to give anything away I'll only mention the most prominent actors. The best scene has to be between the two women how they play out their multifacet and multilevel relationship. Both ZHOU Xun and LI Bingbing are nominated for Best Actress at the Taiwan's Golden Horse award. They both deserve to win. Last year's Golden Horse winner ZHANG Hanyu also has a spectacular performance especially in his scenes with ZHOU. I mentioned how the depiction of heroism moved the critics. This is achieved with no flagwaving rhetoric. The audience gets to gradually feel for the characters without knowing who the real heroes are. Then the twists and turns silently attest to the lengths they would go for their course of fighting for freedom. The nobility of the selfsacrificing spirit is finally brought home by one last message that will touch even the hardened cynics.One thing the local critics haven't talked about much is the quality of the dialogue. While not quite titillating Bernard Shaw these dialogues are intelligent. Examples without getting into specifics 1 When a friend tells a secret agent about finding out the latter's identity the agent takes the friend aside and asks  Agent When did you find out? Friend At this very moment. I was bluffing.2 Interrogator trying to get prisoner to talk  Interrogator I can protect your family if you talk. Prisoner I don't think that in your position you have enough clout to do that. Interrogator When I say protecting your family what I mean is not hurting them myself at which point a phone is passed to the prisoner with the latter's frightened mother at the other end of the line.".

	onyx:emotionText "Seldom if ever do I see three local English language entertainment magazines unanimously heap high praises on a movie from Mainland China. Still rarer is to see these normally cynical movie critics intimating to being moved by the heroism in a mainstream commercial feature. After watching The Message I see how deserving it is.This artistic achievement of this movie while not in the arthouse context is second to none as a mainstream entertainment. It scores an A in every department  direction script cinematography set and art direction suspense and twist and acting particularly acting.The story is simple and universal. While it in set in China in 1942 it would work perfectly with a French underground resistant group against the Nazis. The plot is simple. Five people in the counterconspiracy office of the unpopular puppet government are invited to attend a meeting to discuss security and codebreaking matters in a Gothic mansion. As the scenes unfold they are made to realize that one of them is an infiltrating undercover agent and the idea is to find out which one. At the same time this agent has just fallen for a hoax and sent a message to the organization to initiate an assassination. Now trapped in this mansion this agent has to find a way to send a countermanding and warning message or the entire organization is in danger of being wiped out. There are of course more twists and turns but all I'm going to say is that the audience will find the resolution of all the twists quite satisfactory.Even more engaging however is character development. While as part of the plot the suspects have their claws out against each other the audience in addition to being intrigued by the unfolding revelation is also fascinated by how their characters evolve shift and deepen. In order not to give anything away I'll only mention the most prominent actors. The best scene has to be between the two women how they play out their multifacet and multilevel relationship.

It's a romance story so its box office clout is no surprise especially when starring teenage idols Satoshi Tsumabuki The Waterboys and Masami Nagasawa Crying Out Love from the Center of the World Robocon. Given the screening I attended today was a full house and almost everyone female I guess I'm one of the rare few in the theatre who's there to watch Masami in her new movie as I confess I'm totally smitten by that sunshine smile of hers.Directed by Nobuhiro Doi who helmed one of my favourite movies of 2005  Be With You Nada So So tells the story of the Shingaki siblings  Yota Satoshi and Kaoru Masami. Left to fend for themselves at a very young age as their father had abandoned them and their mom left for the heavens these two halfsiblings have only each other with Yota taking on a surrogate fatherlike role in looking after Kaoru working intense shifts and different jobs in order to pay for her education. As vowed on their mother's deathbed he is obligated to provide the best for her and does so almost to the extreme.It serves as a reminder not to overwork oneself and to take time to smell the roses. Kaoru having been brought up in a small island makes it to the mainland in Okinawa and her physical presence in her brother's life brings about an added dimension to her brother's love life with girlfriend Keiko Kumiko Aso. You see while they are siblings they aren't blood relations and therefore to some there are some sexual tensions between the two although they would like to discount it. People around them do feel and while it's against natural order to those who are unaware of the true nature of their relations these two do keep their feelings well under wraps.In fact there's nothing too wow about the narrative as any seasoned romantic film lover will be able to stay one or two steps well ahead of the story development. I'd come to think that the formula has been so tried and tested anyone can transplant similar stories with just an update in setting premise having different characters and tada a new movie. Okinawa provides plenty of picturesque scenes for the movie and they are well utilized. Both Satoshi Tsumabuki and Masami Nagasawa bring vivid credibility to their characters layering them with as much complexities as possible often done through subtle gestures  that twinkle in the eye that wry smile. Their chemistry as siblings is totally believable as are their feelings for each other which they try desperately hard to hide. They make it believable for an audience to sympathize with their predicament and showcased their ability to exhibit their brotherlysisterly love for each other as well as their attempts to hide behind veiled confessions and declarations. This might be a biased statement  but I thought Masami shuttled her Kaoru character with ease between country bumpkin and smart sister between that smiling happy girl and that sad depressing feeling of not being able to love someone the way she wants to.As always there are numerous opportunities about for anyone soft hearted enough to fall prey to emptying their tear ducts from sad scenes or scenes that want to elicit that response from you so bring along some Kleenex just in case. In the screening I attended there was no lack of sniffles and sobs heard all around.Do remember to stay throughout the end credits as the theme song gets played over a montage sequence of photographs from that photo album and finishes off with a very beautiful picture of Masami in a kimono central to the final act. Also you'll be rewarded with a bonus scene right at the end.For the romantics out there it's a little different in that it's not your usual boygirl relationship but it's love as strong nonetheless.".

I watched it with my friends  suffice to say I hear sobs throughout the movie. Be warned. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Nada Sou Sou means neverending tears in the Japanese Okinawa dialect but do not expect much tears from this movie.Don't get me wrong. Somehow people expect to cry buckets just like Japanese films Crying Out Love and Be With You. Perhaps audiences are already spoilt with the proliferation of Korean tearjerkers.The premise of this movie is very 'Korean' reminiscent of Autumn in My Heart  A brothersister relationship not related of course the struggles of love filmed at scenic spots by the countryside. It drew light chuckles with the allsofamiliar scene of little brother carrying the sister on the back along the beach. Music please.The movie is based on Rimi Natsukawa's hit song Nada Sousou in 2001 made popular in Singapore by Joi Chua's Pei Wo Kan Ri Chu. However a story of a young man falling in love with his step sister is nothing new. In fact some of the subplots seems borrowed from other movies Gigolo Wannabe Crying Out Love. With a straight narrative like this nobody needs to tell you what happens in the end.The main charm in the movie has to be the lead Satoshi Tsumabuki last seen in Fast and The Furious. His sunshine personality and endearing smile would captivate most girls and this is someone you can bring home to your mother with. No doubt this movie will propel him to greater star status.His sister is cute in her own way too cute perhaps. As she shrieks NEE NEE brother repeatedly at the top of her voice you wish she was a mute sister.The characters are told to control the tears in the movie through a light pinch on the nose. The director paints a rather optimistic and sanguine picture throughout probably suggesting that this is meant to be a light romance piece and may disappoint those expecting more.The appeal is in its subtlety. Keep your tissues.".

There's no other plot going for this story. If you're a woman maybe being loved so much by someone may resonate with you but the story is just boring endless doting of the sister by her brother. And the ending is so shameful. It's what an untalented writer would do if they run out of ways to end the story. There's even a word for it in Japanese called Shini ochi that is an easy way to end the story as a tear jerker.So a fail of a movie in my opinion in that it has no creativity going for it.

All though I think that the translation is a bit tricky from the original title which was originally the title of a song from a Japanese pop band.Like hinted in the synapsis of this movie it has elements of an incest love story between two siblings in it but they are only very subtle and not really fleshed out. Besides the incest this movie has some other elements which give it a nice Japanese touch. For example they had a really nice traditional Japanese song supported with shamisen Japanese string instrument music at the end which was pretty nice. It also shows the islands of Okinawa.The story itself felt a bit cheesy. Some drama elements felt just so over amplified and out of proportion. But when you compare it to some drama where a random catastrophe happens or someone gets some kind of illness basically the reason for the drama comes from some uncontrollable source I think Tears for you is more down to earth with its representation since it plays a bit with the idea that we ourselves are responsible for our own demise. I'm not quite sure if it was intentionally or just a plot device but it felt refreshing to see an ordinary drama movie have such interesting plot elements. Also the acting in this movie makes the drama parts endurable. Especially Masami Nagasawa made a nice performance here.So overall I would say if you are a sucker for Japanese culture or you like shows with a bit of melodrama I would recommend this movie for you. If you really can't stand cheesy stories then you should stay away from this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "No director ever personalized a genre the way John Huston could. While some critics have claimed his style was a 'lack' of style the opposite is actually true his sense of irony love of the absurd respect for personal codes of honor and twist endings that always remind us that the true value of a journey is not arriving at a destination but in the 'getting there' all set apart his best work from that of his contemporaries. Even his lesser work has value and his best films which certainly includes THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING are unforgettable.The tragicomic tale of two exSergeants turned confidence men with a grand scheme to fleece a nearlegendary kingdom had been a 'pet' project of Huston's since the forties and he'd spent years tinkering with the script planning to film it with Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart in the leads. With Bogart's death in 1957 he'd considered various other matchups including Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole until he found the ideal pair in Sean Connery and Michael Caine. Connery had just finished the spectacular THE WIND AND THE LION in which Huston played a small but memorable role and the Scot had often been compared to Gable with his dark good looks machismo and lack of pretense. Michael Caine a longtime friend of Connery was one of the industry's busiest actors and had already proved himself adept at playing both soldiers and con men. Together Connery and Caine had a camaraderie and chemistry that even Gable and Bogart couldn't have equaled and Huston was quite pleased.Christopher Plummer was another inspired piece of casting as the legendary author Rudyard Kipling. Bookish with a keen intellect and rich sense of humor Plummer's Kipling sharing Masonic ties with the future 'Kings' is the perfect foil for the duo offering sound advice which they totally disregard with a wink and a smile. As Dravot Connery tells him We are not little men and India bound up in British bureaucracy as well as becoming too 'hot' for them could never provide the immensity of riches they dreamed of.Huston eschewed the 'traditional' approach to adventure films with cardboard heroes performing nearimpossible deeds until the inevitable 'happy ending' and grounded his story in reality which disappointed any viewers hoping KING would simply be a variation of GUNGA DIN. But in not romanticizing the story he gives it a sense of immensity and the exotic a richness of character and an understanding of human frailties that far surpasses a typical Hollywood product. While Dravot orchestrates the pair's ultimate ruin by taking his 'godhood' too seriously as he turns 'noble' trying to bring order to his 'kingdom' and decides to start a dynasty by taking a wife you can understand why Carnehan Caine seeing their 'get rich' scheme disintegrate would be anxious to leave but also why he would forgive his friend when they face torture and certain death. Loyalty to Huston is not lip service but a true measure of a man. While Dravot and Carnehan are certainly not role models their love and respect for each other transcends their faults even their lives putting the film's final scene as a physically crushed Carnehan leaves his 'bundle' for Kipling into perspective. It is a moment you won't soon forget.THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING proves yet again why John Huston as he once described his friend Humphrey Bogart is irreplaceable.".

You shouldn't have to miss out a movie this good just because you haven't heard of it.That said I will concentrate more on the movie. It's based on a short story by Rudyard Kipling but this is one of the few occurances where I find the film better. It's an amazing story set in India from when it was under British rule. As the main characters we see Sean Connery and Michael Caine and they do great roles. I'd always known Sean Connery was a great actor but I hadn't seen Caine's potential until I saw this movie. Their characters' friendship makes this a warming movie but at moments it's also quite sad. Besides Connery and Caine it has many memorable characters like Christopher Plumming as Kipling.Stan Huston directs and I think it shows. The environments for example really are outstanding the icy mountains the crowded market and the Pakistan deserts. When I had finished watching I was overwhelmed it felt like one of the greatest stories ever told much like the feeling I had after watching Lawrence of Arabia and Dersu Uzala. There's really nothing that goes against this movie and needless to say I gave it 1010.".

I said all adventure movies left me feeling a little hollow  adventure movies tended to abandon story really in favor of plot important distinction stories are interesting plots boring consequently a film with a story to tell is better than a movie with a plot to move forward. I think he hurled the disc at me out of pure frustration with my point of view. In doing so he also won the argument.The Man Who Would Be King is the single greatest adventure film I've ever seen. It's a story  It's a tale  It's not a series of plot developments to me to go further with this plotstory dichotomy a plot is mechanical and sometimes that machine is welloiled while a story is organic and feels less contrived though the story as organic matter sometimes is can be rotten. It's a very good story at that. The Man Who Would Be King I believe as a result of its derivation from Kipling has a depth and development of character that is foreign to most adventure tales. Few films are as rousing as this and few films that are this rousing have nearly as much to say about mankind.John Huston of course is a master of instilling greatness into traditionally tedious genres. He transformed the mystery the western the swashbuckler. Why not the adventure story too? As evidenced in The Maltese Falcon and Treasure of the Sierra Madre Huston can take what might wind up a plot and transform it into a story. He understands that characters  human conflicted devious characters  are essential to creating genre pictures that transcend their genre. Without Huston this film would have undoubtedly faltered his steady and determined hand guides this film from the hazards of superficiality without sacrificing entertainment and adventure.He does not create a great film singlehandedly though as Connery and Caine who both give tremendous performances bestow upon Peachy and Daniel immense likability despite their scoundrel airs. Caine proves again why he may be the greatest living British actor and Connery reminds us that there's more to him than 007.As I said this is one of the greatest adventure tales brought to the screen. Though some may disagree in particular my friend who threw the DVD at my head it's better than any of the late 30s swashbucklers and better than most shootemups made since.".

The plot is from a Kipling story so it is of a good stock and stands up well.  The addition of humour is well pitched and really helps.It is a great adventure story with a cautionary twist in the tale and can be enjoyed on all levels.  The directing is as good as you'd hope from Huston but what really made the film for me was the two leads on top form. Both Connery and Caine have a great chemistry and totally convince as the old school military types.  They bring the roles to life and make them enjoyable and get us behind them effortlessly.  Admittedly most of the support cast are only jabbering natives who aren't allowed characters with the odd exception.  Plummer is good in a minor role but this is the ConneryCaine show all the way.Overall this is a great story that is well told by director Huston.  The film is made even better by the gentle camaraderie between Connery and Caine and the good vein of humour that underpins the strong story and quite downbeat climax to Caine's story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Outside of the obvious reflections on the immoral and absurdly hypocritical nature of early British colonialism it's just a damn entertaining movie.But you have to think that Rudyard Kipling who grew up under British rule in India was certainly trying to shake some sensibilities when he first wrote the story as part of an 1890 package called The Man Who Would Be King and Other Stories nearly a century before it was made into a film and during an era when the British Empire was still very much a reality.From the perceptive realization that even the staunchly important Masonic Lodge  which had infilitrated every aspect of Britain's upper classes  could be easily corrupted to the arrogance as Sean Connery's character Daniel Dravot who elevates what he sees as mere social superiority into a godlike status to the inevitable humbling of both men at the hands of the 'savages' they profess to rule the film is ultimately about the humility all men should exhude particularly in the face of the unfamiliar.Kipling's tale also preached tolerance though you might not consider that to be the case based on the film's climax   consider that if Daniel and Peachy had shown an iota of respect for the religion that they instead decided to fleece how differently the tale might have played out.The film owes much of its success to the chemistry between Caine and Connery who regardless of later plaudits gave the finest performances of their careers. Connery is particularly nuanced with Daniel Dravot starting the tale as a somewhat lackwitted second fiddle to the scheming Peachy but later seeing his limited vision help him surpass his friend in terms of villainy with an equally heavy price. Caine plays to some degree or another the same charming British sheysterteddy boy he popularized in the Harry Palmer films. But without a backdrop of similarly disaffected cockney bad guys it's stunningly effective.John Huston's direction is among the best of his career and in terms of his ability to use both sprawling vistas and tight almost claustrophobic photography owes a nod to his earlier work including The African Queen Night of the Iguana and the Treasure of the Sierra Madre. As examples witness the zenith of Peachy and Daniel's hazardous trek through the mountains played out in full panoramic detail only to be followed 90 minutes later by the tight shot of Kipling's face the revulsion fairly etched into every crease as we reach the climax.But perhaps the true hero of this film was Boaty Boatright who also cast Connery's classic The Wind and The Lion. He managed to take some of the most strident forceful personalities in the film industries threw them together and came up with a film about humility. Magic.".

	schema:headline " John Huston A Man Who Was King";
	schema:reviewBody "It took John Huston more than 20 years to bring one of his favorite stories The Man Who Would Be King to the big screen. Originally he had Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable in mind for the lead roles. Sean Connery and Michael Caine would end up in the roles. Overall it was worth the wait.Based on Rudyard Kipling's short story The Man Who Would Be King is a tale set in the 1880s at the height of the British empire's rule in India. Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnehan Connery and Caine respectfully are two soldiers turned con men who decide to conquer Kafiristan a remote section of Afghanistan. Once there the two men plan to train the natives into an army become rulers and steal the country's treasure left behind by Alexander the Great. However due to a misunderstanding Daniel is crowned king and is seen as a possible god and descent of Alexander. Peachy wants to stick with the plan but Daniel soon becomes consumed by his new power.In a decade that evolved around the 'New Hollywood' Huston was one of the very few filmmakers from the Studiioera to be able to continue his craftsmanship and turn out some fine stories. In a way The Man Who Would Be King is a big screen epic presented on a smaller scale. Despite all the breathtaking scenery and fine set pieces it ultimately is a character driven story about two friends staying together until the end. The performances of Connery and Caine rank among the best work from their distinguished careers. Christopher Plummer also gives a fine performance as Kipling himself. Huston who always seemed to adapt other's materials successfully achieved one of his most personal projects into fine perfection. With beautiful locations and a wonderful musical score by Maurice Jarre The Man Who Would Be King is not only one of Huston's best but is also one of the best films to come out from the 70s that still had a certain feel of stories that had a feel of a time long gone when film audiences were able to enjoy films that had everything. Adventure comedy drama suspense and so forth. I guess you could say 'They don't make them like they use to' after viewing this film from one of the great film mavericks of all time.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an excellent adaptation of one of the most exciting and interesting Kipling stories. There are some modifications to the original but in this case I actually think that they improve the story make a little more sense or at least are beneficial for turning the book into a film. One example that comes to mind is the decision to have Billy Fish be a lost soldier which makes his ability to act as interpreter and his loyalty to Danny and Peachy more understandable. The makers also decided to throw in a few references to other Kipling stories and while these are unrelated and probably meaningless to those not familiar with Kipling Kipling fans should get a kick out of this.Kipling fans should also thoroughly enjoy how Huston and the rest successfully bring to life the wild colourful largerthanlife characters of Peachy and Danny and their amazing exciting and appropriately tragic adventure. For those who are not Kipling fans the fun wonderful yet heartmoving story that goes beyond a mere adventure into an exploration of finding one's place in the world friendship and death should provide rich entertainment that is both fun and meaningful.The cast is simply wonderful. The roles of Danny and Peachy are among the greatest roles in my opinion that Sean Connery and Michael Caine have ever played and they do the job beautifully here. Christopher Plummer is outstanding as the cerebral literate Kipling while Saeed Jaffrey and Doghmi Larbi among others also put in strong performances.The directing costumes settings etc. also are excellent. The end result is a complete success that has been one of my favourite films for over 25 years. In fact I have watched this movie well over 20 times more than any other film. Although that is due in part to the fact that it is the first film I ever owned on tape I truly never tire of it and am mesmerized every time.".

But TMWWBK is not simply well made and it's not just an adventureaction movie. It's an amazing gutwrenching journey into human soul which contains everything one needs to know about human strengths and weaknesses. One of the reasons why this movie works so well is that it doesn't try to elude the dark side of the heroes. They are greedy rough sometimes selfish. But the film suggests that this dark side has no importance because they have an incredible capacity of redemption. At the end of the film when Caine and Connery are about to be slaughtered by the monks Connery says he's been a fool for having played with their lives and he asks Caine if he forgives him. Caine says he forgives totally and with no restriction. A few seconds later Connery falls into the precipice. Caine whose eyes have been put out by the monks goes down the ravine retrieves his skull and leaves with it. Wow.In my opinion you can't make stronger than that. This is a guy who's just been beaten to death and whose eyes have been enucleated because his friend played God and who searches his corpse to bring it back home  just because he's his friend. Man you would have to be a rock not to be a little concerned about that.I hope all the people who took a part in the making of these 2 hours of pure magic and who are still alive are proud of their work because they can.If you've never seen TMWWBK do it.

	schema:reviewBody "This my friends is one of my favorite movies of all time. This is the type of film that you do not hear from many critics or many best movies list but this is one of those films that is vastly underrated and is incredibly worthy to be considered one of the best. The story is a great adaption of Ruddy R Kipling's short story of the same name and the main plot of the film flows fantastically throughout the spectacular cinematography landscape and musical score. Considering that this film is from one of Hollywood's top directors John Hutson you might not believe that this film has all the glory and amazement to have the consideration to be among Hutson's other masterpieces like the African Queen but the film amazes with having the key elements of adventure and moral value that any great film should have. Seeing Sean Connery and Michael Caine playing two veteran British soldiers that have become friends over the past several years is truly astonishing. These characters are not that strong on their own but when they're together they seem like they were made for each other and the other acting performances in the film are equally impressive especially Christopher Plummer playing Rudyard Kipling himself. What the man who would be King does most effectively though is that it really has a great element of moral value in it. Themes like perseverance cleverness loyalty trust and most importantly friendship are all themes that are displayed incredibly well in this movie. This is a film for the ages and I hope in the future that it will get more and more recognition from critics filmmakers and audiences alike.10 out of 10 stars or five out of five stars A truly moving and incredible adventure for everyone to see.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes Huston seems to have fallen asleep at the wheel. It's hard to believe that he made a movie like Annie for any reasons other than financial. But his winners are firstrate. I'll only mention The Maltese Falcon The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and The African Queen in passing. Hardly anybody seems to be turning out wellcrafted work like this anymore pieces in which plot character and atmosphere cohere.The Man Who Would Be King is a fine example of Huston at or near his best. It is completely without pretense  a kind of blustering masculine tragicomedy with two superb actors in the leads and fine support by Christopher Plummer as Brother Kipling. Nothing that Caine or Connery feel seems to be more than an inch deep. Stranded on a snowy mountaintop in the Hindu Kush they sit around a dying campfire discussing how they're going to kill themselves since they will otherwise slowly freeze to death. Let's wait till the fire goes out suggests Caine and I'll do the necessary. Connery muses Peachy do you think our lives have been misspent? Well replies Caine I wouldn't say the world is a better place for our having been IN it. They start laughing as they reminisce provoking a lifesaving snow avalanche.They are clever treacherous greedy and very human. They've taken a serious vow against the use of women or liquor until they've completed their plan of robbing some remote tribe of natives six ways from Sunday. Learning that they have no interest in sleeping with his daughters a friendly chieftain suggests that maybe some boys would do the trick sending the heroes into a Victorian dudgeon.I can't carry on much more about the jokes or about the underlying theme which is pretty sad. Hubris the Greeks would have called it defying the gods and presuming to rise above your station. The lawyers might have called it lex loci. Having been proclaimed king Connery tells Caine I'll be going now. You mortals remain outside. Connery breaks his vow where women are concerned and marries the lusciously exotic Roxanne Caine's wife at the time. The spirit grew ever weaker and the flesh was all too willing.Neither Caine nor Connery has ever disgraced or damaged a movie they've been in although the reverse hasn't always been the case. They're not exactly heroes here either. Huston and his writers were unsentimental. The two are racists. Caine throws an affable Indian gentleman off the train  Outside Baboo!  and Huston treats it as a comic incident. That unapologetic lack of political correctness also spares us any nonsense about noble savages. Each of the isolated mountain tribes complains about the next tribe living upstream that they wait until the local women are bathing or doing laundry in the river then they pee into the river. Offered the title of Ootah The Great one chief grumbles and says he'd prefer to be known as Ootah the Terrible. It would have been easy to sentimentalize these people a bit of teaching of Oriental Wisdom a man's reach should not exceed his grasp or all things in moderation or some such nonsense but we don't get it here. These are pretty rough dudes who play ball with the heads of their enemies.In trying to capitalize on the success of this movie the company brought out a novelization which turned the screenplay into a novel as if Kipling had never lived to write the original story. Talk about barbarism!I could watch this a hundred times and still marvel at Connery's mastery of the military style of speech when he says lines like There'll be no summary executions in THIS ahmy! And Sorry about that. Blood was up. Won't happen again. He does it at least as well as Nigel Greene Harry Andrews or Jack Hawkins  those mess hall terminal contours.Don't miss it.".

Learning that they have no interest in sleeping with his daughters a friendly chieftain suggests that maybe some boys would do the trick sending the heroes into a Victorian dudgeon.I can't carry on much more about the jokes or about the underlying theme which is pretty sad. Hubris the Greeks would have called it defying the gods and presuming to rise above your station. The lawyers might have called it lex loci. Having been proclaimed king Connery tells Caine I'll be going now. You mortals remain outside. Connery breaks his vow where women are concerned and marries the lusciously exotic Roxanne Caine's wife at the time. The spirit grew ever weaker and the flesh was all too willing.Neither Caine nor Connery has ever disgraced or damaged a movie they've been in although the reverse hasn't always been the case. They're not exactly heroes here either. Huston and his writers were unsentimental. The two are racists. Caine throws an affable Indian gentleman off the train  Outside Baboo!  and Huston treats it as a comic incident. That unapologetic lack of political correctness also spares us any nonsense about noble savages. Each of the isolated mountain tribes complains about the next tribe living upstream that they wait until the local women are bathing or doing laundry in the river then they pee into the river. Offered the title of Ootah The Great one chief grumbles and says he'd prefer to be known as Ootah the Terrible. It would have been easy to sentimentalize these people a bit of teaching of Oriental Wisdom a man's reach should not exceed his grasp or all things in moderation or some such nonsense but we don't get it here. These are pretty rough dudes who play ball with the heads of their enemies.In trying to capitalize on the success of this movie the company brought out a novelization which turned the screenplay into a novel as if Kipling had never lived to write the original story. Talk about barbarism!I could watch this a hundred times and still marvel at Connery's mastery of the military style of speech when he says lines like There'll be no summary executions in THIS ahmy! And Sorry about that. Blood was up. Won't happen again. He does it at least as well as Nigel Greene Harry Andrews or Jack Hawkins  those mess hall terminal contours.Don't miss it.";

	schema:reviewBody "John Huston must know equally how great and how damn flawed man can be. A lot of his films some might say the bulk of his oeuvre focuses on this from The Treasure of the Sierra Madre to Moby Dick. Sometimes it might seem a man has both the writhing worm of ambition and promise and the potential for complete failure in a single bound. He excels at this not because he has to but because he needs to tell these stories of men like this  his heroes were manly male stories by the likes of Melville Kipling Hemingway and Hammett but one can also sense the spark of criticism of questioning what makes such men the way they are. The Man Who Would be King is no exception and may be the pinnacle of such a tale where we see two men formerly failed soldiers make themselves into the rulers of a nothing country right off of Afghanistan in the 19th century  one of them becomes a God by luck or destiny  and how it eventually ruins them. Whether Huston's film by way of Kipling's story is meant as a cautionary tale or a wicked satire or maybe both it's still tremendous storytelling acting direction and musical composition etc. In the film two exsoldiers of the Royal English Army are in India Daniel Dravot Sean Connery and Peachy Carnahan Michael Caine. They both tell the impressed if a little doubtful Rudyard Kipling himself merely a journalist at the time Christopher Plummer by the way that they being pretty much without any real place to go or things to do as disgraced soldiers lots of crimes such as theft and blackmail have a plan to go to Kafiristan which is a country few know exists and hasn't been inhabited by any kind of real ruler since Alexander the Great. In short a great place to rule and take charge with their skills as soldiers.After braving the terrain in some brief but effective scenes showing how much of a duo Draven and Peachy are in battling the weather and a few stray wanderers they arrive at the country which is in shambles and they train some of the locals to fight their way against their rules the one guy who is sort of kinda ruling things wants Terrible to follow his name not Great as it were. But somehow Draven stands out  first when he is hit by an arrow and it doesn't hurt him or draw blood since yeah it struck a part of his shield since this shows that he is automatically King. Next when the High Priest calls him out he happens to have around his neck a FreeMason symbol which sets off the High Priest to declare him a God since well it's the same image as on a tablet or something. For all of the riches now at Draven's disposal over a short period of time  that is he really starts to like the idea of this God thing when before he was on par with Peachy a tough and smart and witty entrepreneur. No Guts No Glory I guess.This is the sort of story that reads interesting and raises questions about Colonialization and worship in general. On the screen when delivered by a director who lets the backdrops of the mountains and hordes of middleeastern mountain people and the glorious acting of Connery I might say at a career high here and Caine who is no slacker either certainly when he realizes how crazy Draven has become it becomes something to behold. The dialog is one thing that sticks out as particularly clever and intelligent the script could easily fall into some kind of delirious or ridiculous swashbuckler story or even something that praises what they're doing. But Huston and his co writer's script give these characters smart things to say things that people like these British officers with carte blanche as well as their gobetween guy who translates for them would say in this unlikely cinematic situation. Like other Huston films ala 'Falcon' and 'Sierra Madre' it's very quotable.The themes are very potent and not dumbed down or so sensational that they become incredulous. Huston and Kipling draw upon the history of man's ability to overcome obstacles be it climbing a mountain or training a small army or becoming enamored with the responsibility of a God what the outcome of adventure and ambition does to people. It's significant for example that Draven is told about how Alexander the Great picked his wife from this region when he ruled and so he decides he must take a wife and bear a son for future rulers even as it's spoken that women fear being chosen to become the wife of a God since they'll burn up in flames. Things like that or how simple a small group of monks can stop an entire battle with everyone bowing in heed. It's remarkable how astute the commentary is in the film while at the same time not detracting from the action or the power of the performances.The Man Who Would be King is elegant and harsh with a beautiful and harrowing Maurice Jarre score if not as iconic still as fantastic as Lawrence of Arabia for him and memorable for its star power and how its story is really about something. It's also a grandly British story of guys who sing traditional songs when they're bored or near death and joke when they can and are so likable for how they just go for broke. That's one other thing these guys are never so distasteful as to be hated and even their 'scheme' is sort of endearing because of everything they go through to get to Kafiristan. There's a reason at the end Kipling stands mouth agape instead of reaching for his gun in spite of everything these guys are truly painfully human.".

It begins with some words which Rudyard Kipling pens in the opening scene are the opening lines to an actual Kipling poem The Ballad of Boh da Thone that contains several elements which feature in the movie . The flick tells the tale of Daniel Dravot Sean Connery's favorite film character  though John Huston also considered Richard Burton and Peachy Carnahan Michael Caine  though also was deemed Peter O'Toole  two exsoldiers in India when it was under British rule. Kipling Christopher Plummer would have been dismissed early on by the producers but for Sean Connery's insistence that Plummer stay who is seen as an important role that was there at the beginning and the ending  he advised about a dangerous journey . They decide to resign from the Army and set themselves up as deities in Kafiristan  a land where no white man has set foot since Alexander . There Daniel becomes a king and attempts to marry a princess Shakira Caine this is the only feature film to costar Michael Caine and wife under High Priest Kafu Selim Karroom Ben Bouih was 103 years old when he made his first and only film appearance  when he saw some of the footage he declared that now he would live on forever.Long live and spectacular adventure with an extraordinary duo  Connery and Caine  they form the best pair of all time . A glorious tale with two heroes who head off to Kafiristan in order to become Kings in their own right . John Huston tried to launch the film version of The Man Who Would Be King many times before completing it . It was originally conceived as a vehicle for Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart in the fifties and later as a vehicle for Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas. When it was considered as a vehicle for Robert Redford and Paul Newman Newman suggested Sean Connery and Michael Caine . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Oswald Morris filmed in Pinewood studios with magnificent production design by Alexandre Trauner and shot on location Glen Canyon Utah USA  Grande Monte MontBlanc Chamonix  France Atlas Mountains Morocco and at the Kasbah of Ait Benhaddou just north of the southern Moroccan city of Ouarzazate  this site was used in Gladiator as the NorthAfrican arena where Maximus first fights. Ouarzazate is known as Morocco's Hollywood since many international productions  such as Kingdom of Heaven and The Hills Have Eyes  were shot in the area. Imaginative as well as sensitive musical score composed and conducted by Maurice Jarre .The motion picture well produced by John Foreman was stunningly by the great John Huston at his best . The picture was made in a good time of the 70s and 80s when Huston resurged as a director of quality films with Fat City 1972 The man who would be king 1975 and Wise blood 1979. He ended his career on a high note with Under volcano 1984 the aforementioned Honor of Prizzi 1985 and Dublineses 1987. Rating  Above average  this is one of John Huston's best films  a model of his kind  definitely a must see if you are aficionado to adventure film .

They're a pair of lovable con artists who nearly pull off one big old swindle and take over an ancient inaccessible kingdom in the Afghan mountains.This was a labor of love for John Huston. As a kid he read Rudyard Kipling's famous short story and it became his favorite work of fiction. Huston as far back as the Fifties wanted to film this first with Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart and then later on with Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole. Try and picture this story done with either of those combinations.Huston even worked Kipling himself into the act with a fine small cameo by Christopher Plummer. Kipling who was a newspaper correspondent covering the British in India is told this wild tale about what these two did in the forbidden land of Kaffiristan.These are the kind of people Kipling himself knew well from the British army in India which back in the day was its own entity and a great tradition of military glory albeit in an imperialist cause. For American audiences just think of Connery and Caine as a couple of GIs recently finished with their service.I think I understand their characters. What would Connery and Caine be back in civilian life if they returned to the United Kingdom? No one terribly important no doubt. They've spent time in India learned a lot about the language and customs and want to turn some profit in it doing something really big. It's a dream we can all identify with but few of us have the gumption to see it through.Connery and Caine give some of their best screen performances in The Man Who Would Be king. This film became both a critical and box office success for John Huston his first really big smash hit in a long time. It holds up well today and will for all time to come.".

Great locations great direction great art direction great story great plotting and most especially great acting.Michael Caine and Sean Connery have done bigger works but together they have made the biggest work they could ever do.  The spirit and life in their charactersthe sheer optimism that they show even in the final scenes of the film are heart wrenching and beautiful.  They make Daniel Dravot Esquire and Peachy Carnehan come to beautiful life embodying all that is innocent in two men who have been to war conquered their demons and now desire to fulfill the rest of their dreams.The underlying subplot of freemasonry is an interesting one as well.  For it would not have been out of character for men such as Danny and Peachy to have been masons nor for Kipling to be one as well. Did anyone ever note that this was Christopher Plummer's first of two roles that dealt quite a lot with freemasonry? Murder by Decree four years later is the otherI just love this movie for itself.  I've been a fan of H. Rider Haggard and it's the same kind of thrill you get in reading his work.  I just HATED it when they started remaking the Haggard movies and putting women like Sharon Stone in them when it's supposed to be a male adventure.  You would certainly never find a woman like that in The Man Who Would Be Kingit is the TRUE essence of a film about MEN in a MAN'S era.Michael Caine and Sean Connery are for lack of a better word geniuses in the art of filmmaking.  They have become true ACTORS because they love their craft so much and know the difference between acting and faking it. They are not out to prove themselves stars because they don't need thatthey know how to ACT and that is far more important.If any filmmaker now were to tackle a project such as The Man Who Would Be King they would likely try to cast some big name star such as Tom Cruise and ruin the story.  Let's hope this film is NOT remadeit would certainly taint what is perhaps one of the few masterpieces of modern day story telling.".

They are not out to prove themselves stars because they don't need thatthey know how to ACT and that is far more important.If any filmmaker now were to tackle a project such as The Man Who Would Be King they would likely try to cast some big name star such as Tom Cruise and ruin the story.  Let's hope this film is NOT remadeit would certainly taint what is perhaps one of the few masterpieces of modern day story telling.";

	schema:reviewBody "I think it's one of the greatest adventure stories ever written!  John Huston on Rudyard Kipling's short story The Man Who Would Be King A glorious tall tale by director John Huston The Man Who Would Be King stars Michael Caine and Sean Connery as Peachy and Danny a pair of exBritish Army Sergeants. Realizing that 19th century Imperialism is not designed to benefit the lowly footsoldiers who enact the policies and mandates of the Empire Peachy and Danny decide to become private Imperialists they resolve to conquer territory for their own personal gain.Huston made many films about rugged adventurers and affable scoundrels. Few of his rapscallions though are as much fun as Peachy and Danny who in typical John Huston fashion are seeking fame fortune and adventures in exotic faraway lands. We're not little men they say with a smirk and there's nothing we're afraid of! Fittingly Huston's film is structured as a tale within a tale our heroes recounting a story to Rudyard Kipling Christopher Plummer the legendary writer upon whose novel the film is based. This technique allows Huston to adopt a very farcical tone we're always aware that The Man Who Would be King is a very TALL TALE falsified and made larger than life by both the narrator Michael Caine and the man who in turn narrates the narrator's narration to us Rudyard KiplingJohn Huston.The film thus unfolds like a ridiculously embellished adventure our heroes travelling over mountains through Afghanistan and into the desert nation of Kafiristan. Their journey is absolutely preposterous Nobody's done that before! Kipling growls in the film but it's only the beginning.Once in Kafiristan Danny and Peachy defeat a local army conquer a castle raise a militia and proceed to conquer yet more territory. By the film's end our duo has an entire monastery believing that Danny's an ancient god and so deserving of their riches women and adulation.Of course like Huston's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre the good times eventually come crashing down. If King's first half offers camaraderie wit and funny banter its second half offers madness egomania and eventually defeat the natives of Kafiristan figure out that our rogues are conartists and promptly kick their butts out of Afghanistan. But even this defeat is taken with good cheer by our two rascals. They really are an infectious bunch.All adventurers need a side kick and so Huston provides an exBurkha soldier called Billy Fish Saeed Jaffery a funny guy who serves as the interpreter and friend of our rogues. Fish spouts a ridiculous accent  a merger of British and Indian  and is constantly spewing an array of silly one liners.It's not all fun and games though. Though the film can be enjoyed as a bouncy adventure it can equally be viewed as a story of two men battling convention naysayers and nature as a comment on colonialism as a psychological parable about greed and ambition and as a study of religion and the role it plays in certain cultures as well as the way the very same faith which enables heroes to move mountains can quickly and easily lead to self delusion.Like many of Kipling's works the film also critiques White Imperialism. This was afterall an Empire which stretched across the planet and which would be directly and indirectly responsible for billions of deaths. In Huston's hands Danny and Peachy thus become a metaphor for the Empire's arrogance brashly conquering territory promoting itself as a saviourgod misunderstanding customs acting racist and pitting one tribe against the next all in an attempt to wrestle away more wealth and control. Furthermore the fact that our heroes are exposed as frauds and chased out of Kafiristan strongly resembles the various revolutions that rocketed across the British Empire during the decade in which Kipling's tale was written late 1880s. ie  the Empire came saw conquered and then deservedly got kicked out of town.What's remarkable though is how sophisticated The Man Who Would be King is compared to other similar films of the era. One must remember the 1950s70s were packed with films which attempted to rehabilitate the Age of Empire and which attempted to whitewash and glorify British Imperialism Khartoum Zulu King of the Khyber Rifles The Planter's Wife Safari North West Frontier East of Sudan etc. Countering these films were serious directors like David Lean Satyajit Ray and straightfaced fare like Gandhi and Guns at Batasi. Huston though has made an antiImperialist adventure with the bounce of a 1930s50s Imperialist lark. He pulls this off thanks largely to Michael Caine's performance and a subtly tongueincheek script.8.910  One of Huston's greatest films. See Pontecorvo's Burn Herzog's Wrath of God Goodbye Uncle Tom Passage to India Full Metal Jacket and The Quiet American. Worth two viewings.".

	schema:reviewBody "Filmed in Spain by Spaniards this is a Spanish tale based on a French novel and the French opera which it inspired.  Saura's flamenco Carmen is an exciting work of art.A modern ensemble of musicians and dancers is rehearsing a flamenco interpretation of the Carmen story.  The producer and star dancer is Antonio Antonio Gades.  The setting appears to be suburban Madrid but we see so little of the world outside the rehearsal room that it hardly matters. Antonio has done his research and has become obsessed with the Carmen legend.  He chooses a girl named Carmen to play 'his' Carmen and life begins tragically to imitate art ...The opening credits are backed by Dore prints with Bizet playing. This is clearly going to be a production which makes clever use of the manylayered Carmen myth.  And so it proves.  Antonio pores over his copy of Merimee and as a knot of singers and guitarists breaks into an improvised buleria we hear Bizet jarringly overlaid.  Antonio is being pulled in two directions simultaneously possessed by the duende of authentic flamenco and lured by the bewitching Carmen of 19thcentury romanticism.  One current the flamenco is spontaneous and natural the other is unSpanish and highly theatrical.  Both are warring and fermenting within Antonio's psyche.Cats don't come when you call them observes Antonio and they come when you don't call.  Herein is the essence of Carmen's wild character. Antonio has Cristina as his senior dancer the marvellous Cristina Hoyos but as he tells her good though she is she is not 'the' Carmen.  He travels to Seville where else? in search of his ideal and there he finds his leading lady  and his nemesis.  The young gypsy beauty scrambles into the dance class late her unruly dignity immediately apparent and we see in Antonio's face that he knows.  This is 'his' Carmen.The film's artistic conceit is a subtle movement between actuality and fantasy echoing the conflict between the truth of flamenco and the falseness of the Bizet Carmen.  Are Cristina and Carmen at each other's throats in real life or is this Antonio's heated imagination expanding on the Tabacalera clash?  Is the Habanera scene a straightforward rehearsal or Antonio's reverie?  Does Carmen really appear wearing the high comb and mantilla or has Antonio succumbed to the myth?Antonio 'sculpts' Carmen teaching the youngster how to dance and how to feel the dance.  He pushes her hard and makes enormous physical demands of her yet from the first cigarette the dynamics are established  Carmen is unknowable untameable.  Antonio will end by destroying his creation. He is Don Jose and he can't help it.In this deeply attractive film some scenes transcend even the excellent norm.  Such a scene is the Tabacalera number.  The women pound the tables in a flamenco rhythm as they sing the haunting Don't Go Near The Brambles.  The hostility between Cristina and Carmen boils over into violence faithfully reproducing Merimee and Bizet and all portrayed in dance.  As Antonio arrives in the role of Don Jose to arrest the gypsy wildcat Bizet's tragic motif begins to play.Carmen and Antonio drink a glass of manzanilla together symbolically cementing their relationship.  At her bidding Antonio dances the Farruca the 'baile jondo' the key which unlocks the secret of flamenco.  Aroused Carmen joins in and the dance always a metaphor for copulation merges into actual lovemaking.  But delight is followed by disappointment. At 2am Antonio wakes to find Carmen grabbing her clothes and slipping away.  It is futile to ask why.  She is Carmen.Antonio dances alone in the rehearsal room.  The room's stark cuboid with its wholewall mirror makes an interesting contrast with his fluid mobile form.  Does dancing help him think?  Do his thoughts inspire his dance?  The image of a man moving beautifully in a bare box of a room is one of the film's quiet triumphs.At this crucial point in their blossoming love affair Carmen and Antonio begin to take divergent paths.  This is intelligently depicted by the use of parallel scenes.  Antonio sweeps open the drapes to let in the first light of a new day while somewhere else electronic grilles part in a parody of Antonio's curtains to admit Carmen to a prison.  She is visiting the jailbird husband whom she doesn't love.  Antonio has grown emotionally Carmen is a lowlife hustler incapable of change.  In a Christlike gesture Antonio drinks a solitary glass of manzanilla the cup of the passion which will not pass him by.The best scene of the film straddling reality and fantasy ordinariness and high artifice dance and dialogue is the poker game. The jailbird Jose Fernandez has left prison and joined the troupe.  There is a powerful flamenco dance in which Antonio and the gitano confront each other and fight.  Afterwards as he gets up from the floor Jose removes his wig and others gather round solicitous for his wellbeing.  Once more the film has drawn us into an emotional conflict only to strip away the illusion.Other treasures abound.  The corrida is lovingly depicted in mockdance with balletic veronicas and a silent faena then there is the 'danceoff' between a jealous Antonio and an imperious Carmen with their contrasting rhythmic signatures and the squalor of betrayal and abuse in which the story culminates.  The presence of Paco de Lucia legendary guitarist and the scion of a great flamenco dynasty is in itself a certificate of the film's artistic authenticity.Verdict  a superb unfussy modern work which captures the strong flavour of this ancient Spanish folkart on film.".

Antonio has Cristina as his senior dancer the marvellous Cristina Hoyos but as he tells her good though she is she is not 'the' Carmen.  He travels to Seville where else? in search of his ideal and there he finds his leading lady  and his nemesis.  The young gypsy beauty scrambles into the dance class late her unruly dignity immediately apparent and we see in Antonio's face that he knows.  This is 'his' Carmen.The film's artistic conceit is a subtle movement between actuality and fantasy echoing the conflict between the truth of flamenco and the falseness of the Bizet Carmen.  Are Cristina and Carmen at each other's throats in real life or is this Antonio's heated imagination expanding on the Tabacalera clash?  Is the Habanera scene a straightforward rehearsal or Antonio's reverie?  Does Carmen really appear wearing the high comb and mantilla or has Antonio succumbed to the myth?Antonio 'sculpts' Carmen teaching the youngster how to dance and how to feel the dance.  He pushes her hard and makes enormous physical demands of her yet from the first cigarette the dynamics are established  Carmen is unknowable untameable.  Antonio will end by destroying his creation. He is Don Jose and he can't help it.In this deeply attractive film some scenes transcend even the excellent norm.  Such a scene is the Tabacalera number.  The women pound the tables in a flamenco rhythm as they sing the haunting Don't Go Near The Brambles.  The hostility between Cristina and Carmen boils over into violence faithfully reproducing Merimee and Bizet and all portrayed in dance.  As Antonio arrives in the role of Don Jose to arrest the gypsy wildcat Bizet's tragic motif begins to play.Carmen and Antonio drink a glass of manzanilla together symbolically cementing their relationship.  At her bidding Antonio dances the Farruca the 'baile jondo' the key which unlocks the secret of flamenco.  Aroused Carmen joins in and the dance always a metaphor for copulation merges into actual lovemaking.  But delight is followed by disappointment. At 2am Antonio wakes to find Carmen grabbing her clothes and slipping away.  It is futile to ask why.  She is Carmen.Antonio dances alone in the rehearsal room.  The room's stark cuboid with its wholewall mirror makes an interesting contrast with his fluid mobile form.  Does dancing help him think?  Do his thoughts inspire his dance?  The image of a man moving beautifully in a bare box of a room is one of the film's quiet triumphs.At this crucial point in their blossoming love affair Carmen and Antonio begin to take divergent paths.  This is intelligently depicted by the use of parallel scenes.  Antonio sweeps open the drapes to let in the first light of a new day while somewhere else electronic grilles part in a parody of Antonio's curtains to admit Carmen to a prison.  She is visiting the jailbird husband whom she doesn't love.  Antonio has grown emotionally Carmen is a lowlife hustler incapable of change.  In a Christlike gesture Antonio drinks a solitary glass of manzanilla the cup of the passion which will not pass him by.The best scene of the film straddling reality and fantasy ordinariness and high artifice dance and dialogue is the poker game. The jailbird Jose Fernandez has left prison and joined the troupe.  There is a powerful flamenco dance in which Antonio and the gitano confront each other and fight.  Afterwards as he gets up from the floor Jose removes his wig and others gather round solicitous for his wellbeing.  Once more the film has drawn us into an emotional conflict only to strip away the illusion.Other treasures abound.  The corrida is lovingly depicted in mockdance with balletic veronicas and a silent faena then there is the 'danceoff' between a jealous Antonio and an imperious Carmen with their contrasting rhythmic signatures and the squalor of betrayal and abuse in which the story culminates.  The presence of Paco de Lucia legendary guitarist and the scion of a great flamenco dynasty is in itself a certificate of the film's artistic authenticity.Verdict  a superb unfussy modern work which captures the strong flavour of this ancient Spanish folkart on film.";

Hoyos had been the first dancer in Gades' company for twenty years 19681988 and she was the protagonist of three films that Carlos Saura made of Gades' three great shows Bodas de Sangre 1978 Carmen 1983 and El Amor Brujo 1985. Gorgeous Laura del Sol is a young dancer named Carmen in whom Antony sees from the first sight another Carmen who was immortalized by two Frenchmen the writer Prosper Mrime in his most famous novella written in 1846 that had inspired George Bizet's world famous OpraComique version from 1875.As in the opera and in the novella Carmen in Saura's film is desirable and deadly the ultimate femme fatale who has to be free above anything else. She could not tolerate the possessive love of any man and would prefer death to submission. There some 50 movie adaptations of the story and the opera to the screen and as different as they are they all have in common the only possible tragic end.

	schema:reviewBody "On the face of it Carlos Saura's 1983 Carmen is simply yet another version  to join dozens of others  of Bizet's worldfamous opera using flamenco music and dance and a modern storyline alongside elements of the opera. Following in the footsteps of many a Hollywood musical Saura sets his story in the period of rehearsal before a new production except in this case there is no successful opening night as the climax of the movie but a tragic death echoing the opera. The music and dancing are dramatic passionate and exciting especially for those of us who love flamenco and the weaving together of the modern characters and plot with those of the opera is effective if somewhat contrived.   There is however an ironic aspect to the film. Possibly no country in the western world has a stronger culture than Spain. Spanish food drink language literature music dance and much else are unique and immediately identifiable. Yet one of its national icons  the freespirited gypsy Carmen who seduces and abandons men at will  is a totally French creation. Bizet who never set foot in Spain based his 1875 opera on a story by Prosper Merime also a Frenchman and no matter how Spanish his music sounds it is merely imitation. So for Saura to base a film on Carmen has a significance not shared  by the other two films in his flamenco trilogy  Blood Wedding and Love the Magician  where the originals are quintessentially Spanish.It is tempting therefore to regard the film as a kind of reclamation for Spain of Bizet's pseudoSpanish Carmen. And certainly in the adaptation for guitar of some of Bizet's music and in the translation to flamenco dance of some of the action of the opera such a reclamation or reconciliation has taken place. But I for one wish that Saura had gone further had deconstructed the original stereotypes and had shown that by the late 20th century Jos had grown up and could  refrain from knifing Carmen no matter how Spanish he might feel and how freespirited she might be. In other words perhaps a happy Hollywood ending would not have been such a bad idea!".

All these years later my friends and I still love to debate whether or not Carmen is really stabbed at the end. From the reactions of the other characters to the stylized murder it is open to debate.

	schema:headline " A powerful experience";
	schema:reviewBody "The amazing grace and power of flamenco has never been on more vigorous display than in Carlos Saura Carmen the second of the Spanish director's flamenco trilogy that includes Blood Wedding 1981 Carmen 1983 and El Amor Brujo 1986. Although the epitaph for movie musicals has now been written there was never one more alive than this soaring dance interpretation of Bizet's opera based on the novella by Prosper Merimee. Winner of the BAFTA award for Best Foreignlanguage film and nominated for an Oscar in the same category in Carmen Saura attempts to expand the limited vision of the French opera into a deeper and more artistic example of Spain's national identity. Supported by performances by Spain's great guitarist Paco de Lucia and familiar songs by Bizet such as Toreador's March La Habanera and the lovely Intermezzo the film bursts with energy and sensuality.Shot in Gades' dance studio in Madrid the film is marked by riveting performances by Antonio Gades former director of the National Ballet of Spain Cristina Hoyos an acclaimed flamenco dancer and singer and dancer Laura del Sol in her first leading role. Carmen opens with the director of the dance company Gades rehearsing for a dance production of the opera. He is searching among his students for a young dancer to play the lead role but has not found one that suits his ideal. According to Gades he wants a girl with a wild and strange beauty her lips full and well shaped opening onto small teeth whiter than the whitest pearls her long black shiny hair with blue glints similar to a raven's feathers and eyes with a voluptuous but surly expression. It is only when the directorchoreographer travels to a similar studio in Seville that he finds his Carmen played by the darkhaired del Sol. The film then moves seamlessly between the rehearsals of the company for its new production and the lives of the dancers reflecting the story of the opera in an almost surreal way that blurs the distinction between illusion and reality. The teacher becomes personally involved with his student but finds that she is elusive selfabsorbed and proud of her independence. When he discovers however that she is married and her husband has just been released from prison after serving a sentence on a drugrelated charge his possessiveness turns into a destructive jealousy that ends the film on a melodramatic tone.Some of the most memorable scenes in Carmen include Gades dancing the Ferucca in his own home as his lover sees him through his window then once inside watches while he performs a full routine. Another remarkable sequence is the dance between Gades and Christina that depicts the malefemale relationship with elegance and grace. Though the performance by del Sol captures Carmen's fiercely independent streak for me she seems a bit too wholesome to be fully convincing as a jezebel leaving the tragic resolution of the story feeling unmotivated. Whether or not you find the drama convincing however ultimately the film is not about the story but about the passion and breathtaking art of the dance. Carmen is a powerful experience that can evoke in the viewer an unexpected feeling of wonder".

Dance isn't just bodies moving though that's what we come to see. There's always something antecedent to it that animates the desire in the original gypsy world of flamenco I suppose this was marginalization poverty lawlessness it comes down to an anger passion or pride that can't be reasoned and is let out in abstract shape. Here we have a flamenco staging about a flamenco staging of Carmen become animated by the same tumultuous passions in the opera. The inner Carmen story blurs in the outer Carmen which is about staging Carmen with a real passion thus enlarging the stage to encompass the life that gives shape to it. So when Carmen and her rival in the troupe dance out their rivalry or Carmen and her instructor dance out the seduction we have a richer more dangerous life than the opera or dance could afford.Saura had made another exercise prior to this and what looks like a few more mixing dance with a story about the urges. It's smarter to notice than powerful to watch because it's sparse and feels like a sketch.

Visually Carmen is stunning with ravishing cinematography sumptuous colour and costumes and costumes and scenery that are enough to take the breath away. The music is magnificent as well and performed with authentic flavour which makes the experience even more passionate. The choreography is very vivid and shows a big amount of technical even virtuosic brilliance while the Flamenco dancing is not only efficient but the dancers actually show they're into it. The story is still as beautiful and passionate as ever while the performances of Antonio Gades and Laura De Sol are superb and the two are riveting together.

Visually Carmen is stunning with ravishing cinematography sumptuous colour and costumes and costumes and scenery that are enough to take the breath away. The music is magnificent as well and performed with authentic flavour which makes the experience even more passionate. The choreography is very vivid and shows a big amount of technical even virtuosic brilliance while the Flamenco dancing is not only efficient but the dancers actually show they're into it. The story is still as beautiful and passionate as ever while the performances of Antonio Gades and Laura De Sol are superb and the two are riveting together. Every scene is compelling but my favourite is the Poker scene which is one of the better scenes of any film I've seen recently. In conclusion a must watch. 910 Bethany Cox";

And Ishaan just cannot seem to get anything right in class. When he gets into far more trouble than his parents can handle he is packed off to a boarding school to 'be disciplined'. Things are no different at his new school and Ishaan has to contend with the added trauma of separation from his family. One day a new art teacher bursts onto the scene Ram Shankar Nikumbh who infects the students with joy and optimism. He breaks all the rules of 'how things are done' by asking them to think dream and imagine and all the children respond with enthusiasm all except Ishaan.

	schema:reviewBody "As I just became aware of this film a few weeks ago and ordered a DVD and watched it today 10911 this review is unlikely to be seen by many because the film is 4 years old and there are nearly 250 user reviews already. So rather than rehash the plot I will first mention that I have been an Educational Therapist for over 45 years and have worked extensively with dyslexic and ADD and ADHD children in my practice so this film had intrinsic interest to me going in. But despite seeing many films on learning problems through the years some very good I have never seen any movie that can come close to this one both in emotional power and subject accuracy. When I saw that the film is 165 minutes long I was expecting to watch it in two sittings but I never once felt the need to take a break and in the second half of the film when the director Aamir Khan enters the story I was riveted continuously and embarrassingly shed more than a few tears. If you have any interest in education and the problems the outsiders face this is a mustsee. And if you just want to see an intelligent drama with no car chases explosions sex scenes or ultra violence then you will be glad you saw this wonderful film which by the way while it is about children is not really for children unless they are over about 11 or 12 or have suffered the experience of failing due to undiagnosed or treated reading or similar learning difference. Don't let the Disney Studio name fool you this does not feel like a typical Disney movie but the film does point out that Walt Disney himself had school learning problems as a child. Another aspect of the film is something I always try to impart to my clients There is life after school. And it is not necessary to be the best at everything to be successful. Just become the best you are able and try to find something you like doing that makes you happy.The rest will take care of itself. What a great film!Since I first wrote this review I have rewatched it 5 more times and now consider it the best film I have ever seen and that encompasses about 2500 films.".

What it stands for and depicts stunningly is how the cruel world outside is stealing away our children's precious childhood. It is about how our parents are turning into monsters and imposing their own dreams and aspirations on their children which eventually destroys our children's confidence and can only create a generation of hate. Its about how each child needs attention and care and how we so lack those qualities in this life thats bounded by time.Aamir Khan does a fabulous job both behind and in front of the camera. There are scenes in which just his facial expressions tugs at our hearts and moves us. That is truly the hallmark of a great actor. But then Taare Zameen Par is not about Aamir. Its truly owned by Darsheel Safary. Right from the first scene to the very end he steals the show and our hearts with his endearing acting.Taare Zameen Par is a biting criticism of the times we live in. But it also makes you smile laugh cry nod in agreement and seethe with anger.. everything that a movie is supposed to do. It truly is a movie which everyone can relate to. Reminds you that movies are meant to make us think.. to provoke us and act as a mirror of our times. Taare Zameen Par does all this and much more.

	schema:reviewBody "How many times has there been a movie you could really relate to? How many times has it happened that you've seen a character on the screen that reminds of something that you've been through in your life? As I saw Ishan Darsheel Safary today I felt somewhere deep within that that's me.Notwithstanding the slight retard nature dyslexia and bad academic performance the character of Ishan really made me remember my childhood today. I remember I was something like him as a child.creative and imaginative. And my imagination always went unappreciated. I used to curate gibberish  just like he did. I painted I dreamed and I fantasized about different things. So I feel writer Amol Gupte and director Aamir Khan what a wonderful debut! have picked an incredibly moving story. Frankly I am not easily moved by movies. Not even the greatest tearjerkers have managed to move me but for a moment I was stunned. Is this really happening to me? Am I trying to cry? In fact the scene where Ram Aamir Khan walks into Ishan's room and discovers a score of sketches and drawings it made me feel like somebody had in fact opened my closet and discovered my secret childhood fantasies Believe me I still have them. This movie will surely engage all those who have had similar incidents in their lives. That's for sure. I am moved. I love this film. I don't know and I don't care how this film does in the box office but let me tell you don't watch this film if you're looking for regular boy meets girl story. Don't even skip this film thinking it's children's movie  no it isn't. In fact Taare Zameen Par is a movie potentially targeted towards parents. But if you think you too have undergone similar childhood conflicts and lived a life where the people around you refuse to appreciate your fantasies then definitely go for it. TZP mirrors many of those people's lives that looks just plain and simple but those who compromised their dreams for the sake of the earthly existence.Okay enough of fantasies. Technically writer Amol Gupte delivers an A Grade script. Aamir Khan shows his talent not just as an actor but a very versatile and intelligent. Oscar Wilde Leonardo da Vinci and Sally Gardner were hardly ever heard of in Hindi cinema before this. The writer just does not deliver a well written script but also his knowledge of research which other filmmakers hardly ever do! Musically it's twothumbs up for Shanker Ehsaan Loy. The title song is fascinating. Maa and Jame Raho combine talents in all respects music words and voice. The production design is superb. Not for a moment you feel anything is fake. They even managed to squeeze in some quick visual effects and animated scenes. They're there to add another dimension to great story telling. The casting is good and well justified. Little Darsheel steals the show. Tisca Chopra grabs attention.Aamir Khan however stuns the audience by appearing at almost near half of the film. That's the surprise but you don't miss Aamir in the first half because Darsheel will definitely grab your attention and Aamir gets to show some good directorial talent.All in all I'd say go and watch the film. I wouldn't recommend if you're addicted to Yashraj stuffs but if you really want to see some intelligent filmmaking then Taare Zameen Par is a treat.".

	schema:headline " A great inspiring movie for all Every child is special";
	schema:reviewBody "Although Bollywood releases 100s of movies every year but few of them has really left a mark on the audience for a long time. I am pretty much sure that this movie has done an excellent job for all those people who are creative but not good in academics. Many people think things differently but in India like country where competition begins at the age of 4 they are just a dumb in the society. Amir khan has done a very good job on both sides on the screen and off the screen besides he doesn't appear too often on the screen but Darsheel Safary steals the whole movie show.What a nice performance by a 89 year old child you are really gonna love this child. The movie brings our sweet childhood memories back.Its a mix of emotion laugh and cry. We can imagine how we exploit children because they are not like us or they are not able to do what their parents want them to do.At the start movie shows that how a little childDarsheel Safary is forced to do what he can't understand. He gets lowest marks in the class and he has failed once in class three.Sometimes he bunk the class and most of the time he has been out of the class because he don't understand how to turn a page number of the book or while reading letters dance so he can't read. After fear of being thrown him out of the school his parents put him in a boarding school.They think he is lazy and notorious.But in boarding school situation gets worse until a drawing teacherAmir khan gets an appointment as a temporary teacher. After that Amir teaches him in different way and ultimately he gets the success.In this movie director has taken two child one who always gets first and who is punctual for his work and other one is Darsheel Safary who is not good in academics because he can't understand letters and can't memorize too much things at a time. This movie is a motivation for all kind of child and their parents. Everyone should must watch this movie at least once. If you are too emotional then u may cry with Amir khan.".

	schema:headline " Aamir scores an Ace TZP a natural delight.";
	schema:reviewBody "The ghost director has been resurrected in human flesh and yes Mr Perfectionist has got it all perfect. His maiden directorial venture is a delight for one and all. Whether you are a kid or a teenager just married or if you are a parent  Yes... You'll love it! Prerelease in what appeared to be a non mainstream film shines like a UNIVERSAL film which will keep the box office abuzz.The story moves along at a very natural pace at which the viewer is able to connect to the 8 year old dyslexic boy played by Darsheel Safary. That is the biggest plus point of the movie the viewer draws parallel with the boys character connecting with him at a very high emotional level. You'll reminisce and be transported back to those wonderful years of your childhood and will have more than a tear in the eye. The scene where the boy is admitted in the boarding school and bidding goodbye to his parents and brother followed by the 'Maa' song is a real tear jerker. But tears is not all what you are going to have the screenplay makes sure that those tear jerking moments are followed by heavy doses of laughter with some lovely and innocent humorous moments.If you thought that only Sanjay Leela Bhansali knew how to capture art on celluloid then watch TZP. The boy's bunked day at school his room classroom decor and the painting competition in the end are a colorful visual delight expressing a million words to the viewers.Yes its true. Aamir's character appears just before the end of the first half but one is so engrossed that Aamir  The actor's absence is not felt. Thats remarkable! All the credit goes to the protagonist played by Darsheel who in my books gives the best performance till date by a child artist in Hindi Cinema. He is the heart and soul of the movie and how naturally this boy handles scenes of intense emotions with such ease in his first movie is stunning. Tisca Chopra as the boy's mother gives a top notch performance at par if not above the likes of roles played by Nirupa Roy Rakhi and Kirron Kher.Aamir the actor has a shorter but powerful role which he performs decently. But at the end of the day its Aamir  The Director who wins hands down by extracting 'A GRADE' performances from all the cast and making a movie which connects to the heart of the viewer. The second half becomes a little slow in between and it could have been more crisp. But thats negligible because in the end the movie manages convincingly to convey a very important message to today's parents  Your kids are not race horses of a derby. Let them travel life at their pace as each has their unique mission which only they can fulfill.Lastly TZP just made 2007 better and interesting. The award season is knocking and well watch out TZP may just pull off a surprise or two by upsetting the favorites so far...".

And when in this moment of dearth one gets treated to a movie that simply touches the soul  needless to say  Taare Zameen Par  does just that.Aamir Khan proves his mettle as a director. As an actor he is fabulous. The story captures a look at a middle class family who feel the younger kid Darsheel Safary is not a patch on the elder one who is a topper at class. The younger one is always struggling with his ABCs and spends more time out of his class rather than inside.Its only when he is sent to boarding school with the hope that an iron fist will help him improve that he comes across art teacher Aamir Khan who correctly identities his problem of suffering from dyslexia and decides to unleash his creativity and make him an achiever.To know more one should watch this movie since it has elements that everyone could relate towards while at school or boarding and brings into focus the need for underprivileged and slow learning children to be given the chance to prove themselves with patience and love that would help them merge with mainstream education and become worthwhile contributors.Brilliant job Aamir and your team for treating the subject with respect honesty and flair. Darsheel Safary as the struggling kid has done total justice to his role and puts in a performance that will always be remembered.The movie will make you cry make you laugh make you rejoice and come out feeling that there are some people out there who take Indian cinema several notches higher.".

This movie really hits you.In a way everyone can relate to it especially if you have grown up in India where most children are classified as dumb or unintelligent if they can't become engineers or doctors. I went in with huge expectations and this movie exceeded them.Some reviews have complained about situations in the movie being too simple or repetitive in parts but I have absolutely no problems with that. This is no thriller. You know what's going to happen but you are looking forward to it too.The songs might not be great hits but they gel really well with the movie. They are beautifully worded and capture the emotions of the characters perfectly.When the end credits started rolling most people started walking towards the exit but even when they had almost stopped rolling most of them were still standing near the exit watching the images in the end credits.".

	schema:reviewBody "I sat down in my local theatre with no expectations at all and what I was in for for the coming couple of hours was just mind boggling. Taare Zameen Par might not win any awards might not get the praise it so surely deserves but don't let that fool you. For this movie is not just a story about Ishaan but a masterpiece ! Ishaan is a 8 year old boy who suffers from dyslexia no matter how hard he tries he just doesn't succeed in day to day activities. But what is mostly the case in our hard society is that people don't understand him and his shortcomings. Most of the times they paint him off as a lazyno goodbrat and this drives his father so far that he will have no more of this nonsense and sends young Ishaan off to boarding school where he gets treatened even worse. But one day arrives Mr Ramshankar Nikumbh a temporary artteacher and the only person in the world that understands Ishaan's problem. Taare Zameen Par moves on as Mr Nikumbh tries to understand and help out Ishaan with his problem. This starts a journey far greater and more beautiful we could ever imagine.I have seen a thousand movies and I must say that I haven't seen a script acted out so well for quite a while now. For nonmovie buffs let me explain good acting there are a few ways to tell brilliant acting from good acting . Just look for the quality view every character as the character itself and not as the actor behind it acting the part out. If you don't see the actor only the character that means you are convinced of the quality of acting. A view examples Marlon Brando played The godfather so convincingly that for years to come people didn't see Brando but Vito Corleone same goes for Pacino when he played Scarface and so forth. Taare Zameen Par is a work of great acting by everyone it feels so real and the characters grow on to you as the movie continues. And this is very strange for a Bollywood movie. Let's be real this is the film industry who had us believing that Hritik was a jewel thief and that Abishek was a police officer how entertaining it might be but it just doesn't feel real. For a character to feel real like they do in Taare Zameen Par there is need for a great written script and clever dialogue. The actors just do what they are supposed to and the movie plays out nicely. Then there's only the editing the background score the location ... to worry about. And if everything is according to a pallet compare it to a painting where every element blends in with the other we get a great movie. And only once in a while we witness a masterpiece and that's exactly what TZP is and this time it's not because of Mr Khan but because of his apprentice Darsheel Safary. The young boy who played Ishaan Darsheel Safary is one of the best child artists I've seen coming out of Bollywood and what a first starrer this kid got. I surely would like to see more of him in the near future. And for Aamir Khan's first movie TZP wouldn't have been the same without Safary. Although some credit goes to Mr Khan himself as well. Known to be a perfectionist his directional debut is a clearcut proof of this. TZP is not just a movie about kids it's a movie about life society and yourself as a personality. The story moves you into nostalgic days of your childhood when you were forced and pressured by your parents or teachers into the world of a child who is illtreated an misunderstood into the hard truths of our society were failure is looked down on. If there ever was a movie who could make you smile cry and enjoy the trip it's Taare Zameen Par. A great watch for everyone. This doesn't feel like a movie coming from Bollywood but a movie for the masses. I surely hope this does well.".

The first thing my sister said when we were out of the theater was I want that kid's autograph. Darsheel Safary did a brilliant job as the dyslexic but cute Ishaan. I recommend that ALL parents watch this movie WITH their kids. This movie shows the effects of parental pressure social isolation andinspiration of course. Aamir Khan was very provoking as the caring art teacher Nikumbh that recognizes young Ishaan's mental withdrawal yet his amazing ability to paint and build. It is one thing to imagine such bizarre things but to put it on paper or construct things in an appealing way is definitely a gift. I thought that no part of the movie was melodramatic or overly done which is a major concern in Indian movies. Instead I thought that there was a lot of promise in this movie just like how there is a promise in every child that has the motivation and faith to achieve something. And the title translated as Little Stars on Earth describes all children that are looking for this promise although they may not have everything that most children have. Wowwhat an effect this movie had on me".

PicassoThe child must know that he is a miracle that since the beginning of the world there hasn't been and until the end of the world there will not be another child like him.  Pablo CasalsIt's a little while after intermission in the movie Taare Zameen Par. By this time we the audience have already seen that Ishaan Awasthi Darsheel Safary is a kid who's been failing his classes at day school and is mocked as an idiot by both teachers and classmates. He has now been packed and sent to a boarding school. His parents hope this will improve his grades. In the new environment Ishaan finds it all the more harder to understand concepts that are easy for his peers. The teachers who rap on his knuckles and the rules at the school have broken into him. He has lost the zest of a kid he's become a zombie deaf to the world.It's the Arts class being taught by the temporary Arts teacher Ram Nikumbh Aamir Khan. In the quest to understand what's been eating Ishaan he has examined his notebooks talked to his parents and discovered that the silent pupil in his class might be dyslexic. In this class he starts to tell a story to the students. Once upon a time there was a kid. He had trouble understanding numbers and alphabets. He couldn't read write and study like his classmates. He pauses then asks Do you know whom I'm talking about? The camera now slips down to the level of the class desks and zeroes in onto the face of Ishaan. His mouth is agape his sad eyes are looking down and as the silent tension in the class rises tears form ready to roll down his face. His name will be mentioned and the students at this school too will mock him now.Ram answers his own question that kid was the great scientist Albert Einstein. Ishaan looks up and is surprised he looks relieved that his own name wasn't brought up. Ram smiles at him and continues to tell the class how Einstein Picasso Leonardo da Vinci and even Abhishek Bachchan had trouble with reading and writing in their youth. As we learn later Ishaan and Einstein are not the only two possible answers to Ram's question. Ram himself is a third.That's just one of the scenes from this movie about a dyslexic kid and a teacher who discovers and helps him. It is the first directorial attempt by Aamir Khan. AK is the only Bollywood hero I admire and I saw the movie today on its release weekend. And loved it! It's a bit long it might be AK's baby but he should've edited it a bit. Other that that I was positively moved by it. There were many scenes that were absolutely golden some even brought a tear to my eye. Watch out for the one where Ishaan floats his propeller boat made of sticks pencils corks and rubberbands in the school pond and it slowly makes its way towards Ram. That scene is both moving and metaphorical. There are many more like that.How do you even attempt to show the audience how the world looks to a kid a dyslexic one? Using beautiful cinematography attention to detail observe how the camera is usually at the kid's height not adult height and sometimes storytelling animation remember Calvin and his space adventures? we get to see how Ishaan relishes the simple sights and sounds of the real world while at the same time is being hounded by the terrors of his textbooks. This is the finest attempt I've ever seen in a movie Hollywood or Bollywood to show how a kid sees the adult world. Brilliant scripting and storytelling AK the director rules!The background music is top notch the title track and its music is superb but the other songs are just OK. AK doesn't even enter the movie until the intermission and even after that he is just a secondary character. Darsheel Safary owns this movie!!! It's his show all the way from the start to the end. Acting that is so brilliant that you can't call it acting. Ishaan has a strict but caring father a loving mother and a helpful elder brother all of whom are characterized very realistically. I'm willing to bet that you will laugh in some scenes and cry in some of the moving scenes especially with his mom and him.I found the movie to be both inspiring and introspective. Dyslexia actually occupies a very small piece of the movie and its message  that each kid is unique and hisher creative imagination needs to be handled with care by parents teachers and society. A highly recommended watch.".

It relates with parents and to be parents and everyone else at the same time. Please don't miss it Aamir as director has arrived! Its his sensitivity which takes u right into the mind of the child and suddenly when the film unfolds u r thinking as a child. Aamir come later just before the interval but has a very major part to play. The child actor darsheel had arguably given performance of the year even beating best of the best performances.Whole team of this movie deserves special standing ovation 1st to choose such topic and then to put it on screen in such sensitive way that u bound to melt!".

It relates with parents and to be parents and everyone else at the same time. Please don't miss it Aamir as director has arrived! Its his sensitivity which takes u right into the mind of the child and suddenly when the film unfolds u r thinking as a child. Aamir come later just before the interval but has a very major part to play. The child actor darsheel had arguably given performance of the year even beating best of the best performances.Whole team of this movie deserves special standing ovation 1st to choose such topic and then to put it on screen in such sensitive way that u bound to melt!";

I felt really sorry for the boy Eshaan and his main problem was that he has a learning disability and is always lost in his fantasy world. The film gave a terrific insight to his fantasy world by showing spinning objects around his head and by an animated sequence. The best scene was the first appearance of Aamir Khan. I have always liked Aamir Khan's films and I would put Tare Zameen Par number 2 on his top 5 best movies  number 1 would be Lagaan. The story was very uplifting which shows that even the worst student can become the best. It was already on the IMDb top 250 when it came out and was on about 180 place but sadly not anymore and I'm disappointed. There is a huge list of crappy films that are on the top 250 but not a single Bollywood movie and this gem is original.".

	schema:reviewBody "If all start living on their own terms this world will be altogether a different place. Childhood is that juvenile period in life when the dreams have no boundaries and sky is the limit. It's only when the weight of someone else's dream comes on your shoulder life turns full circle and you start as if there was no past. Resisting sticking with past raises questions to your capabilities as in this world there is only one way to get praised which is to perform the best in all the fields.This is not just a movie but this is a world from a child's view. Here 39 can be 3 and yes it's logical since Pluto The 9th planet has no more existence. Ishaan is an eight year old boy who is little different from others. Lost in his own world always short of words but yet understands every single aspect of life. Problem with him is to express himself loudly no one understands the way he behaves since he himself is puzzled the way things are going around him. Unclear in expressing himself he presses his parents and teachers to start thinking that he is not one of the normal child but someone who requires special attention. This forces his demanding father to sent him to a boarding school an eight year old boy who always lived his life in shadow of his mother couldn't adjust to this abrupt distance from her and goes into mental trauma which makes him a speechless kid Berated by the teachers and friends around this new world takes every color from his life until his new art teacher Ram comes in and helps him to get outside the nutshell to prove that Ishaan is no less than a brilliant artist in making.It's a lesson for all those parents who expect their child to win all the races one has to accept that you can't have no 1 in every house someone has to be in lower down the order. Actual problem starts when parents start pushing their child to fulfill their own dreams which they saw but couldn't convert into realities. It's not always about being in the race and finishing first sometimes finishing it gracefully also matters. In a way everyone can relate to it especially if you have grown up in India where most children are classified as dumb or unintelligent if they can't become engineers or doctors. Movie is a biting criticism of the times we live in. But it also makes you smile laugh cry nod in agreement and seethe with anger everything that a movie is supposed to do. It truly is a movie which everyone can relate to. Reminds you that movies are meant to make us think to provoke us and act as a mirror of our times. Taare Zameen Par does all this and much more. This is outstanding heartwarming stuff hats off to Aamir for once again taking on an off beat topic and bringing it to life in his directorial debut. This movie surely belongs to children and their childhood.I myself have worked with kids who require help like Ishaan and I know it very well how do they feel when the world is too demanding and there is less power in you to fulfill them. I am happy that I saw this movie well in advance now surely I am going to do justice to the new age coming. I rated this movie as PRG and surely it's a must watch for each parent and future parents.".

I have been a frequent movie goer for last 78 years.But haven't seen a response like I did for this one.Everyone in the theater was in tears and simultaneous applause and is not because it was a sad film but it was overwhelming.I guess there some part of Ishan in all of our lives.The second aspect that I have never witnessed in theaters before was that nobody moved till the credits were over.There is documentary on children at the enddo not miss it for anythingit is as moving as the film.".

But 'Like Stars on Earth' is a magical film about the magnificent abilities that children have even when all the odds are against them. With a story as powerful as this one it doesn't matter where or how the story is told.Luckily most of the Bollywood clichs actually enhance the film experience. Being such an integral part of the story the soundtrack and score complement the film wonderfully. Each song aligning nicely with the film's dramatic but hopeful tone. Admittedly having a rap song play over Ishaan's family getting dressed and ready for the day is a bit jarring but the songs that play after Aamir Khan appear are nothing short of enchanting.This film is about a dyslexic child who has basically given up on school as no one seems to think he's worth anything. His father beats him for goofing off and all of his teachers scold him for not being able to do the simplest of tasks. So Ishaan finds his way to a boarding school where he meets Ram Shankar Nikumbh Aamir Khan who may change his life forever. Everybody had that teacher who changed the way you approached school and perhaps even life itself which is why I thought this movie was so effective. There's nothing more gratifying than watching someone struggling to find their way only to have one uniquely suited person put them back on track. It seems so simple but coming from a teaching background I'll be the first person to say that it can be nearly impossible to connect with someone who doesn't want any help. However when and if that connection is made it's possibly the most fulfilling thing a person can do. Aamir Khan captures these emotions perfectly near the end of Like Stars on Earth. I don't think I'll ever get the image of Ishaan's father breaking down into tears out of my head. There's some really powerful stuff here.8.610".

	schema:headline " Childhood innocence and the joy of little things...";
	schema:reviewBody "Taare Zameen Par is a film about childhood about dreams about love about innocence about the joy of little things. It is about the simple things in life things that are most beautiful yet most often missed by the eye. This is a film that will make you cry make you laugh entertain you and make you love every moment of it.Amol Gupte has written a brilliant story and the director Aamir Khan has only matched up to it. I am sure the film will appeal to the mass audience yet ever individual who watches it will identify with it very personally. That is the magic of cinema and because in this film the entire process beginning from the concept to the postproduction has been so honest it has happened flawlessly. It is about an 8 year old dyslexic boy Ishaan Awasthi enacted by Darsheel Safary who lives in a world of his own. He is not good with academics but excellent at painting. His family cannot understand or accept his problem and they try to set things right with the use of force. The boy is sent to a boarding school which only distances him further from his family and he grows more and more into himself. He withdraws himself from people from painting even from his little pleasures and simple things that once brought him joy. And then a new temporary art teacher Ram Shankar Nikumbh is inducted and everything starts to change.We all live in our shells. We live in denial till the time a problem hits us directly. We need to open our eyes. It is not just about dyslexia but a lot more. I think the film shows people what they refuse to see and while it entertains it subconsciously makes them accept. I honestly feel India really needed a film like this.The narrative the way the story unfolds is excellent. The pace is just right it moves along with the boy and takes you with it. It is a visual treat with the attention to detail and slick editing in Jame Raho to Tarkovsky's Stalker like shots of the drain. Darsheel has given an excellent performance and Aamir Khan has definitely done a great job of his directorial debut. Shankar Ehsaan Loy's music and Prasoon Joshi's lyrics fit the film and the world of childhood just perfectly. The film is sure to touch the lives of anybody and everybody who watches it. And I definitely recommend it to everyone it is a must watch!".

	onyx:emotionText "Taare Zameen Par is a film about childhood about dreams about love about innocence about the joy of little things. It is about the simple things in life things that are most beautiful yet most often missed by the eye. This is a film that will make you cry make you laugh entertain you and make you love every moment of it.Amol Gupte has written a brilliant story and the director Aamir Khan has only matched up to it. I am sure the film will appeal to the mass audience yet ever individual who watches it will identify with it very personally. That is the magic of cinema and because in this film the entire process beginning from the concept to the postproduction has been so honest it has happened flawlessly. It is about an 8 year old dyslexic boy Ishaan Awasthi enacted by Darsheel Safary who lives in a world of his own. He is not good with academics but excellent at painting. His family cannot understand or accept his problem and they try to set things right with the use of force. The boy is sent to a boarding school which only distances him further from his family and he grows more and more into himself. He withdraws himself from people from painting even from his little pleasures and simple things that once brought him joy. And then a new temporary art teacher Ram Shankar Nikumbh is inducted and everything starts to change.We all live in our shells. We live in denial till the time a problem hits us directly. We need to open our eyes. It is not just about dyslexia but a lot more. I think the film shows people what they refuse to see and while it entertains it subconsciously makes them accept. I honestly feel India really needed a film like this.The narrative the way the story unfolds is excellent. The pace is just right it moves along with the boy and takes you with it. It is a visual treat with the attention to detail and slick editing in Jame Raho to Tarkovsky's Stalker like shots of the drain.

	schema:reviewBody "Being Aamir's directorial debut one was sure of a didactic film. Somehow Aamir never sets out to just tell a story or make a movie the social message is never far away. He would almost be a Shyam Benegal if not for the dollops of humor he manages to sprinkle in his movies. The archaic belief that humor stains the purity of a serious message is the biggest mistake made I feel by art movie makers. A brilliant work like Khoya Khoya Chand 2007 was ruined by its droning pace and monotonic atmosphere. You look forward to Aamir's cinema because he uses humor songs even pretty heroines to make sure his serious cinema is taken seriously!The movie is straightforward. Tells the story of a misunderstood dyslexic kid who leads a tortured life till new Teacher Aamir uncle comes and makes everything OK. Everyone is sorry they treated him bad. Happy ending! Blah Blah. Hardly a spoiler I'd say but you'd been warned.What I was not ready for was the dollops of tears that forced their way out of my eyes. I am a Kill Bill type of viewer and any movie with less than 100 explosions and 35 gallons of blood is usually not worth my while. Imagine my surprise when TZP easily squeezed those emotions I never knew I had. So much for predictability!What makes it stick with you is the uncanny acting of the kid. I must commend Aamir's direction in the absence of any other reason to get so many kids to act so naturally. Move over Mr.India! The repressed anger the fear the small joys and the yearning to belong. Ishaan displays everything so effortlessly it would put many matine idols to shame. He manages all this without being corny or melodramatic. Then there is Setu's photography that captures the tiny details we all remember having watched as kids. Then forgotten in the rush to to attend the next concall. Like the ripples made in a puddle after a car runs over the aggressive spray of shower in the bathroom the miracle of watching ice gola being made at Juhu beach...Finally there is Prasoon Joshi. The only reason one would watch this like RDB many times over in theatres! Simple noncomplicated Gulzarji you listening? and pedestrian lyrics. Stuff you can identify with stuff that makes so much sense and yet sounds so poetic! Funny and sad at the same time. Added to Shankar Ehsaan Loy's music and Ram Madhvani's of Let's Talk fame cameo direction each song tells a story.The innovative start credits and lovely collage during endcredits are not to be missed. The movie got a standing ovation at the Bangalore theatre we visited from a predominantly college crowd at that.I hope it sensitizes Indian schools and society to treat all children as mere children. We have to let them enjoy the colors and miracle of nature that adult life requires us to ignore. I loved this movie not so much for its message on dyslexia although it makes a powerful statement as for how it reminded me that I was a kid once. It reminded me how I wished those damn adults would just understand! I remembered how I'd decided to remember my childhood and not change into an adult. Now that I have a kid of my own TZP is just what I needed to make sure I treat my little star with the respect he deserves and not as a race horse.".

Otto Preminger filmed the play during the 1950's.  The songs all retain Bizet's original music but the lyrics have been updated to English.  If you've never seen the opera and are intimidated by opera in general this film would actually be a good introduction to the topic.The plot is moved from a Spanish village during the late 1800's to the American South during WWII.  The cigarette factory is now a parachute factory and the bullfighter is now a prize fighter.  Generally I thought the update was done well just as some Shakespearean updates work well. The only part which doesn't work for me is that some of the dialogue and lyrics are in what I think of as Porgy and Bess Ebonics e.g. dees dem dat etc.Carmen is played by Dorothy Dandridge who is known as the AfricanAmerican Marilyn Monroe.  The two women's lives sadly parallel each other although Dandridge could find even fewer scripts to show off her acting talents. Harry Belafonte plays the seduced male lead.  Both are stunning beautiful and at their prime.All of the singing voices are dubbed by first rank operatic voices the songs for Carmen Jones are dubbed by Marilyn Horne for example.The tragedy is realizing how many great actors and actresses could have had brilliant careers except for their skin color.  It was interesting and sad to watch the Movietone Newsreel coverage of the premiere which came attached to the copy of the tape I had.  It features all of the white movie stars attending the premiere the white studio heads  and just happens to have a second or two of Harry Belafonte and Dorothy Dandridge at the end.".

After Oklahoma debuted Oscar Hammerstein II went to work on his next Broadway show with a dead collaborator. He wrote new lyrics for the music of Georges Bizet's opera Carmen and wrote a new book for an all black cast to perform it in the tradition of Porgy and Bess.That show was Carmen Jones and it ran for 502 performances on Broadway from 1943 to 1945. Hammerstein discovered what the team of Robert Wright and Chet Forrest had previously found out in adapting Edvard Grieg's melodies into their hit Strange Music. That there's nothing like writing with a collaborator who can't complain and who's melodies are already a hit.In fact while the show was originally on Broadway Rise Stevens had sung in Going My Way the song that eventually became Dat's Love. And Nelson Eddy and sung The Toreador Song in his film Balalaika. Hammerstein brilliantly capitalized on some free publicity for his own show.Harry Belafonte and Dorothy Dandridge give great acting performances though it's kind of strange to hear other voices coming from the mouths of two good singers. Their voices weren't operatic though yet the singers dubbing them matched well with the personalities of both the leads. And Dandridge had Marilyn Horne you can't do much better than that.The whole thing originates from the French novelist's Prosper Merimee's story of the ill effects of passionate love. Harry Belefonte's on his way to being a Tuskegee airman and he runs afoul of Carmen Jones. Belefonte's got himself a gal but Dandridge puts on her Delilah routine and Belefonte's dead meat. In addition to Samson and Delilah the Belefonte character is remarkably similar to George Hurstwood in Theodore Dreiser's Sister Carrie. Another man who threw it all away for passion. I wouldn't be surprised if Dreiser refined Merimee's theme.But Dandridge's performance is the best. As the hedonistic Carmen Jones she's a wonder on screen. Seeing her realize that part on the screen we can well understand why Belefonte threw it all away for love. Dandridge became the first black woman nominated in the Best Actress category but she lost the Oscar sweepstakes to Grace Kelly for The Country Girl.For those who like the opera Carmen I think they'll be well pleased with Oscar Hammerstein II did with Bizet's music and Merimee's story.".

The dancers at Billy Pastor's are another high point.Too many slips for me to rate it a 10. It's lipsynced  like every other movie musical and despite what one other reviewer said one of the best lipsync jobs I've seen. Only My Fair Lady does better of those I've seen. Dandridge Belafonte and Bailey are particularly good Olga James much less so. But I always find lipsyncing painfully obvious and distracting and will probably never have a chance to toprate a movie musical as a result. It's also quite distracting when Joe breaks into song because LeVern Hutcherson's voice is so different from Harry Belafonte's. It's a real shame that experienced singers like Dandridge and Belafonte weren't allowed to sing. Marilyn Horne wow  but I like the voice to match the face.The acting is uneven. Some is excellent led by Dandridge and others do well too. But some of the acting is stiff.Then there's the resetting. Oh moving the place is fine. It's funny that a couple of reviewers have referred to how the Spaniards do it and Spanish opera. Hey Carmen is set in Seville and Bizet attempted to use some Spanish musical idioms but Carmen is a French opera through and through. Bizet was French Prosper Merimee was French the libretto is in French. But Carmen Jones only uses the top arias from Carmen and ends up adding a lot of dialog to fill in the time. The story is true to the original but Bizet told more in music and Hammerstein tells more in words. Oscar should have trusted Georges more.I notice that Alvin Ailey is uncredited as a dancer. I found a couple of photos of him on the web  it's hard because his dance company has been so much more famous than the man but I found a couple. I think I figured out which one he is  some slomo work there  but most of the dancers' faces don't come into focus for long enough to know for sure. It would be mostly a curiosity to know since the movie doesn't show enough of the dance to see any personal style.".

Otto Preminger directed and shot a beautiful film and contemporary actors especially black actors should set the performances in this movie as highwater marks to shoot for. Pearl Bailey was amazing in addition to the two leads Belafonte and Dandridge. Joe Adams as the boxer and the woman who played Cindy Lou also gave great performance.Again to see black actors in this time period given a chance to perform a full range of characters was really amazing. In a lot of ways this film is more progressive than the drivel of black genre films coming out of Hollywood today".

	schema:headline " Dorothy Dandridge's best film";
	schema:reviewBody "It's incredible that it took an Austrian director Otto Preminger the courage to bring this wonderful screen adaptation of the Bizet's immortal opera Carmen to the American public. As a musical Carmen Jones had been seen successfully on Broadway because of the many talented black performers that weren't allowed to be seen in Hollywood movies. Preminger had a knack for tackling issues that other better known directors stayed away from.Carmen Jones as seen today shows us a film that is somehow dated but when it made its debut it surprised a lot of people because it was a revolutionary work something the American movie goers weren't used to seeing. The strength of the film lies in the performances Mr. Preminger got from his multitalented cast.The adaptation of the opera sets the film in the South. We are taken to a military base during the war. The local people work in the factory attached to the base making parachutes and other war related equipment. Carmen Jones is the sultry young woman who sticks out from the rest of her coworkers not only by her beauty which was obvious but by the way she can reduce men to servitude which is what happens to Joe the man who is being promoted until fate intervenes and Carmen renders him useless.The gorgeous Dorothy Dandridge made a magnificent Carmen Jones. In fact this was Ms. Dandridge's best screen work because she smolders the screen every time she is seen in the film. Harry Belafonte is Joe the man whose passion for the lovely Carmen will consume him and will not let him see straight. Pearl Bailey is a delight in her take of Frankie. Olga James is seen as the sweet Cindy Lou the girl in love with Joe. Joe Adams Brock Peters and a young Diahann Carroll are also seen in minor roles.Some comments to the IMDb forum express their displeasure at the way the voices are heard. This seems to have been the only thing that Preminger should have worked with his collaborators Oscar Hammerstein II and Harry Kleiner into having the opera melodies sung naturally the way one would expect Ms. Dandridge who could sing and of course Harry Belafonte a wonderful singer to deliver them in a way that would have pleased those audiences not accustomed to hearing classical opera.Regardless of what we think today this was one of the breakthroughs that proved to America they could enjoy black performers on their merits and talent. Otto Preminger must be praised for being a pioneer in this field and for daring to be a man ahead of his time.".

	schema:headline " Dandridge the photography and the intention are all amazing enough to justify the rest";
	schema:reviewBody "Carmen 1954First of all this is a gorgeous movie. The WWIIera sets the fluid photography with a lot of long takes the lighting and costumes and overall feel are elegant and uncompromised first frame to last. Second the idea is fabulous an allBlack cast and an AfricanAmerican adaptation of the classic Carmen opera by the French composure Bizet. The vernacular and the stereotypes might seem worn or even insulting if you take them wrong or just take them out of context but in fact it's in line with that even better earlier opera Gershwin's Porgy and Bess. The stereotypes are ones that made sanitized sense equally to White and Black America just as other musicals made sanitized sense to the same audiences. If I sound like an apologist I'm only responding to attacks on the film farcical gruesome or dreadful as being untrue or insensitive to Blacks by saying that nearly all musicals are incredibly stylized and false and nearly all movies of this era played with safe simplified versions of life. No to be fair to this really interesting movie you need to treat it like you would your own favorite movies from the 1950s accepting the limitations just as the movie makers did. It's got its own syntax and style it's own inner set of rules.And within those the performance of the character Carmen by Dorothy Dandridge is incredible. She's on fire introspective nuanced and outrageous. The cast around her is excellent but inevitably uneven and she stands easily above them in pure performance energy even over the other big star Harry Belafonte. All of this said the beautiful finely made early widescreen movie here Carmen Jones is lacking some kind of necessary intensity to work. I can't pin down why. From little strains of Bizet that perk it up like a boxing worker whistling the most famous theme as he works to the truly perfect photography and editing maybe too perfect? the movie has a steady compelling flow. It's based on a Broadway musical from 1943 the year the movie is set as well and it has the bones of a great drama if a familiar one it's still Bizet.What might be the biggest problem is the understandable decision to film it in a realistic way with song and minimal dance numbers inserted relatively seamlessly along the way. This is the standard musical approach from from the early AstaireRogers films to the relatively contemporaneous Arthur Freed productions of the early 1950s like Singin' in the Rain. But Carmen the opera and stage musical is not a lighthearted romantic comedy. It isn't just escapist entertainment. And the gravitas and drama in it at the end in particular doesn't quite work the way it does on the opera stage. You watch Belafonte and Dandridge acting their hearts out but it has that perfect 1950s moviemaking production to remind us that it's a movie and we are detached in a far different way than watching a stage version with real people and false settings.But never mind all thatyou'll see for yourself how absorbed you get and why not more so.A couple last things. First the singing voices of the two leads are dubbed yes! surprising in Belafonte's case in particular because he was and is an accomplished singer. Second Dandridge and director Preminger were having a longterm affair during the filming and after and she pulls off what might be the best performance of her life here. Third the movie was shown to the head of the NAACP before release to check on any problems that might be seen from an AfricanAmerican point of view this is 1954 remember and no objections were raised. By this point Preminger had been working with an all Black cast and was in close quarters with the leading lady so he must have had some sense that what he was after was on target for the time.Watch it if you have interest in any of these thingsWWII civilian life Dandridge or Belafonte opera adaptations into movies early big budget AfricanAmerican movies Preminger movies or terrific early Cinemascope photography. That should cover a lot of viewers but not all. For me I liked it a lot and liked parts of it enormously like the short clip of Max Roach drumming away on a barroom stage. But I felt slightly restless too often to get totally absorbed. One last suggestionsee it on the biggest screen you can so it will be immersive.".

	schema:reviewBody "This memorable melodrama is an interesting adaptation of the classic Carmen story and music with a new setting and new song lyrics. Most of it works quite well but it is remembered most of all for Dorothy Dandridge's impressive performance as Carmen Jones.The basic Carmen story itself is a perceptive and tragic look at the elemental passions and emotions that drive so much of what happens in human relationships. For the story to work most effectively it takes a Carmen who not only has plenty of energy but who also can be convincing in dominating all of the other characters. Dandridge excels at both and she makes it easy to believe that she could get practically anything that she wanted from anyone.Except for Pearl Bailey who makes her character lively and entertaining in her own right most of the rest of the cast is solid but is clearly  as is no doubt meant to be the case  overshadowed by Dandridge and Carmen. One exception though is Olga James as Cindy Lou. Although her character is very meek and has no chance against Carmen James does a fine job of making her sympathetic without becoming overly weepy or maudlin and her performance adds some additional depth to the drama of relationships.Most of the musical numbers work well and there is good variety in them as there is also in the settings and the material. The climactic sequence in the arena is nicely crafted with the prizefight taking place in full view while hidden from sight the characters' passions are reaching the boiling point. It caps off an effective and interesting movie.".

While updated this film directed wonderfully by the talented Otto Preminger is a wonderful contemporary version of the opera still maintaining Bizet's wonderful music and inspired lyrics from Oscar Hammerstein II. Whether it is the definitive film version of the opera I am not sure I absolutely adore the 1984 film with Placido Domingo and Julia MignesJohnson. That aside this film is really handsomely shot with beautiful crisp cinematography and stunning scenery. And of course the music is outstanding Dat's Love Dis Flower Stan' Up an' Fight and Dere's a Cafe on de Corner really do stand out. The story is a beautiful tragic compelling one not at all confusing. And the performances are marvellous Dorothy Dandridge is superb as Carmen Jones. She is gorgeous flirtatious and sexy everything Carmen in the opera should be. Harry Belafonte does a great job as Joe the man consumed for the passion of Carmen so much so he is driven to murder. Olga James is heart breaking as CindyLou Pearl Bailey is a delightful Frankie Joe Adams is a great Husky Miller and Brock Peters is effective as Sergeant Brown. I have heard complaints that the singing was awful and I disagree completely. Marilyn Horne has a beautiful singing voice and she did well as Carmen. She has been better though she has a much stronger voice than what was heard here. And LeeVern Hutcherson has a lovely tenor voice quite lightweight and sensitive when it needs to be. And Marvin Hayes has a very resonant voice that is needed for his character. If the singing was a little quiet at times do bear in mind sound and technology wasn't as good then than it is now. My real complaint was that the lipsynching was a little behind the singing at times but other than that this is a great film. 910 Bethany Cox".

It's updated to the 1950s with wild and incredibly sexy Carmen Dorothy Dandridge falling for honest nice serviceman Joe Harry Belafonte...and destroying him and his life.All the singing except for Pearl Bailey was dubbed. Dandridge and Belafonte could definitely sing but they didn't have the voices to carry off operatic songs. This seems kind of a strange way to do Carmen I mean by updating it to the 1950s but it still works. It's colorful full of life and never dull. BTW I HATE opera but I loved this! The dubbing seems strange and obvious at first but you eventually get used to it.The acting varies. The minor roles are all well played but Belafonte seems off as Joe. He looks miserable and even though he's a tall and very handsome guy he seems no match for Dandridge. His soft voice works against him. Pearl Bailey has a small role but she's great. She dominates the screen every time she's on camera. But this is Dandridge's movie all the way. She's just greatVERY sexy and one hell of an actress. She was also the first black actress to ever be nominated as Best Actress she didn't win. There was a LOT of infighting on the setdirector Otto Preminger was known to be a dictator and he was on this movie. He had frequent screaming matches with Pearl Bailey! And Bailey HATED Dandridgeit's a credit to both of them that it doesn't show in the movie. WELL worth catching even if you hate opera. I heard some people hate this because it's done by an all black cast. That's sillyand racist.Look for the scene on the street where Dandridge is on the street in front of a glass windowyou can see the entire camera crew reflected!".

She dominates the screen every time she's on camera. But this is Dandridge's movie all the way. She's just greatVERY sexy and one hell of an actress. She was also the first black actress to ever be nominated as Best Actress she didn't win. There was a LOT of infighting on the setdirector Otto Preminger was known to be a dictator and he was on this movie. He had frequent screaming matches with Pearl Bailey! And Bailey HATED Dandridgeit's a credit to both of them that it doesn't show in the movie. WELL worth catching even if you hate opera. I heard some people hate this because it's done by an all black cast. That's sillyand racist.Look for the scene on the street where Dandridge is on the street in front of a glass windowyou can see the entire camera crew reflected!";

Imagine a Hollywood studio trying to do something like this today? Unthinkable.The basic story line is classic  man woman betrayal death. I find the musical renderings of Bizet's tunes most interesting. Dmitri Tiomkin was one of the musical directors uncredited. The original lyrics aren't all that interesting so rewriting the words doesn't seem to me of much consequence. I could wish however that the singing and acting were better. Except for Carmen  Marilyn Horne!! The race thing doesn't trouble me at all. The original 'Carmen' was set in the Seville underclass so this transformation to America of the 1920s made perfect sense. And it gave a lot of black actors a good gig!Opera stage directors and designers often set operas in modern times. Shakespeare's plays are often reset into  modern times. Remember Ethan Hawkes' Hamlet? We should encourage these revitalization attempts. After all they are in a very real sense truly creative works.Sometimes they succeed sometimes they fail but films like 'Carmen Jones' exemplify a vital history of 'Americanizing' the sometimes stale European 'high art' ideal into more readily digestible fare. This maybe isn't the greatest movie ever made but c'mon! Give Hollywood a break. They were trying to DO something so let's give some credit for a good attempt.".

He cast top AfricanAmerican talent and dubbed most of the cast even those who could sing to heighten the operatic effect.Dandridge and Belafonte must be one of the most spectacularly beautiful couples in all the movies and they play out the juicy old melodramatic plot for all it's worth though his lack of acting training shows. The Hammerstein lyrics are mostly brilliant and the original Merimee story is cleverly transplanted to a different time and place. The film's main trouble is its inconsistency of style  it lurches from melodrama to comedy to musical comedy to opera sometimes within a couple of scenes. The acting styles go from natural to hyper depending on what kind of scene is being played so nothing really hangs together. In the better musicals the moment where dialogue turns into song is subtly handled so you're not really aware of the transition from realism to fantasy but here there are huge bumps from one style to the next.Still it's good overthetop entertainment and as noted elsewhere a respite from the underuse and mishandling of AfricanAmerican talent on the screen. And it is for its time low on condescension and stereotypes.".

Watch out for the debut of a young Diahann Carol.It's disconcerting to have European music Bizet inserted into the story you get to thinking that they should have commissioned original AfroAmerican music to replace it. But given that the lyricist was Oscar Hammerstein he would probably turned to Richard Rogers or someone equally inappropriate. We should be grateful for what we get. And it should be admitted that Husky Miller outdoes any interpreter of Bizet in March of the Toreadors here rendered as Stand Up and Fight. With its biting words and strong rhymes it works better than the original.Moviemusicals are generally so insipid that it takes some really unorthodox approach to breathe life into the genre.

With the singing voices of Marilyn Horne LeVerne Hutcherson Marvin Hayes Bernice Peterson Margaret Lancaster....Director Otto Preminger Lyrics By Oscar Hammerstein II Screenplay Harry Kleiner.From 1954 director Otto Preminger and Broadway musical composer Oscar Hammerstein teamed up for Carmen Jones a musical version of the wellknown and popular opera Carmen by Georges Bizet. For its time this film was revolutionary and innovative. Musicals were primarily a vehicle for wellknown Caucausian singingactors Judy Garland Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire Ethel Merman Julie Andrews Mary Martin and others. The cast for this film is allblack and the principal roles are portrayed by wellknown AfricanAmerican actors of their day Dorothy Dandridge and Harry Belafonte. Although an allblack Broadway musical was not new at this time George Gerswhin's Porgy and Bess had already appeared on Broadway and in the 40's allblack musical films like The Green Pastures and Cabin In The Sky preceded this film Carmen Jones was still very unique and an important film for the black community for it meant that better roles were finally given to black actors. The movie was made in colorful Cinemascope which was quite new at the time filmed thank God outdoors and not in a studio giving the film a realistic quality rather than a painted backdrop feeling which you would otherwise get in a musical or opera for that matter. Although the Bizet opera version is not what you see here much of the original plot themes and characters from the opera remain intact. There's a Carmen Don Jose and Micaela except with different more realistic names and attitudes. The setting has been changed from the typically romanticized 19th century Spain composed of freespirited gypsies bullfighters passionate romance and soldiers to America sometime after World War II possibly the Korean War perioddefinitely the 50's. Carmen's opening number Habanera in which a redclad Carmen sings a seductive song about herself is still as powerful and evocative as every Carmen production I've ever seen. Dorothy Dandrige had made several important films and her roles were like black Marilyn Monroe roles sexy smart and liberated. She was a sort of prefeminist movement icon. Her love of freedom sensuality and devilmaycare attitude serves her well for the part of Carmen who lives to love men leave them and move on to a better catch living a life that is her own and doing exactly as she pleases. American Mezzosoprano diva Marilyn Horne provides the singing voice for Carmen Jones. This was early in her opera career and it was a smart move for many still remember her for her fine Carmen performances. Harry Belafonte as Joe the soldier Carmen loves and later jilts delivers a man driven to torment and passion a man transformed from a good innocent engaged man he's engaged to Cindy Lou played by Olga James to an obscessed and ultimately tragic figure. He is very realistic in fact probably more so than other Don Joses who make him out to be some kind of psychotic soldier or overgrown boy. We feel for Joe's plight. We feel for Cindy Lou's plight. But Dorothy Dandridge is not complex enough for us to sympathize with her character. The film is probably at its best when there is no singing and we see the drama unfolding through dialog. But the words by Oscar Hammerstein are memorable catchy and perfectly insynch with the original music written for the Bizet opera although it appears that Hammerstein composed variations and new music that seems to fit the Carmen music. This is a great film despite the melodrama and the flat characters. Fans of Dorothy Dandridge who lived a short life in the movies and who was in her day a serious black actress prior to the Civil Rights movement will enjoy this film. This role is possibly her most famous and the one that earned her a great deal of fame.".

Hammerstein provides the songs with English lyrics but they fail to do justice to Bizet's magnificent music. Although Dandridge and Belanfonte could sing their singing was dubbed as they could not carry operatic tunes. Dandridge looks beautiful in the title role but her performance is weak. Belafonte does not fare too well either. It may not be the fault of the actors as much as the melodramatic and unengaging screenplay. Preminger out of his element here also deserves blame. The music should have carried the day but the numbers are surprisingly lackluster.".

We could make the argument that Carmen Jones was considered acceptable because it showed AfricanAmericans singing and dancing one of the stereotypes of them but even so it was still a bold move and the result is an impressive one.It was around this time that Harry Belafonte was becoming known as a calypso singer costar Brock Peters sang backups on Belafonte's most famous song but is best known as Gregory Peck's client in To Kill a Mockingbird.

I'm not a stalker personality lol but I'll have to follow Boitano and Witt online and see if they'll come to this area  I could write to them and ask them to make me a copy I guess and perhaps even meet them. Sounds like a good idea to me anyway.I was surprised to have enjoyed the CATS on DVD so much  this London production stars Michael Gruber a fellow from Ohio who was at age 14 years thought to be the second ranking diver in the world. When his year came for Olympic competition somehow he missed the cut and did not get on the USA team. As a result he attended college and we can see him on this DVD in CATS.

It brought the story to life much more so than just the music alone. I prefer it to the opera version. Plan to see a ballet later this year of Carmen so it will be fun to compare the skating to the ballet. I like to see movement with the music and the skaters do it justice. The setting and scenery was good too. One of my favorite scenes is the one where Carmen is waiting in the bar for her soldier to come and she is tapping nervously on the counter. It's very well done and I highly recommend itNow I need to know where i can get a copy of it!!".

The setting and scenery was good too. One of my favorite scenes is the one where Carmen is waiting in the bar for her soldier to come and she is tapping nervously on the counter. It's very well done and I highly recommend itNow I need to know where i can get a copy of it!!";

Great skating  which includes the sounds of the skates on the ice ! Brilliant music and just a wonderful atmosphere to the whole piece. How they did the fire sequences on the ice I will never know ! The extras used throughout are worth the watch also as they provide authentic character to the film. Look out for the flamenco music and dancer also. Why this has never been issued on DVD or shown again on TV to my knowledge I will never understand. My PAL SVHS tape is now copied to DVD for posterity !".

It is notable for the appearance of Rita Hayworth as Rita Cansino and the showcasing the many talents excluding acting of Yakima Canutt.The story has the bad guys headed by Earl Dwire and henchmen Canutt and Charlie King rigging rodeo results to favor them by eliminating competitors. Hayworth is a federal agent sent to infiltrate the gang. Along comes Ritter and his sidekick Horace Murphy. Tex plans to compete in the next rodeo. He enters and beats Canutt in every event despite the gang's efforts to eliminate him. Finally Tex and sheriff Glenn Strange settle things with the gang.This film is memorable for the stunts performed by the legendary Canutt. He performs several dangerous stunts on the backs of a team of runaway horses and on the speeding wagon. Having been a champion Rodeo rider in his youth Canutt had no difficulty in the rodeo scenes in spite of the extensive usage of stock footage.Hayworth was about to adopt that name and move over to Columbia as one of its greatest stars. She gets to perform a dance sequence in which her considerable talent is displayed. Ritter sings a few forgettable songs as well. And the casting of veterans Dwire King and Strange didn't hurt either.Not a bad little programmer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Trouble in Texas appears to be a reworking of the 1934 Lone Star Pictures film The Man From Utah starring John Wayne both were directed by Robert North Bradbury and both utilize the excellent stunt work of Yakima Canutt. In fact Yak's character in both pictures is pretty much the same he portrays a champion rodeo rider who's part of a gang of racketeers that insures their top man wins most of the top prize money. Serious challengers never get a chance usually winding up dead under mysterious circumstances.Tex Ritter acquits himself well in this film his character is Tex Masters and he rides the rodeo circuits in hopes of catching up with the gang responsible for his brother's murder five years earlier. But the real bright star of this film is a lovely young lady by the name of Rita Cansino you might know her better as Rita Hayworth. It's stunning to see how lovely she looks portraying undercover government agent Carmen Serano who tries to get the goods on the gang by working them from the inside. She's hired by rodeo racketeer Barker perennial baddie Earl Dwire and before it's over she gets to show some early singing and dancing talent in an entertaining saloon number.Much of the movie's screen time is taken up by rodeo stock footage with your standard roping and bulldogging and a fair amount of native Indian parade and dance. When it comes time for the actual contests Tex manages to out ride out rope and outdo his main opponent for the prize money in every event Squint Palmer Canutt. The gang is unsuccessful in having Masters fall for the old poison needle in the halter trick but coincidentally that's how Tex's brother died so now he's got the goods on all the bad boys enough for the Middleton sheriff Glenn Strange to put them all away for good. Quite coincidentally the same ruse was used in The Man From Utah only the poison needle was positioned in the saddle to do it's dirty work.I get a kick out of the pre1950 Westerns where the good guy in this case Tex Ritter can shoot a gun out of the hand of an opponent and not have the bullet find it's mark in another person directly in the line of fire. The Lone Ranger would consistently do the same finding his target and only his target even when firing right into the middle of a crowd.Horace Murphy offers up some comic relief in the movie as Tex's sidekick Lucky his gimmick is talking up his non existent heroics in sort of a Gabby Hayes style but he doesn't have the on screen charisma of a Gabby or even a Smiley Burnette kind of a poor man's pardner.I got Trouble in Texas as a double bill DVD along with Tex Ritter's Arizona Days available for a buck in one of the dollar chain stores  definitely a bargain for Tex fans or if you just want to sample Ritter's work without laying out major cash. Of the two Trouble alone will be worth your trouble especially for the surprising appearance of gorgeous Rita Hayworth.".

There is even a number where a cowboy shows how well he can dance. Rita Hayworth was not yet at her prime but it is a pleasure to see her specially when she dances. The film is about rodeos and we see the famous Yakima Cannut as one of the bad guys who was competing for the top prize with Tex showing all he can do.

Again too much stock footage replaces live action and the story within the movie crooked promoters killing outside winners and stealing the rodeo receipts gets even shorter shrift than it does in the first version.One reason for this is this film's pluses Tex Ritter's singing and Rita Hayworth's dancing. Tex sings four good songs 'Down the Colorado Trail' 'The Rodeo Song' 'The Cowboy Band' and a typical traditional melancholy cowboy song 'The Cowboy's Lament.' Rita Hayworth here billed under her real name is the female lead and even though her face looks different her unmistakable smile shines through during her cantina dance.There isn't much tension or hard riding action and shooting as we were used to in Robert Bradbury's other 'Lone Star' films  except for the spectacular stunt work of Yakima Canutt at the end when he leaps and fights Tex on the team of wagon horses and later does his patented fall under the wagon but this time pulling himself forward under it climbing back up onto the top.We get to hear Yak's sand papery voice Charles King's badness and Earl Dwire's villainy. Tex's accent and his sweet sincerity Aw shucks ma'am I didn't do nothing' add to the charm of this thirties piece of history.All of the above make the film watchable but it still feels like it was thrown together by committee on the cheap Splice in some more rodeo footage here boys!. It lacks the high emotional tension characteristic of better westerns that is the classic duel between the forces of good and evil with a developed love triangle thrown in.Because of Tex and Rita's artistic contributions I'd give it a 4.".

Personally I was not at all familiar with Tex Ritter before watching this movie he's agreeable except for the parts where he's singing. Except for a couple of spedup fights and a spedup chase at the end 90 of the action in this movie is stock rodeo footage which may be fascinating in itself if you're a fan but not so much if you can't quite accept prolonged animal abuse as a sporting activity.

They are all part of the same outfit  if any rider looks as though he is going to win the money he then becomes the victim of a nasty accident. Just before Tex arrives at Middleton he foils a hold up that the robbers claim is staged but the grudge is carried into town and the Sheriff is so pleased with the way Tex handles the hooligans that he offers him a job to keep an eye on the rodeo proceedings. Tex even finds time to sing The Rodeo Song.Of course Tex wins all the prizes so the villains attempt to sabotage his big ride with the old poisonous needle in the rope trick  the same way his brother died but he finds out just in time. Fortunately there is just as much action as songs with a climax involving a runaway waggon loaded with dynamite.When Trouble in Texas was released in England in 1943 it was advertised as Lovely and Devastating Rita Hayworth and Tex Ritter in a musical western!!!".

I mean I am okay with these gigantic monsters coming out of Pokeballs but now cards? What is next? And apart from that the story also had more major flaws. It says the blue dragon stands for victory and yet 3 of them cannot win against a dragon that stands for potential victory? Also the ending was far too expected also with the red dragon making difference and it was also very abrupt. Not a rewarding watch but I am saying this as someone who has not seen the series. Maybe you have to in order to appreciate these 30 minutes this should never be the foundation for liking a film though. Not recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Decided to check out this title because it's listed on the IMDb as a spoof of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal skull. But since production on 'The Broken Covenant' must have been underway before 'The Crystal Skull' was released it is not surprising that the two films have very little in common and there are are no references to the trailer like in 'Disaster Movie' either. However there are some similarities between the two films it stars Indiana Jones' only daughter has a scene with ants and takes place about 25 years after Raiders making it 1962. She also says 'I have a very bad feeling about this' at one point. On the other hand the bad guys are still the Nazi's. The story not surprisingly seems to take more hints from Raiders and The Last Crusade.The production values are good. The opening titles look great. There are a couple of good special effects and some of lesser quality. Several adversaries speak with subtitles and best of all our heroine Carolina is introduced with that a Spielbergian zoom that was sadly missing in the fourth installment of Indiana Jones. But unfortunately the fight scene that follows is very crappy and the one liner Carolina utters the first of many at the end of it is more Arnold Schwarzenegger than Harrison Ford. Then there is a sex scene between two people whom the script neglects to introduce while the girl who is to become Carolina's sidekick Dixie looks on in bondage.After a couple of gruesome death scenes that are more early Peter Jackson than early Steven Spiel Carolina has secured another Cross of Coronado like object for a museum. Dixie joins Carolina in her next quest spurred on by a letter from dad telling her to contact J.B. aka John Brody. This man betrayed the family meaning his father Marcus? by selling the location of the Ark of the Covenant. They hitch a ride on a truck with 5 horny possibly Russian soldiers and... throw them off at gunpoint! What a wasted opportunity that was. Dixie distracts a guard while Carolina walks in on her first and only lover J.B. and an expensive prostitute. Naturally she waits for the hooker to finish him off then gets the information and has her revenge with the help of his own deadly ant farm.Dixie tells Carolina to get J.B. out of her head by taking another lover so she takes advantage of the first man she meets the 'houseboy' who is hardly a boy at a hotel. She should have waited a bit longer till she bumped into somebody more attractive methinks. Arriving at the German bad guy's hideout in Israel Dixie bumps into her husband ? Rick. The three of them are quickly captured and about to be sacrificed to the power of the ark but in a surprise Deus Ex Machina papa Jones arrives to save the day. Screenwriter Charlie Browneye haha still has a bit to learn about writing action scenes while keeping your main characters sympathetic Carolina and her father both murder like there is no tomorrow but then this is only his first credited screenplay.6 out of 10".

Anyone who's ever worked in a corporate office can relate to this film on some level and can probably swear that they know someone exactly like one of the characters depicted here. Mike Judge really captures the aspect that makes office life so miserable which is without a doubt the characters that you must deal with that your personal life would normally exclude. There is no question that he must've had his own bout with the way of the office bitch as he shows that he knows it all too well. Out of the comedies I've seen I can most identify with this one.Kudos to the casting department for putting together a unique group of people to portray the perfect characters for the story. Peter Samir Michael Bolton and especially the Milton and Lumbergh characters are all a true treat to watch and never get old upon reviewings.A true comedic classic but probably for more of a niche audience. Having never worked in an office before you may not enjoy it as much as others...but then again I could be wrong and is still worth checking out. But if you have or do work in an office this movie is a must see!Office Space has a special place in my heart for others reasons too. Parts of it were filmed within walking distance of my apartment and my girlfriend lives in Peter's apartments from the movie which is also right down the street! That just adds even more to the fact that I can identify with this film 100 especially considering I drive the same way to work as Peter did! Too weird.Um yeah go see it.".

Well except for the traffic of course. The traffic  remains undefeated. Besides telling a highly amusing story about office workers who are just fed up with it all Office Space is full of other little comments on society such as the way the film points out the sheer goofiness of geeky white guys who listen to hardcore rap music. The film presents a heavily exaggerated version of the typical office but underneath that exaggeration the depiction is very accurate. You have the fairly timid but passive aggressive superior Bill Lumbergh portrayed hilariously by Gary Cole the repressive office cubicles the mumbly guy that kind of weirds everyone out and of course the disillusioned office employee who just doesn't care anymore.Ron Livingston fulfills this last role very well being very open about his dislike of his job and his intentions to do as little as possible for as long as he still gets paid but it is the weird guy that really gets laughs consistently whose name in this case is Milton. This guy's hilarious situation involves having been laid off years before without knowing because no one told him because he still receives a paycheck due to a glitch in the payroll system and whose primary concerns seem to be the location of his cubicle his red stapler and the fact that last year he didn't receive a piece of cake at the office party. The way that this guy's situation gets consistently worse and the way that he is pushed further and further toward the edge of sanity is one of the funniest things about this movie. And we can't forget the Indian guy Samir whose grammatically flawed exclamations also provide for an endless source of comedic entertainment.Jennifer Aniston plays a small role as Peter Gibbons' Livingston love interest as well as that of a waitress who is also sick and tired of the ridiculousness of her job such as a specified minimum of pieces of flair' that employees must wear to work. Ron's home life is another thing that is parodied in this high quality comedy as the shortcomings of living in an average apartment are clearly and sidesplittingly portrayed. Clearly the office scenes are by far the funniest of the film and the eventual criminal plot to embezzle a huge sum of money from the company and take up a lifestyle of not really doing anything despite the fact that it is also very well done can be largely overlooked because of the sheer hilarity of the rest of the film. This is excellent stuff from the famous creator of the endlessly amusing Beavis  ButtHead who with Office Space has further proved that he is just the type of guy who knows what's funny.".

A sleeper cult movie OFFICE SPACE doesn't have that much of a plot as an idea where every possible clich of the employee and the manager is brought to existence during the first half.The story revolves around Peter Ron Livingston who hates his job and who has a nasty micromanaging supervisor Gary Cole the physical embodiment of the managersupervisor who we can't bear to see and would love to kill who has a thing for using the exact template for the company's cover sheet and Milton Stephen Root the office loser who can't stand up for himself to save his life and whose cubicle keeps getting moved all around the office building while he endlessly mumbles about his office rights as compared to his coworkers' rights his character is that blot people normally take for as the overworked wreck we feel compelled to kick into the gutter. Into this mix is Michael Bolton not the singer played by David Herman and Samir Ajay Naidu both having last names frequently made out to be the brunt of coworkers' insensitive jokes and who later assist Peter in a plan to get rich quick and leave the workforce for good.OFFICE SPACE also revolves around a possible romance about to happen between Peter and Joanna Jennifer Aniston a waitress at his favorite restaurant who has her own share of problems like being micromanaged by her own boss who wants from her the right kind of attitude which entails having her wear as much flair as her uniform may allow.As I said this is not a plotbased story but a clever comedy that presents situations that arise from minimal events at work. Some of the funniest moments are when Peter finds out of a coworker who by chance has gotten an early retirement  but at the hefty price of being hit by a car and almost killed while driving to work after contemplating suicide. There is an element of cartoon behavior here Mike Judge responsible for BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD and KING OF THE HILL seems to like to tell stories about types and their personality quirks and how they affect or irritate one another. As a matter of fact this would have worked perfectly in an animated form because everything about OFFICE SPACE calls for cartoon setting but despite being a fully acted feature it holds its own as a slice of life among office employees in Anytown USA.".

Some of the funniest moments are when Peter finds out of a coworker who by chance has gotten an early retirement  but at the hefty price of being hit by a car and almost killed while driving to work after contemplating suicide. There is an element of cartoon behavior here Mike Judge responsible for BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD and KING OF THE HILL seems to like to tell stories about types and their personality quirks and how they affect or irritate one another. As a matter of fact this would have worked perfectly in an animated form because everything about OFFICE SPACE calls for cartoon setting but despite being a fully acted feature it holds its own as a slice of life among office employees in Anytown USA.";

While the story line is nothing spectacular the dialog and acting keep this movie moving at a brisk pace.  Ron Livingston who was excellent in a supporting role in Swingers plays an everyman who hates his life job and girlfriend but has no idea what to do about it.  The supporting cast of coworkers are greatness representing just about every office subculture perfectly albeit to extremes.  Jennifer Aniston completes the male fantasy aspect of having your cake and being able to eat it as well as serving as a conscience for the protagonist.  Several scenes will have you rolling in the aisles.  The Boyz in the Hood kill the copier scene is the funniest I have seen in a while.".

	schema:reviewBody "I honestly don't think there's enough good things to say about Office Space. It has everything a great film needs A great story great acting great jokes great soundtrack great everything! Hell we even get to like the characters as with most films no one cares. Even though this is a comedy it actually deals with a very big issue disillusionment. And most comedies of this type don't do that sort of thing.The disillusioned Peter Gibbons Ron Livingston has an office job at Innitech that he really hates to the point where he confesses that everyday is the worse day of this life because of it. He has two disillusioned friends there Michael Bolton David Herman who gets a lot of harassment due to him having the same name as the singer and Samir Ajay Naidu an Indian immigrant who just wants to keep his job. Two other men who work with them are Tom Richard Riehle a man who wants to make a Jump To Conclusions Mat' to get rich and Milton Stephen Root a mumbling man who can't stand up for himself. Their boss is the evil Bill Lumbergh Gary Cole who makes them work on the weekend and torments everyone especially Milton. Peter loves Joanna Jennifer Aniston a waitress at a restaurant he often goes to that he loves but can't ask her out due to having no confidence and a pushy girlfriend named Anne Alexandra Wentworth. After being hypnotized by a hypnotist that dies before he can complete the process Peter gains all the confidence he needs to decide to not quit his job but just not to go ask Joanna out and leave Anne. But surprisingly instead of getting fired he gets promoted while his hardworking friends get fired. After this they decide to get their revenge by putting a computer virus in Innitech's computers to slowly make millions but it goes horribly wrong.I love this movie. I really do. Even when I first show the trailer for this in cinema about 5 or 6 years ago when I was about 11 years old I thought it'd be a good movie and how right was I? Beyond 100 right! All the actors do a great job in this especially Ron Livingston who should've got a lot of acclaim for this film. I honestly hope his career becomes really successful someday. I also loved Peter's neighbor Lawrence Diedrich Bader who is hilarious. There are other great comedies out there like Wayne's World 1992 and Joe Dirt 2001 but this is just movie magic! Director Mike Judge is a comic genius! Who thought that the toilet humour of Beavis and Butthead could be beaten by office humour? I hope everyone involved in this film continues to make great films like this.Oh and just before I finish this review I have to say one thing. Even though I love this film to death I honestly hope they don't make a sequel. This is just one of those rare films that are perfect and I don't want an inferior sequels to ruin this. A sequel should only be done if it's just as funny if funnier than this. And besides the plot has no where to go so they should leave this alone. The best way I can sum this film up A brilliant classic!Rating 55!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "There's something about a study of life in a cubicle' to which just about everyone can relate at least everyone who has ever had to get up every day go to work and punch a time clock then go home and wait to do it all over again the next day.  In Office Space' writerdirector Mike Judge the guy who gave us Beavis and Butthead' captures the essence of the workaday world in this case in an office setting though it could be on any job anywhere from the largest conglomerate to the smallest business concern anywhere a corporate structure' is in place and employed.  The subtle humor of Judge's vision is funny and often downright hilarious and all with very little exaggeration of the way things really are from the weekly motivational' talks from the boss to staff meetings corporate mission statements' and the protocol of cover sheets and memos all of which as portrayed here have a sterling ring of truth to them. The central character of Judge's story is a guy named Peter Gibbons Ron Livingston a software analyst for Initech' who after working with a therapist finds himself in something of a transcendental state of mind whereupon he divulges to a pair of consultants efficiency experts' sent in to streamline the company's operation that he does only about fifteen minutes of real work' a week due to the very structure or lack thereof of the company itself.  And his refreshingly honest candor in outlining his job description soon has quite an unexpected effect on his life as well as that of a couple of coworkers.  Judge perceptively expands the satire to encompass facets of Peter's life outside the office as well which gives the audience even more with which to identify like driving to work in bumper to bumper freeway traffic that has slowed to a stop in Peter's lane while the cars in the next lane going flying by and when he changes into THAT lane IT comes to a standstill while the cars in the lane he just left start to whiz on by.  It's an application of Murphy's Law that  while certainly nothing new works well within the context of this particular story in which the humor is derived from emphasizing the annoying mundane things that happen to us all on a daily basis.  Like getting in the shortest line at the supermarket and taking longer than anyone else to get checked out. Livingston gives a notable performance giving Peter that sense of the everyman' who'd like nothing better than to break free of the rigors of the 8 to 5 existence.  He brings an affable presence to the screen that perfectly communicates what Judge is attempting to say and does it in such a way that it validates Peter's being selected as Champion of the Cause' as it were.  Also turning in memorable performances are Stephen Root a terrific character actor as Milton a guy whose very existence seems to be a study in suffering abuse and degradation and Gary Cole as Peter's boss Bill Lumbergh whose impudent laconic methods of intimidation delivered in such a droll manner make him the boss everybody loves to hate. The supporting cast includes Jennifer Aniston as Joanna the waitress with a minimum of flare' who has trouble expressing' herself according to her boss Ajay Naidu Samir David Herman Michael Bolton Richard Riehle Tom Joe Bays Dom John C. McGinley Bob Slydell Paul Wilson Bob Porter and Diedrich Bader Lawrence.  Reminiscent of the world portrayed in the Dilbert' comic strip Office Space' works because it effectively puts real people in real situations and brings you into contact with some characters you're going to recognize I guarantee that no matter what you do to live thrive and survive you've run into these people worked for them and alongside them.  It's a case of art reflecting reality and to Judge's credit he's succeeded in making a funny movie that really hits close to home without resorting to any gross or infantile humor to do it.  It's a film that simply puts the corporate experience' in the spotlight and gives you a chance to laugh at the boss' and maybe even a little bit at yourself along the way.  I rate this one 810.".

He surrounds himself with the right things to put in his time at the job.

The other is the appearance of Joanna the friendly waitress of the restaurant where the friends meet. This young woman is the one that brings Peter out of his shell as he falls for her big time.

His girlfriend Annie is cheating on him but she convinces Peter to visit the hypnotherapist Dr. Swanson Michael McShane. Peter tells how miserable his life is and Dr. Swanson hypnotizes him and he goes into a state of ecstasy. However Dr. Swanson has a heart attack and dies immediately after giving the hypnotic suggestion to Peter. He dates the waitress Joanna Jennifer Aniston and changes his attitude in the company being promoted by the consultants. When he discovers that Michael and Samir will be fired they decide to plant a virus in the account system to embezzle fraction of cents in each financial operation into Peter's account. However Michael commits a mistake in the software and instead of decimals they steal a large amount. The desperate trio tries to fix the problem or they will go to prison. Office Space is an ironic comedy about life in an American office. The characters are stereotypes of people in company and it is always possible to find someone similar to a colleague or a situation that the viewer might have lived and that is the reason why most of people like this film. Some jokes are universal like the feeling of having a bad case of the Mondays. This is the second time that I watch this film that is overrated in IMDb. My vote is six.Title Brazil Como Enlouquecer Seu Chefe How to Craze Your Boss".

The film is made up of lots and lots of weird personalities and the stars are Peter Michael and Samir. Oddly however the idea for the film came from a wonderful little animated short by Mike Judge in which the only character was Milton. In other words while Milton was the inspiration in the film he was a purely secondary characterthough he also was in my opinion the funniest thing in the movie. Like Judge's cartoon in the movie Milton is completely stepped on and ignored as he mumbles. No one notices that he's mumbling about burning down the company and killing people!! As for the plot it all revolves around trying to find the best way to work the least and yet keep from getting fired. Michael and Samir haven't mastered this but Peter in a funny twist accidentally hits on the key for not only goofing off and keeping your job but also actually getting advanced in the company! There's a heck of a lot more to it than this and I advise you to watch itit's very funny well written directed and acted.Here's a final observation. OFFICE SPACE is a very very good comedy and I enjoyed it very much. However sometimes I wonder why some films become cult hits and others whither and fade. While OFFICE SPACE didn't do well at the box office on video and DVD it has already sold 108902023093 copies and counting. On the other hand another Mike Judge film that bombed at the box office IDIOCRACY also bombed on video and is as popular as leprosywhy is this?

	schema:reviewBody "Office Space highlights the absurdities of the modern day workplace and the high tech workplace specifically. Everyone at computer software company Initech hates their jobs especially Peter Gibbons Ron Livingston who feels trapped in a treadmill of unrewarding monotonous work as he rewrites and tests other people's software to insure it is Y2K compliant. Simultaneously he feels equally trapped in a relationship with a woman who treats him like an unsatisfactory employee. Peter represents all of the 2535 year old white collar workers who know they are not doing what they want to with their lives but simply find initiating a complete career change as too scary as if anything could be worse than what they are putting up with already.I'm positive that someone involved with this movie has a deep understanding of working in software because I easily recognized each of the various types of people represented in the cast  even the psychotic coworker Milton who keeps coming to work when they move his desk to the basement and stop paying him. Gary Cole's performance of Bill Lundburg hits the bullseye as the boss that understates in a calm voice everything that he wants but then has no problem firing people if they don't meet his understated demands. What seems like a postit note is actually a subpoena in Lundburg's eyes. One of my favorite scenes is when he is having everyone come in and basically beg for their jobs by justifying their positions. One older worker only seems to have one function  to carry the requirements from the requirements writers to the software engineers. When the bosses try to probe more deeply into his skills he gets angry and bellows Are you blind! Can't you people see I have valuable people skills!.Ultimately Peter and his coworkers bungle a scheme to embezzle from the company by writing a program that extracts fractions of pennies per iteration. Instead of producing many very small checks the program winds up producing one huge check that is bound to attract attention. How does all of this work out? Watch and find out. Highly recommended.".

When the bosses try to probe more deeply into his skills he gets angry and bellows Are you blind! Can't you people see I have valuable people skills!.Ultimately Peter and his coworkers bungle a scheme to embezzle from the company by writing a program that extracts fractions of pennies per iteration. Instead of producing many very small checks the program winds up producing one huge check that is bound to attract attention. How does all of this work out? Watch and find out. Highly recommended.";

	schema:reviewBody "The human dimension of this film touched me. Some of these things touched me to tears. I list a few of them.1. The job of the professionals who prepares the dead for their last contact with the family wake and their passage to eternity cremation. In the film the characters who perform this job teach the spectator a true ritual of respect and affection with the dead. Respect and affection with the dead feelings that the modern life tries to banish from its practices. In the modern world the dead are inconvenient and dispatched quickly in funerals where the majority of those who are present entertain themselves with parallel talks instead of focusing on the reason why they are there.2. The nobility and grandeur of this job that in the film is not associated with any religion and is directly associated with dealing with human beings. This nobility and grandeur reflects also on to the dead in the sense that it reminds us that the dead deserve our respect and affection because a new stage of our relationship with them is starting.3.The way Daigo grows as he learns this job and overcomes ithe social stigma that society imposes upon the contact with the dead and also the people who have contact with the dead as well as ii his personal repulsion with repulsive material aspects of death odors rot etc.4. The way Daigo grows as he incorporates the nobility and grandeur of the job he was forced to do because of the circumstances he was jobless because the orchestra where he played cello was dismissed. And when his wife discovers in what consists his job and tries to force him to quit he has grown so much that he chooses to keep the job instead to yield to his wife menaces.5. The way Daigo grows and which leads him back to play the cello and celebrate life more than ever playing outdoors and playing at home as he used to do when he was a boy.6. The way Daigo wife grows when she has the opportunity to look close to the job of her husband and begins to admire him and love him more. Wife who have the opportunity to convince Daigo to take care of his dead father when Daigo runs away when he gets aware of his father death. Wife who when the opportunity showed up says with pride to the individuals of the funeral that were almost doing a dirty job with the deceased Daigo father my husband will take care of him he is a professional7. The way Daigo grows when he encounter again the love for his father and forgive him for having abandoned the family while he prepares his old man for the burial.8. How death can be seen as part of life process when it causes some people to become aware of how much love they missed and how much they have been loved without being aware of it.All this happens because Daigo goes back to his hometown a small town. That is the return to his origins helps to renew the ties with the traditions and helps the character to put himself together again.I'm omitting many precious details that appear throughout the film. These details must be seen personally because the film was made with great sensitivity and expertise and deserves to be seen.Roland.".

I disagree and believe that this movie is beautiful the way it is. This movie is not overbrimming with sentimentality it has a good amount for such an emotional film. The scenes with the cello and the birds represent the passion and emotions he feel. We don't call Shakespeare's long poems sentimental so why do we call this work of Japanese art that? The more I heard the music I felt like the more I understood the movie. Western movies sometimes disregard time in movies allowing action to follow action. This movie was simply about the meaning of living knowing that we would die. The long drawn out silences were necessary to convey emotions. If you have studied many Asian cultures you know that they convey emotions not through words but through silence. The silences give us time to ponder and think about the questions raised something we are often not given in bang bang action American films.As a musician I feel like this whole movie is like song filled with much raw emotion.".

	schema:headline " The power of ritual in life and death";
	schema:reviewBody "Masahiro Motoki is a good comic mime a useful talent for depicting a Japanese in distress. He plays Daigo Kobayashi a young cello player who faces the end of his chosen career when the Tokyo symphony orchestra he is part of is dissolved by its owner. He doesn't think he has the talent to get into another orchestra so he sells his expensive cello which he's still paying for and moves back to his town in the country. His wife Mika Ryoko Hirosue assents to this with brave smiles. There's a house there for them that his mother left him.And then comes the job. Daigo answers an ad that's promising. Departures it says. He assumes something in travel. Easy hours good pay. The boss hires him immediately and gives him a wad of bills. Only trouble the work is encoffination or putting dead people into caskets for cremation. Departures was a misprint for Departed. This is where Motoki gets to make funny faces as he struggles with surprise discomfort and out and out nausea. The first corpse his boss Sasaki Tsutomu Yamazaki takes him along to work on is an elderly lady who was dead two weeks before she was found and it's summertime. After this ordeal he can't face dinner without retching. He hides from his wife what he is doing. But the pay is good and the boss is a decent man and he needs work so he stays on.In professional lingo Moviefone calls this movie a feelgood dramady about death. Younger people already sick of the Academy's easy Oscar choices mocked its members for giving the Best Foreign prize this year to 'Departures' over the edgy Israeli animation about war trauma 'Waltz with Bashir.' Yes 'Departures' is softer but it has depths and its subject is universal. I'd listen to the octogenarian wisdom of the veteran New York critic Andrew Sarris who calls this the most moving film I have ever seen commemorating the bonds between the living and the dead. It's also a lesson in the beauty of Japanese tradition that expresses those bonds. Not so long ago as Sasaki explains to Daigo Japanese families prepared their own departed. Now the funeral agents and the casket preparers Sasaki is the latter have moved in. But the process still retains traditional honesty and grace. In a process both elegantly respectful and forthright the body is prepared in front of the assembled family mourners by the funeral professionals. Sasaki turns out to be a very good one. In a series of graceful gestures. the body is wiped and cleaned undressed turned and reclothed the face caressed the hands smoothed and placed together just so all with the deftness of motion that is the Japanese genius and always discretely shielding the flesh of the deceased from the view of the watchers. Then well wrapped the body is gently laid in the casket. The mourners may come forward and say their goodbyes before the box is closed. Shortly thereafter it is taken to a crematorium. Daigo quickly masters the respectful drama of this process particularly the way the face and hands are manipulated and the clothing is moved and comes to appreciate the profound emotional meaning it has for the mourners. It's both a leavetaking of the person and an acknowledgment that the deceased is really already gone. Of course immensely complex feelings are involved. Daigo settles into the work. Nonetheless he continues to hide from Mika what he's doing.When she finds out she goes home to her mother promising to return only when Daigo quits the job. But the way he enjoys playing his small but tuneful childhood cello again now shows he accepts his new circumstances and is not unhappy. Daigo's roots in the town are symbolized by the old bath house where he goes to cleanse himself after the dressing of the decomposing old lady on his first days's work. It is run by another old lady Tsuyako Kazuko Yoshiyuki the mother of his former best friend. When she suddenly drops dead and Mika returns for the encoffination ceremony she realizes the beauty and importance of the ritual Daigo performs for Tsuyako's family. Daigo's father ran a caf in their house and went off with a young waitress when he was a boy abandoning him and his mother. He hates his father and doesn't want to know anything about him. But when by chance  or more accurately screenwriter Kundo Koyama's obvious arrangement  he learns about his father's death Mika pushes him to go and do the ceremony himself with her at his side and this time the ritual is a profound personal healing process for Daigo himself whose tears pour down as he performs it. When a few months pass and winter comes Mika comes back to live with Diago after she discovers she's pregnant even though she still wants him to quit the job. The film underlines how humble and traditional roles are essential to a society even as it looks down on them by showing the dignity of the encoffination process of the man who handles the cremations of old Tsuyako running the comfortable old bath house that her son wanted to close and turn into more profitable real estate.This film is a tribute to the magic and comfort of human ritual. Hence the encoffination process is shown repeatedly even behind the end credits. It's what the film is about everything else is footnotes to this ceremony. Sometimes the mourners make it tumultuous embarrassing or comic. But it retains the beauty of a culture that knows the value of theater. Takita's movie is more than the sum of its sometimes sentimental or obvious parts. In the beauty of its most humdrum moments with its focus on everyday family necessities it celebrates food too 'Departures' is not at all remote from the quintessentially Japanese quotidian grandeur celebrated in the film masterpieces of Yasajiro Ozu.".

The film underlines how humble and traditional roles are essential to a society even as it looks down on them by showing the dignity of the encoffination process of the man who handles the cremations of old Tsuyako running the comfortable old bath house that her son wanted to close and turn into more profitable real estate.This film is a tribute to the magic and comfort of human ritual. Hence the encoffination process is shown repeatedly even behind the end credits. It's what the film is about everything else is footnotes to this ceremony. Sometimes the mourners make it tumultuous embarrassing or comic. But it retains the beauty of a culture that knows the value of theater. Takita's movie is more than the sum of its sometimes sentimental or obvious parts. In the beauty of its most humdrum moments with its focus on everyday family necessities it celebrates food too 'Departures' is not at all remote from the quintessentially Japanese quotidian grandeur celebrated in the film masterpieces of Yasajiro Ozu.";

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Departures";
	schema:reviewBody "By now almost everyone would have heard of this Japanese film Okuribito Departures given its win in the recent Academy Awards clinching the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film beating the likes of crowd favourite Waltzing With Bashir and the Palme D'or winner The Class. And now after watching it it's no surprise really because if I were to go tongue in cheek it's the novelty factor given that the Academy would never have conceived upon the notion that a film coming from Asia and filled with death corpses and coffins would be anything but a horror film. Seriously though Departures have Awards written all over it with fine acting complementing a strong story to tell.I suppose the equivalent of a casketer in local context would be the embalmer. And it's without a doubt a profession most misunderstood and shunned because of our innate fear of death. We choose to avoid death where it had gone and being an embalmer would unlikely be on any kid's wish list of professions. Despite the stereotypical negative connotations it is a profession that is quite dignified because the professional is entrusted with the responsibility of helping the loved ones of the deceased cope with the passing on and to help ease the pain in bringing some colour before the final journey to either the burial ground or crematorium.Departures demystifies this profession in the Japanese context. And like all things Japanese the process comes with an elaborate ritual of preparation cleansing and presentation all done with great precision skillful grace and utmost respect for both the deceased and the family members. The profession depicted here in the film is one of the highest order where we see exactly how the casketers go about their job and the separation of duties with the undertaker.Masahiro Motoki last seen in The Longest Night in Shanghai stars as the lead protagonist Daigo Kobayashi a cellist in an orchestra who dreams of going places around the world with his wife Mika Ryoko Hirosue in tow. Unfortunately for him his orchestra folds and he is forced to sell his expensive white elephant since he doubts he could make his passion into a successful career. Dejected he convinces his wife to retreat back into the small town he came from living in the house his late mother had left behind in order to start a new life. Little did he know when responding to a job classifieds that a typo had given him the impression he would be in a career that involves travel. The boss of the shop Ikuei Sasaki Tsutomu Yamazaki hires him on instinct and as the saying goes the rest is history.For the curious the film is an excellent medium to showcase the profession and to do so in good light. We come to learn the craft behind the job and the necessity of it all be it dealing with grieving family members or taking care of bodies that are bound for autopsies. Departures paints through Daigo's experience the varying spectrum of emotions that one as a service provider would have to face as we journey with him from novice level. All's not doom and gloom of course as director Yujiro Takita paced the film with well meaning humour  again never slapstick or disrespectful  throughout the narrative.The story by Kundo Koyama also excellently portrayed Daigo's relationships with his wife and with his mentor where the former was like a rubber band waiting to snap because of Daigo's deliberate attempts to not tell his lovely wife what he's up to for a career in order to shield her from the taboo. With the latter from whom he picks up the tools of the trade from there's a surrogate father figure which he never had while growing up resulting in some pent up hatred toward his dad who walked out on the family when he was young.It's an extremely moving piece of drama that doesn't get bogged down by melodrama and I thoroughly enjoyed its themes of reconciliation forgiveness and best of all being a professional and serving with pride. It's a fantastically crafted film with an excellent cast all round and shatters all taboos that come with the profession of a casketer. I know it's clich to say this but Departures will be a strong contender when I compile my list of top films for the year. It's been some time already where I'm equally entertained and moved by a film and without a doubt do not let this depart from our local cinemas before you get a chance to watch it on the big screen. Highly recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "Almost three decades since starring in Juzo Itami's classic The Funeral Tsutomu Yamazaki once more shines in a tale woven around the rituals traditions and theatre involved in Japanese death rites. The irreverence that makes Itami's classic such a delight is present here. Daigo's first day on the job playing a stiff in a DVD for the funeral business comes back to haunt him in hilarious fashion later on. However there is also reverence the film respectfully pointing out that the people who do this necessary but thankless task do not deserve the disdain and revulsion that their profession often attracts.Daigo loses his job as a cellist returns to his inaka roots and stumbles into a job as an undertaker. Too ashamed to tell his wife he slowly warms to his apprenticeship under the masterful tutelage of Sasaki. As he goes about his business the inevitable traumas of a childhood long forgotten bubble to the surface as he goes about reacquainting himself with the town. The conduit for the negative feelings towards his profession is Daigo's wife Mika who takes punitive steps on discovering his new employment.Screenwriter Kundo Koyama has to take credit for a script that moves along briskly juxtaposing black farce with raw tenderness all done seamlessly and acutely observed. Lipstick on a corpse produces gales of laughter and you are reminded that sometimes the best fun is had at funerals. Daigo moves towards a form of reconciliation and redemption through the promptings of those around him and the comfort of his cello.It would be all too easy for material like this to lurch into sappy sentimentality but the film tugs at the heartstrings without overtly manipulating its audience. Motoki has to take some plaudits for this for a performance that amuses at times but hints at deep inner turmoil at others. Hirosue is less consistent at times indulging in the headbobbing giggly saccharine sweet girlishness that is the forte of the Japanese TV drama actress. She has one line in the climactic scene of such stunning obviousness I am surprised it stayed in but for the most part she redeems herself in the tense interactions with Motoki over their differing views on his new career. Overall she convinces as the supportive but putupon wife.From Kurosawa's Ikiru through The Funeral and now Okuribito Japanese cinema has a rich vein of movies that exploit the rituals of death. How those rituals comfort us enchant us and see us through to a place where the pain still exists but might come to an end is laid bare in Okuribito. It is an absorbing moving tale full of laughter and tears that celebrates the intricate details of a Japanese rites of passage while laying bare their universal function. Best seen in the cinema to get the full effect of the luscious orchestral score.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wonderful movie. I was moved. The subject of the movie is a profession called 'Nokanshi' which is to cleanse dress and make up a corpse before it is placed in a coffin. Centered in this profession the story is strong and understandable. All side stories are effectively woven. This movie taught me that death is not a simple end of life but it could even trigger reconciliation of those who hate someone.Everyone dislikes a job to touch corpses. Therefore the classified advertisement is vague and the job interview is precarious and the protagonist is fooled to join this business. In the classified ad it said 'Tabi no otetsudai Assisting travels' but the boss said it is a typo and he corrected it to 'Tabidachi no otetsudai Assisting departures'. Then the protagonist faces miserable debut scene with rotten corpse left 2 weeks after death. But there are many humorous scenes in the first half audiences get drawn into the story. Then he experiences some impressive episodes of nokanshi's work and his father who abandoned him is mentioned.Normally I don't cry at movies. But in this movie tears filled my eyes at several scenes though it is never a socalled tearjerker film.As for acting performances Motoki Masahiro's acting is marvelous as well as his performance as a nokanshi. Yamazaki Tsutomu is the best casting too. However for the wife of the protagonist I think Hirosue Ryoko is too pretty and girlish and her acting is shallow.".

	onyx:emotionText "Wonderful movie. I was moved. The subject of the movie is a profession called 'Nokanshi' which is to cleanse dress and make up a corpse before it is placed in a coffin. Centered in this profession the story is strong and understandable. All side stories are effectively woven. This movie taught me that death is not a simple end of life but it could even trigger reconciliation of those who hate someone.Everyone dislikes a job to touch corpses. Therefore the classified advertisement is vague and the job interview is precarious and the protagonist is fooled to join this business. In the classified ad it said 'Tabi no otetsudai Assisting travels' but the boss said it is a typo and he corrected it to 'Tabidachi no otetsudai Assisting departures'. Then the protagonist faces miserable debut scene with rotten corpse left 2 weeks after death. But there are many humorous scenes in the first half audiences get drawn into the story. Then he experiences some impressive episodes of nokanshi's work and his father who abandoned him is mentioned.Normally I don't cry at movies. But in this movie tears filled my eyes at several scenes though it is never a socalled tearjerker film.As for acting performances Motoki Masahiro's acting is marvelous as well as his performance as a nokanshi. Yamazaki Tsutomu is the best casting too. However for the wife of the protagonist I think Hirosue Ryoko is too pretty and girlish and her acting is shallow.";

The idea Death is a gate for another world may be based on Buddhism belief but I am sure you can relate yourself to this story with your own experience of losing somebody important. Masahiro Motoki was at his best for the leading role. He once played similar role in Sumo Do Sumo Don't by Director Masayuki Suo Shall We Dansu? in terms of being put in awkward situation involved seriously and end up finding the virtue in it. Music score is by Joe Hisaishi. Great as always. He has done great jobs on films for Takeshi Kitano and Hayao Miyazaki. I am sure this will be the best Japanese movie in 2008. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Without irony there is a funereal grace to this 2009 dramedy so much so that one can sometimes hear the distinct echoes of film master Yasujiro Ozu Tokyo Story in director Yojiro Takita's subtle yet stately look at the business of preparing deceased bodies for their caskets. Ozu's influence can be felt most in the quietude of tone that reveals the inevitability of death with both grim humor and spiritual awakening. The film's lyricism rests on the mournful cello accompaniment of the protagonist Daigo Kobayashi a young cellist who finds himself jobless after his Tokyobased orchestra is disbanded. Out of economic necessity he and his sunny supportive wife Mika move back to his late mother's house up north in Yamagata.As outlined in Kundo Koyama's somewhat methodical screenplay the story focuses on the challenge Daigo faces in finding one's place in life no matter how dubious it may seem to others. Daigo bereft of his passion answers a job ad involving departures which leads him to believe the company is a travel agency. However he quickly realizes the twoperson operation is actually about preparing bodies for burial ritually cleansing and cloaking them while the mourners watch. Initially aghast he is convinced by the taciturn owner Mr. Sasaki that he is ideal for the role of assistant and offers him the job. He has to fight his own prejudices as well as others about the supposed unseemliness of his profession including Mika who finds out her husband's new profession and pronounces him unclean. Daigo however realizes he has found his passion in the preburial ceremony and Sasaki teaches him the ropes in a way that recalls Juzo Itami's beloved 1985 comedy Tampopo.Former boyband singer Masahiro Motoki is genuinely affecting as Daigo while Ryoko Hirosue brings a surprising layer of complexity to the perennially sunny Mika. The deadpan Tsutomu Yamazaki makes Sasaki the film's key gravitational element with a minimum of effort while Kimiko Yo shows an offbeat quality as his office manager Yuriko. The cinematography by Takeshi Hamada is topnotch with some memorable images offered along the way like Daigo playing his cello on a hilltop and Joe Hisaishi's Kikujiro music score allows dramatic sweep without getting too epic. On the downside the film runs too long at 130 minutes and there are moments when the comedy is played too broadly and the sentiment laid on too thick. Still the movie shows Japanese cinema still exudes a unique identity and there is global vitality still in that country's film industry. A brief interview with Takita is the major bonus on the 2010 DVD.".

Thus it also becomes a plaintive meditation on Daigo's spiritual and moral development as he attends to the various abandonment issues that haunt him a father who ran off when he was young and a wife that stigmatizes him for his newly found filthy career. Ultimately Departures is as much a story of atonement as it is about dealing with mortality that in order to fully embrace one's existence it is necessary to cope with death  both literally and figuratively  while nurturing the bonds that exist among those who still live.".

Correct me if I am wrong but this is the second Oscar win in this century for a Japanese film since Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away 2001.Departures tells a story of a young married man Daigo who loses his job as a cellist in an orchestra which is seeing dwindling audiences. He then chances upon a job advertisement and lands himself unwillingly as an assistant to an old experienced professional who plies his trade in the coffin business.While Daigo is understandably immensely uncomfortable with his work initially the job grows on him as he consistently brings in the dough. He does ritual cleansing dressing and makeup for the dead during the funeral before they are put to rest in the coffin or in short encoffinment. Because of the nature of the job Daigo's marriage falls apart and he feels unaccepted by society.But that is just the surface of the story. Departures dwells into something more intrinsic to our hearts loss death guilt regret family and love  emotions and themes that are omnipresent in our lives but are often difficult to convey in film.Takita's picture reveals these with careful direction honest acting and a surreal music accompaniment by the legendary Joe Hisaishi to the film's many heartwrenching moments. The characters are so wellrealized that they take a life of their own it is as if we know their entire life story their painful past and their hopes for the future.Not only does Departures tug at our heartstrings it is also an eyeopening observation of a job most will shun without hesitation. Is it a loser's job? Is it an unclean job? What the director does well is to convince viewers that it is neither. Through sprinkles of effective humor Takita manages to bring a lighthearted warmness to the film though this is ultimately overwhelmed by the sheer melancholia of it all.Departures is a touching ode to those who have left us. It is also one of the best films to grace the screen in recent years. It is a powerful tearjerker and a reminder that embracing death can be a very beautiful thing too. Highly recommended!

	schema:headline " Before you departed from this earth go see this movie! It's very interesting and remarkable.";
	schema:reviewBody "It's very surprising to see a movie about the taboo practice of encoffinment become so university praise by critics. You would think this movie would fall under the radar of American  Japanese society because of the dark subject matter however this movie became one of the highestgrossing domestic Japanese films of that year. It was even a bigger hit international abroad winning many awards from critics like the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film of 2009. However for me I saw it as a onetime watch. A good movie worth checking out but not worth revisiting time after time again. Loosely based on 'Coffinman' a memoir by Shinmon Aoki and originally titled Okuribito means the sending away Departures follows the story of a young man Kobayashi Daigo Masahiro Motoki who returns to his hometown after a failed career as a cellist and stumbles across work as a nkanshia traditional Japanese ritual mortician. He is subjected to prejudice from those around him including from his family and friends because of strong social taboos against people who deal with death. Eventually he must try to earn their respect and learns the importance of interpersonal connections through the beauty and dignity of his work. Can Kobayashi Daigo achieve that or will he be disconnect from his family  friends for the rest of his life? Watch the movie to find out if you want to! Without spoiling the movie too much I have to say this movie by director Takita Yojiro was very informative to how Japanese culture prepare their dead for the afterlife. This is pretty much the main appeal of the film for me. To see what steps it takes for them to prepare their dead is very interesting and I'm not known for having a morbid curiosity for such things. You really do learn a lot about Japanese culture by watching this. However besides those the movie doesn't have much going for itself. Yes the classical cello music by composer Joe Hisaishi was indeed beautiful to hear and some of the film is very wellshot but as a main stream appeal it doesn't really have some. It's morbid curiosity at its best. I really don't know if American audiences would revisited this film time after time again like me. After all the film moves in a somewhat slow heavyhanded and predictable pace. In my opinion the conventional simple story is a little toostretch out. The result of this cause the movie to falls into a pit full of pointless filler scenes in the second act. Even the third act break up is very clichs. You can see it coming from a mile away. However most of the changes from the novel in the climax for the film was wellwritten and perform. I love the ending with the message stone. It was somewhat redeeming and heartwarming. As much as it's sounding like I didn't like the movie I honestly did love it. The actors in the film are all wellplayed. One thing I'm pretty glad the movie has is English subtitles then English dubbing because I would hate to see the movie suffer from bad lip sync. The subtitles really help a lot because some of these rituals can seem somewhat confusing. After all there are not many people that eat live squids go to bath houses and drink Japanese tea in rituals ceremony here in the States. It was nice to try to understand such practices. I also kinda glad the movie had some lighten moments. A good example is when Kobayashi and his boss Sasaki Tsutomu Yamazaki are cleaning a body that they thought was a woman but they find out it's a man. However one thing worth noticing about Japanese humor is how that joke and many after that doesn't have that much of a punchline because the film tries too hard to be respectful. I think this film would work better if they allow more leeway in how they were able to portray the dead. Maybe there was a little too much calming hypnotic grace with this PG13 film. It mask people's fears too much that humor and drama can't really shine through. I think this is why the movie kinda suffers when it comes to rewatch value. Maybe it could had work better as an RRated film but that's just a maybe. Anyways Overall Departures is alright movie. Somewhat overpraise but still a great film worth checking out. After all it's nice to see films like this reverse prejudice against a once taboo subject.".

It's morbid curiosity at its best. I really don't know if American audiences would revisited this film time after time again like me. After all the film moves in a somewhat slow heavyhanded and predictable pace. In my opinion the conventional simple story is a little toostretch out. The result of this cause the movie to falls into a pit full of pointless filler scenes in the second act. Even the third act break up is very clichs. You can see it coming from a mile away. However most of the changes from the novel in the climax for the film was wellwritten and perform. I love the ending with the message stone. It was somewhat redeeming and heartwarming. As much as it's sounding like I didn't like the movie I honestly did love it. The actors in the film are all wellplayed. One thing I'm pretty glad the movie has is English subtitles then English dubbing because I would hate to see the movie suffer from bad lip sync. The subtitles really help a lot because some of these rituals can seem somewhat confusing. After all there are not many people that eat live squids go to bath houses and drink Japanese tea in rituals ceremony here in the States. It was nice to try to understand such practices. I also kinda glad the movie had some lighten moments. A good example is when Kobayashi and his boss Sasaki Tsutomu Yamazaki are cleaning a body that they thought was a woman but they find out it's a man. However one thing worth noticing about Japanese humor is how that joke and many after that doesn't have that much of a punchline because the film tries too hard to be respectful. I think this film would work better if they allow more leeway in how they were able to portray the dead. Maybe there was a little too much calming hypnotic grace with this PG13 film. It mask people's fears too much that humor and drama can't really shine through. I think this is why the movie kinda suffers when it comes to rewatch value. Maybe it could had work better as an RRated film but that's just a maybe. Anyways Overall Departures is alright movie. Somewhat overpraise but still a great film worth checking out. After all it's nice to see films like this reverse prejudice against a once taboo subject.";

He was not there for her funeral because 'he was abroad' at the time we assume touring with the orchestra which has recently been disbanded. And he begins to play music again with a new understanding and to remember himself as a boy playing the the little cello that his mother and father bought for him. Because finally the film is about art. About the cello. About transcending life's pain and turmoil.

	schema:reviewBody "DEPARTURES aka OKURIBITO is an experience film one of those graceful creations of cinema that finds the balance between comedy and drama sensitive and sentimental and is embellished by a wondrous musical score and glowing cinematography. Running time is in excess of two hours but likely most viewers would elect to rewind and watch it again so touching and vital is this story. Daigo Kobayashi the enormously gifted Masahiro Motoki was raised by his mother when his father for some reason left his family when Daigo was only six years old his last memory of his father is a quiet scene by the ocean when the child and the father exchange found rocks. Daigo was encouraged by his parents to learn to play the cello so that he could amount to something special as a man. Things happen Daigo goes off to study cello his mother dies and he doesn't attend the funeral he marries Mike Ryoko Hirosue and spends all their money on a prime cello to gain admission to the major orchestra in the city. The orchestra plays to near empty houses and is finally disbanded. Daigo is without an income sells his prize cello and with Mika's blessing returns to his hometown to live in the home of his childhood. He answers an ad for work an ad that uses the word 'Departures' making Daigo think this is a travel agency. When Daigo 'interviews' with the owner Tsutomu Yamazaki he discovers that the job in one called 'encoffinment' a Japanese ceremonial procedure of preparing dressing  praying for the corpse before putting them in the coffin. At first repulsed by the job Daigo gradually discovers the importance of paying final respects to the dead and preparing them for the life ahead and his experiences with the new found beauty of encoffinment ties in with memories of his family recalls his estrangement from his father and reunites him with old dear friends who run a bath house etc. Mika is spared the truth about her husband's new job and when she discovers the truth Mika leaves Daigo who by now is enchanted with his position. Many experiences follow as Daigo encoffins all manner of people there are some ugly scenes and some very humorous scenes depicting the variety of 'calls' Daigo gets. How the story winds down is not necessarily difficult to discern but the manner in which the film ends is a work of great simplicity and beauty. Daigo's dealing with departures allows him to find his own arrivals. Writer Kundo Takita and director Yjir Takita well deserve all the awards lavished on this perfect little film. But much of the success of this story about another way to view death is the astonishingly multifaceted performance by Masahiro Motoki a beautiful man and an equally beautiful actor. This is a film to watch repeatedly and definitely one to add to the personal library of DVDs. Grady Harp".

They barely touch. They talk in generalities about unimportant things and never about what each is feeling. As the main character begins his journey into a new line of work  after being laid off from the symphony  we see how the Japanese face funerals without shedding a tear silent. The 'coffiners' are more human treat the deceased with more love tenderness than we ever see the live people show each other. This somehow gives the mourners permission to allow themselves to show their sadness their tears. This is not an action movie  don't watch it if you are sleepy or want to vege out and be entertained.

	schema:reviewBody "Death might just be the most sensitive subject to handle in the world of cinema. It's always riddled with emotion. If mishandled it can be disastrous but if handled with a daft hand the end result can be beautiful.The Japanese film Departures is a film about death atonement and an appreciation of certain things that others find dishonorable. The film follows Daigo a cellist for the Tokyo Philharmonic. When the orchestra is disbanded Daigo and his wife move back to his hometown where Daigo gets a job working as an encoffiner people who prepare dead bodies for funerals. In Japan being an encoffiner is seen as a dishonorable profession and Diago must come to grips with his change in fortune while also learning about the beauty of death.Departures is an intriguing film beautiful and highly emotional. To say that this is a moving film would not be doing it enough justice. The film is a fascinating piece of art. Director Yojiro Takita directs the film much like Daigo plays the cello with passion and intensity often utilizing swelling crescendos and moments of silence to create genuine emotion. It is never manipulative but simply beautiful.The film is full of brilliant performances in particular Masahiro Motoki as Daigo. Motoki delivers a performance that draws the viewer into the film. He takes you directly into the emotional state of the character and he is a large part of the film's success. Of course it doesn't hurt when a film looks this beautiful and wondrous to behold. The cinematography is stunning. The film captures the beauty of the Japanese mountain ranges with so much clarity. To cap it all off the musical score from legendary composer Joe Hisaishi is magnificent. Hisaishi's music always amazes me but with Departures he has taken another step forward in his career.The real treat of this film is that it laces all of the drama and tragedy with humor and heart. It's a recipe that just leaves you as the audience feeling uplifted rather than depressed. It's a film where if any tears flow they will not be tears of sadness but rather tears of hope.After seeing this film I can definitely see how it deserved all of the accolades bestowed upon it including the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar at the Academy Awards this past year. The film is brilliant. It is tough to find but if you manage to find it online or playing somewhere near you I strongly recommend seeing it and being moved by the power of this film.I give this film a beautiful 10 out of 10!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Japanese entry that received the Oscar for the best foreign movie deals with a theme that is not unique in the Japanese cinema  the death as a continuation of life the caring and respect one owes to the dead which helps the living to continue with their own lives. It does it in a manner that is both emotional and serene and the result is a film that will touch a cord for almost everybody who watches it.The hero is a musician and this fact plays a role in the film as it gives a pretext for wonderful music to be inserted and create the appropriate atmosphere or counterpoint in certain moments. He has to quit his profession when the orchestra he was playing in is disbanded and returns to his home city together with his beautiful and seemingly almost smiling wife. By accident  he is misreading a newspaper add  he is hired by an agency that cares for the bodies of the dead before cremation a work so low class that he cannot even tell his wife about it. It's well paid however and he takes it and then he is confronted with the reality of the 'departures'  his employer is an artist in the profession of making the final moments of quitting this world honorable for the dead but especially kind and memorable for the remaining family. And we will all become convinced by the end of the film that this is how it should be.The film certainly belongs to the category of melodrama but then it is good quality one. Most cinema viewers are not ashamed of dropping a tear when something moves them in the movie and appreciate directors actors and story writers who are capable to induce such emotions. It tells also a lot to the nonJapanese viewers about conflicts between tradition and new pace of life and about family relations and the role of the wife in the modern Japanese family. I am not familiar enough with the social and cultural details of Japan to make a judgment to what extent they are authentic but they are clearly articulated and in a delicate manner. The film is maybe 10 or 20 minutes longer than it should be but there are no long intervals when it becomes boring so its length is supportable. It is wonderfully acted and viewers will probably remember for a long while the principal hero played by Masahiro Motoki the older dead caretaker played by Tsutomu Yamazaki and the wife Mika played by the wonderful Ryoko Hirosue. Cinematography is simple and aesthetic although the scenes of the hero playing music in the nature seem artificial and the filming of the mountain in the background is too many times repeated and apparently unjustified. Over all it is a good and moving film. Maybe it was not the best foreign film of the year but it was quite a simple and obvious choice for the jury of the Academy.".

Giggling girls loud 40 year old commentators blinding active mobile screens mobile ringing the Jive 3x and people talking loudly outside the plex door. Are we still in the 70s? Can't be you all have got your cellphones. So please you paid for a ticket so did I and the rest of the audience. I would call these people inconsiderate rude insensitive and uncaring.The most memorable thing about the movie is no doubt the music. The pieces played are appropriately placed soothing and calm with a touch of melancholy were needed. One of the best scores out of a movie I reckon.The pace of the movie is kept fairly even throughout the film. However there is never a dull moment. The story is in some places mildly humorous but you'll not get anymore than a big grin out of it. You do have to remember you are watching a movie about a traditional Japanese funeral ritual. It underlines the taboo nature of the professional and how a rural community reacts to people like them.This movie gave me a how new respect to this traditions. I am not one who adhere to traditions and much less rituals.I will not dwell on the plots and story so you can go into the cinema and enjoy this very well made movie.If you are those that can't turn off your precious cellphones can't stop talking quietly while the film is running andor if you cannot appreciate another culture's ritual and tradition please spare the people who can and not go and watch this. Also if you are around the age of 1522 and are very sexually active also please stay out.".

We start of at the miserable beginning of Gabrielle Chanel's life in an orphanage. It quickly becomes clear that this is not the story about some highsociety woman who got bored and decided to make clothes in a style that was unheard of at that time even for people who don't know anything about the life of Coco Chanel. We see her slowly but surely clawing her way up in society using her charm and wit but most of all her outspokenness always telling what she thinks.Cinematographically this film is outstanding too. Throughout the film certain elements of clothing black and white patterns stripes men's shirts are shown through an unclear lens to point out that even the most early views of Coco on fashion were incorporated in her style later.This film is not just a story about Coco's success it's also about her struggle to fit in in a society that differed so much from her own opinions about her losses and heartaches. All in all we get a complete picture of the icon that is still loved and admired today.".

I enjoyed watching it and recommend it for a good entertaining film.However I just want to say that the film is not always that factual at times. I would recommend reading a biography of Chanel such as The Gospel According to Chanel to get a more realistic idea of her life.This film has some fact but also includes some idealized fantasy of her which makes for good storytelling for a film. The film is good the factual part not so much.The film shows Chanel as very skilled sewing and as a skilled pattern maker  but I believe in real life she was not that skilled she could sew straight seams but not necessarily intricate tailoring she was more the creative genius with the fashion vision she hired the skilled seamstresses and hired someone to make the patterns from her ideas and her rougher designs.This film does cover the early part of Coco Chanel's life  up to about the beginning World War I. And in fact it was because of the start of WWI in 191418 that Chanel got her big break in designing fashion  but the film does not include that historical background.As an aside I think that a film would not have been made to cover her whole life because during World War II Chanel did live in Paris with a Nazi lover for a few years  and the whole part of her WWII years is usually hushed up. She then later lived in exile in Switzerland after the war with her exNazi lover. So they would not want to have included this unpopular part of her life in a big budget film as it would be too controversial.".

This really is before Chanel the brand and at first it comes off a little routine showing the young years and her trying to get out of having to do silly song and dance acts. Eventually she moves up and meets people of influence the two always go together don't they? and turns a corner by making hats for some well off women who have taken to them and to her.What makes the movie interesting is Chanel's relationships with other men two in particular and in the general libertine scene she found herself joining if not always liking. She does find love maybe twice one more paternal replacing the father who abandoned her as a child. And all three male actors are spoton believable. As is Tatou. The whole affair is interesting but with little magic or surprise. It's well made and well paced and you won't get drowsy but expect a routine exploration.

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Anne Fontaine and based upon the book by Edmonde CharlesRoux Coco Before Chanel is a biographical tale of Gabrielle Coco Chanel set a timeline which is just that before she founded the fashion empire. So for those who are more intrigued about the fashion world and the impact Chanel has on it then this is not the movie you're looking for as it firmly dwells on Coco as a person and her romantic dalliances with two men who played significant roles in her life be it in support of her daily sustenance or inspiring and providing fuel for her desire to make a name for herself.The film dedicated plenty of time in Coco's awakening toward the French high life of the time since she became a voluntary kept mistress of rich playboy Etienne Balsan Benoit Poelvoorde who in a way had rescued her from poverty and whose riches afforded to her provided that access to the slacker lifestyles of the rich and famous. The audience too get reminded time and again of how stifling a woman's place in high society was at the turn of the century made worse by the restrictive clothing like corsets frills and lace from the neck right down to sweeping the floors. Coco's disdain and penchant for freedom led to bold designs that do not conform starting from her hats which provided her some attention and notoriety even.As Coco Chanel Audrey Tautou epitomizes that level of elegance vulnerability and rebellious streak to do things differently. Her petiteness and somewhat boyish cut figure probably suited the role really well as the initial designs by Coco were those inspired by menswear though you only get glimpses of her design genius from short montages scattered throughout and from some scenes which show her working at a tailor shop but other than that you will gain very little from this biopic other than the messy love life that she got herself into first with benefactor of sorts Etienne who treated her nothing more than an object to bed in exchange for lodging then Alessandro Nivola's Arthur BoyCapel a businessman with whom she falls head over heels with. The romances do make you wonder about how careless the treatment of emotions are where love and issues of marriage are quite trivially handled.While Anne Fontaine nailed down the look of the film the feel somehow was found to be lacking as apart from the romantic angle nothing else really rang through until the last act which was a very hastily down finale to show the tremendous progress Coco had undergone once she had closed her heart where she had broken through a society and introduced radical changes to an industry from hats to influencing a lot more in the fashion world. How she did exactly that is best left to another film because this one had little else other than repeated shots of scissors going through fabric.Without a doubt the clothes here are the star of the show from the fashions of societal norms in both directions of the richpoor spectrum to Coco Chanel's designs for her own with her menswear inspired pieces and unfortunately the glamourchic pieces only making it through in a parting shot at the finale since the founding of the business empire was grossly passed over deliberately. The opulently designed clothes of that era stand in stark contrast to the Chanel pieces which celebrates sheer beauty and elegance in their simplicity and probably from there stamping its mark on the fashion industry.Don't approach this film with an expectation that you would learn something of the beginnings of Chanel the brand and how it became the icon of today. In fact it's more about the love and early life of its founder who without her accomplishment and the name backing her could have turned out to be nothing more than a generic average and perhaps even strange romantic picture. And of course this is also for Audrey Tautou fans who'll lap up her look as Coco Chanel in those chic garbs.".

Many seemed to go in unaware that the movie was set before her 'Chanel' days and I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment at the end from others via looking at their faces overhearing conversations and talking with friends. It's interesting but it does plod on very slowly.We are treated to a very rude harsh character in Coco. Full credit goes to Audrey Tautou for her performance though. She really does fit into this movie's feel and tone very well. Her cheeky performance is definitely a highlight.I don't know what to make of Alessandro Nivola as 'Boy'. The character was and looked rather sleazy. I'm not sure if that was meant or if that was Alessandro. Other than that mentions go to Benot Poelvoorde for his solid performance and Emmanuelle Devos as the sexy and selfassured Emilienne d'Alenon.Other than that it's a solid biopic. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Seeing her work in Amelie hardly prepares the audience for the depths and complexities one can see in Coco. The film works because Antonie understands her material and because the lead performer couldn't be better. Audrey Tautou is regal intense gorgeous and very determined in her portrayal of the fashion icon. Her turn brings to life the soul of a woman who was able to see beyond her times who knew it was time to institute change to break out of what society expected of women and most importantly she did it in style.The work of Antoine and Tautou seen as the leaders of a team showing the portrayal of how a young woman grows in her perception and understanding of what it is like being a female in the early 20th century. She knows the boundaries placed by society on her sex and like most of us fears exposing herself at first but Coco is fearless and she learns to conquer earning respect and power along the way.The film is very successful because it doesn't concentrate only on the politics of the time but it spends a considerable amount of time showing us the personal side of the icon and her relationships. It is a joy to see her in love and it's inspiring to see how she manages to rise at critical moments of her life. There is fire in this performance plenty of spirit and an elegance rarely seen in the movies anymore and this poise is not only the result of the gorgeous set direction and costumes but of the forces that live inside Coco's soul.The last 15 minutes of the movie are practically unforgettable as Coco experiences a multitude of emotions from intense and unbridled romantic love to a relentless intensity that now accompanies her desire to become the best. Seeing her sitting on the stairs as the movie ends and watching her expressions change is the stuff most performers hope they can achieve once in a lifetime. Cotillard brought to life another icon and walked away with just about every accolade for her masterful work. Taotou continues to show the marvelous essence of French performers putting together a performance that can inspire us to believe there is still plenty of magic left in the movie world.".

There was some sort of subtleness about it everything was going too slow and not much was happening in terms of demonstrating that this hopeless little girl from nowhere had this extraordinary talent for clothmaking. Yes we did see her advocating simplicity in times of great extravagance and even dressing up probably her first clients but had the viewer not been aware of the brand Chanel he or she would have to wait until the finishing titles to realise Coco turned out to become a fashion icon.If there is one thing about Coco is that she was a rebel in a late 19th century puritan society she stood up for what she believed refused to get married and instead of settling for a wedlock with a rich spouse she chose to live the adventure go to Paris and start up a hat shop.It seems however that her rebellious nature extended to her design skills. To use her own words Simplicity is the keynote of all true elegance. Coco Chanel always kept the clothing she designed simple comfortable and revealing. Unlike most designers in that Europe she kept the woman inside the clothes at the center of her creations. I gave women a sense of freedom I gave them back their bodies bodies that were drenched in sweat due to fashion's finery lace corsets underclothes padding. Perhaps it was fate or desperation from her impoverished upbringing but the affair with the playboy millionaire and later his best friend were pivotal to give her the push she needed to make a start. Though not an expert on French upper class culture but were quite impressed how civilized and elegant the two men were when it came to loving and pursuing the same woman.All in all a decent film but no wow factor.".

There is next to no mention of Chanel's postwar success and influence.

The designer of the groundbreaking haute couture style creator of the huge fashion brand Chanel and a forwardthinker in terms of women's independence. Chanel is a complex and dynamic personality. Makes me want to see a movie called Coco During Chanel. But Coco Before Chanel? Not so much.Audrey Tautou does a commendable job of playing Chanel in her early years and looks a lot like Chanel in the movie's later scenes. Adding complications to the idea is the fact that there is little known about Chanel's youth and what is known often has conflicting stories. But be prepared what does happen in Coco Before Chanel happens slowly. This in a movie that portrays the French elite as people with crazy money outlandish parties and a constant desire to quench their boredom. I desired the same.Although she often denied it Chanel was brought to an orphanage early in life this was denied mainly to prevent preconceptions of her as an undesirable. The film sharply cuts to late teensearly twenties Coco real name Gabrielle singing with her sister in clubs to make a buck. It was the plight of women in the 1890s to find a man or fear being lost in society. Coco's sister was beholden to a man for thirty years and he FINALLY married her after his parents died so he wouldn't have to explain to them that he married an orphan for shame!. This assnine mentality is certainly worth rebelling against but Coco remains passive for too much of the movie. She is taken in by a wild playboy named Balsan expertly played by Benoit Poelvoorde and is mistreated by him for years. Chanel wants to answer to no man and wants to design clothes that avoid the feathers and corset that alter a woman's natural body. But again this is done with little dramatic flair and many many pages of slowmoving script. Coco came off as a little too inert for a little too long.This movie is the first of the lateyear potential Oscar nominees. Tautou's performance is a maybe but the costume design is a sure thing and rightfully so. The Chanel style is famous they have to nail it and they did while also building gorgeous period outfits for the rich endofcentury French culture and a few military outfits as well.The score by Alexandre Desplat does a lot to enhance a few of the scenes and the cinematography is lush. I want to give a special nod to Alessandro Nivola who's very good here and very good in everything but the guy doesn't appear in enough highprofile stuff. He sits very comfortably in the French language here and smolders in some of his more romantic moments like a poor man's Ralph Fiennes.A traumatic event late in the film propels Coco to launch into her designing full speed. That moment felt a little rushed and the whole ending follows suit. What I wanted at the end was the Coco During Chanel movie to start so then that could be kind of a success for the film? But remember I wanted Coco During Chanel going in so really the whole 'before' story just felt like slow filler. Frills perhaps? Padding?".

The closing summary of the film lauds her for her contributions to the fashion world without mentioning her shameful actions in WWII. Even recent documentaries about her seem to dodge the subject also. But it is well documented indeed. They should have given us a balanced warts and all treatment. See the London Times article of April 4 2009 Chanel and the Nazis. This excerpt is particularly relevant Perhaps Chanellovers also have no idea that she tried to wrest control of her perfume manufacturing from a Jewish family taking advantage of proAryan laws. Or that she was arrested for war crimes  and then mysteriously released. Previously I'd seen it mentioned that Chanel had survived the war rather comfortably at the Paris Ritz in the arms of a Nazi officer Hans Gunther von Dincklage and then gone into exile in Switzerland with him but a few hours spent in the library revealed that she was far more deeply involved with the Germans than that. There was even a somewhat ridiculous Nazi plot using Chanel as bait called Operation Modelhut. From Chanel  the Nazis by Kate Muir London Times April 4 2009.".

	schema:headline " Tautou drags you through but it's still painful...";
	schema:reviewBody "Coco Chanel one of these most iconic fashion designers of all time is something of a complex character with layers upon layers of depth pain and a truly heartbreaking story. Shirley MacLaine starred as Coco in an adaptation made for television where she was nominated for an Emmy SAG and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. Figuring the semisuccess of the TV version the movie version in the French language would include the authenticity and passion the other did not. Afraid Coco avant Chanel or Coco Before Chanel in English is an uninspired counterfeit of the life of the fashionista.WriterDirector Anne Fontaine who also penned the Toronto hit Chloe does not give the story any eagerness or motivation to engage the viewer in this timeless tale. The key object needed to improve the narrative is a bridge. By that it means bridge these ideas situations and plot together so the viewer feels included in this tale. In the same manner Coco's story lacks drama and ambition. There's no real struggle seen in her life that brings sympathy or empathy to the character. The story is not cohesive in so much as showing how or why she found solace in design. One random day in the last ten minutes of the film Chanel is the top fashion designer. It's purely random even for a foreign language film.Audrey Tautou plays Coco Chanel from age twentyfive to god knows how old she is when it ends. Tautou puts forth the most valiant effort to breathe existence into this dead soulless character written for the screen. Tautou has shown her acting chops and succeeded in films like Amelie and A Very Long Engagement. Even her level of endowment couldn't drag us through. It's a painful and futile ride through France in what seems to be one of the most insipid films of the year. This is not the Coco Chanel film America wanted. The MadeforTV movie looks like Platoon compared to this.Positive features of the film are the exquisite costume design by Catherine Leterrier. A very pleasing score by Alexandre Desplat who might be a dark horse for an Oscar nomination this awards season is a superb work from the famous composer.Maybe next time they'll play an Alexandre Desplat score with pictures of early 1900s costumes and they'll make for a better film.".

Figuring the semisuccess of the TV version the movie version in the French language would include the authenticity and passion the other did not. Afraid Coco avant Chanel or Coco Before Chanel in English is an uninspired counterfeit of the life of the fashionista.WriterDirector Anne Fontaine who also penned the Toronto hit Chloe does not give the story any eagerness or motivation to engage the viewer in this timeless tale. The key object needed to improve the narrative is a bridge. By that it means bridge these ideas situations and plot together so the viewer feels included in this tale. In the same manner Coco's story lacks drama and ambition. There's no real struggle seen in her life that brings sympathy or empathy to the character. The story is not cohesive in so much as showing how or why she found solace in design. One random day in the last ten minutes of the film Chanel is the top fashion designer. It's purely random even for a foreign language film.Audrey Tautou plays Coco Chanel from age twentyfive to god knows how old she is when it ends. Tautou puts forth the most valiant effort to breathe existence into this dead soulless character written for the screen. Tautou has shown her acting chops and succeeded in films like Amelie and A Very Long Engagement. Even her level of endowment couldn't drag us through. It's a painful and futile ride through France in what seems to be one of the most insipid films of the year. This is not the Coco Chanel film America wanted. The MadeforTV movie looks like Platoon compared to this.Positive features of the film are the exquisite costume design by Catherine Leterrier. A very pleasing score by Alexandre Desplat who might be a dark horse for an Oscar nomination this awards season is a superb work from the famous composer.Maybe next time they'll play an Alexandre Desplat score with pictures of early 1900s costumes and they'll make for a better film.";

I only received hints and instances of Coco's design genius in between the parts where she arrives uninvited to her eventual lover's house as drab a person as a chambermaid makes love to him and then to Arthur 'Boy' Chapel and so on. She was apparently so much the mold breaker for feminists all over that she started her business by being bankrolled by her lover who by the way decided to marry an Englishwoman for money. Well nobody said this was a moral story only a feminist one.But besides all of this the movie is unremarkable and boring. It paces itself in such a way you can go to the kitchen to fix yourself a Dagwood sandwich and still not miss anything. As a chick flick it does not have the attractiveness of a straight love story since one does not see exactly what Boy or Balsan sees in this wretch.5 stars for me.".

The first 40 minuets of orphanage and cabaret misery and rudeness mirror LA VIE EN ROSE too much and only later when Coco falls in love with Boy Alessandro Nivola and they romance by the sea does the film lighten a bit and she actually for a few minutes becomes likable.

I am not saying 33 isn't young it's just that if you saw an actress of 20 next to her the difference would be palpable. Or maybe it is the director's fault because most of Coco's charm seem to be from these long lingering closeups of Audrey's big eyesbut her character was somber and brooding for a large portion of the film. Anyway I think of Anne Hathaway's collegiate youth in the Devil Wears Prada and that same youthful charm  energy just didn't come across in this film albeit it was attempted to be conveyed with various different scenes such as riding a galloping horse without knowing how to ride etc.Secondly I agree that it was a very twodimensional and simplistic movie. It could have been a Hollywood script rather than the fact it was a complex biography of a real person in an important era of history.

The first thing to say is that whilst Marion Cotillard who didn't just play Piaf but WAS Piaf is a far better actress than Audrey Tautou who plays Coco Chanel Anne Fontaine who directed Coco is light years ahead of Olivier Dahan as a director. Indeed so assured is Fontaine that she can afford to throw away a gorgeous scene in the opening minutes the young Coco still known by her real name Gabrielle has just arrived at the orphanage where she spent part of her childhood a door is opened and from the back of the room  looking towards the doorway in which she is framed  we see a row of beds all boasting snowwhite linen and jet black bedsteads a stunning image in which the fledgling Coco is framed in the shades destined to become associated with her. The shot lasts twenty seconds at the most but in a film replete with sumptuous decor it lingers in the memory. Benoit Poelvoorde made his name as a comedian but Fontaine gave him a chance to play straight in Entre ses mains and here again he acquits himself well as what used to be called a 'sugar daddy'. Two of the finest modern French actresses are also on hand and towards the end they get to share a brief scene with Tautou both Marie Gillain and Manu Devos are outstanding in support. Tautou was a good choice for the lead being herself slightly androgynous though at times she resembles Ingrid Bergman more than Audrey Hepburn but the real star is Fontaine via her consistent subtle use of black and white and stunning setpieces. If Fontaine had directed La Mome ... if Cotillard had played Chanel ...".

The shot lasts twenty seconds at the most but in a film replete with sumptuous decor it lingers in the memory. Benoit Poelvoorde made his name as a comedian but Fontaine gave him a chance to play straight in Entre ses mains and here again he acquits himself well as what used to be called a 'sugar daddy'. Two of the finest modern French actresses are also on hand and towards the end they get to share a brief scene with Tautou both Marie Gillain and Manu Devos are outstanding in support. Tautou was a good choice for the lead being herself slightly androgynous though at times she resembles Ingrid Bergman more than Audrey Hepburn but the real star is Fontaine via her consistent subtle use of black and white and stunning setpieces. If Fontaine had directed La Mome ... if Cotillard had played Chanel ...";

It doesn't even do a good job of showing her potential as an artist.Spoilers She comes up as a very simply woman who is strangely content with being a mistress.

And there are those short scenes where we see her tailoring a dress but that is it. It is only at the very end of the movie maybe the last minute the movie gives a glimpse of what she has become in the later years but even that is so lacking in spirit and very vague.I have to say this is a poorly made biography about somebody whose character probably has more spirit and inventiveness than what this movie portrays. I like Audrey Tautou but she is not giving much life to her character which is probably due to the way the script is written. She doesn't have much depth.".

She was unconventional and thumbed her nose at the prevailing styles and society. That was her strength and the basis for her business success.

	schema:reviewBody "Paul Newman plays a Mexican bandit so convincingly in The Outrage Martin Ritt 1964 that it's extremely difficult to recognize Newman at all. Far from being a star vehicle the Paul Newman persona isn't recognizable here in the least. I must admit that for quite a while I kept wondering when Newman was going to finally arrive on the screen before it dawned upon me that Newman was playing the bandit. I wouldn't deem his amoral animalistic lusty performance brilliant because it constitutes a rather stereotypical caricature of a Mexican bandit. Nevertheless Newman disguises himself so dramatically to the point where Paul Newman is almost invisible that his performance becomes noteworthy just the same.Overall Martin Ritt's Western remake of Akira Kurosawa's landmark and legendary Rashomon Kurosawa 1950 is worth viewing despite some obvious flaws. Ritt doesn't add anything new to Kurosawa's famous study in subjective truth and pointofview prejudice and at times The Outrage which was also taken from a thenrecent Broadway play appears a bit flat and copied. Indeed it occasionally seems as if Ritt grows bored with the story that he's copying from Kurosawa and Broadway and that he's yearning for comedy and satire in his otherwise straight remake. However those alternative tones are never fully developed and as a result the film fails to make a dynamic impact. That same year over in Spain Italian director Sergio Leone remade Kurosawa's Samurai classic Yojimbo 1961 as a Western but he did so with epochal results largely because he brought a whole new visual style a patient rhythmic balance of stunning panorama and extreme closeups and directorial slant a fluid study in operatic nihilism and surrealism to Kurosawa's story. In other words Leone remade a Kurosawa film and in doing so he transformed it into something vastly different. In The Outrage Ritt fails to pull off the same trick.That said there are some aspects that recommend The Outrage to the viewer and Newman's chameleon performance is just one of them. All of Ritt's remarkable directorial trademarks are on display here his ambiguity his objectivity his refusal to condescend to the audience the moral shadiness that he evokes his rejection of blackorwhite moral simplicity his implicit and unstrained social commentary in this case revolving around the holy trinity of race class and gender not to mention regionalism his spare ominously striking visuality his meditative pacing. Perhaps most noteworthy is James Wong Howe's haunting blackandwhite cinematography which reflects an ominous glow and projects an apocalyptic sensibility rather than Western grandeur. Instead of macrocosmic vistas Howe's compositions capture a sense of claustrophobia moral confusion and subjective truth thanks to their lowangle and eyelevel confinement. Through his camerawork the Western landscape becomes not a romantic frontier or an openair arena but instead an entangling thicket where honor and honesty descend in a squalid ravine. Most remarkable are the crepuscular stormy forbidding shots of a forsaken railway station during a desert thunderstorm. It is here that three observers one of which is deliciously played by the always memorable Edward G. Robinson discuss the different versions of truth while refraining from spelling out the implications for the audience. Ritt as usual forces the viewer to think for him or herself. And what Ritt reveals are the human motivationspride vanity contempt guilt shame distrust lust cowardice avarice survivalthat color the notion of truth and ultimately render it subjective. Unfortunately as a straight remake The Outrage's presentation of these themes is a little too flat and perfunctory to leave a fresh impact. Still the film is compelling and curious standing as an artistic sobering Western and the most obscure oater that Paul Newman ever starred in. And of course Newman virtually obscures himself by becoming another.".

Those who have seen both works will be able to note the obvious virtues of the original. Yet I saw this film with no prior knowledge of the fact that this was a remake of Rashomon.What struck me within minutes of opening of the film was the unusual camerawork of James Hong Howe that takes pleasure in closeups and tilted shots that are reminescent of European cinema of the sixties. It is so far removed in style from Hollywood.Reams of paper have used to write about Akutagawa's story immortalized by Kurosawa. So I have nothing to add on the brilliant story that obviously attracted Ritt and the playwrights Kanin.What is unusual is Ritt's treatment. His choice of actors are interestingClaire Bloom is a fine choice as she has a range of emotions to display with credibility Laurence Harvey's role is limited even though he occupies a long screentime gagged and bound but he has to show scorn for a brief period the gag is removed without speakingand when he speaks his face is not visible Edward G Robinson is a perfect choice for a snake oil salesman and so on...Ritt's use of the soundtrack is again nonHollywood in style. He uses music and uses silence with great effect while characters talk to underline the emotions. Kurosawa did it to the extreme limits that makes it odd for the nonJapanese viewer.Ritt is an interesting director. I have always admired his choice of subjects to film. I prefer his black and white films to his color projects because of the subjects that he chose to filmEdge of the City being one of my favorite Ritt works. The second reason I admire him is for his choice of actors especially for the major female roles. He has derived great performances as he did here with Bloom.This film will never be talked about because it is a remake of a classic. However in my view it stands out as unlike John Sturges' Magnificent Seven which was also a remake of another Kurosawa work in Hollywood this film adopted a different style closer to Europe and Japan. It is essentially a fine work of depicting a play on film somewhat like nuggets of celluloid gold found among the works of the American Film Theatre series.".

It follows the path set by The OxBow Incident The Gunfighter The Showdown and High Noon the intellectual western in black and white. The story is excellent and adapts well for the genre with four people telling different versions of the same murder. Claire Bloom and Lawrence Harvey are the married couple who get assaulted by Carrasco Newman. Paul Newman is a great actor his performance in Martin Ritt's Hombre is a proof of that but there is a limit on how far you can go acting against your type. Newman set an impossible task for himself playing Carrasco that part should go for actors like Eli Wallach or Anthony Quinn. I would not say his performance is a total failure but the problem is that it is very important to understand Carrasco's character and that is not achieved by Newman visually only when he verbalizes it in a Spanish that does not sound right. The irony is that Newman is such a charismatic actor that you actually enjoy his presence in the film. Edward G Robinson is the Con Man what a performance! The Outrage is a very good film it deserved better reviews than it got from the critics.".

Paul Newman is a great actor his performance in Martin Ritt's Hombre is a proof of that but there is a limit on how far you can go acting against your type. Newman set an impossible task for himself playing Carrasco that part should go for actors like Eli Wallach or Anthony Quinn. I would not say his performance is a total failure but the problem is that it is very important to understand Carrasco's character and that is not achieved by Newman visually only when he verbalizes it in a Spanish that does not sound right. The irony is that Newman is such a charismatic actor that you actually enjoy his presence in the film. Edward G Robinson is the Con Man what a performance! The Outrage is a very good film it deserved better reviews than it got from the critics.";

It stars Edward G. Robinson Paul Newman Laurence Harvey Claire Bloom Howard Da Silva  William Shatner. The story remains the same as four people give contradictory accounts of a rape and murder during the trial of Mexican bandit Juan Carrasco Newman. The story is told within a flashback framework of three men waiting for a train at a rain soaked Southwestern stationa prospector Da Silva a con man Robinson and a preacher now struggling with his faith in humanity Shatner. As each story is told the validity of each account comes under scrutiny could it be there was a gross miscarriage of justice at the trial?Perhaps unsurprisingly this remake of a well regarded classic was a commercial flop with many front line critics particularly savage in their reviews. Which while acknowledging it's a long way away from style and tone of Kurosawa's movie it's hardly the devil's spawn either. Solidly constructed by Ritt and potently shot in black  white by James Wong Howe vistas however are in short supply the story is strong enough to make for an interesting social conscious Oater. There's some misplaced humour in the final third and a charge of overacting from the talented cast is fair enough especially Bloom but maybe just maybe Ritt and his team deserve a little leeway for trying a different approach? I mean at least it's not a shot for shot remake eh?Certainly Newman could never be accused of not being bold or daring with his role selections one only has to look at his Western film's to see that. Especially the three he did with Ritt Hud 1963 The Outrage 1964  Hombre 1967 three very different roles and each of a different ethnicity too. Throw in his intense turn as Billy The Kid in Arthur Penn's The Left Handed Gun and it makes a mockery of those people who pop up from time to time proclaiming Newman had limited range! Is he miscast as Bandido Carrasco in The Outrage? No not really he throws himself into the role and without prior knowledge of whose under the hat it's not overtly evident it's the great blue eyed man performing. Sure a Mexican actor would have been better for the role and definitely Rashomon wasn't in need of a remake. But for Western fans and especially for fans of Newman The Outrage still has enough to warrant spending a pie and a pint of beer with. Not particularly great but not exactly bad either. 6.510".

While I'm aware that we all have the right to express our views I would like to see a little more insight on those selecting which reviews will be presented. This film is a remake and reset of the Kurusawa classic and is a classic in its own right.  Fine fine performances are given by Newman Harvey Bloom Shatnerin his preKirk days Robinson Salmi Da Silva and Fix in this casting of a Japanese film play which is a composite of two stories BTW by Akira Kurusawa.  It's not perfect.  The role of the medium the old Indian shaman portrayed by veteran character actor Paul Fix doesn't have the cultural impact of the original.  There is confusion around the rape and fight scene but these are small things.  The film is marvelous and the black and white setting captures much of the shading and light contrasts of the original Rashomon.  The story in both films which Kurusawa wove out of two earlier stories is full of archetypes but lacking much of the impending chaos of the original.  The first tale of the old gate at kyoto tells of a ronin confronting an old woman and taking the blanket from an abandoned child in the time of civil war and political upheaval the other tale in the woods tells of the various versions of rape murder honor and shame told by each of the participants.  Kurusawa blended them into an excellent film story.  While the cultural background of the original sets it apart from this American version there is much that does make it work.  The genteel Southern couple the Mexican bandido the pragmatic sheriff the country preacher the snakeoil salesman and the minerprospector fit the Samurai bandit medium etc. of the original very well.

	schema:reviewBody "The Outrage is a remake of the Akira Kurosawa classic Rashomon. It's a very faithful adaptation but does not improve upon the original. It would have been better served not to have been as faithful as it was. The cinematography of Rashomon for instance is groundbreaking and an alltime great. Martin Ritt's remake is slicker and more modern but not better. Outrage is set in the old west where the original was set in feudal Japan. Four years before Outrage director John Sturges remade Kurosawa's Seven Samurai' into The Magnificent Seven. Both are classics. Ritt's stab at Kurosawa a slightly older film has been swept up into the sands of film history and is littleremembered. This despite an allstar cast that includes Edward G. Robinson Laurence Harvey William Shatner and Paul Newman as agh! a Mexican outlaw. The source material for Magnificent Seven is a story and a script written for film. The source material for Outrage technically is a short story written in the early 20th century by Ryunosuke Akutagawa called In A Grove from which Rashomon was also adapted. Oddly Rashomon' is another story altogether by the same author. The Rashomon Gate is the largest entrance to the walled thencapital of Japan Kyoto. Having chosen this the setting for the telling of the film's story as the three souls take refuge from a storm under this giant gate Kurosawa renamed the film after it. Instead of going back to the original source Ritt remakes Kurosawa's film. In doing so Ritt walks into a trap many filmmakers do when trying to faithfully remake a muchloved piece of work. To remake a film seems to convey that the original lacked something or was somehow flawed. Rashomon clearly did not need to be remade. But once the decision was made to make another version whether Ritt used the film or the Akutagawa story as his source it's a nowin situation. Even if he'd based it on the original story he would have spent his time and energy trying NOT to make another version of Rashomon.  There are humorous moments in both films. More times than not I could not tell the difference between what was funny intentionally or unintentionally in Outrage. One possible improvement that is made by the remake is that the fourth and final retelling of the trial by the thief distinguishes itself much more from the first telling by the bandit. It comes off more comically which I believe was intended in Kurosawa's version but doesn't quite come across. The sequence taken by itself is the high point of Outrage.  All things considered The Outrage is an exercise in futility. It's a curiosity for those wondering how yet another Kurosawa film could be overhauled and made into a western. I'd guess the idea was to bring the same story to America with a more familiar setting in English. Maybe someday directors will quit wasting their time trying to remake films that are already masterpieces. If you really feel you need to do a remake find a bad film and rise to the challenge of improving upon it example Christopher Nolan's Insomnia. With Rashomon there was nowhere to go but down. The one exception is the aforementioned Magnificent Seven. By Kurosawa's own admission the inspiration for his Seven Samurai came from the American western genre. It's for this reason that Sturges' remake works so well.".

It seems that they should have known that the stage acting that Newman was doing would not be effective on film. In stage acting you play broad and loud because the 23rd row has to see and hear you. In film you can adjust the volume and go in for the closeup to make sure the slightest gesture gets shown. For whatever strange reason everybody with the exception of superold pro Edward G. Robinson is doing stage acting. It comes across as overthetop and ridiculous most of the time. The acting seriously undercuts the serious metaphysical questions about truth that the plot raises.Newman's performance matches his worse performance in From the Terrace although I haven't seen him in the Silver Chalice allegedly his worse. He reminded me of the 1960's cartoon commercial character for Frido's Corn Chips the Frido Bandido. He has on heavy stage makeup so he is hardly recognizable and his accent sounds quite fake. The real problem is that this is not a leading man role but a role for a character actor. There were probably hundreds of out of work Spanish speaking actors in Hollywood at this time who could have done the role better.William Shatner isn't playing to the 23rd row he is playing to the 46th row. As a priest who has lost his faith he has one pained look throughout the movie. One of the nice things about Shatner is how relaxed and animated he is in all his roles from the Twilight Zone to Star Trek to Boston Legal. Here he is the opposite restrained to the point of being a cartoon cutout.Claire Bloom and Laurence Harvey also give mundane and forgettable performances.For cinema fans this is worth seeing because it is a Martin Ritt film and he was a terrific director. However like every great director he had his misfires and this is one of them. It is watchable but much more should have been delivered considering the classical source material.".

With a twist during every tale you won't know who to trust! And you'll be talking about the ending long after the credits roll trust me.";

It wasn't as bad as I expected.  I agree with an earlier comment that the final retelling is pretty funny.I teach Rashomon in my History of Film course.  I realize that many western students just can't fully appreciate much of the Japanese culture packed into Kurosawa's work. I'd love to figure a way to show Rashomon and The Outrage backtoback.   The better students might appreciate the artistry of Kurosawa a bit more the lunkheads might finally figure out what was going on. At least a couple of idiots each term seem to think the wife and the medium in Rashomon are the same woman.

All fine and good but it's a danged selfdestructive way to tell a story. Especially when James Wong Howe's apocalyptic visuals those raindrenched scenes at the isolated train station are almost Blade Runnerish in their darkness and despair are gearing you up from the first moment for some grimly powerful examination of evil.The sad fact is that Laurence Harvey and Claire Bloom as the victimized husband and wife at the heart of the film do not come across as terribly noteworthy or distinctive. You keep waiting for some explosive revelation that might account for the idealistic Parson played by William Shatner  young and freshfaced but overlymannered even then to be so shattered by the incident that he loses his faith but no luck. Edward G.

I personally think Kurosawa's film is a masterpiece and one of the greatest films ever made but I was interested in this remake to see what they'd do. In all honesty this film is extremely lazy in all forms. Newman plays a Mexican bandit who is the prime suspect in the murder of a rich man Laurence Harvey. It's strange that Newman would be so busy in the Civil Rights movement at the time this was released yet he didn't have a problem playing a painted Mexican. His performance is actually pretty good with the exception of his accent which comes across so thick that it's hard to understand at times. Some stereotypical Mexican dialogue doesn't serve too well though. Harvey is also good in his role as is Claire Bloom who plays his wife. Robinson is an old con man who hears the three different stories from people at a train station. I think an American remake could have worked but this isn't the film. The movie is lazy from start to finish and that includes some stupid Indian customs thrown in to try and make the film more mystical.".

The last 8 to 10 minutes were more like 3 StoogesLaurel  Hardy slapstick comedy sliding down a waterfall into a pond and spitting water...c'mon!I did enjoy the scenery around Tucson and the music was pretty good also. The rest of it left me scratching my head. This is a movie I had timerrecorded to DVD and did not watch for quite a while since recording it so it is in my collection. I have real doubts it will ever get another watch by me.And what's up with the baby? Did the writers just say Hey this ought to work for something?It's a pity too because with de Silva Newman Bloom Robinson...these are actors I really like. They could have made a much better movie.I rarely give less than 5 stars but this one only rates 4 from me.jonesey65244".

But don't the actors have some sort of inkling as to how poor a picture is while they are making it?I've never been one for flashback movies but this one with several different versions of the flashback is just too much.There were a couple good pieces of acting such as when Bloom accused her husband of cowardice but they were too few to carry the movie. The last 8 to 10 minutes were more like 3 StoogesLaurel  Hardy slapstick comedy sliding down a waterfall into a pond and spitting water...c'mon!I did enjoy the scenery around Tucson and the music was pretty good also. The rest of it left me scratching my head. This is a movie I had timerrecorded to DVD and did not watch for quite a while since recording it so it is in my collection. I have real doubts it will ever get another watch by me.And what's up with the baby? Did the writers just say Hey this ought to work for something?It's a pity too because with de Silva Newman Bloom Robinson...these are actors I really like. They could have made a much better movie.I rarely give less than 5 stars but this one only rates 4 from me.jonesey65244";

	schema:reviewBody "Having never seen Rashomon I'm at bit of a disadvantage in writing about The Outrage. Nevertheless it's an attempt at something a little more unusual than the average western. As even the beating of Rodney King caught on videotape was successfully challenged in a court of law what does that say about eye witness testimony? The Outrage is the story of an incident on a western trail that left a traveler dead and his wife ravaged by a bandit on the run.Rashomon the film is only the grandfather of The Outrage. It was first adapted as a Broadway play with Rod Steiger and Noel Willman playing the roles that Paul Newman and Laurence Harvey have on screen. It ran for 159 performances in the 1959 season and Claire Bloom who was Mrs. Rod Steiger at the time was the only one to repeat her role. Rod Steiger would have been a far better choice to repeat for the screen and he certainly has the screen name recognition. Newman was better box office but Steiger was far better at playing all kinds of ethnic types.Added to the screen are the characters of Edward G. Robinson and William Shatner playing a conman and a disillusioned minister whose conversations with prospector Howard DaSilva provide a kind of narrative framework for the proceedings. DaSilva provides one of four versions of the events. All we know for certain is that Claire Bloom got violated by Paul Newman and Laurence Harvey wound up dead. At Newman's trial he and Bloom provide differing accounts of what happened. An old Indian medicine man played by Paul Fix came upon a dying Laurence Harvey and Fix repeats it for the court. And then DaSilva tells Shatner and Robinson yet another version of the same events.Bloom is a southern belle not quite of the upper crust she married well and she does her best to imitate the behavior of one of the upper crust no doubt taking Scarlett O'Hara as her model. Laurence Harvey is Ashley Wilkes had he married a road show version of Scarlett instead of Melanie Hamilton. Repeating her performance from Broadway I'd say Claire was the best one in this film.The conclusion was most unsatisfactory in my humble opinion the focus could have and should have stayed on the three protagonists not on the witnesses. Still The Outrage is definitely a most adult western.".

	schema:reviewBody "Without knowing it before hand as soon as the movie started I had a definite feeling that this was a remake of the 1950 Kurosawa film Rashomon. I thought the opening scene was great almost like a horror movie in some respects with the sinister storm and dark atmosphere. Within moments characters portrayed by William Shatner Howard da Silva and Edward G. Robinson appear on screen whetting my appetite for an effectively offbeat story. Robinson's character is described as the 'Con Man' and probably has the best dialog in the picture when he's challenging what passes for status quo thinking in the Old West of the 1870's.I had to go back and read my own review of the Rashomon picture because I knew there was something that bothered me about it when I first saw it. Kurosawa's pacing is sometimes too laborious for me though it surprised me that this treatment was actually a few minutes longer. And for anyone who thinks Paul Newman's performance as the bandit Carracas is over the top you'll really have to see Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune. His characterization of the bandit Tajomaru is so manic it makes Newman's role look tame by comparison.In most other respects the story is almost exactly the same with the three principals involved in the murder of a Southern gentleman and the rape of his wife all telling a different story. Told in a flashback style among the characters who opened the picture one is constantly left questioning which of the narratives is valid and whether the people involved have a spark of dignity or honor among them. This carries right through to the finale when the old prospector Da Silva is hauled up short by the Con Man for being as disreputable as the ones who testified at the trial of Carracas.I guess if one has the means to do so you might try watching both films one after the other. When I first watched Rashomon I had to rewind some scenes for clarification as the characters seemed more esoteric and difficult to follow. I didn't have the same reaction to The Outrage but that could be because I already knew the basic story. I also have a preference for Westerns so that's part of the equation as well. Both pictures merit the same rating by my count though for it's more familiar players I prefer this Martin Ritt directed version.".

Miyazaki proves once again that she is one of the most gifted and talented of Japan's young acting elite.Adapted from Asano Inio's acclaimed and popular Shogakukan's Weekly Young Sunday manga of the same name the film follows the uncertain future of its young protagonist Inoue Meiko Miyazaki Aoi who is a twentysomething OL Office Lady working in the urban jungle of Tokyo. She has been living in Tokyo since moving from the countryside to attend university. She is currently in a longterm serious relationship with college sweetheart Taneda Naruo Kora Kengo a tall and lanky fellow country bumpkin who has come to Tokyo with dreams of starting a band and making it big. Together with college buddies drummer Yamada Jiro AKA Billie Kiritani Kenta and bassist Kato Kenichi AKA Debu real life JRock SampoMaster's band member Kondo Yoichi they have been playing small clubs for a number of years.Growing increasingly frustrated with the boredom at work Meiko makes a fateful decision to quit her steady job to try and find a more meaningful opportunity in life much to Taneda's chagrin. Uptonow Taneda has been relying on Meiko's income to help pay the bills aside from his infrequent band gigs Taneda's sole source of income comes from his freeterparttime job as a graphic artist at a small publishing company. Taneda decides to take his music more seriously and makes a push at getting his band discovered and getting a music contract.Taneda produces a single called Solanin a weepy rock ballad that he hopes will get his band noticed the name is a play off of the word SoraSky and NinPeople and is interpreted as those who reach for the sky i.e. go after their dreams.Out of the dozen record companies that they solicited only one responds back to their demo submission. Yet when Taneda Billie and Meiko go meet with the record producer they are told that they only want them to sign up as a backup band for one of their upandcoming pop idols.His confidence shattered Taneda falls into a deep depression. He ends his relationship with Meiko and disappears for a month. After one last phone call to Meiko Taneda commits suicide by running his moped past a red light and getting into a deadly traffic accident.Devastated by Taneda's death Meiko also falls into a deep depression but thanks to the comfort and support of college friend Kotani Ai the beautiful Ito Ayumi Meiko is inspired to learn to play the guitar and continue Taneda's goal. Along with Billie and Kato Meiko sets off to make Taneda's dream a reality.Takahiro's film follows a number of other similar chase a dream music themed movies including Otani Kentaro's Nana2005 Honda Ryuichi's GS Wonderland 2008 and most recently Kobayashi Takeshi's Bandage 2010 to name only a few but unfortunately doesn't quite really set itself apart from these films let alone match their brilliance. Screenwriter Takahashi Izumi's adaptation of Asano Inio's original story may be a good interpretation of the source material but the film itself covers much of the same ground as other better films and unfortunately comes off as yet another tired overly sentimental and melodramatic teen drama.As mentioned Miyazaki Aoi Gaichu Nana SuKiDa is great as Meiko and does a commendable job of elevating the material from boring romance to heartwarming and inspiring drama. Miyazaki not only does a good job of making Meiko a real person but also a credible musician Miyazaki actually learned to play guitar and sing for this role.The supporting cast is also very likable and charming. Kora Kengo Bandage Sad Vacation seems to enjoy playing the tortured soul part and excels at it here. Kiritani Kenta Crows Zero Series Rookies 69 also is typecasted again as a tough but lovable punk. Musician Kondo Yoichi is pretty charming in his role as jovial Kato and his comedy bits are hilarious. Gorgeous Ito Ayumi Bandage Swallowtail Butterflyis again given a nice supporting role but I wish she would be given the chance to headline a film for once as she is a decent actress.The music is another highlight especially the main Solanin theme performed by JRock band Asian KungFu Generation.While the film itself is pretty disappointing from a story standpoint the only other saving grace about the film aside from Miyazaki Aoi's acting is the beautiful and stunning cinematography by Kondo Ryuto. His deep long shots of the Tokyo skyline awash in blue sky are simply magnificent and breathtaking.Miyazaki is definitely a true talent and hopefully she will get more of the recognition she deserves for her work and maybe we will even get to see her in Hollywood as I see her as being just as talented if not more so than either Kikuchi RinkoBabelor Kuriyama Chiaki Battle Royale Exte Kill Bill Vol. 1.".

	onyx:emotionText "Miki Takahiro's youth oriented film Solanin Sky People is a trite melodrama that is wrought with tired clich but is elevated from mediocre status by the sheer power of Miyazaki Aoi's touching performance. Miyazaki proves once again that she is one of the most gifted and talented of Japan's young acting elite.Adapted from Asano Inio's acclaimed and popular Shogakukan's Weekly Young Sunday manga of the same name the film follows the uncertain future of its young protagonist Inoue Meiko Miyazaki Aoi who is a twentysomething OL Office Lady working in the urban jungle of Tokyo. She has been living in Tokyo since moving from the countryside to attend university. She is currently in a longterm serious relationship with college sweetheart Taneda Naruo Kora Kengo a tall and lanky fellow country bumpkin who has come to Tokyo with dreams of starting a band and making it big.

	schema:reviewBody "An OK movie that could have easily been better.Solanin is a 2010 Japanese movie that's a standard young adults growing up while in a music band tale. it wasn't terrible but it could and should have been a lot better. It's brought down by two main problems. First this movie is too long and could have definitely used a second pass through the edit room because it tends to drag and become dull in several scenes. The second problem is the primary issue and it almost kills the movie altogether and I'll get to that problem in a moment.SPOILERS AHEAD!This movie basically revolves around two main characters a wannabe musician and his live in girlfriend. The rest of the supporting cast is rounded out by their friends band mates and a few other characters. The entire supporting cast is fairly decent and they all do a capable enough job here. The lead actress and primary star of the film is very good in her role as the supportive and dependable girlfriend she's an attractive and talented actress and her character here is likable cute and charming throughout.The lead actor's character however is about as enjoyable as eating dirt and this is what ruins this film. Here's a description of his character he's a boring selfish childish lazy inept aimless indecisive insensitive unreliable mooch. He's also the lead singer guitarist  song writer for the band unfortunately he doesn't sing or play the guitar well at any point during the entire film and he never sticks to the lyrics he wrote or music he composed either. Does that about sum him up for you?...if you think I'm exaggerating watch the movie and tell me otherwise!There is literally nothing to like about the lead character of this movie at all. If this character were a real life person he would not have any friends his band mates would have kicked him out of the band years ago when they realized how talentless he was and he probably wouldn't have any girlfriends that would have stuck by him for any length of time.Despite the total disdain the entire supporting cast of characters should have for the lead character they all somehow think he's this good guy and they all seem somewhat dependent upon him for their happiness and sense of direction in life to varying degrees. These characters are all fairly directionless in life as well but they all look like Steve Jobs compared to the lead character. I had so much contempt for this lead character that I was openly rooting for him to get hit by a bus or something halfway through the movie so we could start focusing on the far more interesting and likable members of the cast which is everyone else in the entire movie. Then a miracle happens the main character SPOILERS actually does get hit by a bus or car or something and dies. I guess he committed suicide but you can't tell if that was really his intention because he can't ever make up his mind on whether he wants to commit to doing something or not.At this point the movie chooses to follow the clich ridden method of having everyone come to terms with the loss of their friend by working towards playing his music on stage. It's blatantly obvious that this is the perfect impetus everyone needs in order to move forward with their lives however they could have all just easily mourned his death in their own individual ways and then just moved on in life without all this nonsense. But this is band movie after all so we can't have that can we?All in all there is decent enough amount of stuff to like in this movie to some extent but I can't give it a definitively positive recommendation because of the unjustly deserved weight this movie places on the main actor's character simply put he's not nearly amiable enough for the viewer to truly connect with why the people he left behind felt he was so emotionally meaningful to their lives. This movie would have benefited greatly by making this character either MUCH less of a douche or killing him off MUCH earlier in the film before the viewer got to the point of outright hating him and questioning why the rest of the cast of characters didn't hate him also.6 out of 10 stars!".

Everything has already been said about this great film n there seems to be little left to say but as a fan of western films lemme contribute by praising how good this film is. The single greatest asset is the wonderful cinematography. The mountains the lakes the hills farms n houses all looked straight outta poetry n painting. Loyal Griggs did an amazing work with the film's cinematography. The story is about a mysterious gunfighter Alan Ladd who helps a farming family against cattle barons wanting the farmers land. Jack Palance in a role of pure malevolence with his evil smirk n few dialogues. George Stevens' direction is truly stunning. He made a very touching film. This film has contributed a lot towards the western genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Shane' is not a Western like Howard Hawk's 'Red River' nor a meditation on history and character like John Ford's The Searchers. It is the most tasteful achievement ever invented to create a legend an instant myth... Only Stevens' meticulously picturesque visuals and his evident desire to treat Western as art could have mastered the archetypal simplicity and vitality of 'Shane.'In 'Shane' the good and evil govern Stevens' mastery of technique... With his golden good looks his calm authority and his almost magical magnetism Alan Ladd is the mysterious lone rider called Shane... His antithesis  a sinister figure all in sable  and enemy a merciless gunfighter from the Cheyenne area named Jack Wilson Jack Palance. Wilson is dark dresses in black and even drinks black coffee from a dark black pot... Shane sparkles with personality and presence... Wilson spreads menace and evil... Shane is 'the fastest gun alive' who shoots to kill only when it is inevitable... Wilson  wearing two guns and walking with jangling spurs  is a psychopath and a sadist a man totally without moral redemption...The film controls that mystical force that runs like a fine thread through a Western story  the mysterious gunslinger who rides into town at exactly the right moment that history requires him fulfills his destiny and then rides on...There is novelty and charm in 'Shane' because the stranger who appears from nowhere is a man of exceptional quality admired by a wonderful kid with bright face and resolute boyish ways... Shane tests the spirit of this little eight yearold boy Joey Starrett Brandon De Wilde in the midst of all the tensions and excitements on that open range... What is admirable about Shane is not his skill with his gun but his restraint in using it... Shane knows that Joey is admiring him for the wrong reasons even though he knows that if he kills Wilson he'll have to leave the valley... He tells Joey 'There's no living with a killing.' However we want him to show Joey how brave and fast he is... The ultimate confrontation in that depressed and faint saloon gives the movie the quality of a fine album of paintings of the frontier...Joey's plaintive call 'Come back Shane' is the famous cry of all the audience for a mythical idolized hero so complete and correct who would not permit himself to be admired by a boy for living by the gun... The closing scenes remain among the most haunting memories in the history of cinema...The characters that Stevens' actors have drawn might be considered portraits of familiar frontier typesMarian Starrett Jean Arthur is the mother who criticizes Shane for initiating her young boy into young manhood by passing on his values... She is the little woman unsettled who always wanders 'What are you fighting for? She is the married woman who reveals an unspoken love...Joe Starrett Van Heflin is the stubborn father and a hard working rancher determined with his forcible patience and fortitude to build a life on the land for his family...Rufus Ryker Emile Meyer is the evil aging cattle rancher who considers the arrival of homesteaders is reducing grazing opportunities for his herds limiting their access to water... He does everything to rid the land of the humble farmers...Morgan Ryker John Dierkes is Rufus' brotherforeman who invites Starrett to talk reasonably... Chris Calloway Ben Johnson is the authentic cowboy who has had a change of heart and has quit Ryker's bunch... He warns Shane in the barn that Starrett is up against a stacked deck.Frank 'Stonewall' Torrey Elisha Cook Jr. is the paleeyed pathetic local farmer who in a fit of fury and mad courage attempts to challenge his tormentor... But an outraged amateur can never beat an accomplished professional... He is brutally gunned down in the first shocking and horrific showdown on the Western screen... Palance toys with the little man and kills him in one of the most realistic scenes staged until that time... Shane is an immensely beautiful film stunningly photographed in color rich in memorable and exhilarating moments... Every scene is composed with extreme careThe deer will raise its head and frame the oncoming rider perfectly between the branches of his antlers...Shane's first appearance descending into a majestic valley rimmed by mountains shining a pearlhandled 'sixshooter' gun...Shane friendship with Joe Starrett cemented that evening as together they swing axes in common task to cut and pull up a large tree stump...Their energy battle filmed through the windows of the cabin and through the frantic kicking hooves of horses disturbed by their vicious struggle to determine who will go to town to face Ryker's hired gun... Shane slow ride into town for a showdown... The low tracking camera angle the darkness and the musical soundtrack emphasize Shane's heroic yet lonely position on the horizon set among the wide view of the mountains...Certainly Shane is a romantic film and yet it is full of integrity about time and place... It may be interesting to compare the idealized interest attraction and love between Shane and Marion with the unspoken love between John Wayne and Dorothy Jordan in 'The Searchers.' In the latter film Dorothy caresses Wayne's army cape and is observed by Ward Bond who simply notices her gesture and looks away... In 'Shane' Marion implies her love for Shane as she cautions her son Joey about becoming attached to him...In Shane Stevens combined so many elements that are 'classically' required and combines them so well He directed 'Shane' with great feeling and turned it into a classic...".

With his golden good looks his calm authority and his almost magical magnetism Alan Ladd is the mysterious lone rider called Shane... His antithesis  a sinister figure all in sable  and enemy a merciless gunfighter from the Cheyenne area named Jack Wilson Jack Palance. Wilson is dark dresses in black and even drinks black coffee from a dark black pot... Shane sparkles with personality and presence... Wilson spreads menace and evil... Shane is 'the fastest gun alive' who shoots to kill only when it is inevitable... Wilson  wearing two guns and walking with jangling spurs  is a psychopath and a sadist a man totally without moral redemption...The film controls that mystical force that runs like a fine thread through a Western story  the mysterious gunslinger who rides into town at exactly the right moment that history requires him fulfills his destiny and then rides on...There is novelty and charm in 'Shane' because the stranger who appears from nowhere is a man of exceptional quality admired by a wonderful kid with bright face and resolute boyish ways... Shane tests the spirit of this little eight yearold boy Joey Starrett Brandon De Wilde in the midst of all the tensions and excitements on that open range... What is admirable about Shane is not his skill with his gun but his restraint in using it... Shane knows that Joey is admiring him for the wrong reasons even though he knows that if he kills Wilson he'll have to leave the valley... He tells Joey 'There's no living with a killing.' However we want him to show Joey how brave and fast he is... The ultimate confrontation in that depressed and faint saloon gives the movie the quality of a fine album of paintings of the frontier...Joey's plaintive call 'Come back Shane' is the famous cry of all the audience for a mythical idolized hero so complete and correct who would not permit himself to be admired by a boy for living by the gun... The closing scenes remain among the most haunting memories in the history of cinema...The characters that Stevens' actors have drawn might be considered portraits of familiar frontier typesMarian Starrett Jean Arthur is the mother who criticizes Shane for initiating her young boy into young manhood by passing on his values... She is the little woman unsettled who always wanders 'What are you fighting for? She is the married woman who reveals an unspoken love...Joe Starrett Van Heflin is the stubborn father and a hard working rancher determined with his forcible patience and fortitude to build a life on the land for his family...Rufus Ryker Emile Meyer is the evil aging cattle rancher who considers the arrival of homesteaders is reducing grazing opportunities for his herds limiting their access to water... He does everything to rid the land of the humble farmers...Morgan Ryker John Dierkes is Rufus' brotherforeman who invites Starrett to talk reasonably... Chris Calloway Ben Johnson is the authentic cowboy who has had a change of heart and has quit Ryker's bunch... He warns Shane in the barn that Starrett is up against a stacked deck.Frank 'Stonewall' Torrey Elisha Cook Jr. is the paleeyed pathetic local farmer who in a fit of fury and mad courage attempts to challenge his tormentor... But an outraged amateur can never beat an accomplished professional... He is brutally gunned down in the first shocking and horrific showdown on the Western screen... Palance toys with the little man and kills him in one of the most realistic scenes staged until that time... Shane is an immensely beautiful film stunningly photographed in color rich in memorable and exhilarating moments... Every scene is composed with extreme careThe deer will raise its head and frame the oncoming rider perfectly between the branches of his antlers...Shane's first appearance descending into a majestic valley rimmed by mountains shining a pearlhandled 'sixshooter' gun...Shane friendship with Joe Starrett cemented that evening as together they swing axes in common task to cut and pull up a large tree stump...Their energy battle filmed through the windows of the cabin and through the frantic kicking hooves of horses disturbed by their vicious struggle to determine who will go to town to face Ryker's hired gun... Shane slow ride into town for a showdown... The low tracking camera angle the darkness and the musical soundtrack emphasize Shane's heroic yet lonely position on the horizon set among the wide view of the mountains...Certainly Shane is a romantic film and yet it is full of integrity about time and place... It may be interesting to compare the idealized interest attraction and love between Shane and Marion with the unspoken love between John Wayne and Dorothy Jordan in 'The Searchers.' In the latter film Dorothy caresses Wayne's army cape and is observed by Ward Bond who simply notices her gesture and looks away... In 'Shane' Marion implies her love for Shane as she cautions her son Joey about becoming attached to him...In Shane Stevens combined so many elements that are 'classically' required and combines them so well He directed 'Shane' with great feeling and turned it into a classic...";

	schema:reviewBody "Shane should be required viewing for anyone setting out to make a film. It tells its story visually through subtext and creates a realistic portrait of people it is also emotionally and morally complex.  It is never stated that Shane had been a gunfighter we just understand this from his appearance and from what we glean through the dialogue.  Likewise there are no overt moments of intimacy between Shane and Marion Mrs. Starrett but we are aware that there is a deep attraction between them.  When Joe Marian's husband realizes it it is not because of anything he states just a line at the 4th of July party when Marian in her wedding dress is dancing with Shane  Looks like I'm fenced out and what is spoken as a joke becomes serious as we watch the expression on his face.  The closest he comes to actually saying anything is toward the end when he's going to ride into town to face Ryker and tells Marian that if anything happens to him he knows she'll be taken care of.  Likewise at the end of the film when little Joey is calling across the plains for Shane to come back he yells to Shane Mother wants you I know she does and the words echo back we see a close up of Joey his expression changing and we know the child realizes too that Shane does or could mean something more to his mother.Stevens also didn't make the bad guys blackandwhite villains.  We understand that these men fought and tamed the land and are now being displaced by the homesteaders.  What they want might not be fair but it is not completely unreasonable either.Most of the scenes even the simple ones play in montage.  It looks as though Stevens shot each scene from about 15 different angles and edited them together.  The effect is striking.Far and away one of the best films ever.".

	schema:headline " A masterpiece of filmmaking";
	schema:reviewBody "Often mentioned as one of the greatest westerns ever it is easy to see why. This film stands as a masterpiece of the art even more so since it was filmed so long ago.  It starts with a great story the story of Shane Alan Ladd a quiet gunslinger who is trying to escape his past and befriends a pioneer family who have settled out west.  He attempts to settle down and become a hired hand to Joe Starrett Van Heflin and his wife Marian Jean Arthur but the ranchers who need to drive cattle through the homesteader's property are attempting to drive them out.  Shane tries to stay out of the disputes but keeps being drawn in and is finally compelled to put his six shooter back on when the ranchers hire Jack Wilson Jack Palance a noted gunfighter to intimidate the farmers.This story is outstanding in so many ways.  It is a classic battle of good and evil.  It has its share of fist fights and shoot outs but this film is more about principles than action.  It exemplifies principles and values that unfortunately have become outdated in today's society such as character integrity loyalty pride in accomplishment persistence and the willingness to fight for what is right.  It is also an excellent human interest story and succeeds in getting the viewer to love the homesteaders and hate the ranchers.George Stevens directed this film late in a notable career and does a splendid job.  The locations were breathtaking shot with majestic mountains in the background of almost every scene.  The cinematography was stunning and the color rich despite the fact that it was filmed almost 50 years ago.The acting was superlative.  Van Heflin wins us over almost immediately with his high minded principles and unshakeable character.  He actually has far more lines than Ladd who was more of an icon of strength than a vocal character.  Jack Palance is the archetypal western villain and went on in his career to become the most prominent and enduring villain in movie history.  His sneering arrogance and haughty gait made him the villain we loved to hate for decades.Elisha Cook as Stonewall Torrey had a prolific career as a supporting actor with over 150 appearances in film an TV that spanned almost 60 years. This is one of his best an most memorable roles as a fearless proud and petulant former confederate that gets goaded into a gunfight with Jack Palance.  Brandon DeWilde as young Joey gave a compelling performance.  One of the best scenes in the movie was when he asked Shane to shoot at a small rock and Shane shot it 5 or 6 times and hit it every time.  The wide eyed look of surprise was terrific.   Though he went on to do about a dozen mostly minor films he was never able to capitalize on his success in this role.Finally there is Alan Ladd.  I've often heard criticisms of his performance of being too low key.  I could not disagree more.  His understated performance made him loom large as an imposing figure in the film.  It created an almost godlike presence.  This strong silent portrayal is very attractive adding humility to his many positive qualities.  This unassuming style is also what made Gary Cooper so popular.This film is on my top fifty list of all time.  It is a magnum opus that the film industry can be proud of.  It combines great filmmaking direction and acting with a memorable and morally instructive story.  This should be required viewing for any serious film buff.  A perfect 10.".

	schema:headline " Shane is a beautifully photographed film with excellent performances.";
	schema:reviewBody "Shane is an awesome film.  Loyal Griggs' cinematography uses the Grand Teton Mountains as a scenic backdrop in framing a simple story of ranchers vs. homesteaders in early Wyoming.  Alan Ladd stars as the enigmatic gunfighter named Shane.  Ladd has seldom been better.  He sides with a homesteader family Van Heflin Jean Arthur and Brandon DeWilde against local ranchers named Ryker Elisha Meyer and John Dierkes.  The Rykers hire a gunfighter Jack Palance from Cheyenne to drive off the homesteaders.  Shane tries to put down his gun and start a new life but the plot inevitably forces him to a fateful climax with the Rykers and the hired gun.The film has a darkly realistic look.  Grafton's saloon is dark and moody far different from the brightly lit and colorful dance halls in other Westerns.  The film is alternately bright and dark.  The sadistic killing of the homesteader by the gunfighter is a dark moment even though it occurs in broad daylight.  Director George Stevens took advantage of an afternoon thunderstorm and plenty of mud to make one of the most memorable scenes in the movie.  The thunder provides an appropriate backdrop to the confrontation between Torrey Elisha Cook Jr. and the gunfighter.  This is little more than an execution and the gunfighter goes about his business with a cool detached professionalism.  Although small Jack Palance's performance as the gunfighter from Cheyenne is one of the most memorable in the film.Shane's background provides plenty of questions but few answers. Where will you go Marian Starret Jean Arthur asks.  One place or another. ..someplace I've never been Shane says.  All we know is that he's a gunfighter.  It becomes clear that he knows about gunfighting.  He's even heard of the gunfighter hired by Ryker.  Chris Calloway Ben Johnson and another cowboy are playing cards in Grafton's saloon when Shane walks in. Calloway starts to pick a fight.  The other man gets up and says Deal me out. . .Let's just say I'm superstitious.  Does he know Shane?  More than likely he does but we'll never know for sure.  Shane's mysteriousness is one of the film's strengths.This is a film about personal relationships.  Shane and Joe Starret Van Heflin become friends.  The relationship between Shane and Marian Starret defies description.  Is it love?  Respect?  Whatever it is it becomes clear in the late moments of the film that her husband has observed it too. There is also a close bond between Shane and Little Joe Starret Brandon DeWilde.  The film is told through the eyes of the boy.This is a film about good and evil but good and evil sometimes overlap. Jack Palance represents evil.  His black hat black gloves and black vest leave little doubt which side he's on.  The Rykers are bad but they are not all bad.  Rufe Emile Meyer tries to make a deal with Starret and speaks with sincerity and feeling about his right to the range. The homesteaders are good but one of them Torrey is a hot head.  Shane is a good guy.  Or is he?  Marian Starret tells him in one memorable scene that she won't be happy until all the guns are out of the valleyeven yours.  Shane realizes this.  Despite his attempts to start a new life he tells Brandon DeWilde after the final showdown at Grafton's  Tell your mother that there are no more guns in the valley.The image of death stalks through this film in many forms.  The scene where the gunfighter rides into town makes it clear that he is the messenger of death.  Shane tells Marian Starret that a gun is a tool but she knows that it is an engine of death.  Guns aren't going to be my boys life she says.  The scene where Shane shows Little Joe how to shoot demonstrates the power of the gun.  The shooting of the homesteader in the dark muddy street is followed by his burial in a cemetery on a bright sunny day set against the grandeur of the mountains.  In the final frame Shane rides out of the valley and through that same cemetery.  Death once again rides a horse.I really enjoy Victor Young's musical score.  The opening melody Call of the Faraway Hills has been frequently recorded and is only a little less familiar than The Magnificent Seven.  It is unfortunate that noone has seen fit to make the score for this film available to collectors.  I keep hoping.Shane is a memorable film with fine performances.  The story of cattlemen vs. homesteaders is a familiar one but it is told here with originality and feelings.  The characters whether good or bad are vivid and deep. I'll never get tired of watching it.  I only wish they'd make a widescreen version available.".

Those sounds have lived in my mind for decades.Shane is a classic  no not a bangbang shootemup B Western but it is a solid Western that gives fans of the genre some something to think about besides they went thataway. The scenery Jackson Hole Wyoming is grand and was even moreso on the big screen. When well known Western novelist A.B. Guthrie wrote the screenplay he kept fairly faithful to Jack Schaefer's novel. The movie makes a reasonable attempt for that time to look authentic in costume and gear and gives fans of the movies of the '40s and '50s some interesting cinematic moments see the small things like how the camera was used to make Alan Ladd seem more heroic.I'd probably recast some of the secondary roles if I had the chance but Ladd's softspoken gentlemanly way is just right for Shane and Jack Palance is subtly evil.Yes Shane contains a few clichs but they weren't yet quite so clich in 1953. Besides they were well done clichs so while you may recognize them you probably won't mind them.But what's Shane about exactly?...Courage. Loyalty. Honor.

	schema:reviewBody "Considered by most a masterpiece and by a few 'a waste of film' 1953's SHANE is a miniepic that tells of the arrival of the mysterious stranger who comes to 'town' and impresses the innocent and threatens the guilty. A good versus evil western was never been more defined. Alan Ladd plays the stranger in an outfit that has been criticized since dayone. He wears a buckskin shirt ala Davy Crockett and if I heard it once I heard it a thousand times that shirt ain't right! Well 'pards I ask you Have you ever heard of Buckskin Frank Leslie? Just happens to be one of the baddestass real life western gunslingers who ever strapped on a gunrig. Why they haven't made westerns about Leslie I will never know. Doc Holliday known for reckless bravery knew enough to stay out of Frank's way. And P.S. he was known for his 'patented' Buckskin Shirt. But I digress...Shane was directed by George Stevens who admittedly directs with a strictness that borders on fascism. And yet he pulls it off with aplomb. Ladd's character is criticized as well because he is played by Ladd himself an actor that is an easy target for certain critics. There's the old joke about Ladd standing in a hole outside of camera view to match the heights of his leading ladies or by standing on a ramp or box so their heights in closeups would be matched for love scenes. Is this the 'stuff' of western heroes? Not hardly. So here we have little Alan taking on one of the most vicious actors that ever played 'Satan Incarnate' the incomparable Jack Palance! Jack's 'Lucifer' is a messenger from hell hired by the bad'uns to save them all from Ladd's goodness. Jack wakes up shortly after arriving in town to assassinate another little man Elisha Cook Jr. in a scene which was completely and shamelessly ripped off by Eastwood in 'Pale Rider'. The death is completely believable and establishes Palance's character as unstoppable.The characters in Shane are cut from a woodcarving they glisten with familiar yet surprising motivations. Ben Johnson the Sainted actor of westerns plays a very small part that almost steals the film. The bad guys in this film are a textbook rendition of meaness.But some say that the action is subdued in Shane. But I say the buildup is worth the wait as the final climatic shootout has been described by many western film scholars as the best that was ever put to film.Shane a waste of film? I think not.".

	onyx:emotionText "Considered by most a masterpiece and by a few 'a waste of film' 1953's SHANE is a miniepic that tells of the arrival of the mysterious stranger who comes to 'town' and impresses the innocent and threatens the guilty. A good versus evil western was never been more defined. Alan Ladd plays the stranger in an outfit that has been criticized since dayone. He wears a buckskin shirt ala Davy Crockett and if I heard it once I heard it a thousand times that shirt ain't right! Well 'pards I ask you Have you ever heard of Buckskin Frank Leslie? Just happens to be one of the baddestass real life western gunslingers who ever strapped on a gunrig. Why they haven't made westerns about Leslie I will never know. Doc Holliday known for reckless bravery knew enough to stay out of Frank's way. And P.S. he was known for his 'patented' Buckskin Shirt.

	schema:reviewBody "After watching the massively depressing LOGAN 2017 and noticing that the closing scene pays homage to Shane same dialog used to mark Logan's grave I felt the need to do an update review on Shane.According to traditional Hollywood history Shane is one of the 100 greatest films of all time iconic and even the dialog is multilayered.There is a scene in the shortlived TV series THE OTHERS done by the same two men who created XFiles where one of the lead characters who is blind regularly goes to the movies to watch SHANE over and over. In many ways that has to be one of the grandest backhanded compliments you can pay to a film.I wish however to also suggest there is a great deal of hidden irony in what otherwise appears to be a straightforward western.For example Ladd hated guns and according to film legend Wikipedia had to do over 100 takes in the iconic scene where he teaches the boy to draw. Similarly Jack Palance hated horses and was only able to do one successful mount after many takes. Director Stevens had to use this same piece of film over and over even to the point of running the strip backwards to make it look like Jack was dismounting.Wait it gets better. Director Stevens hated violence and wanted SHANE to be be an antiviolence film. However the trope he invented for the gunfight where the actors were violently pulled backwards by ropes as bullets struck is considered by film historians to have forever changed the face of film action and led to an entirely new generation of gunfighting in films where the violence increased by a factor of 100X. Even the infamous Hong Kong action film directors consider they owe a debt to Stevens.The final irony is that in the opinion of this reviewer the film does not stand for what the screenwriter intended. To this reviewer Shane is a metaphor for the evolution of the United States itself an arc more visible when this review is penned in 2017 than in 1953. Although even in 1953 at the end of WW2 the US as a nation was having to face introspection as a nation which had hitherto prided itself on isolationism suddenly felt compelled to become policeman to the entire world.Still a great film. But also an ironic one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shane 1953 is about the enduring struggle of a group of 'homesteaders' fight to survive and build their families in the Valley of Wyoming. The Story focuses on the Starrett family which consists of Joe Marion his wife and Joey their beloved son. The eponymous character Shane is a retiring gunfighter who is riding into the valley and is trying to leave his mysterious and violent past behind him. When he enters the valley he is drawn to the Starrett home and as the film progresses he becomes increasingly interwoven into both their family life and their fight against Ryker who with the aid of others is trying to drive them from the valley he wants for himself.The apparent simplicity of Shane is very deceptive. Stevens artistry as a director infuses this film with an eminent aura of an Arthurian legend an outstanding quality that has resulted in it becoming one of the most imitated and revered westerns of all time. Its excellent depiction of the age old myth that is the mysterious wandering protector vs the evil bloodthirsty murderer is arguably one of the best in cinema. In his portrayal of Jack Wilson George Stevens has put to screen one of the most celebrated villains of cinema. His violent and sadistic nature is brought to the forefront in one of cinema's most shocking visions  the killing of 'stonewall' Torrey. The entire scene is both visually stunning and superbly choreographed a combination that runs throughout this film. The spectacular Valley floor and the surrounding Teton Mountains of Wyoming are brought to life by director of photography Loyal Griggs who received the films only Oscar although it received six nominations. Instead of using standard 25mm lenses that would make the mountains appear very distant Griggs used 75mm100mm telephoto lenses that draw the mountains in making their grandeur and beauty loom over the valley floor. This is apparent in many of the films beautiful scenes one of which is Torreys' funeral where the stunning landscapes of the valley are a backdrop to the sad and moving scene. This is just one example of the artistry at work in Shane a film that boasts a wealth of Beautiful photography.The characterisation in Shane is wonderful. The film never tries to make us connect with the characters using forced dialogue. We get glimpses of their qualities and see their detailed reactions to what goes on and what is said. This is part of the way we get to know people in real life. This quality that runs throughout the film imbues the deep connection we feel with the characters and the understanding we have of them. Shane is a film that leaves a lot up to the audience and part of the pleasure is seeing a look or a reaction from one of the characters that we are able to understand and read into.Joeys' fascination for Shane's gun mirrors that of many adolescents and teenagers in society who love to run around and play with guns. However George Stevens wanted to dispel the glamorisation of the sixgun and to emphasise the destruction they cause. In order to convey this message Stevens actually had the sound of gunfire magnified on the soundtrack  a technique not previously attempted in mainstream cinema. Shane tells Joey just as he is about to ride off There's no living with a killing or a killer. His sentiments represent societies view on killing  no matter which way you cut it the use of violence cannot be an accepted value of society. Computer games today glamorise the use of guns and make causing destruction and bloodshed fun a trend which seems to reflect in cinema of today where the acceptable level of violence portrayed in films is greater than ever before. Shanes honest portrayal of the devastating effects of guns and its condemnation of violence is a message as relevant as ever.Shane has a heartrending and inspirational quality to it that elevates it above being 'just a western' and it becomes a fantastic mystical tale that deals with complex themes deep rooted in the fabric of society such as human nature family life the culture of the gun and identity. The films much debated and talked about ending is a testament to the great and lasting impact this film has had.".

Shane who bears a burden of remorse for a past life as a gunfighter does his best to renounce violence only to be forced against his best intentions to kill again. Because he is a good man and wise enough now to know that killing is terrible his heroism is extreme because he must bear not only the danger of fighting but also the pain of remorse even if he survives the fight. Wilson on the other hand is perfectly evil because he feels no remorse for killing. He enjoys it and is proud of his capacity to do it. Wilson has no soul.I am the only one I know who thinks this but I think that Shane has been mortally wounded at the end of the movie and is going off to die alone rather than let the boy Joey witness his death. Nobody else gets this out of the movie so maybe it's just me.".

They are like the jagged mountainscapes that dominate the picture A young boy slogging around in a marsh aims his toy gun on a deer grazing on some grass stems the deer lifts it's antlers and perfectly frames a lone rider approaching in the distance  a struggling family homestead held together by hard work the father splitting wood the mother baking in the kitchen and always the mountains jutting upwards away off in the distance.We have a stranger lean and handsome dressed in fringed buckskin.  His dress and gun belt suggest something other than a farmer or rancher yet we never really know or ever know of his past.  He is kind and modest and takes time to address the boy as though someone worth talking to You were watching me down the trail quite a spell weren't you.  I like a man who watches things going around.....He can make his mark someday.  the boy smiles up at him and an instant bond is formed an idol worship in the making.We have snickering troublesome ranchhands who spend any free hours swilling whiskey at Graftons General Merchantile.  I thought I smelled pig.  Which one of those tatterpickers are you working for? Or are you just squattin' on the range?  this is the kind of menace that dogsany farmer who dares to come into town.We have Shane although trying to lead the simple life of farming goaded into a fight by a sweatyfaced cowpoke Ben Johnson.   His bloodying of the cowpoke is like a violent ballet graceful and cutting.There is a meeting of the homesteaders huddled together by lamplight trying to solve there problems by resolving to go into town all together so that they would have strength in numbers.  This is a rather sad scene since WE know that will be in vain.There is touching elegance to the 4th of July celebration where there is fiddle music and dancing.  Shane and Marion the boy's mother take a few turns to a reel..... dancing with others in the corral.  Van Heflin the Boy's father is symbolically shut out beyond the fence. Marion they fenced me out he grins.  Yet we know that there is a growing affection between the two dancers.There is tension in the late evening when the head of the ranchers pays visit to the homestead.  Look Starrett. When I come to this country you weren't much older than your boy there........ How would you like to go partners with me.  It's sad because this is a real if clumsy attempt to be reasonable But as Shane would say on more than one occasion it's no use.I could go on the murder of the Stonewall at the hands of an especially evil hired gun from Cheyenne has great impact.  And the final confrontation at Graftons one fateful night is one of the best in Westerns.The characters are well developed and the story while exiting is a little melancholy.The best Western ever made.".

It's sad because this is a real if clumsy attempt to be reasonable But as Shane would say on more than one occasion it's no use.I could go on the murder of the Stonewall at the hands of an especially evil hired gun from Cheyenne has great impact.  And the final confrontation at Graftons one fateful night is one of the best in Westerns.The characters are well developed and the story while exiting is a little melancholy.The best Western ever made.";

	schema:reviewBody "A lonesome stranger rides on to a homesteader's farm looking for water and right after him comes the big cattle baron with several riders issuing the latest of several warning to this particular squatter about getting off 'his' range. Something about the man's bullying attitude rubs the stranger the wrong way and he decides to stay and lend a hand.So begins the classic western Shane which has entertained millions since its release in 1953. It gave Alan Ladd his career role and resulted in Oscar nominations for Jack Palance and Brandon DeWilde in the Best Supporting Actor category. It could have revived Alan Ladd's career but for a fatal career decision by his agentwife Sue Carol.Shane was shot in 1951 completely on location in the Grand Teton mountains in Wyoming. Another reviewer pointed out that director George Stevens seem to meticulously shoot the same scene from many angles. He did just that and spent a year editing his masterpiece.But in the mean time Sue Carol made a decision for her husband to leave Paramount and sign with Warner Brothers. Had she held out and waited for Shane's release she might have gotten a great deal from Paramount that might have included better parts. As it was Paramount had no reason to push this film at Oscar time so Ladd got no nomination for Best Actor which he could have with some studio backing. By the time Shane was out Ladd was with Warner Brothers and doing some of the same routine action adventures films that he was doing at Paramount. No classic roles for that man any more.The rancher versus homesteader is an old western plot story and there have been many films made from both points of view. Shane leaves no doubt that the homesteaders are in the right. The cattleman's point of view is eloquently argued in Elia Kazan's Sea of Grass by Spencer Tracy. That western icon John Wayne's been on both sides of the fence in McLintock he's a cattle baron in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance he's a small rancher and protector of the homesteader. Even Emile Meyer as Rufe Ryker does make a valid point that his kind settled the west when it was really wild. Van Heflin as Joe Starrett argues equally eloquently that doesn't give him the right to say no one else has any rights in the territory.Shane marked the farewell big screen performance of Jean Arthur. A talented but terribly strange woman with a whole lot of issues Arthur delivers a good performance as Van Heflin's missus. She felt she was miscast as a farmer's wife in westerns she saw herself more in the frontier woman roles she did in The Plainsman and Arizona. And at that she much preferred screwball comedy to any western. They weren't making her kind of films any more as she saw it so she left.When Shane's done doing what fate brought him to do in the valley he has to leave. For the community to grow there must be no more guns in the valley as he well realizes. So he leaves to an unknown fate living in the hearts and memories of the Starrett family and the rest of the small farmers especially young Brandon DeWilde.And in the hearts of all lovers of the western genre including this little cowpoke who saw him as a small lad on the big silver screen so many years ago.".

It certainly doesn't have the impact it did back then but it will always be considered by many as one of the great classics in film history certainly regarding Westerns.These classics particularly the westerns were good vehicles in promoting values and definite good vs. evil stories. The evil here is personified by Jack Palance. He doesn't have many lines but he doesn't need them. His body language in this film spoke volumes and he was one scary dude. Even the dog gets up and moves when Palance moves! However an unsung role eighth billing in the credits in here was the one by Emile Meyer who played the real villain in here Ryker. Palance was just called in at the end. A young Ben Johnson plays a member of his gang.Alan Ladd meanwhile is the hero the man who comes to the aid of family man Van Helflin his wife Jean Arthur and young son Brandon De Wilde. The kid De Wilde steals the film and made himself into a young star with his role here. Whether feverishly chewing on his candy while witnessing Ladd fighting the bad guys or his plaintiff cries for Shane! at the end of the film he made a memorable impression.The only overdone part  as seen in so many oldtime westerns  is the amount of punches people took blow after blow when in real life they would have knocked unconscious right off the bat! But that's part of the genre I guess.Shane was a forerunner of many of western that copied its successful formula. This movie was so famous that a lot of newborns were named Shane for awhile.Powerful is another adjective that describes this film  back then and still now. Great stuff!".

I could start by comparing it with High Noon a deserving and highlypraised effort which really cleaned up at the Oscars the previous year1952 but which now seems very dated and somewhat artificial in my opinion. By comparison Shane feels as if it could have been made last month by all of our best film professionals working together on what can only be described as a labour of love   music cinematography screenplay acting production design   everything.I saw Shane first when I was 8 or 9 years old in the Daylight theatre in Saskatoon Saskatchewan back in 1953 when it was first released. I have since seem this moving and beautiful parable at least a dozen times since then and it keeps getting better each time like a truly masterful piece of symphonic music with many layers and textures. The imagery in Shane is so deep and the story so full of mythological archetypes that the experience evoked in the viewer is timeless   it is really about the hero's journey. And the dialogue in Shane is every bit as authentic noble and powerful as it was when I first saw it as a wideeyed little boy who was knocked right off his feet. The experience keeps getting deeper and deeper as I get older. Shane is much more than a Western. It has more in common with the Saxon myth Beowulf or Homer's Odyssey than it does with other Westerns or for that matter with most other movies. Shane is really an epic an inspiring and beautifully made epic which speaks to the very deepest parts of us of what is means to be human    and to stand up on your own and be counted.Bravo to George Stevens! Bravo to Alan Ladd and the rest of a stellar cast. Without a doubt one of the best dozen or so movies ever made.".

	schema:headline " A Western tragedy of almost Gothic proportions with Alan Ladd as the quintessential good 'bad' guy...";
	schema:reviewBody "At first glance the Western genre is perhaps an unlikely vehicle for tragedy in a grand sense  it probably suffers from more Bmovies than any other. An exception however is Shane which was produced and directed by one of Hollywood's greats George Stevens. The plot of the film is well known to the extent that some may argue it is simple. But the story of Shane as a person is timeless and complex being the tragedy of a man unable to escape his past or as he says towards the end A man can't break the mould  and three dead killers in the saloon are mute witnesses to that truth.While there are subplots that foreshadow the denouement Stevens encapsulates the entire tragedy of Shane visually and symbolically with the spectacle of the opening and closing sequences  no mean feat in my opinion. As the Academy Award winning sound track begins the film opens with Shane  in faded almost white buckskin offwhite hat and mounted upon a palomino stallion  beginning a long descent into a scene of natural splendour a spectacle that symbolically epitomizes Heaven on Earth so to speak the lush valley surrounded by whitecapped mountains and a glittering river meandering through the green pastures. The sun is high the sky is blue all is peaceful and Shane's head is high as he traverses like a white knight the valley floor to the farmhouse in the distance to meet young Joey the farmer's son.When the awful deeds are done however and the plot has run its course the closing contrast is stark and diametrically opposed to the beginning wounded physically and emotionally Shane rides up the mountain trail with gathering storm clouds above and all around to leave the valley forever his buckskins and hat now darkened almost black from the falling rain. The lightning flashes the thunder rolls and Death once again rides a Pale Horse  but this time away from all that is Good in the valley below. His head bowed his wounded arm sagging at his side Shane finally reaches the crest of the ridge and disappears from view his Paradise Lost and the echo of Joey's cry Shane  come back! long gone. The tragedy for Shane is now complete.The acting throughout is as near perfect as is possible casting Alan Ladd as Shane was inspired because his style of acting matched ideally the quiet unassuming strength and power of the character of Shane. The only other suitable actor at that time was probably Glenn Ford but I'm quite happy that Ladd got the part. And the evil personification of the gunfighter Wilson found its rightful place in the hands of Jack Palance a much underrated actor whose presence almost steals the movie I did read somewhere that Jack Palance was in fact the fastest on the draw of all Western genre actors in Hollywood!. But like Bogie's Rick Blaine in Casablanca who had to give up his dream to fight on so also Alan Ladd's Shane has become the iconic Western 'good guy' who despite all his efforts to shake off his past must still carry on to fight his demons within and those others who continue to ravage his world.If you've not seen this movie then I do heartily recommend it. And for what it's worth that great directorwriter of the human comedy Woody Allen rates Shane as his most favorite movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whether or not Shane is in fact a great film is open to at least some discussion. But it is certainly among the most cinematic. One could set a documentary on garbagecollection in the Grand Tetons and elevate its stature by that fact alone. Put a film of real substance in such a setting and the table is definitely set. Shane is beautiful to watch at times like a moving oil painting. In fact the film's setting sometimes overpowers its characters diffusing them into the vast scenery. It's easy to picture just planting signs in the ground that say Town' Homestead' Cemetery' and foregoing setdesign altogether.Shane never completely worked for me until I was able to stop seeing it purely as a western. Alan Ladd's title character is almost a total nonsequitur more like a State Farm agent from 1950's Des Moines horsebacking through the Snake River valley of Wyoming perhaps as part of a dude ranch outing. He's just all wrong. But there it is. Must the improbable Ladd in his improbable fringed buckskins be human at all? In the later Clint Eastwood films High Plains Drifter and Pale Rider both of which reference Shane wholeheartedly all three films draw on the same fundamental myth Clint Eastwood's characters though certainly interesting and implicitly mysterious remain rather superficially so as though both wear signs that say Supernatural'. Shane is truly mysterious and perhaps even more unreal because he is so completely incongruous. Just look past the costume. When Shane was made The Twilight Zone had not yet appeared. But Rod Serling did not invent The Strange. He simply had the genius to recognize and tap into what was already percolating up into the general consciousness. As a possibly supernatural guardian of a vast landscape Ladd's nearflatline characterization begins to make real sense.As was the case with the Eastwood characters the disharmony required to call the supernatural guardian into human form has manifested and he has appeared. Shane comes from nowhere' and eventually returns to that noplace where even the innocent Brandon DeWilde may not follow. He resembles no one and exhibits few human traits aside from the most superficial. No one neither sodbuster nor cowpuncher knows quite what to make of him. He seems friendly but this may be just the sideeffect of a complete absence of the reactionism displayed by many of the film's other characters an entirely different orientation from the merely friendly. Shane is part of no relationship with man or woman and never will be even though Jean Arthur's homestead wife an orchid of womanhood transplanted into the high plains chastely throws herself at him. Shane clearly returns her love but from a place as remote and still as the summit of Everest on a calm morning. There are wisps of implication that Shane may have a past but they vanish quickly subatomic resonances of Shane's transient human form. Shane is there. But in many ways he is not. Of course director George Stevens probably did not ascribe to any paranormal vision when making the film. But things often happen even when they are not intended certainly in art.The film proceeds somewhat formulaically until its chief villains the cattleranching Ryker brothers call up a dark force to oppose Shane's angel of light. The Rykers pioneered the vast valley for open range against nature and its indigenous inhabitants and are ready to kill to keep their range from being homesteaded. They summon the gunfighter Jack Wilson played definitively by the young Jack Palance. Palance's Wilson is a killer of such distilled lethality that just looking at him might kill you. Whenever Wilson is on screen time seems to slow down as it is refracted by his menacing gravity Almost all subsequent tvmovie gunslingers are his bitches. Wilson is allegedly from Cheyenne but that assertion is never confirmed by hard evidence. He simply appears. The first meeting of Shane and Wilson at the homestead of alphasodbuster Joe Starrett  Van Heflin is riveting. The Rykers are making the rounds issuing their final warning to the farmers accompanied for maximum effect by the recentlyarrived Wilson. Not a word is exchanged as the two entities unblinkingly size each other up. Dialog continues in the background but you barely hear it as Wilson who has dismounted for a drink of water places a foot in a stirrup then almost levitates back into the saddle grinning like death having never taken his eyes off Shane from the first moment finally backing his horse out of Starrett's yard in order to keep Shane in focus. A later sequence where Wilson meticulously executes Elisha Cook Jr.'s homesteader a punchedout Civil War veteran with exponentially more pride than sense must rank as one of the most powerful ever filmed western or otherwise. Rolling thunder clouds open for a moment and bathe the homesteader in bright light as he almost turns back on the way to his doom then they close and roll on as he rejects his last chance.Shane the film owes much to its beautifullyrendered bad guys who confront a rather bland unidimensional good giving it texture and motivation. Without them the film might have remained just a western movie. Shane the character enters as something of a posterboy cowboy hero. But bathed in Jack Wilson's black light he glows beyond that status. The Taoists assert that emptiness lies at the heart of all things the wheel turns because the center of the hub is empty. Shane turns to no little degree because its hub is almost equally empty the film moving in stately rotation around Ladd's nearblank avenging angel. If Shane is a great film it is possibly as much by accident as design. It was meant to be a big studio western in the style of that period. However unforeseen chemical reactions occurred and the result transcended certain stylistic bindings including its swelling 'Big Sky' score to become more than the sum of its parts.".

They summon the gunfighter Jack Wilson played definitively by the young Jack Palance. Palance's Wilson is a killer of such distilled lethality that just looking at him might kill you. Whenever Wilson is on screen time seems to slow down as it is refracted by his menacing gravity Almost all subsequent tvmovie gunslingers are his bitches. Wilson is allegedly from Cheyenne but that assertion is never confirmed by hard evidence. He simply appears. The first meeting of Shane and Wilson at the homestead of alphasodbuster Joe Starrett  Van Heflin is riveting. The Rykers are making the rounds issuing their final warning to the farmers accompanied for maximum effect by the recentlyarrived Wilson. Not a word is exchanged as the two entities unblinkingly size each other up. Dialog continues in the background but you barely hear it as Wilson who has dismounted for a drink of water places a foot in a stirrup then almost levitates back into the saddle grinning like death having never taken his eyes off Shane from the first moment finally backing his horse out of Starrett's yard in order to keep Shane in focus. A later sequence where Wilson meticulously executes Elisha Cook Jr.'s homesteader a punchedout Civil War veteran with exponentially more pride than sense must rank as one of the most powerful ever filmed western or otherwise. Rolling thunder clouds open for a moment and bathe the homesteader in bright light as he almost turns back on the way to his doom then they close and roll on as he rejects his last chance.Shane the film owes much to its beautifullyrendered bad guys who confront a rather bland unidimensional good giving it texture and motivation. Without them the film might have remained just a western movie. Shane the character enters as something of a posterboy cowboy hero. But bathed in Jack Wilson's black light he glows beyond that status. The Taoists assert that emptiness lies at the heart of all things the wheel turns because the center of the hub is empty. Shane turns to no little degree because its hub is almost equally empty the film moving in stately rotation around Ladd's nearblank avenging angel. If Shane is a great film it is possibly as much by accident as design. It was meant to be a big studio western in the style of that period. However unforeseen chemical reactions occurred and the result transcended certain stylistic bindings including its swelling 'Big Sky' score to become more than the sum of its parts.";

	schema:headline " And my mother wants you Shane! I KNOW she does!";
	schema:reviewBody "American cinematography doesn't get much more American than Shane. George Stevens' 1953 classic captures everything that was the myth and much that was the reality of the American West.Shane works on more than one level as do most outstanding films. On its most basic level this is of course a traditional Western. The basic macho American mantra Leave me alone and I'll leave you alone push me too far and I'll fight' is everpresent as well as the theme of progress and orderalthough the coming of that progress order and eventual civilization of course will spell the end of the very lifestyle these characters fight for.A huge comeback for Alan Ladd Shane is also a very good portrayal of very real people facing very real challenges. It is magnificently crafted exquisitely filmed and wonderfully acted. Shane has to stand among the genre's greatest films.SPOILERS AHEADLadd revives a sagging career with a tremendous performance as the withdrawn unobtrusive yet proud and gutsy Shane. A mysterious characterwe don't even know if Shane is his first or last name Shane happens by the Joe Starrett farm and winds up staying for a spell. Starrett Van Heflin is the leader of a pack of homesteading farmers being harassed and threatened by an unscrupulous cattle baron Rufus Ryker Emile Meyer. Although one can predict how the movie will end long before the climactic scene arrives the buildup toward the climax is nevertheless rivoting.Aside from the traditional machismo yet honorable male code of ethics the film also displays a less often seen angle. As in The Searchers the happily married wife Jean Arthur is obviously attracted to Shane. Although nothing inappropriate is done or said the mutual attraction becomes obvious to Starrettcapped of course with the deliciously ironic line by young Joey Starrett Brandon de Wilde at the end and my mother wants you Shane! I KNOW she does!'Another thing that lifts Shane above the normal genre fare is the deep characterization. These are not one or twodimensional characters. The villains are no more cardboardish than the protagonists. When the bearded Ryker gives an impassioned speech to the Starrett family about how the oldtime ranchers worked and bled and fought to make the area what it is only to be fenced out of their water etc. it may not swing many viewers to his sideyet it does show us that Ryker HAS a point of view. In the end both Ryker AND Starrett proclaim that they are willing to kill the other to hang onto what they feel rightly belongs to them. While our loyalty stays with Starrett and Shane the enemy is no mere sadistic cardboard bad guy. Even the delightfully sardonic gunslinger Jack Wilson played wonderfully by Jack Palance has some humanity. While he seems to truly enjoy his work and his grin is as chilling as it would be playing Dracula 20 years later! he does make an effort to avoid fighting Shanesomeone other than the man whom he has been hired to kill.The other farmers are a fascinating collection with pintsized Confederate fireball Frank Stonewall' Torrey Elisha Cook Jr. lanky cautious Swede Axel Shipstead Douglas Spencer and garrulous old fart Fred Lewis the beloved Edgar Buchanan and their families. I get a lump in my throat seeing Stonewall's faithful hound whine and paw sadly at his master's coffin as it is lowered into its grave. The entire cast is strong.Of course Arthur as Marion Starrett deservedly gets second billing behind Ladd. A sweetnatured beauty she is obviously happy with her husband and son. Yet her eyes do roam onto the mysterious stranger in their midst. Little Joey is probably right his mother probably DOES want Shane. Yet as in A Tale of Two Cities Shane does the far far better thing' and meets the gunman in Starrett's placealbeit very much against Joe's will.Overall this is a very satisfying movie. Other than the music being a tad overbearing at times such as Shane's fateful ride into town to face Ryker and Wilson it is one that seems to be without any real flaws. Shane deserves its place as one of America's best films of its decade and one of the top Westerns ever made.".

	schema:headline " The Unseen and Unspoken elevate Shane to its iconic status ...";
	schema:reviewBody "Exploring the struggle of hardworking homesteaders against ruthless cattlemen Shane highlights the ambiguity of the frontier code sometimes noble and sometimes savage while Wyoming's green valleys and isolated mountains provide the perfect escapism for a lone rider to bury a painful past. Whether you take the word 'western' as an indelible chapter of America's history or a state of mind Shane is one of these immortal classics.Indeed the Western genre isn't just the most prolific it also is the most representative of American Cinema. Yet a few western films ended up being recognized as masterpieces on their own. Shane is one of the few that did and without the 'John Ford' stamp. But maybe George Stevens didn't realize he was making a masterpiece that would stand the test of time and influence other movies including nonWesterns. But does it really matter? Most of the American Film Institute's Top 100 movies including Shane were not originally meant to be masterpieces.And the casting strikes as the most remarkable oddity. Montgomery Clift and William Holden were planned to be cast as Shane and Joe Starret and Katharine Hepburn as Marian. Would the film have suffered from an allstar cast? Not necessarily but it would have considerably damaged the impact of the story in my opinion. Clift would have been too credible as a tough guy able to handle Ryker's men and Holden exudes so much machocharisma that I can't picture him in a lower rank than Clift. As for Hepburn her strong personality would have turned the tacit subplot in a battle of egos where the main story would have been totally diluted.Now Alan Ladd as Shane is unusually short for a hero and handsome in an effeminate way and his legendary buckskin outfit more fit for a circus act doesn't help. More a tenderfoot than a lone rider his voice yet exudes a confidence a quiet strength inspiring both fear and respect. When Joe taking Shane for one of Ryker's men asks him to leave Shane wants him to lower the rifle. He can leave but as he says I like it to be my idea. Shane is aware of his nonthreatening look even more when he's confronted to the towering Jack Palance or Ben Johnson but through his resistance and eagerness to fight he literally embodies the fight of 'little people'.Interestingly Shane carries the same political undertones than many revisionist westerns of the late 60's and early 70's. Even Rufus Ryker Emile Meyer reminds of the corrupted Morton who ordered to kill the McBain clan in Once Upon a Time in the West whose funeral scene is borrowed almost shottoshot from Shane or the businessmen who tried to buy Warren Beatty out in McCabe and Mrs. Miller. Ahead of its time the film even avoids Manichaeism when Ryker claims that he's among the pioneers who pacified the land and therefore has a legitimate right on it. But Joe doesn't just stay for the land but for the principles for his own freedom. In a way if he ever left he'd like it to be his idea. That's the frontier spirit.Van Heflin is perfect as the man who tries to be like Shane but reckons they're not in the same league. And it's not William Holden at the peak of his seductive power that could have played a man more aware of his weaknesses than his strength. Naturally Marian is a fitting wife to a man like Joe she's fragile sensitive yet caring and loving. Jean Arthur the unsung heroine of Capra's movies still has this little nasal voice that makes hard to believe she's 53 in Shane'. But she's not the strong willed woman of Capra films she doesn't want to see the MEN she loves in trouble. And she makes it quite obvious that there is a chemistry between her and Shane something miraculously imperceptible in the story but perceptible on screen.It's not visible because the genius of Shane is to tell the film from the perspective of little Joey played by the late Brandon de Wilde who idolizes a man like Shane and loves him as a fatherly figure. Joey like the viewer witnesses the juxtaposition of two visions of the West. And the dilemma is even more interesting for Shane because he's given a unique chance to bury his past and live a peaceful existence with Marian and Joey if he lets Joe killed by Jack Wilson a gunfighter hired by Ryker wearing a hat as black as Shane's is white. Palance plays Shane's evil alterego displaying violence in possibly one of the most coldblooded killing scenes ever captured in film when he shoots Elisha Cook's illfated character a shocking moment referred to in Eastwood's remake Pale Rider and more notably in Altman's McCabe  Mrs. Miller.For a western Shane is a film of a few gunshots but each one is loud and startling like carrying an inner significance in a quiet place where the future of Old West is jeopardized. People like Shane Wilson and Ryker are already living ghosts while America is already building its future. And Shane is one of Cinema's greatest heroes because he chose his destiny and had the wisdom to vanish after an act of generosity a sacrifice like only the frontier spirit could have inspired. And he leaves Joey with his family and an answer to the existential model to follow. As he said one can't get away with killing and like Marian he doesn't want guns in Joey's future.And maybe the iconic concluding line Shane! Come back! shouted with a chilling echo while Shane's silhouette slowly disappears might reflect the desperate cry of an America who wants to reconcile with the agonizing spirit. Shane features many archetypes of the Old West myth but it's the level of unseen and unspoken and maybe its magnificent finale that elevates it to its iconic status.".

	schema:headline " Highly watchable Western in which a drifter resolves a conflict between a bunch of settlers and wealthy owner";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a classic Western about usual confrontation between cattlemen and homesteaders. A strange and weary cowboy named Shame comes to defense peasants in their struggle against the nasty owners  as the gunfighter fighting to stifle the conflicts between homesteaders and cattlemen who hire a hired hand . A drifter Alan Ladd comes to a farm in the Old West just in time to reckoning gunslingers and owners . Shane attempts to settle down with a homestead husband named Starrett Van Heflin  his wife named Marian Jean Arthur was over 50 years old she was in fact ten years older than Emile Meyer and Katharine Hepburn was originally suggested for the role of Marian and a son  but a smoldering settlerrancher conflict forces him to act. He is a mysterious gunfighter who comes to the aid of countrymen from a greedy wealthy owner topnotch Emile Meyer as grizzled old cattle baron Rufus Ryker trying to encroach on their land . Meanwhile  the Good Stranger is idolized by their son Brandon De Wilde. As the wealthy owner contracts an outlaw as hired gunfighter Jack Palance to kill Starrett and Shane. Well crafted and sweeping Western with interesting screenplay written by A. B Guthrie  including memorable dialogue and important phrases  as the movie's line Come back Shane! was voted as the 69 of The 100 Greatest Movie Lines by Premiere in 2007 . Agreeable Western packs drama  thrills  go riding  shootouts and some moving action sequences . It's a high budget film with good actors  technicians production values and pleasing results . Alan Ladd is unforgettable in the title role coming to help a group of struggling homesteaders . Director George Stevens originally cast Montgomery Clift as Shane and William Holden as Joe Starrett  when both decided to do other films instead Shane was nearly abandoned  a bit later on  upon seeing a list of actors under contract to the studio Stevens cast Alan Ladd Van Heflin and Jean Arthur . The scene where Alan Ladd practices shooting in front of Brandon De Wilde took 119 takes to complete. Good casting with several prestigious secondaries as Edgar Buchanan  Ben Johnson  John Dierkes  Elisha Cook Jr  and special mention to Jack Palance as a downright nasty pistolero . Exquisitely shot in CinemaScope by Loyal Griggs who deservedly won Oscar Best Cinematography  with a magnificent photo tography on impressive exteriors and snowy mountains backgrounds  being filmed on location in Big Bear Lake Big Bear Valley San Bernardino National Forest California and Grand Teton National Park Moose Wyoming . Thrilling as well as sensitive musical score by Victor Young  though the music cues for the climactic ride that Shane takes to the showdown are from an earlier Paramount film Rope of sand . Although the movie is generally remembered for its blue sky vistas the weather was actually cloudy or rainy for a great deal of the shoot  however if you look beyond the mud in the town you can see that the ground is dry  obviously part of the town had been watered down . Meticulous care was taken at all levels of production. All the physical props were true to the period the buildings were built to the specifications of the time and the clothing was completely authentic  director George Stevens even had somewhat scrawnylooking cattle imported from other areas as the local herds looked too wellfed and healthy . The motion picture was directed in sure visual eye by the great George Stevens . In 2007 the American Film Institute ranked this as the 45 Greatest Movie of All Time and ranked 3 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre Western in June 2008 . Many years later  Clint Eastwood directed Pale rider  this film is made in somewhat similar style to Shane  and which so much cloning of High plains drifter also directed by Eastwood only this time the drifter appears to have been sent from hell rather than heaven to right from ordinary injustices . This classic Western Shane as good as the notorious Pale rider is splendid in every way . It was followed by a TV series starred by David Carradine and Jill Ireland  equally titled Shane.".

Director George Stevens originally cast Montgomery Clift as Shane and William Holden as Joe Starrett  when both decided to do other films instead Shane was nearly abandoned  a bit later on  upon seeing a list of actors under contract to the studio Stevens cast Alan Ladd Van Heflin and Jean Arthur . The scene where Alan Ladd practices shooting in front of Brandon De Wilde took 119 takes to complete. Good casting with several prestigious secondaries as Edgar Buchanan  Ben Johnson  John Dierkes  Elisha Cook Jr  and special mention to Jack Palance as a downright nasty pistolero . Exquisitely shot in CinemaScope by Loyal Griggs who deservedly won Oscar Best Cinematography  with a magnificent photo tography on impressive exteriors and snowy mountains backgrounds  being filmed on location in Big Bear Lake Big Bear Valley San Bernardino National Forest California and Grand Teton National Park Moose Wyoming . Thrilling as well as sensitive musical score by Victor Young  though the music cues for the climactic ride that Shane takes to the showdown are from an earlier Paramount film Rope of sand . Although the movie is generally remembered for its blue sky vistas the weather was actually cloudy or rainy for a great deal of the shoot  however if you look beyond the mud in the town you can see that the ground is dry  obviously part of the town had been watered down . Meticulous care was taken at all levels of production. All the physical props were true to the period the buildings were built to the specifications of the time and the clothing was completely authentic  director George Stevens even had somewhat scrawnylooking cattle imported from other areas as the local herds looked too wellfed and healthy . The motion picture was directed in sure visual eye by the great George Stevens . In 2007 the American Film Institute ranked this as the 45 Greatest Movie of All Time and ranked 3 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre Western in June 2008 . Many years later  Clint Eastwood directed Pale rider  this film is made in somewhat similar style to Shane  and which so much cloning of High plains drifter also directed by Eastwood only this time the drifter appears to have been sent from hell rather than heaven to right from ordinary injustices . This classic Western Shane as good as the notorious Pale rider is splendid in every way . It was followed by a TV series starred by David Carradine and Jill Ireland  equally titled Shane.";

Although the basic plot is simple the good guys are being driven off their land by the bad guys a stranger rides in and takes up their cause eventually vanquishing the bad guys the sub plot goes much deeper even to the extent that it is shown that even the bad guys have a point if not justification for trying to regain the land that the homesteaders have cultivated.

	schema:reviewBody "Wyoming in the 1880's is a beautiful wilderness of spectacular mountains and fertile valleys.  Into one such valley Shane the lonely gunfighter comes riding.He happens upon a local war between the ranchers and the homesteaders. Rufe Ryker the rancher won this valley from the indians and resents the squatters who have fenced me off from water.  The valley should he believes be open cattle range.  Joe Starrett is the natural leader of the homesteaders.  He sees the future of America in terms of communities  people should settle the land and work it and build schools and churches.As Shane rides onto Starrett's spread he is greeted by idyllic domesticity.  Joe is chopping wood Little Joey is playing and Marian sings as she fixes supper.  Both Shane and Starrett bristle ... I didn't expect to find any fences around here says Shane and Joe takes Shane for one of Ryker's troublemakers.The tension subsides and Shane stays overnight.  The pain in his face when Marian serves a wedge of apple pie denotes a longing for a happy home life and the love of a good woman.  Marian too is affected by Shane.  She hides coyly in the kitchen then brings out the best crockery for her guest.In return for the hospitality Shane starts chopping at the stubborn old treestump.  Starrett joins him and the two men toil to defeat the stump bonding in friendship as they symbolically tame the frontier wilderness.Ernie Wright stops by.  He is a homesteader who wants out because of Ryker's bullies but Starrett persuades him to stay. Shane agrees to work for Joe because he sees that Joe is this community's anchor and he will need help in the confrontation to come.The homesteaders keep to the valley floor the cowboys haunt the township.  Farmers stay on their spreads raising their families and working the land.  The cowpokes are single men whose only fixed point is Grafton's saloon.Old man Grafton has two businesses on adjoining premises but they are separate universes.  Homesteaders patronise the general store making expeditions for clothes nails and food bonnets for the women and candy for the kids.  The saloon is where Ryker's thugs spend their day.  The listless pointless existence is enlivened only when a 'sodbuster' strays in giving them someone to bully.Under orders from Joe not to get into trouble Shane ventures into the saloon and is picked on by Ryker's men.  With enormous selfrestraint he allows himself to be humiliated.Joe calls a homesteaders' meeting.  The budding community looks to Starrett as its leader.  The farmers decide to do their shopping en masse to minimise exposure to the cattlemen.  When Marian warns Little Joey not to get to likin' Shane too much we know that she has fallen in love.The mass shopping expedition is a turningpoint.  Shane settles his score with the bullies and he and Joe fighting backtoback take on Ryker's men and win.  This prompts Ryker to send to Cheyenne for Wilson the hired killer.Wilson exudes evil.  The lithe blackhatted gunslinger never works. He sits around the saloon all day a brooding alien presence in the valley. At the faceoff on Starrett's spread Shane watches intensely as Wilson backs his horse out with sinister elegance.It is Wilson's function to goad the homesteaders into drawing against him so that he can gun them down.  'Stonewall' Torey is the obvious first choice being a recklessly brave hothead.  The confrontation is a thrilling piece of cinema ... Shipstead's three plaintive cries which almost pull Torey back from the brink ...the bleak muddy street .... the awful inevitability.The funeral is another cinematic triumph.  The mourners are dramatically silhouetted against the vast sky as the dog pines for his dead master.  Down on the valley floor the township with its saloon glowers like a stain on the landscape.The homesteaders are all for quitting until they see that Fred Lewis's place has been set ablaze by Ryker's men.  This has two plot consequences. The sodbusters now resolve to stay and build a community and Starrett decides to ride in and settle things with Ryker.Shane cannot allow this.  He knows that Joe is no match for Wilson. Starrett hints that there is a certain appropriateness about being killed in this way.  He knows that Marian will be looked after and that Shane will stand up to Ryker ...And so the two friends fight.  This is a cataclysm for Marian and Joey and it shakes the foundations of their world.  While the fight proceeds out of our view Marian and Joey hurry from window to window as if in a shipwreck.  When the camera moves out into the yard we see the fistfight through the legs of terrified horses.  Dogs quiver in fear.  The Starrett universe is in turmoil.In the final scene in the barroom Shane tells Tyker the cruel truth  the old man has lived too long.  Ryker's dream has passed from the earth. When the violence is done Shane rides off into the dawn wounded and alone. He knows that his dream too has passed him by.The dawn symbolises the new era of peace and prosperity in the valley. As Shane leaves it behind Joey's innocently ironic words echo back from the sierra  And mother wants you.  I know she does!".

This is an absolutely touching story of a former gunfighter who is falsely labeled a coward by the sodbusters and who has got to do what a man has got to do in order to save the day.

The cinematography is excellent the camerawork is superb the mood is perfect the effects are beautifully rendered and not overused and the timing of individual scenes is consistent throughout the piece. The problem is the overall timing of the film. For over half the film the overall plot and premise is ignored. It is very much as if we are watching two different episodes of the same TV series the characters are the same the premise is the same it is clear how the plots fit together visually and thematically but otherwise they have pretty much nothing to do with one another. They are not disjointed in their construction or presentation it is simply that the plot threads are mostly unrelated.It is worth pointing out that this is the first film in a planned trilogy. Every hanging plotcharacter moment in the film is very strongly intended to be followed through upon in the next two films and it shows. Characters and references are not simply tossed aside but are led into gently just enough to let the audience know that greater things are intended. While I'm not particularly a fan of this kind of thing Night Watch does it very well and I await the sequels with anticipation.Many people on this board have made comparisons to Star Wars EpIII and for the life of me I haven't the faintest clue why. The concept of Imperfect Good vs Seductive Evil within the human soul was hardly invented by George Lucas though vampires in Star Wars would be pretty freakin' cool and its presentation in Night Watch is tight and interesting. There is no resemblance whatsoever this is one of the more original films that I have ever seen and I recommend it both for its flaws and perfections.".

The story is filled with stunning visuals and sound effects  think the best elements of The Matrix and Highlander with a bit of Sin City thrown in. All the characters are three dimensional and the actors' performances are superb. A rarity in action films these days. In Night Watch the line between good and evil is often blurred. The lead character struggles with what is a truly a moral action and what is not. Night Watch does not offer any easy answers to this question. After all what is moral and what is not is something that each of us must decide freely for ourselves.This is an incredible movie and is not one you have seen before. I highly recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Night Watch is far more entertaining than many of its American counterparts in the secret underground world of vampires and good vs. evil genre. Unlike Underworld and Constantine it kept my attention throughout but still this Russian smash is severely flawed.First let's applaud the good parts. Night Watch is distinctly Russian. Moscow is presented as a vibrant mix of modern metropolis and Gothicstyle throwback to the middle ages. The plot heavily steeped in its own fabricated mythology from a series of popular books also serves on some level as an allegory for the fall of Communism and the rise of Capitalism. In my mind the forces of dark forced underground are the Communists while the forces of light whose HQ is fronted by the City Electric Company are the Capitalists who often get caught up in their own bureaucracy in their vain attempts to keep the peace and not violate the truce. Some of the special effects and modern riffs on vampirism are highly imaginative and disarming I loved The Gloom aspect. The American distributors also deserve some credit for their creative use of subtitles which often become part of the scene without ever distracting from the visuals.Unfortunately the director is clearly a veteran of music videos and he makes the action sequences hyper kinetic and often incoherent. When he does manage to create an alluring visual he quickcuts and you wish he would've had the patience to hold some of the shots longer. This hectic visual style is evident in the plotting as well which clearly is setting up for sequels with the introduction of many characters though some of the subplots especially involving the cursed virgin woman and her evil vortex seemed unnecessary. Likewise the rushed finale seemed oddly anticlimatic and didn't pack the wallop I feel the filmmakers intended.Despite the flaws I will eagerly await the American distribution of the sequels and I suppose that is the greatest compliment a film like this can receive.".

As is usually the case in these sorts of stories most recently in last year's relatively underrated CONSTANTINE the protagonist who's allied with light although he's got a lot of dark edges stumbles upon an apocalyptic situation that will bring the truce to a cataclysmic end. By no means a bad movie but nothing all that special. I would argue that the movie doesn't show off it's Moscow locations very well at all and doesn't feel especially foreign though of course there may be subtexts that only a Russian would pick up. It also over relies on flash cinematography and editing to give drive to what in point of fact are rather pedestrian scenes. The main plot finally has enough holes to run semis through.All of that doesn't add up to a bad movie exactly I enjoyed parts of it and would certainly be interested in checking out DAY WATCH when it hits the States. But even allowing for the obvious budget differences between this and Hollywood product I'm suggesting it's fairly typical of it's breed. I'm suggesting it's not quite as amazing as some people have said.. In many ways KONTROLL although only nominally a fantasy is a lot better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Night Watch is one of the most expensive Russian film production ever and enjoyed in it's home country the best movie start of all time 15 million US  in its first month but is it any good? Yes and no. First of all let me say that this is a special effects film and even though for a Russian production this has a comparatively huge budget for CGI and makeup fx the results are decidedly mixed. Most of it is OK with single drops into the ridiculous. The direction by former ad director Bekmambetov is stylish enough without forgetting to portray the grittiness of Russian life circumstances. The actors are competent though leading man Konstantin Khabensky is lacking in the charisma department. The story ultimately is the measurement of what is good and bad about Night Watch and it does contain both. The novels on which this film is based are pretty complex making this the first in a trilogy with Day Watch and Dusk Watch to come. The presented battle between good and evil supernatural beings is reminiscent of other genre efforts but unlike say Underworld Night Watch takes its elements seriously. This is a mixed blessing. On one hand you have a real mythology underlying events instead of a starting point for subway machine gun battles of longhairs on the other there is no humor in the picture and the reverent and dead serious tone in spite of the bizarre events is sometimes overdone and a little laughable. The idea of supernatural police forces observing and checking each other is a nice one as are numerous quirky little ideas but overall there are two lame stereotypes for every good and fresh idea. Most disappointing is the double climax letdown. The 'grudge' storyline is extremely well built up with lots of suspense but ends with a whimper instead of a bang. The climax of the 'kid' storyline is muddled as well but does offer a nice full circle resolution to one aspect of the story and features an interesting cliffhanger.Overall the shortcomings are just slightly outweighed by a fresh different and decidedly unHollywood take on fantasy movie standards.

	schema:headline " Great film with a well created mythology";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a very very entertaining film. It has some nice special effects for a film with such a small budget. Great acting by some believable actors. Great dialogue. Cool fun action sequences. But the real backbone of this film is the mythology upon which the whole plot lies.The mythology created by the original author upon which the film is based belongs up there with the great ones like Lucas' Star Wars the Wachowski brothers' Matrix Tolkien's LOTR Herbert's Dune. It just has that kind of history and interesting terms and names and events that make you go Wow! What's that all about?...That is so cool! I wanna learn more! Wouldn't be cool to live in that universe? The funny thing for me though is that this mythology is a vampire related mythology. And since reading the Anne Rice novels and her well described history of the vampires I have not been able to accept anyone else's interpretation of vampires. Kate Beckinsale in Underworld...no! And even though I think that the acting and writing for Buffy the Vampire Slayer was some of the best stuff on television I just did not think that their treatment of vampire mythology was up to standard. But here in Night Watch...it worked! I thought that this was a tremendous film and enjoyed it greatly. I would absolutely recommend it especially if you like any of the above mythical worlds and are looking to get yourself into another one. Can't wait for the sequels!".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a very very entertaining film. It has some nice special effects for a film with such a small budget. Great acting by some believable actors. Great dialogue. Cool fun action sequences. But the real backbone of this film is the mythology upon which the whole plot lies.The mythology created by the original author upon which the film is based belongs up there with the great ones like Lucas' Star Wars the Wachowski brothers' Matrix Tolkien's LOTR Herbert's Dune. It just has that kind of history and interesting terms and names and events that make you go Wow! What's that all about?...That is so cool! I wanna learn more! Wouldn't be cool to live in that universe? The funny thing for me though is that this mythology is a vampire related mythology. And since reading the Anne Rice novels and her well described history of the vampires I have not been able to accept anyone else's interpretation of vampires. Kate Beckinsale in Underworld...no! And even though I think that the acting and writing for Buffy the Vampire Slayer was some of the best stuff on television I just did not think that their treatment of vampire mythology was up to standard.

Some filmmakers no longer shoot movies just to entertain the moviegoers. They strive with their last bit of strength in pursuit of the ultimate goal TO MAKE AN EXCEPTIONAL FILM THAT WOULD BLOW UP THE Hollywood.I don't really much incline to the idea that we are somehow aesthetically and culturally above the rest of the world and that we should obligatory go our own way.But I'm afraid that the efforts to prove at any cost that WE ALSO CAN DO A COOL STUFF with bells and whistles at least not worse than the big guys may be not exactly the right path to the top.Well it's a way better than the arms race but a work of art falls into somewhat selfsufficient category and shouldn't be an object of that sort of competition.I believe a film doesn't have to bear a specific nationality. Once it is considered irrespective of the country of origin and could be valued purely as is just for it's inner virtues it may look much more appealing.To be honest all that my reasoning however refers to the hysteria around the Night Watch rather than to the film itself.Unexpectedly to myself I've bought an occasional licensed DivX with the Night Watch just to test MPEG4 capabilities of a DVD player.And I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. I found it rather atmospheric gripping and engaging as well as neatly produced. I may say I liked it.The cast was great acting  almost impeccable and not over the top what frequently degrades modern Russian fantasy scifi or action movies. Some dialogues nevertheless could have been a bit more articulate.The cinematography was equally nice  I liked that fancy shooting angles and professional camerawork. Effects were descent and balanced.The closing titles background song was pretty cool. Frankly I'm not so much enthusiastic about that sort of tiresome music. What is really awesome about the song is its humorous lyrics embracing the entire movie plot.The idea of the filmbook is quite interesting though not brand new. Numerous dark forces lurk somewhere in a parallel world unseen to unsophisticated humans. Until the time when some of their most villainous representatives would be eager to play with their unsuspecting victims. It is however contrary to a certain pact between the good and the evil specifying that both good and evil doings should be controlled and approved by both parties that have established for that reason the respective teams of guardians the Night Watch and the Day Watch.Entirely new for the movies with such kind of a pleasant premise is that none has ever got killed except for a handful of malefactors like that stoned bloodsucker. Just some pinpoint accurate destructions here and there minor violence and mild torture. A closeup shot of the finger pinned for a blood sample was the only scene that made my temporal vein twitch of disgust. Menshov's healerlike manipulations with Khabensky's entrails were impressively staged.A serious drawback of the film is the lack of explanation on some principle points. It's not that the philosophy was too complex for my convolutions. But the coherency of the storytelling was impaired at times. Like certain chunks of the film have been lost among leftovers on the cutting room's floor.My son familiar with the Lukyanenko's novel was giving brief tips in the course of the action which were conducive to the overall comprehensibility.Final verdict not for all tastes but refreshing and worth watching at least once.P.S. Amazingly the majority of the IMDb positive reviews comes from overseas audience while the Russian reviewers lash the Night Watch with a scathing sarcasm.".

For this viewer it has a fair bit to redeem it but has too many flaws as well to make it good enough very similar pros and cons for 2007's Wolfhound actually. Night Watch is an excellently made film the scenery is sumptuous with a dark edge as well the CGI is welldefined and used appropriately and most of the photography is skilfully done. The music score is terrific as well it has some beautiful parts some stirring parts and some haunting parts and these are used in a way that is effective for each scene and doesn't across as repetitive or jarring. The acting is also quite good Konstantin Khabensky's lead performance in particular is great and the supporting do a good job in making the most of what they have. The script is a mix here some of it is literate and thoughtful but there are too many other instances where it sounds awkward and underwritten. Most of the photography is fine but that is not the case with the action sequences where it is very claustrophobicfeeling and too much like watching a hurriedlyedited music video. The action doesn't really have as much drive or tension as it ought to it's performed competently but rather stodgily choreographed. The characters are sketched very thinly we know what types of characters they are but often that's pretty much it. The story is the biggest problem with Night Watch a good idea but the storytelling is far too rushed and confused with too many things left unexplained or underdeveloped. If the pace had slowed down things would have been more comprehensible less choppy and better developed. While the ending is also a let down it was here where Night Watch felt the most rushed and it felt unfinished and anticlimatic too. Overall a mixed bag here and this is coming from a Russian fantasy fanatic who hasn't read the bookand you don't necessarily have had to to either like or dislike the film and judged Night Watch on its own terms. 510 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen this film in Russia it is an honest fear of mine that it'll gain any popularity or even a hype in the West.The popularity of this film has to be understood and can't really be shared in the West. The Nochnoy dozor books were awfully popular in Russia. I can't really comment on the quality of those books having only casually read the first few a bit but I can say that if you look at the popularity of those books you would realise that it didn't really matter to the Russians how good or bad the film would be. They wanted a film and any would do. In my opinion the Harry Potter movies weren't bad but imagine they were. Would the first Harry Potter film not still have been a huge hit and even hugely hyped by the avid book readers just because it managed to put the books into filmform? The same holds true here but it has to be remembered that the West doesn't share the hype that the Night Watch books gained in Russia. I would be highly surprised if this movie popped in on the Oscars as I've heard many Russians suggest and would definitely be insulted if next to the many quality films produced by foreign countries including Russia this one would be listed. Many recent Russian films like Sibirskiy tsiryulnik or Zvezda or VostokZapad or even Voina deserved the Oscar more than this film.It is interesting to Sibirskiy tsiryulnik the Barber of Siberia in comparison to this. Mikhalkov's ambitious project was seen by many to be little more than an attempt to impress the West. This assertion is not fair but it does reveal a lot about the flaws of that film which sometimes hung right in between Western and Russian styles and other bordercrossing attempts like Viona or this film. Voina fails in giving an otherwise excellent film an American ending. This films fails by giving a somewhat usable premise a heavy Hollywood coating.The acting is to be honest not that good and the storyline is confusing for those that are not avid readers of the Night Watch series e.g. everyone outside Russia. This does not kill off the film though it is killed by the script which I will not go into in detail except to say that it is confusing and implausible up to a point of annoyance and by the awful cameraworks which feels like mix of Russian styles Matrixized actions and shocky Blair Witch filming. The net result is one hell of a headache and no clue as to what you just looked at.Maybe just maybe this film has a leg to stand on as a simple actionfilm with a nice fantastic background weren't it for the confusing plot and the poorly directed action scenes. I would advise everyone except the Night Watchfans to stay well away from this work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nochnoy Dozor or Night Watch as it is called in America is a dark horrorfantasy that has gained lots of publicity because of its status as Russias first blockbuster. This came both as a gift and as a curse as while many critics praised its stylish visuals and its very original take on an otherwise clichd plot many other critics labeled its notorious Hollywood influence as a cheap attempt to imitate American action filmmaking. While there is some truth in both statements Night Watch has more good than bad and even when it is definitely a Hollywoodstyle action movie it is at times better and more entertaining than most of what the American cinema has created in this decade.Based on a series of very successful novels by Sergei Lukyanenko Nochnoy Dozor is the beginning of the final battle between the forces of light and the forces of darkness. Unknown to humans supernatural beings collectively named as The Others exist and take part in a war that has been going on since the beginning of time. However a truce was declared centuries ago and now every Other must decide between the Light and the Darkness and to keep the balance between them two special forces are created the Day Watch and the Night Watch. Anton Gorodetsky Konstantin Khabensky our main character is a member of the Night Watch Light's special team to watch over the Others of the Darkness.Timur Bekmambetov a Russian director who so far had only directed small BMovies in the U.S. returns home with a blast to give life to Lukyanenko's fantastic world in this first chapter of a trilogy that seems to be set to become a cultclassic. Bekmambetov's visual style is definitely influenced by Hollywood modern actionhorror films however he manages to keep a balance between the special effects and the character development. This is what really sets Nochnoy Dozor apart from its American influences Bekmambetov slowly builds up his characters and manages to make Lukyanenko's complex world understandable and very attractive.It is probably this dedication to the plot what makes Night Watch a bit slow in some parts. As the movie is the initial chapter of a trilogy it focuses more on setting up the plot rather than on actual action and this may turn away people expecting nonstop action. Still the action set pieces are very well designed and Bekmambetov allows us to explore this fantastic world of vampires sorcerers and other supernaturals with a lucid camerawork and Gothic atmospheres.Konstantin Khabensky as Anton Gorodetsky makes a good lead quite atypical from the common hero of this kind of stories. He has that everyday man look and at the same time is quite believable as the unlikely hero. Galina Tyunina plays Olga a sorceress who is assigned to aid Anton and although we don't see much of her character her performance is quite spot on and has good chemistry with Konstantin. It is worth to mention that the dark industrial setting of Moscow acts like another character and Bekmambetov makes the most of his locations with a good use of lighting and special effects.Night Watch's main problem is the one that earned it the hate of prominent Russian critics at times it tries too much to prove that Russians can make blockbusters too and by doing it the movie gains the same flaws as the movies it attempts to imitate. While the lead character is perfectly developed and the whole plot itself is well explored most of the supporting characters receive few time to shine.Timur Bekmambetov has done a very good work in this first episode of Nochnoy Dozor however there is a lot of work to do and hopefully all the flaws the movie has will be corrected in the second part as this is only an introduction to this brave new world. The movie has successfully created a thrilling story with enough suspense and emotion that the wait for the second part becomes difficult to stand. 710".

Unfortunately there's not much to like in this film which is being advertised as Guardianes de la Noche in Mexico if anybody wants to know. First of all there's a lot of elements from other movies and comics we've seen before. There's something that looks taken out from the first Highlander movie something that looks taken out from the Hellblazer comics and Constantine movie the music sounds like the Graeme Revell score from The Crow which was done to greater impact on that movie something from Hellboy the truck scene and there's even something from The Sixth Sense lying around. That's enough to keep you distracted from the main plot because all those elements really resemble the ones you've already seen. Anyway there's a lot of eye candy but nothing on the development of the plot suits the spectacular visuals which by the way aren't that spectacular either. Some things that happen and are really vital to the story fall flat. You know the overcome of the story from the moment they show the kid and when you get to see it it's not really powerful or moving. So we end up with a lot of brilliant visual ideas at the service of a really poor story come on light versus darkness stories have been around since the dawn of civilization so we needed something else to give us the sense of a really apocalyptic setting. But that 'something' never hits the screen. And I also think the rock music the used in certain scenes was somewhat annoying. The movie holds so much potential but it's totally wasted because of it's driven towards the visual aspect and never stops to make these characters seem real and sad which I think it tries to do desperately. While I was watching it I was wondering Jesus are they really going to try to do a trilogy out of this? Because it's pretty boring and unoriginal.".

I for one read the books all of them and simply loved them. In my opinion one of the greatest works of fiction I read and believe me I read a lot. So anyway what's wrong with this movie... well the first scene in it is actually not supposed to be there since it's from the beginning of The Day Watch just with some roles switched. Second an one of the biggest flaws it appears Egor is Anton's son. Shocked? I know I am since it doesn't make any sense and completely sets the story on a different side of tracks than it is in the books. Then we have the characters that are somewhat weaker then in the books. Where's Gesar's power? Or Zabulon's? They're supposed to be mages without classification and yet Gesar has trouble healing Anton. And don't get me started on Zabulon's outfit the guy looks like a bum. Where's the Zabulon from the books? Sophisticated always wears a suit and clearly powerful. This guy in the movie is some crack head Playstation playing dirty bum that hasn't seen a soap in months.Another thing what the heck is Alisa doing being a pop star? I know she always has her way but come on this is ridiculous. Totally spoils the first story in The Day Watch when she goes to that summer camp to replenish her energy reserves.The only thing I liked in the movie were special effects and Tiger Cub. She was always my favorite character and I think she did well in the movie. Beautiful but deadly. Although her romance with Bear was kinda wrong. They're supposed to be just friends.Anyway to sum it all up if you're a fan of the series you'll probably understand the story which is btw. just one third of the novel they only took the first story in the novel and focused on it but you will probably be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Night Watch is a low budget Russian vampire movie that depicts the eternal battle of good and evil in modern day Moscow. Centuries after a truce between two opposing forces there is a risk that an 'Other' or gifted human anyone seen Neo? will tip the balance of power. As with the vampire movie Underworld there are forces that prevent the battle from spilling over into the real world. The Day Watch are vampires assigned to police their brethren who disguise themselves as Adidas tracksuit wearing chavs who drive Audi TTs and aspire to be pop stars the UK is full of Vampires!. The Night Watch must step in to prevent evil forces from doing harm to innocent humans. The special effects in the movie are decent and one would be forgiven for mistaking the movie as a Hollywood title at times. However there are other instances when it looks as though the movie is being acted out by a bunch of friends in a warehouse or derelict flat. The cheap grainy feel is likely to be part of the desired Gothic art house effect so many will however enjoy its raw non glossy appeal.

	onyx:emotionText "Night Watch is a low budget Russian vampire movie that depicts the eternal battle of good and evil in modern day Moscow. Centuries after a truce between two opposing forces there is a risk that an 'Other' or gifted human anyone seen Neo? will tip the balance of power. As with the vampire movie Underworld there are forces that prevent the battle from spilling over into the real world. The Day Watch are vampires assigned to police their brethren who disguise themselves as Adidas tracksuit wearing chavs who drive Audi TTs and aspire to be pop stars the UK is full of Vampires!. The Night Watch must step in to prevent evil forces from doing harm to innocent humans. The special effects in the movie are decent and one would be forgiven for mistaking the movie as a Hollywood title at times. However there are other instances when it looks as though the movie is being acted out by a bunch of friends in a warehouse or derelict flat. The cheap grainy feel is likely to be part of the desired Gothic art house effect so many will however enjoy its raw non glossy appeal.

But these problems are more or less overcomed by good director good camera work and good editing. The viewer just needs to help a little by being less critical on production values. We are all used to big Hollywood spectacles and this movie would've been glad to be one but cannot from obvious reasons.

A long lost heir to the throne of Genovia has been identified as a klutzy teenager who lives in San Francisco. The Queen of Genovia goes to San Francisco and attempts to persuade her to come back to Genovia and take her place as a princess of the realm. From their the typical hijinks ensue. The princess gets an education in proper royal behavior  procedures. The Queen learns to loosen up and relax. Princess Mia also struggles between dating the school jock who ignored her before she became famous and dating an unpopular guy who has been her friend for years.The story is predictable and hold no real surprises. Despite this I still found myself enjoying the film. Julie Andrews did well in her role as the Queen and it was a treat to see her in another Disney film. I was surprised by how well Anne Hathaway did in her role as Princess Mia. She held her own against such performers as Andrews and Elizondo. This movie could have come off as cheezy but thanks to the director and skilled actors it proved to be a real treat. I remember back in 1990 when PW came out that girls thought it was so romantic that a hooker could find romance true love and wealth. In my opinion PD is a much better role model. I'd rather have my little girl wishing she that she was heir to throne than a hooker who happens to find true love.

Then who of all people should turn up but Julie Andrews to tell Mia that her father who she hasn't seen since she was tiny was actually royalty and that she Mia was princess of a country no one's ever heard of. What it comes down to is this She has until a big embassy ball to decide whether she wants to give up the crown and basically open the country up to a hostile political takeover or take her place as princess. After a makeover at the hands of funnyman Larry Miller some training and at least four horrendously traumatizing incidents she decides...well that would be giving it away wouldn't it?This is not a movie for little girls dressed in tutus who want to be princesses when they grow up. For the first time in the studio's tenure I'd wager this film depicts the responsibility of royalty. Mia tackles with the pressures of ruling a country. But for my money the best part of this movie is the love story. No not Mia and the uniquely attractive rocker although that is great. A second unscripted love story exists between Andrews and her chauffeur Hector Elizondo. That's terrific.It's about being yourself and bettering yourself. It's about knowing who your real friends are. It's about living up to your own expectations. It's about smushing an ice cream cone on the blouse of a bitchy cheerleader who deserves it. And maybe that sounds corny to all y'all rustic expression but I know a lot of adults who could use lessons like these.".

One day on the contrary she was told to be the Princess of a country which is very opposite to her former expectation. What a big turning to her life ! What she will undergo ? Mia is my very first and memorable impression about this movie. Anything about her comes from Anne Hathaway's virgin performance. After deeply understand the characterMia Anne let Meg's story vivid on the screen. Her acting is natural and every detail show a combination of her own understanding of the character and the shining of the character itself. I noticed some details about Miawhich is very sophisticated. Mia's school uniform represent the 1950's elegance. The black socks and ties. What a copy of Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's. Mia's smile remind me of another famous actressJulie Roberts who has become a mother recently. The beautiful big smile is very eyecatching and also memorable. OhI remember another person who also have those big smile. She is Amlie Poulain. The Story is philanthropic and extraordinary.It's not simply a Cinderella story.But a great story about grandmother and granddaughter a educationvalued story about mother and daughter a special story about father and daughtera eversweet story about first love a beautiful story about friendship. Above all it's a growing story. Based on Meg's classic story The Princess Diary the motion picture make her characters believelike in another artistic way. Just like having read Margaret's story Gone With The Wind you then watch O'Selznick's GWTW movie. Your feeling will be like I seemed to be a part of the story. Those characters are just and always around you! Clarisse The Sound of Music is recognized as a movie that is priceless so this also recognized the supporting actress's performance is priceless. Julie is an actress that could act well on any characters. The governessthe grandmother or on Broadway etc. Helen Caroline Goodall played a vital role is Mia's growing period. This daughter and mother is a good role model. Because they show the grand respect for each other. Anyone can't grow without friend the princesstoo. From the friendship with Lilly Mia knows how to tell the truth how to apologize and how to deal with something that is uniquely occurred in teenager which is called Growing Pains. Like other reviewers I also feel the last sentence Mia told Michael is Soooooooo...... Cool ! O You saw me when I was invisible. Why we feel cool ? Because that's what true love is. And especially that's what true love is to a princess !! Joe is a person we can't ignore. He acted as a imitate friend to Mia. He told her what she should be. And he is virtually the bodyguard. Oh by the way he is a very very special one ! Some of the songs in The Princess Diary is also memorable. A Summer Song remind me of those romantic school kisses. The final song Miracles Happen is special designed for this movie for Mia and also for all of us. Now I am recommending this movie to YOU from my heart.".

But because Anne Hathaway's character was brought out with a lot of strength all these minor faults seemed invisible. Hector Elizondo was equally good as the chauffeur Joe.

She can't believe that she is the daughter of the deceased Prince of Genovia with his wife Queen Clarisse Renaldi Dame Julie Andrews as Grandmother who tells her she has to decide whether or not to take his place. For a while Mia tries to live normally with this revelation being secret even after being primped up but she is being stalked by the press when the truth is blurted out. It looks like she is convinced of saying no but changes her mind after reading a letter from her father and she is a real princess by the end. Also starring Hector Elizondo as Joe Heather Matarazzo as Lilly Moscovitz Mandy Moore as Lana Thomas Robert Schwartzman as Michael Moscovitz Escape to Witch Mountain's Erik Von Detten as Josh Bryant Sandra Oh as Vice Principal Gupta and Larry Miller as Paolo the Hairdresser. Hathaway in her first film is quite good Andrews brings the usual sweetfaced radiance to her role and while it isn't the funniest family comedy you will see it isn't too bad. Okay!".

My only surmise is that a lot of people thought it would be good and by the time they discovered it wasn't it was too late to get a refund.The story had potential but as usual it was taken to such extremes as to defeat the original purpose.  The melodrama and the predictable bad lines were so consistent that we actually started a betting pool to call what would happen next.  It was the only way to survive watching the film.If this is the sort of thing we allow our children to watch it is no wonder they grow up with their minds made of mush.  There was absolutely no substance to this movie  nothing you could wrap your mind around and think about.  There are good movies out there aimed at teens such as 'Ten things I hate about you' and 'She's all that'.  These movies center around fairly normal people with normal problems mixed in with good lines and imaginative plot twists.  But this movie seems to say that your life will wind up perfect only if your grandmother happens to be a queen and you wind up being a princess.  The only thing you might improve by watching this movie is your ability to groan.".

Well after her wonderful part in Strike!  she was definitely even better than Kirsten Dunst or any other of the teenage casts there  I never saw any other movie of Heather Matarazzo. Now here she is back again and I was surely happy about seeing her again !However the movie itself failed completely.Well no question there was a good cast good acting very nice background. Especially I liked Heathers part closest friend of the princess and the queen and the funny house the princess lives in. Camera and directing itself wasn't bad either. And about that Mandy Moore  she was just as evil and stupid as her character should have been I don't know what else people expected from her.But the story itself was narrated in such an unbelievable boring and lifeless way ! The characters showed nearly no development and appeared lifeless in an unnatural degree. The storyline offered no surprise whatsoever and always took the most obvious way.Interesting smaller roles occur sometimes but offered no surprise either. For example the neighbor of the princess I always expected that something will happen with him but he just stays a little weird with no further characterization.Or the other pupils in school. They just stay the same throughout the whole movie ! Any REAL girl who would switch to such an attractive outfit would get masses of attention from boys. But again the other pupils just stay lifeless around and treat her nearly as if nothing has really changed. That was so unnatural !Same with the princess. Her behavior was so damned predictable all the time.In short the writer of the script absolutely had no clue about real people and made most if not all characters appear flat and superstereotype. Many parts of the script also smelled like an old man's phantasy.There where still some nice little jokes in the script for example when the princess should give an address to her school class or how she damaged some statue. As such the movie wasn't really pain to watch  but I didn't felt very well entertained either.Strike! was a masterpiece I liked it even more than Matrix but this one here is just plain boring. I hope I get the chance to see a better one with Heather soon !".

And what there weren't even any students in for Assembly when Mia threw up? Michael was scarily creepylooking. Josh was  less said about him the better. Julie Andrews was graceful and supportive and beautiful  but HELLO GRANDMERE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE GRACEFUL AND FRIENDLY AND BEAUTIFUL!!! Anne Hathaway as Mia was the only watchable thing about the movie and not even because of her lack of acting skills but because she was at least portraying Mia like in the book.

Hilarity ensues because Mia is pretty much a regular teen who is clumsy awkward and in desperate need of a professional makeover so she spends the next several weeks in etiquette lessons getting redone and trying to decide if being a princess is what she really wants in life. The film was cute at times extremely corny but watcheable.  It featured surprisingly decent acting by Hathaway who made up for the horrible Mandy Moore.  I especially enjoyed Hector Elizondo a good character actor who was kind of hilarious doing his best Shaft impersonation as the Queen's head of security.  Heather Matarazzo who was also featured as Mia's best friend continues in her quirky girl tradition but still can't live up to her role in Welcome to the Dollhouse.  This is one of the few kid's movies that I wouldn't hesitate to watch with a kid because it's tolerable.  It's also so predictable that if you snooze in the middle of it you won't miss anything when you wake up.Shelly".

	schema:reviewBody "Adopting children should be a labor of love. After all if a woman finds herself unable to conceive it would probably be a good idea to let her go anywhere where orphans and children that have been given up for adoption to be reunited with an infant. Well in most cases as we see in this film there are people that profit from this process. It has turned to be a commercial enterprise for many people. We know a few cases where overseas adoptions have cost upwards of 100000.00 when all is taken into account.We meet six American women who have come to Mexico in the hope of adopting children. For one reason or another they haven't been able to have their own babies. The connection is clear in this case the lawyer in charge of the adoption recommend their clients to stay at Posada Santa Marta where the owner Senora Munoz is working with the unscrupulous man. Since the law requires to have a local lawyer most would be mothers have to rely on this intermediary in order to adopt.The six women in the story are so different from one another that it is hard to imagine them socializing had they not been thrown together in the hotel to await for their newly adopted babies. Although we don't get to know them in intimate details we can see their desire to be mothers. The quiet Skipper turns out to be the one who has suffered three dreadful pregnancies in which all three infants had died. Nan a pushy woman is an unhappy camper. Everything irritates her and she lets anyone know about what she thinks about the country and the adoption procedures. Eileen coming from a large Irish family has not been able to conceive. Leslie and Gayle seem to be the best adjusted of the women. Jennifer is the youngest of them all.There are also a couple of stories running parallel to the American women. The most touching story comes from Asuncion one of the maids in the hotel. When Eileen tries to communicate with her the maid not understanding her tells her in Spanish about the way she had to give up her own baby girl for adoption. Also we see what appears to be an upscale woman with her pregnant daughter Celia as the mother weighs her options and how the girl will not have an adoption. Celia who is only fifteen years old evidently had relations with Reynaldo the young stud that roams the beach in search of easy conquests.John Sayles never cease to amaze us with his stories. In this film he tackles the commerce that goes on in the adoption process. At the same time he makes a case for how complicated the whole thing is and how these would be mothers have to face as these young infants grow in an environment that stands in sharp contrast with the street children he brings into the movie. Those children are desperately in need for adoption yet their own society or would be parents will bypass them in favor of the ones that can only be obtained in a legal manner.The ensemble cast does wonders under Mr. Sayles direction. Best of all is Marcia Gay Harden as the pathetic Nan a prototype of the ugly American abroad. Daryl Hannah has some excellent moments as Skipper. Lili Taylor Mary Steenburgen Maggie Gyllenhaal are fine. Susan Lynch has a great moment as she tries to talk with the maid. Vanessa Martinez gives a good rendition of her character Asuncion. Rita Moreno is also seen as the owner of the hotel.Casa de los Babys takes an excellent view at the thorny issue of adoptions.".

Rita Moreno through her frustration with her husband's politics voices the frustration of so many women politics is one thing but who'll take care of the kids? And of course the reverse is implied as well kids are one thing but who'll take care of the politics? You can go through each of the characters and seem some inherent pull in opposite directions.I loved that none of the characters is entirely sympathetic except perhaps the three homeless boys. They are all complicated and corrupted by a complicated and corrupt world that places a premium on babies and motherhood but only under the right circumstances for the right women and the right kids. I was very grateful that there was no real closure at the end and that all Sayles had to say was that despite all both the least sympathetic and the most sympathetic of the potential moms were about to leave with babies. Anyone who cares about kids and women should see this movie. And certainly anyone who is considering adoption domestic or international  either way it's all the same issues should see it.

	schema:reviewBody "John Sayles always an intriguing filmmaker has come up with yet another conversationstarting film in Casa de los Babys a subtle exploration of the great divide that separates the haves from the havenots in this maddeningly imbalanced world of ours. Sayles sets his story at a hotel in South America one designed to cater specifically to American women who are waiting to adopt children to take back with them to the States. Due to bureaucratic red tape many of the ladies Sayles introduces us to have been holed up in the hotel for months. Except for contact with the resort staff and the occasional foray into the local neighborhood the women are essentially sealed off from the cultural and socioeconomic realities of the world around them.The thing that separates Sayles' work from that of so many other socially conscious filmmakers is that he is scrupulously fair in his approach refusing to pigeonhole any one group of people while allowing us to see the imperfections and humanity inherent in those on both sides of the divide. It would have been so easy for him to have portrayed the women as merely spoiled Americans exploiting the poor of the world for their own selfish benefit. Indeed one of the men who helps run the hotel decries the ladies as gringo imperialists looking to buy Hispanic babies as if they were strolling through the local market. Yet his mother who manages the resort and who also resents the imperialistic tone of some of the women is pragmatic enough to know that this is a business like any other and that the alternative for many of these orphans would be far grimmer if they were forced to fend for themselves out on the streets. In fact the children in the facility who are well cared for and who have some hope for the future are in direct counterpoint to all the youngsters we see who are living in cardboard boxes forced to wash windshields beg from tourists or steal to survive.Of the American women the most interesting is Nan beautifully played by Marcia Gay Harden who is the most obnoxiously pushy and least culturally sensitive of the group. We get the feeling that the moment she gets her hands on her new child she will go to work draining every ounce of ethnicity from his or her soul and spirit. The other women are all far more open and tolerant than she is being mainly concerned with filling that childless void located deep within themselves. The film is in large part a series of revealing conversations in which the women voice their fears concerns visions and hopes about life as a parent.The movie does an interesting job conveying the universality of motherhood for despite the economic and language barriers that separate them both the women yearning for babies and the women being forced to give their babies up for adoption are able to meet on the common ground of maternity.In addition to Harden there are excellent performances from Mary Steenbergen Lili Taylor Daryl Hannah Maggie Gyllenhall and Susan Lynch as the American women and Rita Moreno as the hotel manager who understands how the world works even if she doesn't fully approve of it. Each actress manages to create an interesting fully realized character out of only a limited amount of screen time.If there's a criticism to be leveled against the film it is that Sayles leaves a few too many loose ends hanging at the end. As a storyteller he has never been all that interested in conventional narrative so this shouldn't surprise us but we do sense that he could have gone a bit further with his characters here. As it is Casa de los Babys feels somewhat incomplete more like an exercise  albeit a fascinating one  than a fullfledged drama. Still for its cleareyed threedimensional and nonjudgmental take on a tricky subject Casa de los Babys is a film well worth seeing.".

The film is in large part a series of revealing conversations in which the women voice their fears concerns visions and hopes about life as a parent.The movie does an interesting job conveying the universality of motherhood for despite the economic and language barriers that separate them both the women yearning for babies and the women being forced to give their babies up for adoption are able to meet on the common ground of maternity.In addition to Harden there are excellent performances from Mary Steenbergen Lili Taylor Daryl Hannah Maggie Gyllenhall and Susan Lynch as the American women and Rita Moreno as the hotel manager who understands how the world works even if she doesn't fully approve of it. Each actress manages to create an interesting fully realized character out of only a limited amount of screen time.If there's a criticism to be leveled against the film it is that Sayles leaves a few too many loose ends hanging at the end. As a storyteller he has never been all that interested in conventional narrative so this shouldn't surprise us but we do sense that he could have gone a bit further with his characters here. As it is Casa de los Babys feels somewhat incomplete more like an exercise  albeit a fascinating one  than a fullfledged drama. Still for its cleareyed threedimensional and nonjudgmental take on a tricky subject Casa de los Babys is a film well worth seeing.";

Also we have the fact that those women from the first world have come to a third world country in order to adopt a child. With 4 or 5 sequences Sayles perfectly explains WHY Mxico is a country where people comes to adopt children to and why thousands of mexican women have to get rid of their babys. We see children of the street 7 or 8 years old homeless kids robbing and taking drugsyoung girls getting pregnant and being forced to give their babys away in a Catholic country just like Mxico abortion ain't an option men that cannot find a job and the corruption that hides in third world countries' bureaucracy. Well so many things to thing about. We need more movies just like this one. Social cinema Ken Loach Frears Len de Aranoa is frowned upon by some people maybe because it makes them fell guilty.And what to say about the cast? The five starring actresses may not be the most handsome nor the most famous may not have the best bodies... But let me tell you something this is the best female cast in years. If the Oscar's were for real they should give a goddamn golden little naked man to each and every one of the women that appear in Casa De Los Babys. Not only to the anglosaxon ones but also to the mexican cast. If you don't care about third world's penuries nor about people's personal dramas you should go and watch Casa De Los Babys just to know what it means to be an ACTRESS.My rate 810".

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoy Sayles because he always gives you more than you expect. This film is about 6 women trying to adopt children from Mexico but it is also a commentary on many aspects of a life we as Americans may never understand. One plot line is that of the young maid at the hotel who is raising her 2 younger siblings and has given her own child up for adoption. Another plot details the lives of 3 brothers who talk about their mother but appear to live alone on the streets huffing spray paint and sleeping on the beach. Still another plot involves the son of the hotel owner who is convinced that the adoption of Mexican babies by Americans is imperialism at its peak. His mother who owns the hotel reveals her feelings when she talks about how easily men get caught up in politics her own husband is banned from the state and has taken up with a young Spanish girl leaving her to run the hotel and adoption service by herself. Meanwhile the viewer finds out the motivation of each woman who is seeking to adopt. The women are somewhat catty and mean but are under a lot of stress as they have been in Mexico for 2 months already. All in all a wonderful film. Sayles offers a true if not depressing view of life in Mexico especially for women. This life is in sharp contrast with the woes of the American women and it really makes you think about our lives here.".

People can spend hours with each other but if they don't understand each others' language they don't know each other. This is in direct contradiction to the comments of many viewers including Roger Ebert! that emotions can connect people.So I want to apply that to the mostdiscussed scene in the film the monologues between Eileen and Asuncion.SPOILERS RIGHT HERE!Eileen rhapsodizes about finally having a child and being able to be the good mother she always has dreamed about. Asuncion understanding nothing listens with great empathy. Empathy it seems because she too had to give up a baby not long ago. So she hears the earnestness in Eileen and imagines that her child is with a mother like Eileen without understanding whether Eileen is really going to be a good mother. But Asuncion is grieving and Eileen knows nothing of this. What good is it to feel empathy for tears if you don't know what provokes the tears?If I were to change anything in this film I would have added more sympathetic qualities to Nan.

There was no violence no sex no twisted plot in it. However it is the kind that takes the viewers to different worlds  the worlds of the wouldbe mothers of the poor in Mexico of foreign adoption and of government bureaucracy.We need more films of this nature  films that give you a new experience films that explore human emotions films that educate and films that dig deep to explore.

I had avoided this movie as many critics had trashed it and for no good reason that I could ascertain.The story features six very different American women who have come to Mexico in the hope of adopting children due to their own inability and in one case lack of desireto conceive. The lawyer in charge of these adoptions and the owner of the resort where they stay are brother and sister and in it for the money of course. Rita Moreno whom I haven't seen in years and years plays the sister running the hotel.The movie is not so much about the stories of the women but about the layering of multiple stories in Mexico. Mexico is never specified but the town portrayed is Acapulco. The homeless beggar children of the street are shown the maids of the resort coming to work from the mountains every day a fifteen year old on the verge of giving up her child for adoption an educated engineer who can't seem to find work anywhere and dreams of Philadelphia.Over the few months or so that the women have to stay in the resort they begin to bond with one another. John Sayles gets amazing performances out of the actresses Mary Steenbergen Darryl Hannah Susan Lynch Marca Gay Harden Maggie Gyllenhall and Lili Taylor. He throws a compassionate eye over the whole process of the adopting of children from one country who sometimes have to abandon their genetic tribal and cultural origins in their new home.It begs the question of how a country such as Canada or the U.S. would react if Mexicans came here to adopt our unwanted children.Casa de los Babys is a refreshing take on a very difficult subject and brings honesty and compassion to a heartbreaking topic. 8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Warning spoilers all over the place! This movie is the story of several women waiting in an unidentified Latin American country for adoptions to be processed. In the meantime they stay in a hotel called locally the Casa de Los Babys no translation required I hope. It's a starstudded cast including Marcia Gay Harden Daryl Hannah Mary Steenburgen Lili Taylor and Maggie Gyllenhaal. The one remaining mother is played by a relative unknown the Irish actress Susan Lynch playing an Irish woman who is trying to adopt a baby despite much shorter funds than the Americans. Much of the movie consists of the women gossiping about and backbiting any woman who isn't present. Lili Taylor takes a lot of shots for adopting without a male partner and Daryl Hannah gets the usual digs any pretty woman with a nice body can expect from other women when she's not around. She's also a bit of a loner and later on we find out some good reasons why. Marcia Gay Harden plays a bitchy woman who refuses to make any serious allowances for local customs or for ethics in general. She does some smalltime pilfering from the maid's cart and is ready to bribe officials if that's what it takes to get her baby. Gyllenhaal plays a woman whose marriage is a bit rocky. Steenburgen is a recovering alcoholic which she apparently keeps secret in order not to create another hurdle to getting her baby. During a moment when both Gyllenhaal and Hannah let down their hair and reveal some inner thoughts and secrets we learn that Hannah has lost three babies one to stillbirth and two to birth defects. The Irish woman's husband is freelancing i.e. between jobs which in part explains her money problems. She misses meals orders water instead of soda or alcohol and pinches pennies whenever possible. The movie would just be a mere account of four women waiting for babies were it not for Sayles' contrasting of them with the locals. There is an unsympathetic son of the hotel's owner. He's a Marxist who sees the women as members of an oppressive imperialist class. Then there is one of the maids who we learn had to give up her own baby to a northerner but raises her younger brother and sister in place of her dead parents. She and the Irish woman in a touching scene each tell their own hope and dreamfilled stories in a pair of soliloquies that neither one cam understand. Lili Taylor and Daryl Hannah meet a man who acts as their guide for the day. He is quite erudite about the history of his country and reasonably fluent in English which he says he learned from TV. His fee 4. I'm not sure we are supposed to see the problems of the mothersinwaiting is minor compared with those of the locals but it's hard not to look at it that way. In many parts of the world mothers are burdened with too many children. And here in this nameless country mothers who would desperately like to keep their babies must give them away or sell them so that Englishspeaking northerners can have them. In the end the first of the women to get her baby is Marcia Gay Harden who basically annoys the authorities into giving her one and the Irish woman who may have gotten her baby because she was running out of money and it does seem that keeping the mothers there is a way to soak them for dough. Since she's running out of cash and can't be soaked. The verdict Because it gives us some serious things to think about this movie rises well above what it might have been a MadeForTheOxygenChannel movie of the week.".

Here we get another sliceoflife film centered around a modern phenomenon that is rife with controversy. While Sayles displays some leanings I disagree with others here that Casa is a strident PC harangue. Instead it seems to me that Sayles is intentionally striving to steer clear of any easy answers as frustrating as that might be for some of his audience.At least part of the film is looking at borders between people classes and nations. Additionally there is the border between right and wrong which may be as permeable as the others. He's working with a tremendous cast Marcia Gay Harden is mighty talented but unlike the others I don't think she ever finds her way to the heart of her character. But then her character is the most duplicitous of the bunch.But it is indeed a bunch of characters. Each of the six mothersinwaiting has her own tale. Additionally toss in some less lucky  abandoned children as huffing street urchins an adult looking to illegally adopt Philadephia as his home and a complicated motherson relationship with Rita Moreno and........como se dice phew en espanol?This sliceoflife is perhaps a bit too large to fit on the plate that is serving it. It does help that the six women are at least united in a common quest. But like with The Sunshine State I feel this could be an outstanding part of a trilogy. Another shared positive similarity that monologues here deliver the most memorable parts of the film. Albeit here the monologues are cleverly presented with both Susan Lynch and Vanessa Martinez in the same room at the same time...still separated by a border of language.I respect Sayles appreciation of complexity especially as he favors a film that is pregnant with questions rather than delivering a simple answer. However it's his predilection towards a complex ensemble cast that I think may undermine his films as of late. His success as a writereditorjuggler is something to watch but as a viewer I would like to have had less characters up in the air and more in hand for longer periods.One last comment I could enjoy Sayles films with my eyes closed...not just for those aforementioned monologues and in general his ear but his skill in selecting music is noteworthy.610".

	schema:headline " The story could almost be a faux documentary.";
	schema:reviewBody "John Sayles' Casa de los Babys' is a strange film even for the eccentric director of such arthouse favorites as Matewan' and Lone Star.' Strange because I can't tell where he's coming from  Does his film show in typically oblique Sayles' fashion the exploitation of women waiting to adopt children from Latin America? Or is it homage to the industry that delivers babies to needy gringo women?Or is his juxtaposition of scenes with waitingmoms and the careless promiscuity of Latino youths producing unwanted babies transcending this locale into the human irony of those who can't have and those who carelessly have.Probably both although it is hard to sympathize with the Marcia GayHarden character who lies and steals toiletries from the maid's cart and exhibits questionable activity with the dolls she uses to practice for motherhood. Her ''Believe me you don't want my husband to have to come down here!'' exclamation is chilling because you know she can cause the trouble.Darryl Hannah's athletic masseuse mom is the most memorable as her loss of 3 children after childbirth is slowly revealed to a skeptical flock of waiting mom wanabees. Susan Lynch's Irish girl has a soulful exchange with a Latina maid that is poignant because neither understands the other's language but each clearly understands the longing for motherhood.With little climactic activity and too many separate actions and characters the story could almost be a faux documentary and its theme is just about as buried as a welldone news piece from CNN. Although it is not the obviously political Sunshine State' it carries weight about the two cultures which serve each other.  Again the Harden character offers the jaundiced point of view They're making us pay for our babies with the balance of trade.It is possible Sayles is praising women who wait so long and so promisingly for someone else's children.  Shakespeare says it succinctly Let her never nurse her child herself for she will breed it like a fool.'".

	onyx:emotionText "John Sayles' Casa de los Babys' is a strange film even for the eccentric director of such arthouse favorites as Matewan' and Lone Star.' Strange because I can't tell where he's coming from  Does his film show in typically oblique Sayles' fashion the exploitation of women waiting to adopt children from Latin America? Or is it homage to the industry that delivers babies to needy gringo women?Or is his juxtaposition of scenes with waitingmoms and the careless promiscuity of Latino youths producing unwanted babies transcending this locale into the human irony of those who can't have and those who carelessly have.Probably both although it is hard to sympathize with the Marcia GayHarden character who lies and steals toiletries from the maid's cart and exhibits questionable activity with the dolls she uses to practice for motherhood. Her ''Believe me you don't want my husband to have to come down here!'' exclamation is chilling because you know she can cause the trouble.Darryl Hannah's athletic masseuse mom is the most memorable as her loss of 3 children after childbirth is slowly revealed to a skeptical flock of waiting mom wanabees. Susan Lynch's Irish girl has a soulful exchange with a Latina maid that is poignant because neither understands the other's language but each clearly understands the longing for motherhood.With little climactic activity and too many separate actions and characters the story could almost be a faux documentary and its theme is just about as buried as a welldone news piece from CNN. Although it is not the obviously political Sunshine State' it carries weight about the two cultures which serve each other.  Again the Harden character offers the jaundiced point of view They're making us pay for our babies with the balance of trade.It is possible Sayles is praising women who wait so long and so promisingly for someone else's children.  Shakespeare says it succinctly Let her never nurse her child herself for she will breed it like a fool.'";

Those of you who have read my reviews before will know that I tend to be more inclined to view the Hollywood smash mouth explosion movie and leave the more subtle viewing to others.  I will reluctantly say that trend will still have to occur.possible spoilersJohn Sayles wrote directed and edited this movie about six women dealing with an extremely trying and emotional time in their lives.  The time leading up to receiving their adopted child.  The movie takes place in an unnamed Latin American location and focuses on what appears to be one day in the life of these women. They are all staying at the same Hotel the aforementioned Casa de los Babys and are waiting anxiously for the last minute paper work demons to be vanquished.  It appears that the women may have been in this location for months rumor has it that this was supposed to be a six month time period but really we are only left to feel their desperation during one day.  We see the activities that some do to kill time as well as learn something about each of their backgrounds and what impact this adoption has had or may be having on their life here in the country as well as back home in America.Having a beautiful little girl from Guatemala I really wanted to like this movie.  As it is I can say that it kept my interest but ultimately left me with too many unanswered questions and a feeling that I had seen adoption lite.  Sayles seems to have tried to incorporate too many different subplots within the movie.  I realize that some were done to try and show the condition of the country the dreams of people trying to better themselves and the lives of the unwanted children on the street but these stories were poorly written and went no were.  It seems that Sayles could also have been taking a swipe at foreign adoption with the repeated allegations of bribes that need take place yet in a piece of incomprehensible writing he turns and has the one person who has offered large amounts of money to her lawyer be the first to leave with a child. This of course comes after her lawyer has muttered that she will never leave with a child.  That also brings up the ending which leaves with no sense of resolution.  Frankly I found the writing to be the weakest part of the movie.On the plus side the actresses involved all did great jobs.  The cast was made up of Daryl Hannah Mary Steenburgen Marcia Gay Harden Lilli Taylor Maggie Gyllenhal and Rita Moreno.  All the actresses brought subtle nuances to their characters which told more of who they were than the script allowed one to see.  Rita Moreno probably stole the show with her performance as the owner of the Casa. 24".

On the Special Features on the DVD Sayes tells us how he has spent so much time in South America and really knows the people.   Yet his political perspective on the international adoption process is extremely one sided and very antiadoption.  Seems like he just met the Che Guevera segment of South America the gringos are stealing our babies.  This is a uniquely bad experience for me from all his movies.   I always felt that I had a total experience from each one of them not just one extreme point of view.

The more he shows his affection the more ostentatiously she rejects him. Even so he doesn't give up on her because her lover Lorenzo has grave gaming debts. In return for the required money Lorenzo tells Casanova about a looming secret rendezvous with Marcelina. Moreover he lets Casanova take his place. Undercover of the night Casanova finally seduces her. Lorenzo later feels his honor was besmirched and demands satisfaction.";

	schema:headline " a grandiose adieu from Alain Delon the seducer";
	schema:reviewBody "Those who saw the everfamous French police adventure films during 60s and 70s probably remember some few figures very well.  I mean the films were also great but some faces were as great and representative of those days. Alain Delon was certainly the leading one among them.  He always was the man of those films.  A unique combination of iceblue eyes French arrogance and a bit of Meditterannean womanizer.  He always had that air on him.  The Man of ultimate beauty. Today there are stars like Brad Pitt George Clooney Ralp Fiennes who might be at the equal ground as Delon once played but none of them come closer to his aura.  He was a unique formula and that formula only worked around Europe and Far East.  Delon made several films in his career. He had his full actions loved many women killed many men got killed sevral times.  Naturally like everyone in this universe he's had his screen time come to an end.  He is no longer the ultimate seducer his looks don't penetrate as before his face gathered wrinkles the glimmer in his eyes faded.  Unlike some others Delon took all this natural process in piece.  He didn't dye his hair didn't have any surgical operation to make him look artificially younger.  He took the hard fact of being old like the brave men he portrayed in his films.  It is a pity that although he still lives we no longer can watch such a star on the silver screen.But this is the last film he delivers the last remittances of his ever famous qualities.  Casanova is a perfect match for Delon. He should have played the younger Casanova during 60s or 70s when he was at his best appearance levels.  But this film also works very well for him.  He is an aged Casanova who is getting towards the end of his usuall career and he wants to put an end to this via his last seduction.  The Return of Casanova is a very nicely designed film with carefully delivered details of the time Casanova lived.  The scene where Casanova delivers a mission to the landlady is incredibly nice.  Delon unlike most of his films also delivers a very deep acting.  Most importantly the screen images he throws fits perfectly well with the Casanova role.  Some parts of this film reminded me of Kubrick's masterpiece called Barry Lyndon particularly in some interior scenes.  Unlike Barry Lyndon this films lacks some of the filmographic qualities such as music.  It could have been a true masterpiece if the director thought of using some of the classic tunes of the time to match with the heavy atmosphere of the time.  The duel at the end and Casanova's final arrival to Venice with his wonderful blue hat could have been much greater if the cinematography and music were enhanced.  Delon had given his most dramatic looks but the director didn't spend enough screentime and didn't add some dramatic music to go with it.In summary if you are among the ultimate Delon fans don't miss this film because this would be the last where you can feel Delon's everfamous aura watch his icecold blue eyes glimmering for a last seduction.  Adieu Delon the ultimate seducer.  Women will miss you a lot.P.S. this film can be obtained from online stores in a dvd format with several bonus trailers of other Delon films but the pity was that the film didn't have English subtitles like many of Delon films released recently in dvd format in France.".

	schema:headline " Great film if you haven't read the book";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an entertaining movie that goes over two hours but I really don't understand why it was made. Sprawling stories spanning several decades with several subplots involving dozens of characters are totally defensible on the printed page where we can always go back and remind ourselves which character is which and how this character is related to that one. But this type of thing makes no sense whatsoever in a film. Unless a viewer has a phenomenal memory such a story on film invariably leads to confusion and to my asking myself now wait a minute whose brother is this and whose son?So that is one of the principal problems with this film.There are several other problems as well. Reese Witherspoon is badly miscast. She simply lacks Becky Sharp's bite. In fact the whole film lacks Thackeray's bite. Reese does a good job with the British accent but it just doesn't work. She is just too American for the role. Weren't there any British actresses available or were the producers just relying on Reese's star power? Reese is just too nice to play Becky.It has often been said that Becky Sharp was the model for Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With the Wind although Margaret Mitchell denied this. Even so I kept visualizing Vivien Leigh in this role and imagining how perfect she would have been. I think Mira Nair was thinking of GWTW as well because there are several scenes in the film that are obvious homages to it. First there are the battle scenes during the Battle of Waterloo followed by a panoramic view of the carnage following the battle complete with corpses strewn all over the battlefield. This was an obvious homage to the crane shot over Atlanta in GWTW. The final fight between Becky and her husband reminded me of the final fight between Scarlett and Rhett in GWTW. I half expected the husband to say Frankly my dear I don't give a damn.Another flaw involves the Indian director Nair's inability to resist bringing in some Bollywood type scenes particularly one involving Becky leading an Indian type dance with Indian music before the king no less and to thunderous applause.And yet another thing this film spans at least twenty maybe twentyfive or thirty years in Becky's life after she graduates from finishing schoolI am not counting the one scene of her as a childyet the character never ages.

	onyx:emotionText "This is an entertaining movie that goes over two hours but I really don't understand why it was made. Sprawling stories spanning several decades with several subplots involving dozens of characters are totally defensible on the printed page where we can always go back and remind ourselves which character is which and how this character is related to that one. But this type of thing makes no sense whatsoever in a film. Unless a viewer has a phenomenal memory such a story on film invariably leads to confusion and to my asking myself now wait a minute whose brother is this and whose son?So that is one of the principal problems with this film.There are several other problems as well. Reese Witherspoon is badly miscast. She simply lacks Becky Sharp's bite. In fact the whole film lacks Thackeray's bite. Reese does a good job with the British accent but it just doesn't work. She is just too American for the role. Weren't there any British actresses available or were the producers just relying on Reese's star power? Reese is just too nice to play Becky.It has often been said that Becky Sharp was the model for Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With the Wind although Margaret Mitchell denied this. Even so I kept visualizing Vivien Leigh in this role and imagining how perfect she would have been. I think Mira Nair was thinking of GWTW as well because there are several scenes in the film that are obvious homages to it. First there are the battle scenes during the Battle of Waterloo followed by a panoramic view of the carnage following the battle complete with corpses strewn all over the battlefield. This was an obvious homage to the crane shot over Atlanta in GWTW. The final fight between Becky and her husband reminded me of the final fight between Scarlett and Rhett in GWTW. I half expected the husband to say Frankly my dear I don't give a damn.Another flaw involves the Indian director Nair's inability to resist bringing in some Bollywood type scenes particularly one involving Becky leading an Indian type dance with Indian music before the king no less and to thunderous applause.And yet another thing this film spans at least twenty maybe twentyfive or thirty years in Becky's life after she graduates from finishing schoolI am not counting the one scene of her as a childyet the character never ages. Neither do any of the other characters. Maybe the makeup staff went on strike?But most of these problems won't even be noted by someone who hasn't read the book so if you haven't go ahead and see it you'll probably be entertained. And if you are someone like me who loves the book you may not be able to resist seeing it anyway. But Thackeray was never so soft.";

At just over two hours this film cannot deal in depth with the many characters in the story and has to content itself with hitting the high points which make for a very condensed telling suited to those who only wish the flavor of the story. Those with a particular interest in Victorian pulp fiction or more expansive dramas should turn to the BBC's 1998 six hour miniseries which offers greater character depth a presentation much more true to the period and a very much better cast.

	schema:reviewBody "If Becky Sharp Georgian England's conniving calculating social climber had a contemporary equivalent it surely would be Tracy Flick the deliciously ambitious high school student played delightfully by Reese Witherspoon in the acerbic comedy Election 1999.Director Mira Nair has said what made Witherspoon the ideal Becky Sharp was the actress' American energy and sassiness. Fair enough. But why did Nair then tame that energy and sass? We see none of it in Witherspoon's Becky. This isn't the feisty actress who proved she could play edgy and biting in Election and Freeway 1996. This is Elle Woods as Becky thanks to Nair's misguided decision to turn Becky into an appealing feminist.I'm not averse to directors stamping their distinct styles on literary works mixing film styles or modernizing old works. But you don't change the work's crucial essence. You don't transform Goneril and Regan into caring daughters for instance.That's where Nair's take on William Makepeace Thackeray fails miserably.She and Oscarwinning screenwriter Julian Fellowes  the two other credited writers Matthew Faulk and Mark Skeet reportedly disowned the film alleging the shooting script bore no resemblance to their work  have stripped Becky of all her viciousness and cunning. They've declawed her in a ridiculous attempt to make her likable.In interviews Nair and Witherspoon insist they didn't want to make a typical bonnet film. Fine. But you also shouldn't make a film that doesn't know what it wants to be and lacks emotional resonance. And that's what Nair's film is.It sparkles for about a halfhour or so as we see a young Becky played pluckily by Angelica Mandy then the older Becky Witherspoon leaving school with her friend Amelia Romola Garai and meeting among others Dobbin Rhys Ifans and George Osborne Jonathan RhysMeyers. Later Becky becomes Sir Pitt Crawley's Bob Hoskins governess and meets her future husband Rawdon James Purefoy and Matilda Eileen Atkins.But once Becky heads to London the film screeches to a halt. With no one seemingly knowing what the emotional tone should be and the story's harshness and satiric edge excised the film grinds at a snail's pace the actors slowly sapping all the energy out of it. A scene between Becky and George at the piano should be tart their words should sting. Instead the two actors labor with the dialogue and make the moment as sharp as a dull razor.Adapting Thackeray's massive novel into a feature film was never going to be easy. But Nair gets more wrong than right. With the exception of the children none of the characters age. Gabriel Byrne looks the same at the end of the film as he did in the beginning which takes place 40 years earlier. Witherspoon Garai Hoskins Ifans Purefoy and RhysMeyers also show no hint of aging. And in an attempt to condense the story important characters  Amelia and Dobbin for instance  disappear for long periods and show up solely to wrap up subplots.The highlights are Declan Quinn's striking cinematography performances by Hoskins and Atkins the only two who seem to be having any fun and a superbly restrained Ifans playing convincingly against type.Much has been made about the Indian influence in Nair's story. There's nothing wrong with them being in the film. Thackeray was born in Calcutta and the colony's impact was evinced in Georgian English society. Not only do Nair's Indian touches make the film seem more vibrant but the peacocks parrots and Indian musicians costumes and servants also make provocative statements about the exploitation of India and how the British Empire amassed its wealth. However no matter how exotic it seems Becky's dance just doesn't work and seems like nothing more than an imprudent attempt to add a foreign film style into this period piece.Witherspoon whose English accent falters occasionally works commendably but ultimately remains unconvincing through no fault of her own really. You don't take someone who quips Revenge may be wicked but it's perfectly natural and turn her into a sweet amiable victim. Witherspoon isn't even remotely as devious as Nair would want us to believe. It's unlikely another actress say Kate Winslet or Kate Beckinsale would have fared any better for she'd have worked with the same script and Nair's foolhardy direction which includes inexplicably asking Geraldine McEwan to not so much speak her lines as to squeal them highpitched making the veteran actress' Lady Southdown needlessly irritating.This film remains so emotionally lackadaisical that when Becky finally breaks down before Rawdon it seems more like a For Your OscarConsideration moment for Witherspoon than anything else. By softening Becky making her more alluring than calculating Nair destroyed the story's spirit. She and Fellowes also tacked on a ludicrous ending.As botched film adaptations of literary works go Vanity Fair isn't nearly as execrable as Roland Joff's The Scarlet Letter 1995. But I'm confounded as to how the skilled storyteller of Salaam Bombay! 1988 and Monsoon Wedding 2001 could have gone so horridly wrong.".

The rich period in which the action takes place comes alive in the screen as a feast of colors which in a way compensate for the failings on the story and in the way Ms. Nair conceived the way she wanted to tell this tale about an ambitious young woman who is the epitome of social climbing. As a character puts in the film Becky Sharp would be a perfect mountaineer.Part of what is wrong with the film is Reese Witherspoon in the central role. Not that her interpretation is wrong it's that she doesn't project the character of Becky Sharp with an intensity that another actress might have brought to the role. In part this might not have been Ms. Witherspoon's fault but the director's in the way she guided the key performance.The other failure of the film lies in the last scenes in which one finds Becky in BadenBaden. Becky Amelia and Dobbins haven't aged one iota. For the sake of realism a bit of old age makeup should have been applied to these actors or else one might believe in the curative waters of that German spa.

It saddens me to know that a generation of young people will watch this film and assume that Nair's vision of the story is a correct one. It also upsets me that several of the most entertaining scenes in the novel were altered or completely left out for the sake of forcing us to endure Reese Witherspoon's mediocre lip syncing in at least three separate musical numbers. Sure in the novel Becky could sing... but she was also a heartless sociopath who would do anything to get ahead. Out of the two personality traits I believe Thackeray would rather us know the latter instead of the former. 'Vanity Fair' the novel is a sharp and often hilarious social commentary. 'Vanity Fair' the 2004 movie is a dull and often intellectually insulting piece of weepie dreck.

	schema:headline " Both a visual feast and a welltold heartbreaking story";
	schema:reviewBody "'Vanity Fair' is the perfect title for this story showing us a world of cold characters with impersonal motives a world where marriage is just another move in a chess game where the opponent is poverty and perhaps more importantly unpopularity. At the center of this movie is Becky Sharp Reese Witherspoon a beautiful blonde from a terribly poor family her father was a talented but poor artist. We meet her first when she is a young girl and we see that she is already stubborn and manipulative when she demands ten guineas for a portrait of her mother that is being sold to a wealthy aristocrat Gabriel Byrne for four. He agrees probably not because he thinks it's worth it but because he admires the fire and spirit in the young girl. He'll come into play later.We see her next after completing finishing school and being sent off to be a governess for Sir Pitt Crawley Bob Hoskins a scruffy old man who's just barely getting by with a dusty mansion and rude servants. She leaves for Pitt with her friend Amelia Romola Garai who is engaged to an officer George Osborne Jonathan RhysMeyers. Amelia's engagement does not stop her from talking to Becky about the benefits of marrying a wealthy man and it is here that we first see the mindset of most of the women in the film. Since they don't have many promising career prospects those were for the men they want to seduce a rich man to gain wealth and popularity and happiness too I guess.And Becky is great at playing the game. When she stays with Amelia's family in London before going to the Crawleys she meets Amelia's awkward and heavy brother Tony Maudsley a wealthy man from India and starts a seduction that is in a way kind of obvious but she knows that the insecure Joseph couldn't possibly see through it. And he doesn't he wants to marry her and she wants that but it's George who talks him out of it.So Becky is finished with her detour and moves to the Crawley's where she teaches his kids perfect French and even cleans up the mansion when his wealthy sister Matilde Eileen Atkins arrives. Matilde is an undeniable snob who claims to have a romantic heart but with mean putdowns ready for everyone in the house. She takes a liking to Becky for her own cleverness and invites her to live with her and her nephew Rawdon Crawley James Purefoy in London. Becky accepts of course it's another step up.So she is back in London and reunites with Amelia George and George's soldier friend William Dobbin Rhys Ifans. She also recognizes Matilde's neighbor Lord Steyne the man who bought her mother's portrait all those years ago. She's back in the game but she falls prey to her heart and elopes with Rawdon angering Matilde enough to cut Rawdon out of her will she loves romantic stories she says but not in real life!.Becky hasn't been completely consumed by her love though. She still has that cunning agenda of her own which includes getting pregnant in hopes of gaining sympathy from Matilde and attending all the major parties shows and banquets in London despite her lower class.But Rawdon is a gambler and their wealth and public image starts to drop significantly. This is when we see the extent of Becky's agenda when she accepts Steyne as her mentor despite his A being a horrible man and B clearly wanting Becky for his bedroom not his student. But Steyne is seductive in his own right and buys Becky the most expensive and beautiful jewelry shows her to great parties and even casts her as the lead in a dance show he directed. Their relationship is one of the most intriguing points of the film kind of similar to that of Fast Eddie Felson and Bert Gordon and Laura Hunt and Waldo Lydecker.Despite most of its characters being cunning and sinister 'Vanity Fair' is a distinctly moral movie. Pitt Crawley Jr. Douglas Hodge is awkward and kind of dull but his honesty and kindness gives him a stable happy life and Joseph's own earnestness pays off for him in the end. But the most important is the story of William Dobbin's undying love for Amelia and how he's so gentlemanly about it. He doesn't urge her into adultery and when she mistakes a piano he's bought for her for a present from George he doesn't correct her. I won't say how this story ends but it'll most likely pull a tear from the girls in the audience. Ifans' is a fantastic heartbreaking performance the best of the movie.Mira Nair's direction is awesome as well what other director could make a passable even good glittery bellydancing scene in a Victorian drama. The Oscar for costume design will most certainly go to this and its set design makes the best competition to 'The Terminal' so far this year.As for acting Oscars well the way the movie switches from story to story doesn't quite let us get to know most of the characters but some great performances can still be found here. Particularly Rhys Ifans whose performance is so quiet and strong and Eileen Atkins who is perfect and hilarious a true scenestealer of her performance and maybe even Byrne too.And then there's Witherspoon in one of her best performances as Becky Sharp the girl who after learning her lesson by the end is so stubborn that she's at it again 7.510.".

	schema:headline " CurryFlavored Thackeray With an Incongruous Lead";
	schema:reviewBody "In many ways director Mira Nair is a daring imaginative choice to helm this latest film adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray's classic novel of social mores in early 19th century England. But the end result of her vision is on the whole rather disappointing. What could have been an energetic distillation of the book's themes turns into a lengthy episodic movie suffering from poor pacing and softened characters. It is a feast for the eyes though as it appears Nair is intent on bringing her native India into the film as much as possible from the brightly colored period costumes to the contemporarylooking exotic dance at the Marquess of Steyne's party with very anachronistic Rai music in the background to the happy ending atop an elephant in Jodhpur. All these references remain true to the Calcuttaborn author's story and actually they feed into the English imagination of what India meant to them at the time. At the same time the images are too overwhelming to make the basic story of Becky Sharp resonate as it should. Her evolution is the heart of the story as she moves from finishing school outsider to resourceful governess to brave captain's wife to fallen woman in a casino. It's a long rocky journey almost too long for a 137minute movie to bear as it turns out. Nair however also has a good handle on the comic banter among the characters and it certainly helps that she has assembled a Who's Who of British stage and film in all the roles except the primary one.As Becky Reese Witherspoon gives it a valiant effort and perfects her British accent to Gwyneth Paltrow's standards but she seems to be channeling a hybrid of her Elle Woods Legally Blonde and her Tracy Flick in Alexander Payne's Election by way of Kate Winslet in Sense and Sensibility. When facing down her opponents in her climb upward especially in the early scenes the performance seems right. But when her character takes on Scarlett O'Hara dimensions in wartime suffering and acts of betrayal she seems young and overwhelmed and her reactions come across as too modern to be true to the character's evolution as intended. This anomaly results in a Becky Sharp who is not so much an ambitious social climber but a plucky heroine for the underclasses a textbook example of a Tony Robbins motivational seminar. This transformation may seem endearing to those looking for nicely wrapped tales of triumph against all odds but it doesn't lend credibility to the more pointed satire and harsher criticisms that Thackeray had in mind when he wrote the book. For example Becky's gambler husband Rawdon Crawley is really more of a ne'erdowell whose departure in the story should be viewed somewhat as relief but as played by James Purefoy he is a romantic figure who is guiltridden over his failure to provide for his family. The change could have been acceptable were it not for the fact that his character is discarded in an almost matteroffact way. The same sketchy treatment is given to Becky's only friend Amelia Sedley played by Romola Garai who is set up as a contrast to Becky and comes across as a wet rag for much of the story. But the film transforms her into a brave widow whose romantic resolution at the end strains credibility. Somehow Purefoy and Garai acquit themselves admirably regardless.There are many fine performances in the smaller roles. Worth mentioning are Jim Broadbent as roguish George Osborne's unforgiving father Bob Hoskins as the clownishly pitiable Sir Pitt Gabriel Byrne as the territorially devious Marquess of Steyne and Geraldine McEwan's heliumvoiced Lady Southdown. Best of all is the mordantly witty Eileen Atkins who seems to understand the tone of Thackeray's story better than anyone else and lends a dotty authority to the role of Aunt Mathilde serving as the primary catalyst of Becky's social escalation much to her later regret. Great acting aside the film's length does have a wearing effect since the climax does not bear the emotional weight of everything that has gone before it and unfortunately the plot strands get wrapped up much too quickly at the end to make the story truly resonate. That's a shame since there is so much creative energy obviously at work here.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vanity Fair is a beautiful mess. It combines the beauty of elegant costumes sets and people with the disaster that is Mira Nair's adaptation of William Makepeace Thackery's novel. Not only is the adaptation bad but also so is what Nair has done with it. If you read the book the movie will break your heart. It has completely ripped to shreds the pages of the classic story.If you haven't read the book and intend to waste your money on the film I would recommend that first you read a couple of plot summaries of the novel. Otherwise you may be very lost through no fault of your own but because there is no defining plot in the film. There are no central conflicts presented and it's not until about two thirds of the way through that you have at least an idea of what is trying to be done here. Even then it is unclear. Reese Witherspoon plays Becky Sharp a social climber. Vanity Fair is supposed to be her story but instead it is crowded by a confusing and unnecessary cast of supporting characters. I suppose Vanity Fair is a story about love but also about how the social class system can create a barrier between people. If this was the intended idea the supporting cast would be needed but Vanity Fair is supposed to be about Becky Sharp and the movie is far too much of an ensemble piece for that to be the case.Mira Nair's direction is too present. She throws in too much of herself with the scenes about India and actually in India. Where the hell is the point? There just seem to be times when Nair thought it was okay to throw in another shot of an elephant's ass or belly dancers or India food.Speaking of unwanted Reese's second child was not credited in the closing credits but is in every scene Reese is. Witherspoon and the crew seemed to think they could hide the fact that she was pregnant by putting her in big clothes but that didn't work. She still looks pregnant and it ruins the effect the clothes should have had. It also puts the movie out of sequence. In one scene Reese is very large and in the next you can only see her belly if you look for it.Vanity Fair could have been brilliant. The material is there Reese bring to the table the range that we have come to expect from her and a performance that could have taken her places if it had been used better. But the fact remains that there are too many moments where ends just don't meet and the audience is confused to the point where the film can't rely on its pretty scenery to distract from its larger flaws. 12 out of ".

	schema:headline " A lot of pretty pictures but is has nothing to do with Thackeray";
	schema:reviewBody "If you hadn't gathered it from the movie itself the bonus documentaries on the DVD will make it clear that this edition of Vanity Fair has at its root a fatal flaw. It attempts to portray Becky Sharp as a sympathetic even admirable person. A plucky Madonnastyle powergirl. As a result this is an extremely watereddown version of what Thackeray actually wrote. There is nothing nice about his novel which is tremendously compelling and hilariously funny but also coldly cynical. Becky is a brutal predator who doesn't care a hoot about her child or her husband and goes about exploiting everyone around her with the greatest zeal.She's closer akin to Hannibal Lecter than to Scarlet O'Hara. Reese Witherspoone's portrayal of the nonheroine blunts all the edges and leaves us with a fairly uninvolving character whose motivations are not always easy to grasp. Other characters are similarly polished up. George Osborne isn't nearly as callous in his behavior to Amelia as he is in the novel. Dobbin is far too outspoken and powerful a figure whereas with Thackeray he is an utter wet noodle. The absurdity and cowardice of Jos Sedley is smothered in layers of oriental mystique. The dazzling Indian finale shamelessly over the top that we get by way of obligatory happy ending would have us believe that Becky has gone off with him on a life of happy traveling casting infatuated glances in his direction. In the book however she simply leeches on him and Jos besieges his acquaintances to protect him form her! You don't know what a terrible woman she is. That woman is not in this movie. In this way the film completely misses out on the essence of the story. It basically becomes a vehicle for a string of sumptuously executed pretty pictures. In the explicit attempt voiced by Mira Nair herself to bring the story to the screen as one relevant to modern audiences rather than being just the next period piece the exact opposite is achieved. This is beautifully executed but very tame and oldfashioned costume drama. Not even the ridiculous oriental dance scene starring Becky which shows a complete lack of understanding of early 19th century mores can change that. Of course Thackeray's story needs no modernization at all  it is as recognizable today as it was 200 years ago. 130 minutes are not enough to do justice to the book either. All plot lines are reduced to their bare essentials the psychology driving them is completely lost. One moment George Osborne is shunning Amelia the next he marries her one moment he is insulting Becky Sharp the next he's inviting her to elope with him. At times it is almost as if you can hear the actors gasping for breath while hurrying along to get everything crammed in in the allotted time two hours is already longer than most movie audiences can stand nowadays if the film isn't peppered with a proper barrage of CG special effects. That none of the acting stands out as particularly distinguished with the exception of Eileen Atkins's portrayal of aunt Mathilda Crawley is hardly surprising under these circumstances. Another thing that doesn't help believability is the fact that characters appear to have eternal youth. While we see toddlers growing up into adults Becky Amelia and others look exactly the same at the end of the movie as they did at the beginning. The one thing that may make this movie worthwhile to watch nonetheless for some is simply the visual beauty of it. Costumes locations and sets are generally stunning and the streets of London are teeming with people animals and coaches. Given that the whole crew was even dragged to Jodhpur India to shoot a few minutes worth of footage it is however hard to understand why the Brussels episode was shot in the courtyards of Hampton Court Palace which constitute an unconvincing decor to anyone who knows what Belgian cities look like. What a strange experience it must have been for Natasha Little to play Jane Sheepshanks the most goodly character in the story and witness the insipid Becky of Reese Witherspoon after having herself starred as the perfect embodiment of Miss Sharp in the BBC dramatization of the novel. That version is superior to this one on every count it looks far more realistic gives us the fleshed out characters in all their nastiness stays close to Thackeray's sarcastic tone and is in its own way just as beautifully visualized as this multimillion dollar project. If you want the next best thing to reading the book the extra cost of that DVD is more than worth it.".

	onyx:emotionText "If you hadn't gathered it from the movie itself the bonus documentaries on the DVD will make it clear that this edition of Vanity Fair has at its root a fatal flaw. It attempts to portray Becky Sharp as a sympathetic even admirable person. A plucky Madonnastyle powergirl. As a result this is an extremely watereddown version of what Thackeray actually wrote. There is nothing nice about his novel which is tremendously compelling and hilariously funny but also coldly cynical. Becky is a brutal predator who doesn't care a hoot about her child or her husband and goes about exploiting everyone around her with the greatest zeal.She's closer akin to Hannibal Lecter than to Scarlet O'Hara. Reese Witherspoone's portrayal of the nonheroine blunts all the edges and leaves us with a fairly uninvolving character whose motivations are not always easy to grasp. Other characters are similarly polished up. George Osborne isn't nearly as callous in his behavior to Amelia as he is in the novel.

However I am a fan of Reese Witherspoon I have enjoyed the roles she created in all her movies and she is the main reason I spend almost 2 and one half hours viewing Vanity Fair. The movie is based on the Becky Sharp character in the mid 19th century novel and is set in the first 30 years or so of the 19th century. There in fact was a 1935 movie Becky Sharp which is based on the same book.Becky Sharp Witherspoon was a pretty and bright young girl born to a poor artist. At perhaps 8 or so was sent to a school for girls and received a fine education leaving when she was old enough. This is a story of her early life how she used her beauty and smarts of navigate upwards into society places one normally attained only by birth. It deals with money politics love and war.Gabriel Byrne is good as The Marquess of Steyne who purchases a painting from her dad when Becky was very young and their paths crossed again years later when Becky and her husband were destitute. Romola Garai is good as Amelia Sedley Becky's friend from school. Rhys Ifans who was so funny as Hugh Grant's flat mate in Notting Hill plays William Dobbin a serious role where he longs all his life for Amelia but isn't able to profess his feelings in a direct way. I will take the assignment in India unless you tell me not to go. Very beautifully filmed and with good sound. A nice movie for those who enjoy English period movies.".

I am appauld at the reaction to this beautiful film. I am a proud owner of this movie for the fact it has one heck of a serious plot and shows the character of BEcky sharp in a light that lets you judge for yourself whether this social climber should be put in her place or let loose to climb to high society. I don't think any novel can be completely taken to screen with the same richness as its source. Now with that out of the way lets get on too the film. It stares the very talented Reese Witherspoon who adopts a perfect English accent and can boost about learning belly dancing and other such dances for the film. The novel if you will call it that by Willam Thackery Mackapiece was actually newspaper article that he collected and put to a novel. So knowing that I am proud to say that this screen adaptation by Mira Nair really hits the mark.If I wanted to see a book exactly the same on film I would not have gone to see a film that was publicized as a different take on classic material. The book I was forced to read in the 11th grade and I must say trying to capture 800 pages on film with all the little subplots would have been tedious and even boring. This adaptation uses the character of BEcky Sharp to show how one may climb the social ladder while still maintaining who she always is. The story that unfolds is about how people will change in life sometimes for the good and some for the bad but it is inevitable. I want to go on about how I rarely watch a movie more than once but this movie I not only own but try to watch at least twice a week cause there is always a new layer to the film that I didn't notice last time. And to the final questions no I don't know anybody in the production or the cast. Though if Mira Nair is casting one of her films I would be happy to be a part of her work after seeing this fantastic film!!!!!".

Very detailed and the circus type music to accompany the ring master who is none other than Miss Becky Sharp! One just cannot understand how casting agents and directors could possibly use an American actress in a British historical piece especially when she hasn't nailed the accent which in Ms. Reeses case was not a believable one! We had to walk out of the theater after a half an hour. What was this director thinking!? What I also found odd was that Natasha Little who clearly should have been in the lead had a minor role along with some other extremely talented actressesone such as the lovely Meg Wynn Owen who was fabulous in Upstairs Downstairs. The director ought to stick to making films of India and not British period pieces or maybe next time at least read the book before taking on a film.".

Mira Nair goes overboard in trying to stress the 'India' connection in Thackeray's novel. This results in some awkward scenes of Witherspoon dancing in oriental regalia.

	schema:reviewBody "CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!I have only one question to ask the director as well as the screenplay writers of this movie  have we been reading the same book? This movie has almost nothing to do with the W. Thackeray's novel. Well the names of the main characters in the movie are the same as of those in the book and some of the events in the movie are slightly reminiscent of those in the book...but the rest...most of the events described in the book are either altered or left out. Some of the book's main characters never appear in the movie...however some events and characters that are in the movie were never actually in the book. What gives? Did the screenplay writers think than Thackeray could and should be improved on? A delusion that leads to disastrous for the movie results  all the book's wit all its irony and its delightful almost delicious sarcasm are gone. The brilliant dialogues like Rebecca's and George's conversation by the piano when he decides to remind her of her place  one of my favorite paragraphs in the book are replaced by weak unconvincing trivial and worst of all boring lines. And the scene in which Rawdon leaves Rebecca...that scene was never in Vanity Fair the novel. It was in Gone with the Wind the movie. Remember the final scene? Scarlett standing at the top of the stairs crying out to Rhett Please Rhett in my way I loved you. And he replies Then that is your misfortune. When Rebecca and Rawdon exchange the very same words with Rebecca standing at the top of the stairs it was pretty insulting. How dumb do the people responsible for this movie think the audience are? So okay they assume that most people never read the book and therefore don't know any better but did they really think that no one remembered the final scene in Gone with the Wind??? The Gone with the Wind scene ending up in Vanity Fair is actually what puzzles me most about this movie Vanity Fair that is...I just don't understand how it happened...did they really think no one would notice? Unless of course it was done intentionally to liken Rebecca Sharp to Scarlett O'Hara which I highly doubt. Looks more like a plain ol' ripoff to me.And why this urge to make Rebecca Sharp likable when in the book she was actually quite loathsome especially the way she treated her son? She's practically a con woman and a sociopath yet in the movie she was portrayed as this witty cheerful young girl who is simply down on her luck and is simply yearning for acceptance and better life? Reese Witherspoon gives a great performance nevertheless but this part seems like such a waste of her talent and she has enough talent to pull off the real Rebecca the original Thackeray's Rebecca the shrewd scheming conniving unscrupulous cynical and most importantly heartless Rebecca...the way she was portrayed in the novel. And the movie's young goodlooking elegant galant sophisticated Rawdon is also a far cry from the novel's honest Rawdon  chubby middleaged inarticulate nearly illetirate and quite simpleminded man who was quite unscrupulous himself almost all throughout the novel except in the end. But I guess all the differences between the movie and the novel would only bother those who read the book. If you have never read it chances are you will enjoy the movie  the storyline is still compelling it would require an extraordinary talent to manage to make an utter crap out of Thackeray's masterpiece it offers some stellar performances sets and costumes do not disappoint either. Me I give this movie to stars  one for cinematography most of the time the screen was quite lovely to look at and another one for Reese Witherspoon's performance she's great.".

	schema:reviewBody "The day after I finished reading the novel I rented the latest film of Vanity Fair 2004 starring Reese Witherspoon Rhys Ifans Gabriel Brynes Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Romola Garai. I predicted that Hollywood again would ruin a perfectly good English period story into a cheap shallow Hollywoody adaptation. I was more or less correct. Firstly the use of synthetic materials a big NONO in any historical film modern make up and modern hairstyles all minor trivial details irritated me but I am willing to forgive Hollywood as they could never live up to BBC's incredibly high standards in period costume drama.The casting was surprisingly good  Witherspoon was a good choice for Becky as she is wellknown and pretty but no great beauty just as Becky from the novel. Her accent was very good  no trace of an American accent and her acting convincing. However more importantly the choice of Gabriel Brynes as my lord the Marquis of Steyne was very interesting. I imagined Lord Steyne to reek of filthy rich aristocratic arrogance be bald lecherous and ugly whereas Brynes brought a peculiar sense of elegance wisdom and was strangely seductive. Or maybe this is because I quite like Gabriel Brynes he's on my list of liked actors although admittedly I was shocked at how old he looked in the film. Even though Lord Steyne was completely different in the film this was one interpretation that I quite liked.The interpretation of Becky Sharp however wasn't harsh enough. From the book I thought she is fond of her husband but not really passionate in the movie Becky seems to actually be in love with him. The film makes the audience sympathetic towards Becky in the book the reader thinks that Becky made her own downfall. The movie doesn't show the utmost disdain she has towards her child or how she has absolute control over her husband. It doesn't show how she uses Rawdon as a mere pawn in her game or how she steps on everybody for her own gain.More than anything the movie's ending was dreadful. Until the last scene I was happy  although it has historically inaccurate hairdos dresses and was generally lacking in character development Vanity Fair '04 was doing well in packing a lengthy novel into under 3 hours. The last few scenes wrecked this illusion. I should have known that Hollywood could never deliver a story like Vanity Fair decently.The whole story of Vanity Fair is about the rise and FALL of Becky. The film presented the RISE well but it never showed the DOWNFALL. Ergo the point of the story and Thackeray's message is not at all shown including that legendary lineVANITAS VANITATUM! Which of us is happy in this world? Which of us has the desire? Or having it is satisfied?".

	schema:reviewBody "Can a movie ever benefit from a lack of marketing? I wondered this to myself as I sat in the theatre about 40 minutes before Vanity Fair was about to be viewed. As the audience began trickling in I could not help but notice the age of the paying parties. On average JoeQ public consisted on this day of mostly teenage girls anywhere from 1316 years of age. I knew what to expect in Vanity Fair before the curtains rolled up so it fueled my query as I wondered if those hard earned teenage dollars knew that they were about to sit through a period piece set in London in early 19th century. I think not. The lack of television overexposure and the fact that corsetwearing aristocrats were not on a Burger King soda cup had me believe that the audience was there primarily due to Reese Witherspoon's name which appeared above the title. I did not question any of the patrons at the conclusion of the screening. I did not hide in the lobby to hear their comments. But based on my observations during the dimmed light phase I think that the movie was generally not what was expected. I base this solely on the number of times these teenage girls left the theatre either in singles or in hunting packs for periods of time that was anywhere from a moment to what might end up being a couple of chapters on a DVD. They seemed restless no matter which clique they belonged. They did not get the few but poignant humorous scenes. And when the credits began to show at the films conclusion they remained in their seats speechless like a child who opens a big box at Christmas only to find a neatly folded sweater sitting at its bottom.Can't blame them really. Directed by Mira Nair Monsoon Wedding Vanity Fair was something of a miss. Starring Witherspoon as Becky Sharp a daughter of a starving artist who seems to fight and claw her way up the social ladder by either being in the right place at the right time or aligning herself with the appropriate aristocrats to push her one step closer to the perch of societal acceptance Vanity Fair tries to hard for too long to be something that it is not. Possibly wanting to be a softer Dangerous Liaisons we watch as Becky leaves school becomes a firecracker of knowledge marries a gambler gets propositioned by the Marquess and eventually gives birth to a child that she gives up without argue. Throw in many subplots consisting of overbearing fathers a love not realized and major characters getting killed in wars throughout Europe and it might seem like too much for just one film. Nope.Clocking in at 137 minutes Nair takes her time in having the movie methodically move like molasses going the wrong way on an onramp. We jump ahead in time at random once going 12 years later in a tired attempt at throwing everything to a wall and hoping that more than a few things stick.Witherspoon will survive. Her comedic wit and attraction to the younger audiences will ensure another hit before long. Whom I feel for is the alwaysmisused Gabriel Byrne. In 1990's Miller's Crossing and again in 1995's The Usual Suspects Byrne showed us what he could do with good material. As the Marquess of Steyne he rises above the mediocre role and shines as the helpful but with motive art enthusiast that takes a liking to the young Sharp. His screen time however is so long in coming and so surrounded by uninteresting characters and dialogue that even he can't lift the film an extra half star. So now that it is over I don't know who was better off  the teenagers who got something that they could probably see in school in a few months or someone like me who went in hoping to see Reese rise to the top of her craft in a career move that seemed timed just right. I think the teens got off easy.www.gregsrants.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow. I only paid 3 to rent this movie and I still want my money back. When I saw the preview for Vanity Fair I thought it seemed like a good movie. I love period pieces and the costumes and cast looked great. However someone should have warned me that I wouldn't be able to follow the plot through the entire slowmoving 2 hour and 15 minute long film.By reading reviews of Vanity Fair I've gathered that the book was about a sassy and conniving young woman trying to get up the social ladder by any means possible. Director Mira Nair must have missed that part. To me someone who hasn't read the book nor has any idea of the plot of the book the movie seemed to be about a peppy young girl who was in love but had a hard time being accepted in the higher crowds however that didn't stop her from trying her hardest and never giving up. When I read the comments on here I stopped and thought WOAH WOAH Rebecca was supposed to be conniving?!?!During the first hour or so the movie was pretty good but after that everything slowed down tremendously. As more and more subplots and characters were thrown in I got lost at least twice. There was no passing of time it seemed. No one really aged either. And what does India hafta do with anything? It seemed to show up a lot but it seemed to me to just be something to make viewer's go Ooh that's exotic!The acting wasn't all that horrible. Witherspoon gave it a good try but Nair's directions seemed to throw her totally off character. I have to admit she did look very pretty although I'm not sure how the orangeyblondey hair suits her. As for everyone else...Byrne and Purefoy were good Byrne probably being the best of the whole cast. He played his character very nicely and Purefoy also did well as I could feel his emotions in many of his scenes. Everyone else was well casted but all were so involved in complicated subplots that I couldn't keep any straight.Like I said before the costumes and sets were very well done and they pretty much earned the 2 stars. The rest of the movie was slow and dull but at the same time too choppy and complicated. My recommendation if you insist on seeing it rent it cheap somewhere or wait till you can see it on HBO.".

A pity profanities obscenities and spiteful remarks are not allowed in reviews. But here is a clue the F word is definitely an insult just as how Hong Kong Director Gordan Chan's The King of Fighters is an insult. Not just an insult to the fans of the King of Fighters affectionately abbreviated to KOF video game series or video games in general but it even manages to be an insult to bad video game movies.On a whole the setting of the story manages to immediately ripoff The Matrix while sounding more confusing than the entire trilogy combined. THe premise of this movie shows A secret tournament that is held in some alternate dimension in which fighters from around the world log in to via special earpieces. Think jacking into a big matrixlike video game world complete with Iknowkungfu wire fighting and badly CGIed special powers. Its all fun and games until Rugal Ray Park doing his best Darth Maul meets The Joker impression steals some sacred artifacts with a plot to free something called The Orochi. Why free the orochi? Because Rugal wants to haxors the alternate dimensional video game become L33T and ultimately the godmode hax winner. Out to stop him are undercover agents Mai who is working for Terry Bogard in the CIA and Iori Yagami a man with a past connection to Rugal. Together they must seek out a third artifact called the Kusanagi sword which has been passed from father to son to one Kyo Kusanagi.To quote Maggie Q's character of Mai by saying Its not Logical would be a major understatement. An illogical confusing and plodding plot is the least of this movie's problems. In trying to mix mysticism with hardcore science fiction would have worked in the hands of a skilled creative team. Here it turned out like oil and water making the entire movie very difficult to follow and bordering on absurd.The most basic criteria for a just passable video game movie is that either the story has small resemblance to the game Silent Hill Max Payne Hitman or the character has some similar appearance to their game counterparts Mortal Kombat Tekken. King of Failures has NONE of these mere basic elements! Fine Resident Evil had neither too but at least it had a story that was mildly entertaining. King of Failures is an absolute chore to sit through.The pacing is thrown off by having too much talk and not enough fight. All the talk is not even interesting nor does it develop that silly excuse for a plot. Kyo's so called hero's journey has been done in umpteen other shows and every character's lack of charisma is made even more painful by stilted acting and laughable dialogue. At least Ray Park's Rugal was funny in all his weird costumes when he changes the setting of the game to for example a hockey match. When some action does come once in a while it is an utter let down and a complete joke especially when one knows what kind of awesome action Hong Kong is capable of. The fight choreography is generally uninspired almost dull. Many B movies have had better fights than this heck even Legend of Chun Li had some better fight choreography. Ray Park and Will Yun Lee were the only two actors who had some convincing fighting moves thanks perhaps to their martial arts training. Speaking of Legend of chun Li remember that lesbian tease scene? Well King of Failures has its own lesbian tease scene. But the biggest sin here is Gordan Chan's wonky camerawork which uses way too many dutch anglesoblique or slanted tilting of the camera while filming and an irritating purple lighting that seems reminiscent of Battlefield Earth.NINE companies collaborated on this project count it in the company credits section and all they managed to cough up was a 12 million dollar budget for this piece of junk?? How could Gordon Chan renown director of great films like Painted Skin and Fist of Legend sink so low? It pains me personally to see the name of a Singaporean company listed among the production credits. It is as if there is some perverse secret global competition for crappiest video game movie creators of the century Hollywood has entered Hyde Park Entertainment and Andrzej Bartkowiak Germany has Boll K. G. and Uwe Boll France has Xavier Gens . And now CONGRATULATIONS to Asia who has officially added Gordon Chan and all 9 of those production companies who are mostly also Asian to vie for the crappiest video game movie creator title.".

	schema:headline " More like The Jester of Fighting";
	schema:reviewBody "Hand on heart then I am not a fan of movies based on fighting games but this one topples all the rest. It pretty much sums up the definition of bad movies.The King of Fighters suffers horribly from an very weak and basically nonexistent storyline. And whatever little was there just didn't work. Come on putting in an ear piece and then press a button and you go to an alternate dimension to fight? Yeah that was perhaps the most epic fail of the entire movie.Also the movie suffered from a lack of acting talents. Surely there were some scenes that were alright but in general the acting performances in this movie was painful to behold. And also the actorsactresses didn't really have much of a solid dialogue script to work with. And also the characters portrayed in the movie never grasped you they were shallow and had no personalities so it was hard to relate to any of them or get any kind of emotion for any of them.Now what did work for the movie was the CGI effects. They were actually adequate enough to look at. I especially liked the regular flame and blue flame effects they looked cool.Some of the fighting scenes were good enough to look at and had just the right amount of speed and action. But most of them actually were strenuous to the eyes and came off as halfhearted forced attempts of making a fight scene.I wonder what made Maggie Q agree to participate in a movie like this. Usually her movies are somewhat further up the ladder compared to this movie. If for no other reason at least her appearance is a treat for the eyes.There are way too many movie versions of fighting games out there and 99 of them doesn't translate well to a movie screen. And The King of Fighters is one of them. I actually fell asleep and was out for 20 minutes during this movie it was just that boring. I am sure that the director had the best of intentions at heart but there is no need to make a movie out of a fighting game that has long gone out of date.If you are into action movies and movies based on fighting games The King of Fighters should be avoided you are better off watching something like Mortal Kombat instead. This movie is not really worth the effort.I wasted an hour and a half on this well more like an hour as I was out for 20 minutes or so and this is definitely not a movie that I will be returning to ever again.".

	onyx:emotionText "Hand on heart then I am not a fan of movies based on fighting games but this one topples all the rest. It pretty much sums up the definition of bad movies.The King of Fighters suffers horribly from an very weak and basically nonexistent storyline. And whatever little was there just didn't work. Come on putting in an ear piece and then press a button and you go to an alternate dimension to fight? Yeah that was perhaps the most epic fail of the entire movie.Also the movie suffered from a lack of acting talents. Surely there were some scenes that were alright but in general the acting performances in this movie was painful to behold. And also the actorsactresses didn't really have much of a solid dialogue script to work with. And also the characters portrayed in the movie never grasped you they were shallow and had no personalities so it was hard to relate to any of them or get any kind of emotion for any of them.Now what did work for the movie was the CGI effects. They were actually adequate enough to look at. I especially liked the regular flame and blue flame effects they looked cool.Some of the fighting scenes were good enough to look at and had just the right amount of speed and action. But most of them actually were strenuous to the eyes and came off as halfhearted forced attempts of making a fight scene.I wonder what made Maggie Q agree to participate in a movie like this. Usually her movies are somewhat further up the ladder compared to this movie. If for no other reason at least her appearance is a treat for the eyes.There are way too many movie versions of fighting games out there and 99 of them doesn't translate well to a movie screen. And The King of Fighters is one of them. I actually fell asleep and was out for 20 minutes during this movie it was just that boring. I am sure that the director had the best of intentions at heart but there is no need to make a movie out of a fighting game that has long gone out of date.If you are into action movies and movies based on fighting games The King of Fighters should be avoided you are better off watching something like Mortal Kombat instead. This movie is not really worth the effort.I wasted an hour and a half on this well more like an hour as I was out for 20 minutes or so and this is definitely not a movie that I will be returning to ever again.";

	schema:reviewBody "I don't get on this website as often as I want to because quite frankly I don't have the time to visit this place and post reviews of movies I think are lame and should be doomed to the shelf for all eternity in video hell. However as a fan of fighting video games as a whole I simply came to this one because I had to to not review this movie after trying to survive a threepart Orochi saga and flamboyant french man named after the dude from Evil Dead would be a crime against humanity. So after probably what seemed like a year or two since my last review I figured it was time to suck in the gut and get the ball rolling on a little critique on this movie based on SNK's 'King of Fighters' series.For those who think this is an original movie based on an original idea reconsider that thought it isn't. Your stereotypical band of misfits follow a kooky weirdo hooked on Japanese mythology decide to jack into a video game system to engage in a battle of epic wits heart and soul gaining EXP with extreme PVP to kick a very thin man's butt in a virtual reality world. If anything else I could have sworn this movie might have been the 'Lost Matrix Sequel' that time forgot or maybe just an extended trailer for Matrix Online that had been recut dismantled reassembled and put together for the viewing audience. No this was a movie that had my favorite game's title in it had some folks loosely based on characters I've grown to admire in terms of actual gameplay and some of the weirdest action I've ever seen.First off let me ask you how difficult is it to really make a movie out of this? The original game was simple an open invitation by a mysterious hostee and his mistresses to find the best fighters in the world. The catch was that this wasn't going to be your atypical oneonone you now had two partners to join you. You had your choice of various knownnames ranging from street fighters to karate nuts to goofballs and some military men. Unlike Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat they're not just doing onedudeagainstthemasses no it's teams of three. People with distinct personalities clashing with others and lifestyles.That my friends should be more than enough to use for the basis of this movie. Had I done it I would have taken four teams from the original list and modified them as such a kooky team of socalled karate experts in a rugged part of L.A trying to make a living. mixed in with some homebrew fighters from the mean streets of Chicago renowned and respected professional brawlers who travel the world and then maybe add some retired RamboAhnulledJohn McClane ruffians from the US Army going in to seize the event. Make Rugal simply a oneman army go out and kick all of their asses until the final moment and that would have been it. Maybe toss in some villainous gangsters or something to make up for Geese Howard or Kain R. Heinlein in the mix.However this is simple a combination of things we have all seen before if not in a good long while. A suspicious looking thinman who hardly looks like the game boss and two scantily clad fetishists fighting a CIA agent some Japanese dork another scantilyclad woman as they look around for a sword.C'mon people where is the life to these characters? Terry Bogard was a homeless dude a cleanshaven one and welltaken care of one at that not a CIA agent. If people want undercover agents that's what shows like 24 or even the Legend of ChunLi movie is all about I question the casting for CharlieNash. They're all models of repeats.The story is a borefest. I would have simply preferred something the lines of a straightforward fighting movie no plot other than the conflicts and tough times fueled by different fighters who don't get along or don't like each other. Here we're just looking at the same movie of years past with a different title and 'A PLOT TWIST!' If anything else this is a movie that's more of a rental.Strangely I've been following this movie for some time now and I didn't even know it was released until right now... I wonder if they were intending to do that for sake of not getting something like my Secret of NIMH II review under the guise of MR. KARATE. But alas.".

The story is straight forward the good guys want to catchkill the one and only bad guy. I can clearly see that this has a small budget and I think this will be released straight to DVD in other countries. The acting is disappointing. Maggie Q is also not doing her best acting. Ray Park well acts like a generic bad guy. Evil eyes and laughing evilly. The fight scenes are okay the CGI is okay for a movie with a small budget. The music is overthetop and generic. I feel that the music does not even match some scenes and is just there for the sake of being there. When they talk there is techno music...just plain weird.Overall It is just mediocre. It is nothing special. It is just disappointing too. I believe it can be improved in ways. Gordon Chan's directing is also disappointing.

Awful screenplay photography dialogs and crappy costumes. Corny slow boring what else do you want me to say?

I agree that the red hair was not necessary but I was really expecting his hair to turn red when he was controlled by Orochi.Half American half whateverbutJapanese Kyo? It was the most similar personality Although he looked like Shingo with short hairbut it lacked swagger.Skinny Rugal! My god!! You could at least have tried to put a wig on Goldberg!Marty McFly Terry. What the hell was up with that jacket? You should have given him the leather jacket he had in KOF 2001. A CIA agent? The LONE WOLF? Ha!Chizuru wasn't that bad and Mr. Big could have been bald but he was OK.I LOVED Mature and Vice excellent really cute.The movie itself sucked. Awful screenplay photography dialogs and crappy costumes. Corny slow boring what else do you want me to say?

	schema:reviewBody "If there's one video game that I suck at big time it will be The King of Fighters. Already I was struggling back then with mastering all the Street Fighter character moves then this game came along where one has to master 3 characters as a group and face them off either with some artificial intelligence now programmed to be smarter at your neighbourhood video game store or with another human challenger who finds it easy to cream me with one character in full energy left to spare.Things have been relatively low key for the film version of the video game and perhaps rightly so since it's not automatic that films from Japanese video games manga and animation make that dignified liveaction leap onto the silver screen most falling short in the process  last year's disastrous Dragon Ball Evolution and the lacklustre Street Fighter Legend of Chun Li being very recent examples of the bad aftertaste left at the box office. Audience these days demand a lot more and the inbuilt fan base no longer representing a ready market but a base of high expectations that are difficult to meet even as they are aware some tweaks to characters and story lines are necessary for the change of medium. This Gordon Chan directed effort however is expected to fall short given the extremely flimsy cookie cutter storyline that reeks and for an action film the cardinal sin of having limited action almost all of which are left to the last 30 minutes.Maggie Q marquees this film as Mai Shianui working undercover for Terry Bogard David Leitch of the CIA I hear yawns already to hook up with Iori Yagami Will Yun Lee who teaches her the background myth of having a necklace and a mirror combined to open a door to another dimension. There's a sword in the picture as well belonging to the Kusanagi clan but one rumored to be lost and required by chief villain Rugal Bernstein Ray Park in order to reign supreme in the King of Fighters MMORPG since he's stolen the other two items and tweaked the system so that his rules apply in the virtual world and is working to combine all dimensions and realms into one. That's basically it with the heroes trying to convince the Kusanagi clan heir Kyo Sean Faris who plays a halfJapanese that explains his Caucasian looks to cough out the legendary sword and stop Rugal from destroying civilization.What's neat is how Rita Augustine and Matthew Ryan Fischer managed to fuse the fantastical elements of the fights that nods at the Matrix experience with combatants jacked in through bluetoothlike earpieces in order to fight in the virtual MMORPG dimension complete with superhuman powers from the game though the fights during the first hour had just a very little glimpse of what the finale would promise. The King of Fighters then is a tournament where combatants rise in the ranks through each victory though with the compromise now by Rugal death in the dimension also means death in the real world.What didn't work happens to be a lot of things. For starters we have the usual cardboard characters OK so this is based on a video game with CIA agents hokey Japanese philosophy talk and just about every situation setting and background of the characters being extremely contrived. As mentioned the first hour of the film is talk talk and more talk on the usual genre themes like responsibility and destiny Then you have heroes who are reluctant and blur and how one gets transformed from zero to hero is absolutely baffling based on pep talks from memory. The quest for the Kusunagi sword also happens in the most roundabout fashion just to bloat the film's runtime and amongst all the characters Terry Bogard happens to be the most carelessly designed on screen with that out of place jacket and baseball cap keeping to the game I know with a really obnoxious ignorant attitude and a CIA dimwit ahole to boot.The fight sequences happened to be a mixed bag though Hong Kong influences are very heavy in the way the fisticuffs are designed. Special effects inspired by the game are also limited which is most unfortunate as the game is famed for the various combomoves that the characters can execute which is all but lost in the film version. Even then whatever effects all seemed to be reserved for the extended battle sequence at the finale for an allout duke out and audiences will have to be patient with all the talk for the first hour before things start to get remotely interesting since all the money shots get concentrated toward the end.Naturally movies of this nature will have an ending primed for sequels to continue where it left off especially when the box office response is positive but my money's on the Nay list. If I have to compare then this is ahead of Dragonball and The Legend of Chun Li but only just.".

This is made possible due to three ancient artifacts that allow this dimension to exist. The members come under threat when Rugal Ray Park a previous member of the tournament steals the artifacts and begins to manipulate the other dimension to his own liking so as to kill anyone who enters it. It is left to Mai Maggie Q and Iori Will Yun Lee must enlist the help of Kyo Sean Farris to defeat Rugal before too many lives are lost.The film adaptation of The King of Fighters loosely follows that of the original King of Fighters '94 with some elements from '95 in which Rugal starts the tournament so as to get some excitement into his life. The most notable difference in the adaptation is that the tournament is already established and also that the fighters need to be in an alternate dimension in order to fight in a way which resemble the original game. The science fictionesquire twist on the narrative makes for an intriguing story but the films never really explores the concept. The story is fashioned in a linear manner with the odd reference to past sequences to help explain certain information. Unfortunately the plot is fairly thin it presents opportunities for further development but these avenues are never fully explored.The acting quality is not exactly great but this is somewhat understandable considering the cast. That said no actor ever falls prey to evidently poor acting and with more depth to the script a better acting prowess could have been shown. Actors generally take their roles seriously Park seems to enjoy the eccentric nature of being a villain while the likes of Maggie Q Lee and Faris portray the motives of their respective characters adequately enough.The overall filming quality suggests that the filmmakers had a low budget to work with. The King of Fighters appears to be filmed more like a television show then an actual movie but that does not stop some fairly enjoyable action sequences yet these only become common in the latter half. CG becomes present mainly towards the end and looks lowkey but nonetheless workable.Beyond the makings of a possible girlongirl scene there is no nudity or sexual content present. Language is tame and infrequent while violence is frequent throughout the film without ever being gory or bloody.There is no doubt that The King of Fighters is a missed opportunity. With some obvious reworking to the script and story and a better budget the film could easily have been a more commendable entry for video gametocinema adaptations. What really needed to happen was the fleshing out of the characters and the overall narrative to create a more cohesive product. That said the story actors and some decent action scenes are adequate enough to carry The King of Fighters to its conclusion and miss a definitive K.O.".

	schema:reviewBody "Credit IMDb Liveaction feature based on the video game King of Fighters. The King of Fighters was shredded of all it's dignity as soon as it entered postproduction in my opinion. It was doomed to fail from the start. Despite what you may think it features some promising talent but it's certainly not displayed here in any way. The fight scenes feel cartoonish the production values feel cheap and I felt like I was watching a boring videogame that had no pride in itself. It doesn't help that most of the characters are corny and unlikable. Maggie Q is the only thing watchable about this movie. What hurts this movie the most though is the cheesy storyline. I didn't find it to be believable whatsoever nor did it provide any entertainment value. Performances. Maggie Q is decent as the lead and manages to come out of this crap alive somehow. She is much better then the film deserves and it shows. Sean Farris has promise as an actor but here his arrogance is his downfall. Unlike Forever Strong where he balanced it with charisma that is nowhere to be seen here. Will Yun Lee has intensity but that's about it. Ray Park is much too comical and OTT to be effective. He basically threw it away to ham it up like a buffoon as the villain. David Leitch is OK as the agent but nothing more. Francoise Yip is pretty bland in her role spurting some atrocious dialogue.Bottom line. This deserves its bad reputation. You are wasting 90 minutes of your life that you could easily be doing something with much more worthwhile. People call Street Fighter bad? At least it knew it was and managed to make the movie fun. This has none of that. Avoid in every way possible.210".

	schema:headline " I must say Entirely Mediocre !";
	schema:reviewBody "I've just watched recently  I must say The King Of Fighters movie is a pile of junk it's not even the miscast problem but the whole thing in this movie is extremely mediocre.  this is the worst movie I've ever seen in 2010 thank God I didn't have any expectation at all on this because I knew it... OK from my point of view why the whole thing is mediocre is from the story itself were inarticulate  slight over from the gameSigh video games adaptation the setting isn't appealing  clearly out of the budget special effects are way too flashy  completely stupid looking little fight scenes  yet too short  the most bugged me is the miscast of the characters. Here's my opinionMai Shiranui Maggie Q ruined the character a lot. Nothing look alike from Mai which got a trademark sexy bouncing boobs yet she didn't have any Japanese style at all. In here she's depicted to be carefree  serious not funny like in the game. The fighting style were inartistic  she didn't feel like a good fighter. Mai as main character is fail totally fail.Kyo Kusanagi Sean Faris really destroyed the character with his inappropriate looks which is Caucasian ! Here his role is inarticulate he didn't have his Kusanagi flame trademark he's incredibly weak to be a fighter  his fighting style is pathetic. Funny thing his young version is Asian in here. Gordon Chan... This is a big mistake of what you've done to Kyo Kusanagi.Iori Yagami Even though Will Yun Lee is Asian he's not suitable to be Iori Yagami yet stupid hair cut that he had. Here he act like a rich man  charismatic his personality is serious  good. Unfortunately in the game he's a violent person. Actually I kinda like his character if he's not Iori in here. The fighting style is pathetic like Kyo but skillful than Kyo his special effects are way too flashy  why blue? The reason why I want to watch this movie is because of my curiosity on Iori turning to Orochi Iori.  Honestly only this thing that cheered me when watching this flick unfortunately I hate the story why he got the Orochi blood. Too bad Iori is also my favorite character.Terry Bogard Not again one of my favorite character... Another failed attempt for him especially making him as an CIA agent again besides not resembles to Terry. David Leitch really annoyed me  horrible acting that he played. Plain stupid  totally fail for him.Rugal Bernstein Ray Park as Rugal? Thank you Gordon Chan for messing the KOF film  turned down the fans... Rugal here is just another big failure like other characters in here. his villain role in here is depicted to be a powerful fighter with crazy  merciless personality not charismatic like in the game. In here it is shown that he treat the lady horribly even killing Chizuru  the statue that he had is super mediocre... Definitely not Rugal at all.Chizuru Kagura Again  again... OK I'll just say my opinion on her in here. My thought she's boring but since her role isn't big I kinda confused to judge her completely yet Chizuru wasn't my favorite character so I don't know much about her.Vice  Mature I think their character were too resembles like other video games adaptation being a henchmen for the bad guy. So they're completely boring IMO.Saisyu Kusanagi Hahaha he's nothing look alike with his son at all...  funny thing he looked like an comedian instead of fighter. The rest... Well just like other video games adaptation about family relationship in martial arts.  that's boring once again IMO.That's all that I can say about the characters  after u read this you'll be noticed that none of the characters in here were resembles like in the game but that's just my opinion. Lastly if you loved the games so muchKOF fans this is a big mistake for you to watch it. Even for action lovers this film had a few action scenes yet it is short  stupid IMO... But that's up to you whether you want it or not just judge them by yourself.".

OK from my point of view why the whole thing is mediocre is from the story itself were inarticulate  slight over from the gameSigh video games adaptation the setting isn't appealing  clearly out of the budget special effects are way too flashy  completely stupid looking little fight scenes  yet too short  the most bugged me is the miscast of the characters. Here's my opinionMai Shiranui Maggie Q ruined the character a lot. Nothing look alike from Mai which got a trademark sexy bouncing boobs yet she didn't have any Japanese style at all. In here she's depicted to be carefree  serious not funny like in the game. The fighting style were inartistic  she didn't feel like a good fighter. Mai as main character is fail totally fail.Kyo Kusanagi Sean Faris really destroyed the character with his inappropriate looks which is Caucasian ! Here his role is inarticulate he didn't have his Kusanagi flame trademark he's incredibly weak to be a fighter  his fighting style is pathetic. Funny thing his young version is Asian in here. Gordon Chan... This is a big mistake of what you've done to Kyo Kusanagi.Iori Yagami Even though Will Yun Lee is Asian he's not suitable to be Iori Yagami yet stupid hair cut that he had. Here he act like a rich man  charismatic his personality is serious  good. Unfortunately in the game he's a violent person. Actually I kinda like his character if he's not Iori in here. The fighting style is pathetic like Kyo but skillful than Kyo his special effects are way too flashy  why blue? The reason why I want to watch this movie is because of my curiosity on Iori turning to Orochi Iori.  Honestly only this thing that cheered me when watching this flick unfortunately I hate the story why he got the Orochi blood. Too bad Iori is also my favorite character.Terry Bogard Not again one of my favorite character... Another failed attempt for him especially making him as an CIA agent again besides not resembles to Terry. David Leitch really annoyed me  horrible acting that he played. Plain stupid  totally fail for him.Rugal Bernstein Ray Park as Rugal? Thank you Gordon Chan for messing the KOF film  turned down the fans... Rugal here is just another big failure like other characters in here. his villain role in here is depicted to be a powerful fighter with crazy  merciless personality not charismatic like in the game. In here it is shown that he treat the lady horribly even killing Chizuru  the statue that he had is super mediocre... Definitely not Rugal at all.Chizuru Kagura Again  again... OK I'll just say my opinion on her in here. My thought she's boring but since her role isn't big I kinda confused to judge her completely yet Chizuru wasn't my favorite character so I don't know much about her.Vice  Mature I think their character were too resembles like other video games adaptation being a henchmen for the bad guy. So they're completely boring IMO.Saisyu Kusanagi Hahaha he's nothing look alike with his son at all...  funny thing he looked like an comedian instead of fighter. The rest... Well just like other video games adaptation about family relationship in martial arts.  that's boring once again IMO.That's all that I can say about the characters  after u read this you'll be noticed that none of the characters in here were resembles like in the game but that's just my opinion. Lastly if you loved the games so muchKOF fans this is a big mistake for you to watch it. Even for action lovers this film had a few action scenes yet it is short  stupid IMO... But that's up to you whether you want it or not just judge them by yourself.";

To make matters worse there is no semifull contact bouts just the usual shaky camera and telephoned moves even a kid could see from miles away. The worse point who made me fast forward the rest of the movie was the introduction of the white 'fighter' aka Sean Faris. Kyo Kusanagi is Japanese not caucasian and the funny part lurk around the corner. He is Japanese as a kid in flashbacks but turn full American later one !? In the end it doesn't really matter for the producers who cast Korean and Chinese in Japanese roles because they forget the cardinal rules of MA movies. If you don't have a story make the bouts realistic. If the fighters are bad make the story interesting. If both the story and fighters are bad hire a couple of good stunt men.".

The story line is simpler than the complex explanation Good guys fight bad guys.People fight in games in an alternate dimension that is made virtual with ear pieces. It combines magical ancient oriental artifacts with Bluetooth technology. There is also an evil spirit that can be let loose which will make the games real. Maggie Q fights in a short skirt with stockings. She dates a man who was a former champion. But is really not her boyfriend...While the fighters are having a meeting a man Rugal Ray Park decides to bring a gun to a fist fight runs off with the artifacts and physically goes into that other dimension. The CIA is monitoring the activity. Maggie Q is instructed to go find a man who is in a mental institution one where all you have to do is go up to the front desk and ask to speak to a patient and they unlock the door for you.Rugal has taken control of the games and issued a challenge to all the remaining reality fighters except they don't know they will be fighting with their own lives!Once he beats up all the fighters he gets the title King of Fighters for what it is worth. What is that? Like a level 72 in WOW? At this point unless Rugal I would have named Nigel wins and rules the world the plot is predictable. Maggie is not much of an old world traditionalist. She likes the R word reason. Sean Faris plays the son of a former fighter the man in the mental institution. He is into Zen and motorcycle maintenance. Oh! How did the writers ever come up with that! They should have made him a minor league baseball player and have him use his skills later on a nice tiein.On the plus side women fight in short skirts. On the negative side They needed to add a little humor. The movie had some funny lines except they were delivered in a stiff manner. David Leitch who played investigator Terry Bogard absolutely stank. He had the best lines in the movie and screwed them up. They really needed a funny Bruce Willis. The story line was fine it could use a few tweaks but the poor dry dialogue dragged the movie down. If you like girls fighting in short skirts in an alternate reality try Sucker Punch.No sex no nudity no fbombs. Near lesbian scene. Excessive amount of CG style fighting.".

She is one of my favorite actresses a very talented martial artist and I wouldn't normally care about boobs but the character in the game has double d's and that's her gimmick. It wouldn't have been hard to find someone that looked the part. Rugal isn't some young douche named Ray Park he's an old white guy with blonde hair and a beard. Richard Norton who has done many films like this would have been perfect. Terry isn't some old cop he's supposed to be middle aged and an awesome fighter Van Damme played a better Guile and that isn't saying much. Ultimately that had to do with the way that specific character was written and I'll touch on the writing in a moment. Will Yun Lee was great in his role as Iori they seriously couldn't dye the guys hair red just for this movie though? The three girls that I didn't mention were great in their roles also including Sean Faris ha ha ha. Sean Faris is white kyo is Japanese. I guess it sort a didn't work at all. He's also a terrible actor.Candice Elzinga and Michelle Morris did the casting please cross your fingers that the two don't ruin another videogame based film.The movie was poorly written multidimensional fighting tournawhat? This was the first time Rita Augustine and Matthew Ryan Fischer wrote a screenplay so maybe the producers are really to blame for hiring them.It was terribly directed too in comparison to something like Mortal Kombat from the 90's. But Gordon Chan's biggest film prior to this was The Medallion so I wasn't expecting much and even still it's the producer's fault for hiring him.The cinematography was...you guessed it terrible. But the film was fun to watch. A lot of times I found myself interested in the terribly contrived shallow plot meaning structure which is often mistaken for story.The fight scenes were good and that was because Chan has directed several martial arts movies and knows detail in those areas.Should you see this?

Anyway the story line is so obvious that everybody who has seen a couple of these Good guys try to get a treasure and bad guys try to kill them and get it toomovies can really write the script by himself.

But when I watched the movie I was merely disappointed. Again a German Production has overdone it with the action scenes and in the end the whole thing is nothing more than a stunt movie.I cannot comment on the actors because I simply do not know if it was the script the director or their acting which was laughable. Anyway the story line is so obvious that everybody who has seen a couple of these Good guys try to get a treasure and bad guys try to kill them and get it toomovies can really write the script by himself. Thank God I saw the whole thing on TV. I could at least flee every now and then and watch something else...";

	schema:reviewBody "Cascadeur is a German 105minute movie from 1998 so this one will have its 20th anniversary next year and this one was directed by Hardy Martins who also plays one of the crucial characters in here. It is not a small screen block buster like so many other German action films that try to make an impact frequently about catastrophes. But just like these this one here is a failure as well for the most part. Even if it is for other reasons. But sometimes also for the same reasons. For example it is not just action also drama adventure romance and yeah there are a lot of genres packed in here and I certainly would prefer if they had kept it at 1 or 2 genres and properly delivered in these. The way it actually turned out this is not the case. It is a bit of everything not enough of anything. Heiner Lauterbach probably the biggest name here can be a charismatic actor at times but his character here felt as forgettable as basically everybody else including the protagonists playing the good guys. Lack of shades is also a common problem I believe. The characters here are either 100 good saintlike or 100t evil devillike. The violence feels for the sake of it and never turns this into a gritty watch and the characters overall as well as the general plot idea never made a lasting impact on me. Or an impact at all. So yeah I suggest you keep your distance with this one here as it was a very bizarre watch. Itg also looked really cheap I would say even for a film for the 1990s. production values are just as much a letdown as everything else in here. Watch something else instead.".

Here in Brazil Le Convoyeur is being released in DVD and is a smash hit everywhere. Forget Leon Luc Besson's epic of violence this is the ultimate french thriller a nailbiting classic of violence and action that should resist the test of time and in the following years gets the respect it deserves. The story is simple at least you think so at the beginning Alexandre Dumarre Albert Dupontel is the new guy on the job of cash truck there is a series of attacks being perpetrated against the cash trucks and people suspect there are insiders in the firm giving away the routes. You meet the guys of the cash truck and by the end you'll fell that you actually meet those guys and maybe had a drink with them. Dumarre has his own agenda but you will only find out his reasons in the end. It is a film that respects its characters and give each one room to grow. When the action arrives it's devastating. The final ten minutes are a tour de force of violence and action in the most realistic and brutal way. You won't see choreographed gun fights you will get real action grittier more brutal and let me say that the ending left me shocked  really. This is not a horror film but the final minutes well they scared me! Albert Dupontel is the best actor I've seen in a long time. This guy is an actor with a capital A he gave the best performance of Irreversible here he is even better. People only talk about the America icons like De Niro and Pacino. Well Dupontel is brilliant and should be put in the same category of the very best. Jean Dujardin is also fine here he is funny and by the end CONTAIN SPOILERS He is scary as hell END OF SPOILERS Please American distributorsmark my words give Le Convoyeur a chance to be shown in USA it's by far the very best thriller of 2004 hell of the last five years!".

If you are looking for a feelgood ending look away now. Noneless I love this film for all those reasons. It's very well cast acted and paced Dupontel is excellent in this understated almost shy character but ruthlessly driven to revenge. SPOILER He and his son get shot on a deserted road witnessing a robbery on a armored car however he alone survives but is left crippled with intense epileptic fits and the story hints that he hasn't got much time left. After the loss of their son in such a brutal way his wife despairs into an almost catatonic state while he leaves his past life behind to hunt down the murderers. Believing the robberies were inside jobs he then enrolled in one of the targeted security firm on the verge of collapse hoping to get close to the gang.".

It's very well cast acted and paced Dupontel is excellent in this understated almost shy character but ruthlessly driven to revenge. SPOILER He and his son get shot on a deserted road witnessing a robbery on a armored car however he alone survives but is left crippled with intense epileptic fits and the story hints that he hasn't got much time left. After the loss of their son in such a brutal way his wife despairs into an almost catatonic state while he leaves his past life behind to hunt down the murderers. Believing the robberies were inside jobs he then enrolled in one of the targeted security firm on the verge of collapse hoping to get close to the gang.";

But the Beresford's movie was not exactly the same story as the Convoyeur let's be fair. I do not say that Boukrief made a plagiary. But when he told every one that he was the first to shot a movie about money movers he lies. No excuse for that. Threre is no harm to be influenced. The remake of Criss cross shot in 1995  I don't remember the title sorry  and directed by Steven Sonderbbergh was also about money movers but not in the same way.Anyway I love this picture. A pretty good one and violent too. But in the real life money movers are not all alcoholic drug dealers or silly as they are shown in Le Convoyeur. I know myself some Brink's employees.

	schema:reviewBody "If you think of Peter Cushing in a Hammer production it will be his roles in the colourful and camp horror films that will spring to mind first and for good reason as it's those performances that defined the great actor but Cushing and Hammer also combined on some nonhorror films and Cash on Demand is surely one of the very best of them both in terms of the film itself and the performance from the great Peter Cushing. This is an absolutely brilliant thriller that works thanks to its simplicity commanding and intriguing performances and well written script. The film focuses on a bank in a small town which is managed by the dedicated Mr Fordyce. His bank is disturbed one day by a caller who introduces himself as a man from the bank's insurance company who has come to test the security. However it transpires that the man is actually a bank robber who has come to rob the bank and he's got an associate in Fordyce's house ready to kill his wife and kid if he does not allow the robbery to take place! Peter Cushing's performance in this film is absolutely immense and undoubtedly one of the best of his career. He gets his character spot on and is completely believable throughout the film and this is one of the main reasons Cash on Demand is such a success. He is joined by Andr Morell who is equally brilliant in his role as the debonair bank robber. Every scene in the film takes place either in the bank or just outside of it and most of it takes place in Forsyce's office where we get to watch Cushing and Morell play a game of cat and mouse which is always fascinating to watch. The film remains simple throughout and director Quentin Lawrence keeps his audience interested through the various elements of the plot. The film does have a few twists and turns and of course the best of these is saved right up until the end. Overall this is an absolutely great thriller that is well worth seeing and comes highly recommended! Unfortunately the copy I saw was rather poor which makes this a prime candidate for a pristine release on DVD!".

As a result it's well worth seeingand a great example for film makers as it proves you don't need a huge budget and complex sets to make a good film.The film is set in a bank. The manager Cushing is a humorless and exacting bossvery efficient but not one to inspire his employees' love or devotion. However you dislike the guy though you can't help but feel for him with what happens next. A guy who purports to be from the underwriter for the bank arrives and asks to meet with Cushing alone. The man Morell then announces that he is in fact a bank robber and that if Cushing does not cooperate Cushing's wife and son will be tortured or killed. And he provides a phone message with the scared wife to prove that he means business. What will happen next? Cushing IS a very efficient man but he loves his family and can't let them be hurt.Throughout the film I marveled at Cushing. The actor was known mostly for his horror films but he appeared in gobs of moviesbut never one that allowed him such an opportunity to emote like this. Cushing is very very convincing as a scared and lonely man who feels trapped. It's too bad that many of his other roles were a bit onedimensional and didn't let him demonstrate he was a heck of an actor. Morell is also quite goodbut his smooth criminal doesn't provide him quite the same depth and opportunity as Cushing's. This is Cushing's film.An exciting plot wonderfully written characters and great actingwhat more could you ask for in a crime film?! See this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cash On Demand is a neat little thriller set entirely inside a very small bank with a very small cast. Peter Cushing plays a nitpicking bank manager who finds he loses his dry demeanour when he is at the mercy of a bank robber who has taken his family hostage.The film charts the robber's fiendish plan to calmly loot the bank's safe of all it's money and walk out as though nothing is wrong while all the time putting the terrified manager through the wringer. Cushing really excels in the role of the bank manager and Andre Morell makes an excellent slimy criminal who you just want to punch the entire time.As I said the whole movie takes place in the one setting and almost in real time too. It's enjoyable while it lasts and you'll be wondering what will happen but despite some attempts at dramatic momentsfumbled locks an unexpected window cleaner etc the final payoff is very disappointing as the film ends in a really weak almost feelgood waywhich negates the realistically tense 60 minutes that preceded it and gave me very little satisfaction for justice being done. In this way it's almost like William Castle film  he also bungles his endings in a similar way.Cash On Demand is not very well known but is worthy of a look if you like Peter Cushing as he definitely makes the film.".

Morrell is deliciously nasty but Cushing really deserves some acting kudos for creating a jerk of a character that you actually start to sympathize with as Morrell turns the screws.Quentin Lawrence a veteran of British TV skillfully directs a tight script in a confined setting and keeps the tension high and story moving  almost like it's unfolding in real time. Once the normal routines and relationships are quickly established he ratchets up the tension with Morrell's arrival and never lets up.

Austure fastidious and domineering bank manager Fordyce the always superb Peter Cushing in top form finds himself at the mercy of urbane and wily criminal Hepburn marvelously played to the smooth and smug hilt by Andre Morell who forces Fordyce to assist him with robbing his bank or else Fordyce's abducted wife and son will be severely hurt. Director Quentin Lawrence working from a sharp and witty script by David T. Chantler and Lewis Greifer ably milks the gripping story for maximum suspense and maintains a steady pace throughout. Lawrence downplays action in favor of focusing instead on tension and the shrewd bristling verbal sparring between the two principal characters. Moreover this movie is essentially a clever thriller version of A Christmas Carol with the initially unlikable Fordyce becoming more and more sympathetic as he learns a muchneeded albeit harrowing lesson in humility and thus regains his humanity while doing his best to stay calm and collected under intense pressure. Cushing and Morell do outstanding work in their roles. Richard Vernon likewise does well as kindly chief clerk Pearson. Both Arthur Grant's crisp black and white cinematography and Wilfred Josephs' shivery score are up to par. A real dandy sleeper.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having been a bank employee for a number of years now I guess I have a subversive fondness for caper thrillers especially those dealing with robberies from vaults and which generally involve hostages being taken. Although they have been known to happen locally even during my tenure luckily I have never been subjected to onealthough last year's midyear attempt was quite a close call! Anyway this renowned British example of this subgenre  atypically produced by Hammer Films for all of 37000!  gives studio stalwarts Peter Cushing and Andre' Morell formerly paired as adversaries in a famous 1953 TV adaptation of 1984  that I have yet to watch!  and as celebrated duo of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in their atmospheric 1959 adaptation of THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES arguably the best nonhorror roles they ever had during their stay at Bray Studios.Although the IMDb mistakenly gives the film as being a 1962 production and a mere 66 minutes in length the truth of the matter is more complicated its U.S. distributors Columbia released it over there as early as December 1961 but the movie would not be officially screened on its hometurf until October 1963 its running time then is actually 80 minutes! Based on an earlier TV episode of THEATRE 70 entitled GOLD INSIDE which also shared the same director and starred Morell but with one Richard Warner enacting the role later handled by Cushing. Indeed the Christmas period during which the narrative is set and Cushing's own fastidious and glum character make this seem like a smart revisit of Dickens' Yuletide perennial about a certain cantankerous miser who goes by the name of Ebenezer Scrooge! Cushing in fact plays a strict and unloved manager of a small banking branch in the suburbs who is as distant and authoritarian with his staff as he seems to be with his wife and child. Morell is the atonce gentlemanly and ruthless thief who poses as an auditor from Head Office out to inspect this particular branch's security standards.The fact that a recent minor cash difference had just put a young teller Barry Lowe and the Chief Clerk Richard Vernon at loggerheads with their Manager only exacerbates the tension already present within the enclosed environment and ensures that a series of errors i.e. security breaches are committed that enable Morell's ease of entry into Cushing's office from which he will be conducting his cunning plan of filling up four suitcases which he had Lowe bring back inside from his car parked outside! with the bank's entire cash holding of 93000 since there is a direct passage to the vault downstairs from there! This being the early 1960s it still presents the oldfashioned picture of a branch manager holding one of the keys to the keys to the bank's strongroom with the other held by the Chief Clerk but that situation is all the more plausible for the film being set in a small branch. Morell tells Cushing that he had been planning the heist for a year and one is bound to believe him since he knows every little detail concerning not just the bank's security procedures but also its individual employees! In fact some accomplices are apparently holding Cushing's family hostage and have orders to kill them if the appropriate signals are not given from Cushing's window. The plan goes smoothly for Morell despite the occasional slipup from a brokendown Cushing but he has not reckoned with Norman Bird as an eagertoplease bank employee who belatedly checks up on Morell's identity with Head Office and Kevin Stoney as an overzealous new Police Inspector in town... Apart from the aforementioned stars and a handful of behindthescenes mainstays most of the people involved in the film were not Hammer regulars even so it still emerges as one of their worthier straight efforts and is miles removed from even their other thrillers the telephone sequence with Cushing and his 'family' and the sudden realization of Morell's true intent is more genuinely spinetingling than anything out of the studio's more renowned chillers! Still the miniscule budget ensured that no attempt is made to openup the story which would have justified this bigscreen transposition! but on the other hand this enables it to retain the inherent claustrophobia elicited by its oneset plot one other quibble involves the finale which could have been rendered in a more exciting manner! While Cushing's characterization is impressive it was a pleasure to watch him crack under the strain and become recognizably humane  albeit still reservedly  towards his subordinates as always but Morell is a particular standout here since he was rarely given the opportunity to play lead roles notable exceptions being the original TV serial QUATERMASS AND THE PIT 1958  later condensed for a movie remake by Hammer themselves but starring Andrew Keir!  and the company's sole foray into livingdead lore THE PLAGUE OF THE ZOMBIES 1966 as the charming villain who can just as easily display his menace through the tone of his voice as the use of his hands. Interestingly director Lawrence was the man behind the Hammeresque scifi effort THE TROLLENBERG TERROR aka THE CRAWLING EYE 1958 which I just caught up with last year and THE MAN WHO FINALLY DIED 1963 another thriller featuring Cushing that I have in my unwatched pile. For the record having already acquired a mediocrelooking copy of the film some years back I eventually upgraded to a vastly superior one sourced from Sony's barebones disc as part of their Hammer Films The Icons Of Suspense 6film 3disc set.".

And one can tell that this is based on a play with the accent on dialogue but it's interesting and riveting all the way through with very taut direction by Lawrence who gets superb performances out of his two talented leads. Cushing is a joy to watch as a man who becomes more sympathetic as the story plays out. And Morell is fun as the dapper mostly calm thief. Solid support is provided by Richard Vernon as Pearson the banks' secondincommand Barry Lowe as the teller Harvill and Kevin Stoney as Detective Inspector Mason.Also indicating a stage origin is a limited number of sets but this only serves to give this superior film an intimate feel and help us to get completely involved in this twistladen plot.

Fordyce's ironwilled demeanor is continually pecked at under the strain of the situation especially knowing that if he does not cooperate his family may be killed.As with the jury room setting in 12 ANGRY MEN the strongest factor of this film lies in its simplicity all the action takes place inside the bank and it draws the viewer in just through the intense interplay of Cushing and Morell alone who each excel in their parts. Also very good is Richard Vernon as a likable clerk who's always under the thumb of the unsympathetic Fordyce.

This puts the usually controlling Cushing into the position of being the controlled and gives the audience an insight into the emptiness of this man's soul.The severe face of Cushing is well utilized for the character of Mr. Fordeyes a Dickenslike take on Four Eyes for this bespeckled character perhaps? an Ebenezer Scrooge if there ever was one. The fact that this takes place near Christmas time and the staff members of the bank are discussing whether or not there will be a Christmas party makes that comparison even more perfect. The audience also gets to look both into the criminal mind and the security workings of a bank and each twist and turn that this caper takes will bring you close to the edge of your seat. It isn't the banker you care about but the staff and his unseen wife. Eventually as his desperation becomes more apparent you do begin to feel something for Cushing if at least pity. Andr Morell delivers a sly performance as the alleged Colonel while Richard Vernon is also excellent as the chief clerk whose 10 years of service are being threatened by Cushing's accusations of incompetence.

From a technical viewpoint it was rather primitive production viewed with modern eyes but at the same time has a power that is undiminished by time . Much of this is down to the acting skills of the two leads and the scene where Morrell's villain tortures Cushing's everyman hero remains stark raw drama at its best . Morrell also starred as the eponymous hero of QUATERMASS AND THE PIT and much of that teleplay's success is down to Morrell as the lead character It's the casting that makes this somewhat staid  static British B movie something of an unknown forgotten classic .

If you enjoyed Morrell as Quatermass you'll enjoy his performance here as he enjoys taking control of a situation that he is charge of . Bullying and authoritative  a genuine control freak he enjoys dominating Cushing's Fordyce without once ever going over the top . Cushing is equally as good  in fact it's possibly his career best performance What let's the film down is the denouement which is very much ambiguous and open to interpretation . There's several ways you can read it none of which are entirely satisfactory but it helps if you watch the film at Christmas time and remind yourself of a famous Christmas fable by Charles Dickens .

CASH ON DEMAND is an obvious redemption plot but the journey is far more important than the destination and the journey is enthralling down to the two leads";

	schema:reviewBody "It takes the British to make something memorable and gripping out of an ordinary bank heist movie helped by two tremendous performances. Astonishing that Hammer invested only 37000 pounds by 2009 standards into this film!! Peter Cushing is perfection as the martinet Mr. Fordyce a bank manager who runs the bank and his life like clockwork!! His nit picking and constant carping don't make for a happy work place and he is constantly tried by Pearson can't remember the actor's name but he was terrific as the old Major in The Duchess of Duke Street. Pearson is constantly stressed but hard hearted Fordyce will not recommend the transfer Pearson so desperately craves in fact he is contemplating dismissing the luckless teller!!Into this oppressive atmosphere breezes Captain Hepburn passing himself off as head of a security firm employed by the bank's head office to tour the branches to see their security is up to snuff. He is really the head of a slick band of bank robbers although you only see him but he succeeds in ingratiating himself with the staff something Fordyce has never been able to do by donating a fiver to their office party. The put upon staff have been too frightened to bring up the subject of a Christmas party with the manager for fear of being shot down in flames.Pearson proves a bit of a red herring he is just about to witness his whole life go up in smoke could he be up to doing something not above board?  but in reality it is his suspicion that saves the day. He has already got in touch with the head office security and realises there is every reason to worry  when Fordyce is still trying to butter up to Hepburn who can see at a glance what the staff really think of their manager!! Hepburn has made it his duty to research each bank worker  he knows Pearson has his worries that another staff member has just won a chess club tournament and that Fordyce's wife has more fear of him than love. Andre Morrel a staple of British movies and TV from the 40s 50s and 60s is just superb as the villain with the human touch a very uncommon thief!!Highly Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Harry Fordyce Peter Cushing is a strict exacting and rather mean spirited bank manager who is unpopular with everyone including his staff who dislike his fussy and micro management style. But his life is dramatically changed one Christmas when he is visited by a smooth bank robber called Colonel Gore Hepburn Andre Morell. Posing as a representative from an insurance company to secure access into the bank he threatens Fordyce with the lives of his wife and son in order to force him into helping him steal 97.000 from the vault. But is the Colonel all that he appears to be and could the ordeal encourage Fordyce to become a better man?If proof were ever needed to show that Hammer could make worthwhile movies away from their trademark gothic horrors then this deeply felt 'B' pic crime drama could well be it. It has been described as the studio's take on A Christmas Carol and that is a fair comment since the plot revolves around Cushing's mean spirited banker  a sort of Ebeneezer Scrooge character who is encouraged to change his ways by Morell's cunning and undeniably ruthless crook but who also has a deep interest in people and their character with a generous kind hearted streak in him. He acts as Jacob Marley and the Ghosts of Christmas Past Present and Future all rolled into one but the difference here is that he is a more earthly spirit. Directed by the underrated Quentin Lawrence whose credits include such TV classics as The Avengers Gideon's Way and instalments the long running British soap opera Coronation Street does an incredible job of sustaining the suspense and intrigue which is especially remarkable since 99.9 of the plot unfolds from a single set. He is much aided in this by the sharp editing of Eric Boyd Perkins. The audience is teased and kept guessing all the way as we wonder if Morell's villain is really what he claims to be. For instance by the way he forever encourages Cushing to value his family more and to treat his staff with more respect  he forces him to contribute to the fund for their works' Christmas do  if the robbery could be make believe and perhaps an elaborate charade laid on by either his colleagues or his family to get him to see the error of his ways. Or perhaps it is genuine since a number of incidents occur along the way which threaten to compromise the success of the job and we are kept on the edge of our seats wondering if the wife and son whom we only hear on a telephone and see in a photograph are about to be really imperilled. The performances from Cushing and Morell two of Hammer's greatest stars are a joy to behold and it will amuse you to see how seriously the former always took his parts by the immense attention to detail he put into them. All in all a gem from the Hammer studio that should on no accounts be missed by its fans and lovers of great movies alike.".

	schema:reviewBody "With the title CASINO NO LIMIT one would expect some attention to the gambling details perhaps even a suspenseful war of wills across the table. Instead we get highquality Euro Sex over 212 hours worth but the videomakers decided to punt on the game of chance content.That's a shame because otherwise this is a glamorous galfilled porn video from Marc Dorcel boasting 14 girls 12 scenes. I guess the amount of thought and care to completing the entertainment package was just beyond the abilities of writerdirector Herve Bodilis.Flashbacks provide the back story as Dorcel regular Horst Baron portrays Horst entire cast use the same names for their characters too a war criminal seen torturing and then executing a hapless guy in opening scenes. Melissa Lauren buxom French actress wellknown from hundreds of U.S. made XXX videos wants revenge and schemes along with wheelchair bound Alex as Alex natch to get some. Alex wants revenge against Nacho Nacho Vidal an excellent villain and no slouch in the humping department the guy who put him in a chair three years back.Yasmine is Alex's main squeeze and a key cog in the revenge plot she's an amazing beauty who generally earns her top or near the top billing in a Dorcel exercise. Other key player is Tony Tony Carerra a gangster living very high on the hog in Ibiza who is quite colorful boasting plenty of tattoos and having a cute pug as mascot. He's certainly the least hissable of the villains.One peculiarity of this video is that all the major female roles are played by brunettes most of them outfitted with extremely fake looking wigs seeming to be auditioning for a Vampira role while the attractive blondes with the exception of Natali DiAngelo are just on hand as eye candy and sex filler with zero dialog. Given the huge cast list I found this pecking order fascinating and peculiar though it is true that in mainstream cinema it's the brunettes Roberts Swank Bullock Portman etc. who bring home the bacon with superstar longevity far exceeding that achieved by their blonde sisters take Pfeiffer or even Lange for example in hindsight view.The one token redhead in the cast is Ana Martin merely wearing a bright red wig that looks like it was sent over from Ricky's moments before the shoot. Her scene is near the finish a very very strange contest of Melissa arm wrestling Ana while various thugs molest them from behind as a distraction. Such irrelevant kinkiness is what puts Euro Trash porn on a pedestal or into the gutter depending upon one's pointofview. Dorcel is on a safe sex kick every video has a couple of PSA's included stressing condom use so even in this life  death world every villain and thirdrate henchman remembers to put on a rubber before raping or just routinely penetrating the 14 count 'em 14 women in the cast.With Lauren and Yasmine leading the way the sex scenes are strong and plentiful which will obviously endear CASINO to the undiscriminating porn fan. One rather violent sex scene where nasty Nacho forces Lauren to gaggingly deep throat him is quite impressive and works well in the narrative since we know she already hates his guts enough to want to kill him.So why do I complain about the gambling? Early scenes show the cast playing roulette blackjack and poker at a casino frequented by Horst and his evillooking secretary Nina Nina Roberts but the plot builds up to an illegal No Limits game staged by Tony in which not only does each of the four contestants put up a million euros each for starters but when cleaned out you are permitted to literally bet your life.The game they're playing appears to be a modified version of the currently trendy Texas Hold'em but Bodilis' direction of the poker action is so sloppy you never know what's going on and there's no suspense whatsoever before some guy announces say Two Jacks what's in his own concealed hand not the total five card combination which counts and is pronounced the loser. Why not show the cast sweating out each card betting before and after the River rather than truncating all the gambling scenes to the point of irrelevancy? This is Filmmaking 101 or videomaking I guess but perhaps pornographers have reinvented the wheel to their own stupid sex is all agenda.".

Next to 48 Hours I think this is one of the best buddy cop movies I have yet seen.  Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez make a wonderful team with deadon chemistry.  Dreyfuss steals the show with his hilarious performance proving he's just as talented at doing broad comedy as he is intense drama.  That especially shows in the scene where he's about to walk out of Madeline Stowe's house but doesn't want to be recognized so he asks her to lend him a hat.  The way he handled that scene was so magnificent and there are many other farcical moments that he handled just as efficiently and with the wrong timing and delivery those scenes could've collapsed.  Estevez plays the straight man also doing a magnificent job and you really feel his envy when he's spying on Stowe who's being hit on by Dreyfuss.  I loved the scenes where the rival cops pulled pranks on each other.  Speaking of which Forrest Whitaker pops up in a fine early performance.  And Madeline Stowe is great and sexy as always.   Sure the plot is quite predictable but as I said I was always entertained thanks to sharp writing and great performances.  John Badham is a fine action director so he kept those action scenes filled with suspense and tension.  Stakeout is not a film that will keep your brain occupiedas a matter of fact there are some scenes that require you to check your brain at the doorbut I assure you that you'll have a damn good time.My score  8 out of 10".

	schema:headline " Dreyfuss' best effort since his 70's movies";
	schema:reviewBody "There is something about Richard Dreyfuss that makes me think of George Clooney.  I believe Clooney is one of a very few slate of actors that can make any scene work no matter how good or bad it is written.  Dreyfuss is like that too.  I remember a particular scene in Jaws when he brings wine over to Brody's house and Brody cracks it open and decides to drink from it. Dreyfuss tries to warn him by saying   You might want to let that breathe....  nothing nothing.  He takes a small scene and makes it that much more interesting by his excellent interpretations of who they are. Chris Leece is his best acting since the seventies.  He is so much fun to watch and it is his relationship with Bill  Estevez  and the other two stakeout cops  one of them being a very funny Forest Whitaker  that make this film a treat to watch.  Its strengths are its dialogue and acting and although Badham directs a fast and frenzied film  much like Beverly Hills Cop  some of the movie just doesn't fit especially the end where it resorts to Bruce Willis tactics and ends with explosions and death.  But that aside the film excels and it is a very funny film written by the same guy that had a hand in The Fugitive.Here we have a film about two cops  Dreyfuss and Estevez  that are assigned to watch the home of the girlfriend of an escaped convict that may be on his way back to see her.  Dreyfuss ends up getting a little too close to his subject and before long he ends up falling in love with her.  This puts Bill in an awkward situation because not only is it against the rules and ethics but he has to now cover for Chris during briefings with his superiors and he also has to keep the other two cops on the stakeout from finding out about Chris' involvement with their subject.  The subject's name is Maria and she is played with richness by Madeline Stowe  The General's Daughter .Some of the hilarity in this film lies with the two sets of cops trying to out do one another in their pranks.  It seems that they have worked on stakeouts together before and it is shenanigans like leaving dog poop in the fridge and putting marker on the rims of the binoculars that add some nice comedy to the routine.  Dreyfuss also has one hilarious line that had me laughing for quite some time.  When they first get their description of who it is that they are watching it describes Maria as 5'5 and 342 pounds.   342 pounds!  OHHH she could be the house! The film works great as a comedy and only so so as a violent action film. I think the film would have benefitted if it stuck strictly to comedy and instead of reverting to a chase and explosions at the end they could have written it better so that it is resolved with words and comic genius just like the rest of the film.  But overall this film is worth seeing for its hilarity. One final note.  Chris and Bill have movie line contests.  It is a great way to pass the time and when Bill asks Chris the one line  Well this was not a boating accident.  Chris doesn't know.  That is a nice touch seeing as it was Dreyfuss' Matt Hooper from Jaws that said that.  That's a nice piece of inside Hollywood and it plays really well.".

	schema:headline " It has the right mix of comedy and action";
	schema:reviewBody "Some people knock this film but I think it is a very good film.The basic plot line is Richard Dreyfuss Chris Lecce and Emilio Estevez Bill Reimers are detectives who are assigned to stakeout a woman Madeline Stowe. Her exboyfriend is a violent con who has escaped from prison Aidan Quinn and the F.B.I think there may be a chance that he will try to get in contact with her. Chris Lecce soon finds himself falling in love with Maria and gets in many funny situations as he comes a part of the stakeout himself such as him leaving her house the next morning after they have made love and disguising himself with a pink hat and shawl and trying to evade the police without being recognised and ending up being on the surveillance and on tape.I think the number one thing that works for the film is the relationship between Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez's characters. They have great chemistry and just bounce humour off one another. Another humorous aspect to their relationship is a type of role reversal. Chris is older than Bill but yet he is not that bothered about promotion and he doesn't commit to any of his girlfriends. While Bill is a happily married man who has a child and who wants to go up the promotion ranks.Another thing that makes me laugh is the competition Bill and Chris have with Dan Lauria Phil Coldshank and Forest Whitaker Jack Pismo where they play practical jokes on one another. I especially liked the one Bill played on Phil's dog where he put a wild cat in the car and the cat ended up chasing Phil's dog down the road. Brilliant! The film even had time to add romance to the story between Maria and Chris which added another dimension to the film and it was interesting seeing their relationship develop and what would happen in the end when Maria found out Chris was a cop.This film has the right mix of genres in it and it doesn't slow down the plot line but it gives you different emotions to feel humour romance and your heart rate jumping which it did in the scene where you think Aidan's character has come and he kills Chris and Maria. I jumped out of my seat at that. I liked that John Badham added that as at that point you have taken in the humour and romance and then this scene comes along that surprises and shocks you.One of my best Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez films.".

Aidan Quinn is very good as the bad guy and I thought Estevez and Dreyfuss had wonderful chemistry together plus it's very well made and written as well. It's also pretty underrated in my opinion and one of the funniest scenes in the movie for me is when the cops are chasing Dreyfuss as they think he's the suspect and he's wearing a pink hat and weird clothing plus this should be higher then 6.4!. The whole cast really seemed to be enjoying themselves and Dreyfuss and Stowe had pretty good chemistry together as well plus the finale is quite exciting. The ending is very funny and it had some great music in it as well plus the opening was somewhat disturbing. This is a great ActionComedy that's quite hilarious and very entertaining with a cool story Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez were brilliant together I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. John Badham does a great! job here with really good camera work good angles and keeping the film funny and at a very fast pace. The Acting is wonderful!. Richard Dreyfuss is amazing here he is extremely hilarious very likable had wonderful chemistry with Estevez had some cool lines seemed to be enjoying himself and had perfect comic timing! I love this guy!. Emilio Estevez is amazing as always and is also amazing here he is extremely likable funny worked so well together with Dreyfuss had lots of charisma and had some really funny scenes he was amazing! Estevez rules!!!!!!!. Madeleine Stowe is incredibly gorgeous and is amazing as always she had a decent accent was funny had pretty good chemistry with Dreyfuss and had a fun character I loved her as usual! Stowe Rules!!!!!!!. Aidan Quinn is very good as the bad guy he was intense and really convinced me I liked him. Dan Lauria and Forest Whitaker are good as the two dim witted cops I liked them.

Things soon take a bizarre twist as Lecce posing as a telephone repairman and Maguire start to fall in love.Although the film offers no originality and is riddled with clichs it is very entertaining. Although it runs for nearly two hours it thankfully doesn't feel that long and the story keeps you interested all the way. Richard Dreyfus and Emilio Estevez are quality comedians somewhat surprisingly in my opinion. Their jokes and banter make the comedy part of this film work well.The thriller elements are good too Aidan Quinn does a good job making his character look like a real badass and the film's action sequences are really solid precgistuff. I was especially impressed by the car chase which looks really good.Overall this is pure solid 80s entertainment and I think this film deserves to be remembered and watched.

	schema:reviewBody "This is kind of funny and for the most part enjoyable. On the surface it looks like another comic cop thriller but really the core of the plot couldn't be older. That is  it goes way past The Gay Divorce past the Greek or Roman from whom Shakespeare stole A Comedy of Errors back past the masques winding up somewhere I would guess around Homo cromagnonsesis in Les Ezyies de Tayac. The mistakenidentity plot is framed by a bit of violence. First Dreyfus gets into a fist fight with a perp he and Estevez are chasing Estevez is nothing much more than a straight man in this movie and the two combatants fall into a huge container of fish and barely escape being filleted by the Chinese workers. The second involves a shoot out between Aidan Quinn's villain and a lot of cop cars and owes a lot to the chase in Bullitt although done mostly for laughs. At the end there is another strictly conventional shootout and fist fight aboard a boat on top of rolling logs this is Seattle and in a timber mill which gives us a good idea of how gigantic saws are used to turn logs into planks  and men into planks as well given half a chance. Quinn is excellent but so is almost everyone else. Madeleine Stowe is dropdead gorgeous with or without Hispanic makeup and she can act too. Dreyfus is very funny. He is caught in all sorts of embarrassing situations and gets a chance to display that expression of abject humiliation that he does so well. He gets a chance to do a lot of physical comedy too running around wearing a pink sun hat wrapped in a shawl while pursued by the police. And when he inadvertently reveals he is spying on Stowe during a phone call in which he warns her that her food is burning she demands to know how he knew. He tears his eyes from the telescope and tells her I  er  I could hear is sizzling in the background. Then he turns his face to the side wrinkled with disgust and hisses to himself  Heard it SIZZLING in the background? There are all sorts of runins in which she still thinks he is the phone repairman he's been pretending to be and they're all engagingly cute.It's not a masterpiece of comedy and the realistic violence is out of place. But it's smoothly professionally done. There is an icky them song but the composer gives Stowe's scenes a bouncy fingidosaborLatino sound. I've seen this a couple of times and keep waiting to be bored by it but have never quite been able to get over the hump.".

	schema:reviewBody "I absolutely love this movie and watch it at least once a month. It is the perfect blend of comedy and drama and all of the lead characters were well suited for their roles.The only bit that made me uncomfortable was the fact that Chris not only illegally entered Maria's apartment but stuck around to watch her naked in the shower. That wasn't even remotely funny it was frightening. This young woman thinks she is alone in her home and never knows that there is a policemanpervert watching her shower. I couldn't help but imagine what could have happened if she glanced at the doorway and saw a strange man watching her. It makes us uncomfortable because nobody likes to be spied on and we have the illusion of safety and privacy in our homes. I think Chris had an unfair advantage over Maria and that is one of the reasons she was so hurt and angry when she found out who he really was. This guy had listened in on private phone conversations watched her get undressed saw her naked in the shower had been in her bedroom  actually under her bed  watching her in what she thought were private moments. I don't know if I could have forgiven a man for something like that even it was his job. That wouldn't make it any less despicable to me. Chris and Bill were barking like hounds when Maria was taking off her top and were disappointed that she didn't turn around so they could see her breasts. Wonder how Bill's wife would have felt about that behavior? Barring their degenerate and disrespectful behavior the movie was indeed hilarious and it held my attention from beginning to end.Also Maria exercised poor judgment  she just took Chris' word that he was the telephone repairman. She didn't ask for identification and just threw open the door and let him in her apartment. Can we say Boston Strangler? Chris simply climbed through an open window in order to search Maria's bedroom. She wasn't very security conscious at all. A real rapist or killer would have no problem gaining entry. She was a single woman and should have had better sense. It bothered me that Maria's scenes had to be backed by some kind of pseudoLatin music. That seemed a bit offensive to me. None of Chris and Bill's scenes called for some kind of ethnic background music. When Maria was in her kitchen cooking she was bopping around while she stirred her food and boogeying her way over to answer the telephone. It seemed to suggest that of course those freespirited hot blooded Latinas always danced while preparing a meal and had to have some kind of music playing in the background to do the simplest of chores. Just like many commercials that feature African Americans have to have someone rapping or break dancing or singing a gospel song. Can we ever get past these stereotypes?Aidan Quinn playing a bad guy  he was convincingly evil and perfect for the part. A lot of directors wouldn't have been savvy enough to cast him.All in all a thoroughly enjoyable movie that still feels fresh after 20 years.".

	schema:headline " An easy blend of suspense humor wit and action";
	schema:reviewBody "I've always loved STAKEOUT from the first time I saw it in the late 80s up until now. It never loses it's appeal with me. On the surface it's a pretty standard 80s buddy cop action tale. But what translates to the screen is much more than that. Laughter is a hard thing to make a moviegoer do and this film succeeds in virtually every moment that is meant to be funny in making me laugh. I give STAKEOUT great credit for that. It's also a darn good action flick when it has action and that is mostly in the beginning and at the end. In between there's a lot of humor of the slapstick witty and adult kind.Set in Seattle STAKEOUT stars Richard Dreyfuss as Det. Chris Lecce and Emilio Estevez as Det. Bill Reimers. Chris and Bill are tasked to stakeout the home of Maria Vasquez played by Madeleine Stowe in one of the most naturally alluring and sexy performances that you'll ever see on screen. Stowe's Maria is a true bonus for this film bc she is much more than window dressing she is a full blooded and bodied! woman. The detectives have to stakeout her home bc her former boyfriend is an escaped convict who may pay her a visit so the Feds want the cops there to notify them just in case.The convict is Richard 'Stick' Montgomery played by Aidan Quinn in truly scary performance. Stick and his buddy who helped him escape are on their to Seattle to pay Maria a visit to get something that 'belongs' to Stick.Now back to the cops Dreyfus and Estevez have terrific chemistry and really make the most of their roles but this is Dreyfus' show all the way! Dreyfus gives a great physical comic performance here a real gem of a role trapped in a standard cop buddy flick. I mean I can't state it enough Dreyfus is really memorable! Really it's the topflight performances that elevates STAKEOUT above most cop buddy flicks. Everyone really makes the most of what they are given to work with and then Dreyfus takes it all a step further. The film is an easy mix of humor action and even suspense. The climactic ending is one of the more suspenseful things you'll see in any movie. It is all so well done that at times you forget that you are watching just a buddy cop film. There are also really good supporting performances from Dan Lauria and Forrest Whitaker as the other cop pair that alternate stakeout duties with Chris and Bill.Well directed by John Badham STAKEOUT is definitely a film worth seeing!".

	schema:reviewBody "Stakeout is a classic it has a lot of funny moments enough action to at least get you a little going and a perfect but simple love story.Story 910 The story is actually simple for an 80es movie but it does just what is always needed to get a lot of peers to look it up you will love the small subtle wits the overall love that is shared between the two the story goes a little like this. A evil old friend of Maria Madeleine Stowehas just escaped prison his goal is of course to reach her 4 cops are set on a rather long stakeout we happen to see all 4 cops but the story revolves more around Bill Emilio Estevezand Chris Richard Dreyfuss in the start it seems like it is going to be a rather boring stakeout the girl doesn't even seem to be very pretty in the description of the police records as many 80es movies actually as a lot of movies the girl is of course a rather hot babe and this movie is no exception Chris who has just been dumped falls head over heels for this girl hotter then hot and from there on Chris have to protect his identity so that Maria don't know who he really is yet this is tougher then he of course realizes the rest you will need to find out for yourself.Actors 910 We got a mix of a lot of good actors the most noticeable is of course Emilio Estevez Richard Dreyfuss Madeleine Stowe and Aidan Quinn this movie doesn't have a big cast and the rest of the actors are really not the ones catching your eyes since they don't really have much to the story but some lines from the other actors are fun enough to get you going. If you are a fan of either of these 4 fine actors I suggest picking this movie up while it is still in some lending stores I just bought it from an online store and felt that old rush first time I saw it I was ten years old I know what many are going to say this is not a movie for a ten year old and it isn't I can go with it but as ten I loved it anyway it still rocks just as it did back then.Soundtrack 910 I loved the soundtrack there aren't many numbers in this movie but the ones that are perfect for the movie especially the end theme Is It Love I thought that theme was fitting like moth to a flame. I wouldn't buy the soundtrack just for the numbers there are on this soundtrack but defiantly would go to a store looking for some of the songs. Mr Mister would be the first I would sort out in a store just for the heck of it I couldn't find his albums though but that is of course simple cause his carrier was in the 80es and some in the 90es not the 20es but if you find some I would buy it believe me some are worthSpecial Effects NA I know this is an action movie but it doesn't really have any special effects at least not something you would notice but the ones there are does add a little to the movie but in my appointing this movie doesn't really not it at all anyways the comedy and love is enough to hold this movie even for such small flaws but other then that nothingOverall 910 Everything is perfect I could take the count down to 810 for the special effects but that doesn't really would be fair at all I didn't even care for the special effects in the first way so it shouldn't do any good raising a perfectly good movie down to a lower stage. All the way through this movie the mood has a good way of proving something not many movies can do even if this movie is a lot like any other movie this one does it better just my thoughts on this gem of a favorite movie. If you saw this movie I would not suggest seeing Another Stakeout it has its good moments but it is a boring sequel and it screws over a nearly perfect first movie it is just filling and doesn't need to be there at all the first had every potentials and don't need any sequel at all".

A evil old friend of Maria Madeleine Stowehas just escaped prison his goal is of course to reach her 4 cops are set on a rather long stakeout we happen to see all 4 cops but the story revolves more around Bill Emilio Estevezand Chris Richard Dreyfuss in the start it seems like it is going to be a rather boring stakeout the girl doesn't even seem to be very pretty in the description of the police records as many 80es movies actually as a lot of movies the girl is of course a rather hot babe and this movie is no exception Chris who has just been dumped falls head over heels for this girl hotter then hot and from there on Chris have to protect his identity so that Maria don't know who he really is yet this is tougher then he of course realizes the rest you will need to find out for yourself.Actors 910 We got a mix of a lot of good actors the most noticeable is of course Emilio Estevez Richard Dreyfuss Madeleine Stowe and Aidan Quinn this movie doesn't have a big cast and the rest of the actors are really not the ones catching your eyes since they don't really have much to the story but some lines from the other actors are fun enough to get you going. If you are a fan of either of these 4 fine actors I suggest picking this movie up while it is still in some lending stores I just bought it from an online store and felt that old rush first time I saw it I was ten years old I know what many are going to say this is not a movie for a ten year old and it isn't I can go with it but as ten I loved it anyway it still rocks just as it did back then.Soundtrack 910 I loved the soundtrack there aren't many numbers in this movie but the ones that are perfect for the movie especially the end theme Is It Love I thought that theme was fitting like moth to a flame. I wouldn't buy the soundtrack just for the numbers there are on this soundtrack but defiantly would go to a store looking for some of the songs. Mr Mister would be the first I would sort out in a store just for the heck of it I couldn't find his albums though but that is of course simple cause his carrier was in the 80es and some in the 90es not the 20es but if you find some I would buy it believe me some are worthSpecial Effects NA I know this is an action movie but it doesn't really have any special effects at least not something you would notice but the ones there are does add a little to the movie but in my appointing this movie doesn't really not it at all anyways the comedy and love is enough to hold this movie even for such small flaws but other then that nothingOverall 910 Everything is perfect I could take the count down to 810 for the special effects but that doesn't really would be fair at all I didn't even care for the special effects in the first way so it shouldn't do any good raising a perfectly good movie down to a lower stage. All the way through this movie the mood has a good way of proving something not many movies can do even if this movie is a lot like any other movie this one does it better just my thoughts on this gem of a favorite movie. If you saw this movie I would not suggest seeing Another Stakeout it has its good moments but it is a boring sequel and it screws over a nearly perfect first movie it is just filling and doesn't need to be there at all the first had every potentials and don't need any sequel at all";

And guess what? The two cops in question Dreyfuss and Estevez are polar opposites. Original right? Where Stakeout succeeds and other formulaic movies fail is that it is fun to watch. Isn't that really what we all hope for when we watch a movie? We want to be entertained. Stakeout doesn't break any new ground but Dreyfuss and Estevez work very well together. There are some great one liners and although the buddy cop thing has been done to death the plot is fairly original.The only true downfall of Stakeout is the score which DEFINITELY dates the movie. There are some good songs from the time but the background music is horrendous. Not enough to ruin the movie though.Have you ever been wandering through the video store having a difficult time finding something that catches your eye? Maybe the movies that you came for were out or maybe you're just not impressed with any of the new releases. You come across a movie that you sort of remember but you can't remember too much. Maybe it has an actor you recognize. You take a chance on the movie and it turns out to be the surprisingly best rental you've made in quite a while. That's Stakeout.".

The great duo of Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas! Try to count how many famous personalities of the 20th century will you recognize? Burlesque parody circus puns play of words with a lot of languages and  how strange!  you will understand all! I have to admit that somehow this movie is moving too  especially at the end.

As a result the impact of the film was somewhat lost on me. I was expecting an action film instead of a character drama with lots of police procedure. But now older and wiser and with a brand new Blu Ray of the movie I am finally able to appreciate how clever the film is.The story unfortunately IS riddled with 80s Cop Movie clichs and goes through quite a lot of familiar motions. But if you see past that you'll appreciate the immense atmosphere and mood that Ridley Scott piles on. Simply put Michael Douglas is Nick Conklin a bad cop pretty much the exact same character in Basic Instinct who drag races on his superbike to pay alimony and pinches drug money instead of turning it in for evidence. Enjoying lunch with partner Charlie Andy Garcia in a steakhouse in New York's meatpacking district they just happen to witness a Yakuza execution by wanted Japanese criminal Sato Yusaku Matsuda who was dying of cancer during filming and didn't tell anyone. After a quick punchup and shootout they find themselves chaperoning Sato back to Osaka. But when they arrive there he manages to escape leaving them embarrassed with lots of questions to answer.Nick and Charlie find themselves in a very foreign and intolerant world and recapturing Sato proves to be difficult in many ways. Not the least of which is Japan's alienating culture from an NYPD point of view and rigid rules. Nonetheless Nick is determined to catch Sato and restore his honor.Like I said the atmosphere of the film is overwhelming which is really all the film needs. The clichs and stereotypes don't matter so much when you are involved this much. Hans Zimmer his first film with Ridley Scott provides a deeply emotional and very melodic score that'll be rattling around in your head for days. It's a shame it's never had a comprehensive CD release as it's one of Zimmer's most impressive efforts.You could call it a pretty 80s movies but I still do feel that it holds up pretty well today. As one of Ridley Scott's more forgotten works it's well worth checking out.".

Black Rain is another fishoutofwater yarn in which a cop leaves his usual patch to track down a criminal in an unfamiliar place see also Brannigan French Connection II No Mercy Beverly Hills Cop etc. for other versions of what is virtually the same story. The unoriginality of it all is a bit disappointing in all honesty but Black Rain compensates for its overfamiliarity by excelling in other areas.Reckless New York cop Nick Conklin Michael Douglas  looking more like his father Kirk than ever and his partner Charlie Vincent Andy Garcia catch a Japanese gangster named Sato Yasuka Matsuda in their city. They are assigned to escort Sato back to Japan and hand him over to the Japanese police. However almost immediately upon their arrival Sato escapes with the aid of some of his underworld friends cunningly disguised as cops. Nick and Charlie are left with egg on their face and endeavour to help the Japanese police to recapture their man. They join Japanese cop Masahiro Ken Takakura but police methods in Japan prove very different to what the Americans are accustomed to and soon differences in approach boil over into frustration and violence.Scott paints the nighttime streets of Osaka as some kind of neonlit nightmarish maze. It becomes easy to relate to Nick and Charlie's bewilderment and the viewer is left glad NOT to be sharing their experiences in the seedy dangerous environment of this seemingly hostile city. There are some attempts to explore the different codes of honour by which the American and Japanese law enforcers measure their success. Also the film establishes and sustains an edgy atmosphere one scene in which a key character is lured into a trap and beheaded is especially tense.Black Rain is a mix of effective and notsoeffective elements. The visuals the atmosphere and the cultural alienation of the main character are very interesting while the plotting and dialogue are disappointingly familiar. It's definitely a film worth catching though it probably won't be remembered as fondly fifty years from now as some of the director's other films.".

I think its due to the fact he starred as one on TV in The Streets of San Francisco. Everything blends in this cop thriller. It oozes style and panache. It also has an underlying emotional core that I think gets underrated by critics. Douglas as Nick Conklin has some fine moments playing off the characters played by Andy Garcia Kate Capshaw and especially Ken Takakura. This movie combines excellent acting gorgeous cinematography great atmosphere along with some solid action set pieces...and gets it right. Director Ridley Scott brings all his cinematic guns to bear and spins these elements into a definitive police action thriller. I loved this flick when I saw it in 1989 and I still do. It may not be as audacious as when it premiered time has seen to thatex.action scenes have really gone virtual realitybut it's still a respectable addition to your DVD library. And of that fact there is no gray area!".

The cinematography and even the costumes were phenomenal and couldn't have been any better. Whoever did the casting for this movie earned their pay and then some. You couldn't have found better actors anywhere in the world. This is Michael Douglas at his best as New York Detective Nick Conklin a macho yet streetwise cop after a coldblooded Yakuza killer all the way from the back alleys of Manhattan to the streets of Japan. Andy Garcia also gives a tourdeforce performance as Douglas's partner Charley Vincent and gives the movie some extra humor. There some great one liners here. I even like Kate Capshaw as Conklin's friend and love interest. Sato Kogei the bad guy is played brilliantly and almost effortlessly by Yusako Matsuda. Why haven't I ever seen this guy in anything else? Definitely one of my top ten best villains to grace the silver screen. Also look for Ken Takakura as Masahiro Matsamodo the stubborn and by the book police officer who befriends Douglas and Garcia and helps them chase Matsuda Takakura was also in Mr. Baseball. Sato's rival Sugai Kenyo gives a stunningly great performance as well as the old time crime boss. Anyways if you haven't seen this film go out and get it like I did and make it part of your collection. Its great viewing timeless and worth every penny. You won't regret it.".

There are so many levels about this film that I love the story the acting the action sequences the cinematography the musicto name a few.The story is simple Nick Conklin Michael Douglas is a New York cop who is under investigation by Internal Affairs for corruption. When eating lunch Nick and his partner Andy Garcia witness a bloody double homicide. They catch the perpetrator but because he is Japanese and a wanted criminal in Japan he must be taken back to his home country for trial. Reluctantly Nick and his partner take him home but lose him in their custody. They then team up with the Japanese law enforcement to catch the criminal. The film really explores the different styles of cop work from New York and Japan. Nick is a hardass who breaks the rules to get the job done. In contrast the Japanese law enforcement does everything by the book which provides no help particularly with the Japanese cop named Masa Nick and his partner are assigned to played wonderfully by Ken Takakura. Not only do the two cops buttheads but when the film's plot takes a dark turn Nick and Masa learn to tolerant their differences and work together. As a result both also learn some important lessons from each other. Critics have always said that Michael Douglas's best role is his 1988 Oscar winner for Gordon Gekko in Wall Street. I beg to differ. Douglas as Nick Conklin is his best performance. Why? Unlike Gordon Nick goes on a journey that ultimately changes his character. There is a strong sense of ambivalence in his character as he teams up with the Japanese law enforcement to catch the Yakuza boss. As mentioned above Nick is a jerk at first but as the film progresses he learns some important lessons in Japan and likewise with the Japanese cop. This is what I love about Douglas's performance. He should have received a nomination for this film.Andy Garcia is perfect as Nick's partner he supplies the comic relieffulfilling as the good cop. Ken Yakuza as Masa is another great addition to the film. I wish I had seen him in more movies. The actor who plays the villain I can't remember his name is perfect. He carries both the demeanor and facial expressions of a naturalborn psycho. It is sad that he was dying of bladder cancer when he was filming this moviehe would have had quite a career. Another aspect worth noting is Jan De Bont's cinematography. He captures a very Blade Runner look dim lighting smoke filled rooms and streets and skyscraper vistas. His work is truly breathtakingcapturing Tokyo at the rise of its peak in the late 1980s. Hans Zimmer's score is flawless. He incorporates oriental instruments to accommodate the Japanese atmosphere as well as includes synthesis brooding drums and electric guitar to reflect the two Americans in Japana West meets East feeling I love it! People do not talk much about this film perhaps because it has fallen under as just another crime action flick. Yes there is plenty of action including a big shootout at the end following a sweet motorcycle chase and a brutal handtohand fight between the good guy and bad guy. However there are so many levels to this film that I feel most people overlook. It has action but there is more than it. Black Rain has it all drama some light humor brilliant performances an interesting plot and a tourdeforce in the filmmaking aspects specifically in direction cinematography and music.My rating obvious  out of ".

Takakura a star in his home country is eminently sympathetic and Matsuda's way of playing his role  with a touch of smart aleck snooty adolescence  is nothing short of brilliant.This was Douglas's project perhaps he had something in mind. It's interesting with respect to the title what that title means and the fact that a documentary on the subject and with the same name in Japanese came out the same year.Matsuda succumbed to bladder cancer a month after the premiere. He'd known about it for a year but didn't think it fatal. He'd been on his way to making a new film with Sean Connery. Matsuda is a legend in his home country and was so before his illness.The movie is largely about the Douglas and Takakura characters but as always when Hans Zimmer has a hand in production the music really takes off. Zimmer is perhaps the most effective film composer today if not of all time. He's done wonders with movies that might otherwise have not come to people's attention. And this is another great score. The title song with lyrics by Will Jennings is a knockout.And let's not forget Lady Kate Capshaw.This one is bloody and violent and that might not be your cup of tea and it certainly isn't mine but just like with Leon there is a kind of quiet subtle poetry that emerges gore or not.Three days after seeing it again and the music and scenes are still playing in my mind.

	schema:reviewBody "Black Rain is directed by Ridley Scott and written by Craig Bolotin and Warren Lewis. It stars Michael Douglas Andy Garcia Ken Takakura Kate Capshaw Yusaku Matsuda and Tomisaburo Wakayama. Music is by Hans Zimmer and cinematography by Jan de Bont.After New York cops Nick Conklin Douglas and Charlie Vincent Garcia arrest a sword wielding psychopath named Sato Koji Matsuda they are tasked with escorting him back to Osaka in Japan. From here they are plunged into a war that is brewing in the Japanese underworld.You see there's a war going on here and they don't take no prisoners.Welcome to Blade Runner's younger brother Black Rain a Ridley Scott film I feel has never received the credit it deserves. Viewing from the outside it looked like one of those 1980s cop movies one where the main cop is washed up and perched on the edge of oblivion his partner his sanity and voice of reason. However Scott brought in late to direct when Paul Verhoeven bailed wasn't interested in the normalities of the cop drama he saw the potential for cross continent culture clash and the chance to bring his visual skills to the fore.Yep it's the big neon glitter of Osaka and the grime and dime of New York that is the big draw here but characterisations are still rich for the drama with Scott taking plenty of time to set up the lead protagonist. We know Conklin's troubles we know how tight his friendship is with Charlie and by the time things go grim and dour in Osaka we understand just why Conklin plunges head first into a do or die situation.Visually Scott infuses the picture with cramped locales steamy streets industrial wastelands and blood red suns while his lead character is an unshaven trench coat wearer who still manages to look devilishly cool. It's perhaps the drawing of Osaka that is the most impressive for it's an alien creation to us as much as it obviously is to Conklin the ignorance gap between America and Japan still wide apart in 1989.Complaints? At just over two hours in running time the film does have periods of flatness where some better editing wouldn't have gone amiss though Scott's original cut was considerably longer begging the question on if more could have been done to enhance the seething culture clash between cops Conklin and Matsumoto Takakura?Another problem is that Capshaw's character is under written a crime when it's the sole female part of note in a two hour movie. Did more of the character hit the cutting room floor? Likely because now it's a token eye candy offering which is a shame since what little we do get hints at a savvy performance from Capshaw.Ridley Scott lifts Black Rain from merely being a fish out of water thriller to something more layered. True to say there is more style than substance what style though but there is still very much interesting juxtapositioning of countries and human interactions of credible worth as well. 810".

	onyx:emotionText "Black Rain is directed by Ridley Scott and written by Craig Bolotin and Warren Lewis. It stars Michael Douglas Andy Garcia Ken Takakura Kate Capshaw Yusaku Matsuda and Tomisaburo Wakayama. Music is by Hans Zimmer and cinematography by Jan de Bont.After New York cops Nick Conklin Douglas and Charlie Vincent Garcia arrest a sword wielding psychopath named Sato Koji Matsuda they are tasked with escorting him back to Osaka in Japan. From here they are plunged into a war that is brewing in the Japanese underworld.You see there's a war going on here and they don't take no prisoners.Welcome to Blade Runner's younger brother Black Rain a Ridley Scott film I feel has never received the credit it deserves. Viewing from the outside it looked like one of those 1980s cop movies one where the main cop is washed up and perched on the edge of oblivion his partner his sanity and voice of reason. However Scott brought in late to direct when Paul Verhoeven bailed wasn't interested in the normalities of the cop drama he saw the potential for cross continent culture clash and the chance to bring his visual skills to the fore.Yep it's the big neon glitter of Osaka and the grime and dime of New York that is the big draw here but characterisations are still rich for the drama with Scott taking plenty of time to set up the lead protagonist. We know Conklin's troubles we know how tight his friendship is with Charlie and by the time things go grim and dour in Osaka we understand just why Conklin plunges head first into a do or die situation.Visually Scott infuses the picture with cramped locales steamy streets industrial wastelands and blood red suns while his lead character is an unshaven trench coat wearer who still manages to look devilishly cool. It's perhaps the drawing of Osaka that is the most impressive for it's an alien creation to us as much as it obviously is to Conklin the ignorance gap between America and Japan still wide apart in 1989.Complaints? At just over two hours in running time the film does have periods of flatness where some better editing wouldn't have gone amiss though Scott's original cut was considerably longer begging the question on if more could have been done to enhance the seething culture clash between cops Conklin and Matsumoto Takakura?Another problem is that Capshaw's character is under written a crime when it's the sole female part of note in a two hour movie.

Michael Douglas who by 1989 was a big Hollywood star with a mullet plays a crooked cop who escorts a Yakuza home to Japan after witnessing the guy kill two people. His partner Andy Garcia is along for the ride. As soon as they touch down in Tokyo they lose the killer and the chase is on. Soon enough they are teamed up with a bythebook Japanese detective played by the doleful Ken Takakura. The problem with the movie is it is shot MTVstyle and we are all over the place with this one rarely sitting still long enough to catch our collective breath. You'd think Tony not Ridley shot this one. Douglas is fine and basically carries the movie and Garcia is believable as a naive freshfaced youngster who lacks Douglas' street smarts. The bad guys are stock characters and just not that interesting. In the end too much chasing around without much of a payoff will have worn most viewers out long before the final scene.".

	schema:headline " Ogami Itto as a Yakuza Boss";
	schema:reviewBody "Quite frankly my main reason to watch Ridley Scott's Black Rain was the fact that it features the great Tomisaburo Wakayama in one of his last roles as a Yakuza Boss. Wakayama is best known for playing Ogami Itto in six Lone Wolf and Cub Kozure Okami films all of which are personal favorites of mine from 1972 to 1974. Wakayama who died in 1992 the film is from 1989 is always a very convincing reason for me to watch a film. Otherwise I did not expect too much. I am not the biggest fan of Michael Douglas but he was a good choice to the role of the burnedout cop with an anger issue he plays here. Andy Garcia is good as usual and the film furthermore stars prolific Japanese character actor Ken Takakura who very good as a Japanes cop. And everybody knows that Ridley Alien Scott is a more than capable director. The film is entertaining and yet I cannot say I was satisfied with it. Douglas plays Nick Conklin a scruffy American Cop who goes to Japan in order to bring a Yakuza assassin to justice. He is accompanied by his younger friend and fellow cop Charlie Andy Garcia. The two did not expect to get caught in a war between Yakuza gangs however... That's all fine and so is the action but the film maintains to provide an aspect that I hate Black Rain is simply so damn stereotypical that it hurts. The two American cops Nick a roughandready tough guy Charlie a womanizing young fellow are both really 'coool' whereas the Japanese characters are entirely stereotypical duteous but pedantic and exaggeratedly submissive to bureaucratic rules. The constant stereotypes that are yelled at the viewer at every opportunity are really annoying and lessened my enjoyment of the film quite a bit. Otherwise the story is decent enough though by no means original and the action entertains. Tomisaburo Wakayama is of course great as always. My advice In case you wanna watch films about the Yakuza watch Japanese ones.".

The script for Black Rain is actually pretty clichd  amounts to nothing more than a revenge thriller as some hard nosed cop sets out to take down some bad guy after things get personal the partner is killed there are fights near misses  I suppose the thing that Black Rain has going for it to set it apart from the crowd is the setting where a lot of it takes place in Japan as Nick is teamed up with a Japanese cop  the whole clichd 'fish out of water' scenario takes place. Just think Rush Hour 2 2001 without as much action or personality or humour  your almost there. Black Rain takes itself extremely seriously which is at odds with action films of the period if Black Rain had been a Stallone or Schwarzenegger film there would most likely have been oneliners all over the place  a lot more action. Despite it's overlong two hour duration not that much actually happens in Black Rain it's a fairly basic revenge thriller with a simple plot although exposition scenes can drag on  there are loads of long establishing shots which get boring after a while  slow things down even more. There's the expected attempts to highlight the differences in culture  the way they are between America  Japan honour loyalty etc but it doesn't amount to much other than a token gesture to a country that provides a pretty backdrop.It is said that Howard Atherton was cinematographer on the majority of Black Rain but resigned  Jan de Bont who gets final credit was brought in  he finished it  one thing that Black Rain definitely does have going for it is some very nice cinematography be it Atherton's or de Bont's the use of colour  movement is great  it seems every shot is grandiose in scale  packed with things to see  little details  I am sure a lot of time went into the look  feel of the film from the streets of New York to the clubs of Japan to the vineyard where the unsatisfying climax takes place. The makers should have spent a bit more time on the script rather than the look of Black Rain  maybe it would have been a better film. The violence is tame with a couple of slit throats a severed finger  a stabbed hand. There is no sex or nudity although there is some profanity. Apparently Dutch director Paul Verhoeven signed up to make this but dropped out  Scott stepped in.With a supposed budget of about 30000000 this looks great but doesn't have that much action it it apart from an OK shootout at the end Black Rain was actually nominated for two Oscars for Best Sound  Sound Effects although won neither. The acting is good Michael Douglas is fine as is Andy Garcia Kate Chapshaw provides the glamour while Jackie Chan apparently turned a role down in this. Main bad guy Sato was played by Yusaku Matsuda who had bladder cancer at the time of filming  died just seven weeks after it's US premiere.Black Rain is actually quite a basic  clichd cop thriller that probably doesn't have enough action for mainstream audiences  is too simple for the cerebral crowd. It's not the worst film ever but it's not the best  as far as cop thrillers go there's much better out there  I can see why it wasn't a crowd pleaser or much of a success.".

And I did not feel the same the Japanese reviewer did. In my sense the film does not mock Japan. It does not show Japan as 'inferior' but as different. And this is all the interest of this film whose purpose in my opinion is to show the opposite mentalities and culture. Both sides are presented. The bad and the good ones.The Bad  Japoneses are showed as ridiculous with red tape and bureaucracy matters with shy behaviors weird violence for occidental people. But Americans too. Those are presented as brutal stupid beasts for example when Charlie Vincent run after a motorbike without understanding the trap is going into or when Nick Conklin does not manage to restrain himself from knocking everywhere. Or when Nick signs a stupid sheet of paper without distrust. The two Americans are also presented as arrogant as they don't even think that foreigners could speak English .. because they don't imagine it is even possible. Even the AmericanJapanese prostitute rejects their arrogance. Also American police is presented as corrupted and messy ... So no one wins here I guess.The good  Japaneses are also presented as good. Cops are straight but cooperative and honor respectful mainly instructed efficient. Even if they lack of adaptiveness and are bad inspired to reject the American cops help. The mafia is well presented too. Franckly they really are scary guys but gain respect with their honor code. Sato is impressive. Here I agree with the Japanese reviewer  The Americans are glorified music helps . Nick manages on his own yet with the help of Mas to solve a difficult case in a country he obviously even doesn't know. This is clearly the weakness of the film.Yet what I really appreciated was the oppositions between Mas and Nick. Wiseness and honor of Mas for example when he feels insulted by Nicks thief behavior or when he learns from Nick. Humanity and pugnacity of Nick.I also liked mafia's leader speech with Nick. Here we definitively can't say the film only runs for America obviously.One regret. We definitively see too little of Japan. Even if the film does much in presenting a country that we mainly bad know in occident it could have done more. That said I think this was not the purpose of the director who just wanted to focus on mindsets.Another regret  the ridiculous sounds of the motorbikes especially in the beginning of the film and in the last scene. The actors are all perfect. The soundtrack is really cool. Contrarily to the Japanese reviewer I appreciated the way the director represents Japan with subtlety as Japan is all about. And USA with strength as USA are all about too sometimes too much . If the oppositions between the two countries are exaggerated it is in the purpose of showing them better and make understand I guess. This is a 'mustbewatched' film for me. One of the best of Ridley Scott.".

No cultural ambassadorship for Douglas' Nick by any stretch of the imagination. But this characteristic could have been displayed with a great deal more subtlety. The ending is typical hollywood rubbish which allows Douglas to get the bad guy show that he's been somehow cleansed by the experiences in the film and wind up with the girl in the end.

	schema:reviewBody "If you have ever visited a US military base in Europe the one thing that will have impressed you is the way in which Americans overseas build 'little America' around themselves.  They seem unwilling to engage with the society in which they find themselves sticking instead to familiar food drinks and pastimes.  Black Rain is another manifestation of the same phenomenon.In the late 1980's two American cops travel to Tokyo to hand over a Yakuza killer into the custody of the Japanese authorities.  Things go wrong and so the Americans remain in Tokyo determined to ensure that justice is done.At the heart of this film is a deep American mistrust of foreigners. Only the New York cops are capable if the Yakuza is to be fought it's the Americans who will have to do it.  Chopsticks are fiendish alien implements and a regular guy like Michael Douglas won't learn how to use them.  This refusal to meet the host culture on its own terms permeates the whole film. Not only do cliches of Japanese life proliferate they are offered up for the American audience to snigger at.  If there's a bar there has to be a karaoke performance with a Japanese singer giving a 'flied lice' rendition of an American song.  Of course when Charlie of the NYPD takes the stage he rocks the joint  he's showing Japan what popular music is all about.Concentrating as it does on banal examples of Japanese culture for example the removal of shoes on entering a home the film profoundly misunderstands the Japanese mindset.  We meet Sugai the mighty oyebun 'godfather' to use the clumsy American parallel.  He not only sits and chats with Nick Michael Douglas's character but discusses with him the behaviour of another Yakuza member and even follows Nick's instructions concerning a forthcoming ambush.  This is lunacy.  In the real world a man such as Sugai would disdain even to NOTICE a lowly American cop.  Mas is dishonoured by his association with the New Yorkers.  It is inconceivable that he would so much as mention his disgrace in Nick's presence let alone undertake the course of action shown in the film.The two Americans and especially Nick are offered to us as heroic figures because they defy authority.  They use unorthodox policing methods including the physical abuse of prisoners and the destruction of evidence. By contrast the film represents the Japanese police as rather 'square' because they follow procedures.  This glorying in lax professional ethics is quite frankly insulting to the Japanese.  Their cultural values embrace concepts such as correctness and scrupulous honesty civilised virtues which this film sees fit to scoff at.Apart from being a coarse affront to the Japanese whose hospitality the project enjoyed Black Rain is simply a bad movie.  The thing that happens to the police officer in the shopping mall would constitute a fullblown international incident in real life but here it is lamely treated as a mere street crime.  Charlie performs What Did I Say? flawlessy to perfect accompaniment even though he and his Japanese backinggroup have never met before and cannot communicate.  The idea of Joyce the highclass escort girl having to walk home alone in the early hours through downtown Tokyo is utterly ridiculous.  Even more preposterously than that the Americans bluff their way onto a dangerous police raid and are allowed into close unsupervised contact with arrested Yakuza members.  Nick is able to move around the steelworks unchallenged as if the intrusion of unauthorised westerners was a daily occurrence. Motor bikes and cars explode for no discernible reason and Nick is able to escape from an airliner by simply climbing into a food cabinet.  Though he is a stranger to Tokyo and cannot read Japanese characters he has no trouble making his way to Mas's apartment in the suburbs.All these things are sloppy and improbable but they are as nothing in comparison with the preposterous goingson at the film's climax.  An American policeman runs around the Japanese countryside weilding a pumpaction shotgun.  The Yakuza has entrusted its problemsolving to the lone foreigner.  Professional gangsters with Uzis and martial arts knowhow are brushed aside.  A man is arrested without authority or legitimacy. The restoration of the shamed man is ludicrous showing total ignorance of Confucian notions of disgrace.Director Ridley Scott will always be associated with the 'Alien' films and if he sought by the making of Black Rain to break that connection he failed.  With its coloured lights spark showers gouts of steam and cruets of molten metal Tokyo is just another beleaguered spacecraft floating in nothingness.  Nick is a masculine Ripley pursued by The Unknown along the sinister passages of the labyrinth which is Spaceship Tokyo.Nick is an oaf and a crook and Joyce is a carelessly tackedon token love interest.  The 'black rain' of the title is a past horror inflicted on the Japanese by the Americans.  Plus ca change ...".

The idea of Joyce the highclass escort girl having to walk home alone in the early hours through downtown Tokyo is utterly ridiculous.  Even more preposterously than that the Americans bluff their way onto a dangerous police raid and are allowed into close unsupervised contact with arrested Yakuza members.  Nick is able to move around the steelworks unchallenged as if the intrusion of unauthorised westerners was a daily occurrence. Motor bikes and cars explode for no discernible reason and Nick is able to escape from an airliner by simply climbing into a food cabinet.  Though he is a stranger to Tokyo and cannot read Japanese characters he has no trouble making his way to Mas's apartment in the suburbs.All these things are sloppy and improbable but they are as nothing in comparison with the preposterous goingson at the film's climax.  An American policeman runs around the Japanese countryside weilding a pumpaction shotgun.  The Yakuza has entrusted its problemsolving to the lone foreigner.  Professional gangsters with Uzis and martial arts knowhow are brushed aside.  A man is arrested without authority or legitimacy. The restoration of the shamed man is ludicrous showing total ignorance of Confucian notions of disgrace.Director Ridley Scott will always be associated with the 'Alien' films and if he sought by the making of Black Rain to break that connection he failed.  With its coloured lights spark showers gouts of steam and cruets of molten metal Tokyo is just another beleaguered spacecraft floating in nothingness.  Nick is a masculine Ripley pursued by The Unknown along the sinister passages of the labyrinth which is Spaceship Tokyo.Nick is an oaf and a crook and Joyce is a carelessly tackedon token love interest.  The 'black rain' of the title is a past horror inflicted on the Japanese by the Americans.  Plus ca change ...";

And what's so clever about it is how it uses them as a tool of audience manipulation AND has the evil ghosts use Pullman in exactly the same way that we're being used. This is a smartly written screenplay. The story itself is pretty conventional and predictable the loner girl gets teased by a popular girl that nobody really likes who's out to destroy her the popular girl has a cute boyfriend that the loner girl has the hots for etc. etc. story will resolve itself with everyone falling in love with loner girl.I can't quite understand why this movie has such a low rating. The only explanation I can think of is that people prefer emotionally safe movies like Toy Story of the same year that are equally brilliant technically and have as many references but don't sacrifice coolness by showing sentimental sad emotion. It's possible that the movie got marketed incorrectly. The film isn't about spooks like one of those early wonderful Tim Burton fantasies this film also shares with them an outstanding score the film deals  quite movingly I think  with regaining that lost sense of childhood that moment where Casper tries to remember being alive is just wrenching. And the scene relates just as profoundly to us just as he can't remember being alive we can't really remember being kids. I was ten when I first saw this and it had an effect on me then Ricci's description of sunny sideup eggs making her gag subconsciously made me avoid anything less than hard boiled for ten years this is something that I really cherish as being part of my young emotional and visual education and it stands up today. I haven't seen the director's other films so I have no idea whether this whole thing was a fluke or whether everything just settled in to my particular sensibility but even outside of the emotion I think the technical aspects the giant basement set are enough to keep interest. And even outside of that the acting is terrific. Cathy Moriarty is an absolute riot. 710".

Then there is Casper's heroic act go see the movie it's one of the most touching moment Dr. Harvey's reunion etc. etc.From a child's point of view it's pure entertainment.  From an art lover's point of view you have to awe at the special effect  sets.  From an audience seeking emotional outlet well bring in an extra box of kleenex. It's a very touching warmhearted humorous sweet little movie about a friendly ghost named Casper.Just a side note it is quite interesting to watch Addams' Family  Casper  Sleepy Hollow  see Christina Ricci grow from the eccentric Wednesday Addams to a regular teenager Kat Harvey to a beautiful young lady Katrina Van Tessel.".

Wow it all came back to me how much I loved this movie.Casper himself is played as a lot little boy very real and unsure of himself at the age of 12.  He falls in love with Kat in such an innocent way that it's touching.  And when he says as she falls asleep Can I keep you? I start to cry. His speech about his death would make a great short acting monolouge.Kat is a smartass and highly intelligent showing Christina Ricci as the funny witty and allaround cool actress she is.  Her portrayal of Kat is reminisent of a similar movie that came earlier...Winona Rider as Lydia in Beetlejuice without the fascination with death.Of course Bill Pullman is great in whatever he does but here you just wanna wrap the poor guy up in a hug.  And his dynamic with the FANTASTIC Ghostly Trio pretty much makes most of the movie sparkle.What could've been a sappy ending is done with such magic.  A 17yearold Devon Sawa in one of his first roles walks down the stairs and extends his hand to Kat with such perfect love and tenderness.  And I cheer when the FINALLY kiss.  He looks like such an angel.All around a great movie.  Funny romantic the perfect blend of sappyness and sentimentality that MAKES for a tearjerker ending.  Great job!".

	onyx:emotionText "I've owned this movie for 7 years now but I was having a kid moment last night and after I watched SNL I put this on.  Wow it all came back to me how much I loved this movie.Casper himself is played as a lot little boy very real and unsure of himself at the age of 12.  He falls in love with Kat in such an innocent way that it's touching.  And when he says as she falls asleep Can I keep you? I start to cry. His speech about his death would make a great short acting monolouge.Kat is a smartass and highly intelligent showing Christina Ricci as the funny witty and allaround cool actress she is.  Her portrayal of Kat is reminisent of a similar movie that came earlier...Winona Rider as Lydia in Beetlejuice without the fascination with death.Of course Bill Pullman is great in whatever he does but here you just wanna wrap the poor guy up in a hug.  And his dynamic with the FANTASTIC Ghostly Trio pretty much makes most of the movie sparkle.What could've been a sappy ending is done with such magic.  A 17yearold Devon Sawa in one of his first roles walks down the stairs and extends his hand to Kat with such perfect love and tenderness.  And I cheer when the FINALLY kiss.  He looks like such an angel.All around a great movie.  Funny romantic the perfect blend of sappyness and sentimentality that MAKES for a tearjerker ending.  Great job!";

Looking at it again as I am older I now love this movie more than just because it's about my favorite friendly ghost. This movie does a good job clenching the issue of death and either letting it go and hang onto it as a ghost with unfinished business. The atmosphere although often times comical which is how it is with the cartoons too XD has a really deep and emotional air to it as we look at Dr. Harvey and Kat's loss at the wifemother's death as well as Casper's mourning for his life and loneliness as a ghost. The music itself is very beautiful and the set gives a perfect background for both spooky and sentimental moments. If you're one who is looking for a good emotional ghost story this is a great example even though it was based on a cartoon. If you're looking for something comical well the three ghosts Stretch Fatso and Stinky are there to provide laughs as they really do seem to be having a ball being floating ethereal beings capable of shifting themselves into horrific and hilarious shapes.I don't remember much from the Casper cartoons but it's not like you can totally base an entire movie on just those. The plots for the cartoons vary and this movie could be counted as some sort of canon I suppose. Either way it does a good job capturing the lonely friendly ghost that is Casper on the big screen and TV set.Go ahead and rent the movie I'm looking forward to searching for a DVD for it so I can watch it again and again. I love it. I totally recommend this for everyone kids and grownups alike.".

That creates an important place for a movie like this...one that can make your life a little less serious for a while. I've always been a Christina Ricci fan going back to the Addams Family when she was only 11 years old. She was a great actress even at that young age. You could tell that she would go far as an actress. The personality was there...it set her apart from her peers. At the age of 15 she continues to do a great job in Casper...she is very believable. Sometimes in this troubled world where violence and negative things seem to be the norm a nice little movie like this can go a long way toward making your day a little brighter. Some of my other feel good movies are Patch Adams all the Superman movies the Robocop series and good old Babe. Thanks for reading this. Feel free to reply with an email.".

A woman inherits one of her father's condemned mansions. Once she finds out it holds a treasure somewhere they look inside it only for it to be haunted by three mischievous ghosts and one friendly one. Ghost hunter after ghost hunter fails so they get a psychologist who specialises in getting ghost's unfinished business done. After that it shifts to the psychologist and his daughter talking to the ghosts the daughter going to school her and Casper developing a friendship.Onto the complaints as I said the plot is disjointed some of the dialogue does get extremely weak around the middle and that it does seem a little bit more reliant on special effects than anything else. Although unlike other movies where this happens if you want an example look at the movies playing in your theater that's full of them this one actually has heart it maybe to a small extent but it does have heart.Now if you're looking for a mindless watch that is humorous and entertaining then this could be for you  you could do with a lot worse. The three uncles are worth watching for their humour along with Eric Idle and Cathy Moriarty as the villain.I also enjoyed the soundtrack for this movie. It is very fitting and although most of the time it is the same melody it doesn't get irritating.So if you want an hour and a half of mindless entertainment of family fun then this might be the one for you. Don't expect much but it is worth watching if you have kids and they want to see something new that you might also enjoy.".

Here it is the absolutely engaging set.At the end of the 19th century a style of art essentially a fad swept over Europe Art Nouveau. This focused on natural forms and continuous lines. Done well in drawing and sculpture its quite charming. At the same time there was a crisis in architecture as the first real architects sought solutions to how internal space affects the psyche. For only a decade or so architects tried to employ art nouveau in their work.The problem is that the two just don't naturally mix it's as if someone tried to do a swimmingpool production of Hamlet. But two geniuses partly succeeded in a few experiments Horta in Brussels and Gaudi in Barcelona. In their lives their experiments were rejected by the public and critics. Today they are among only a few valued gems of modern architectural history we have.So much for background. What we have in Whipstaff Manor is a reworking of Gaudi with some elements of Horta in entry and staircase. This is notable for a couple reasonsThe primary mission of a film is to convey a tone ideally an unfamiliar one. Sometimes cinematography is the tool of reliance sometimes costumes sometimes surreal plot twists rarely acting posture. Rarely rarely is the set the star. The goal of Gaudi was to in a very literal sense raise spirits by the form of the space. See how you feel in the bedroomcorridor and livingroom' spaces. The attic was done by a lesser talent and the cellar isn't part of this discussion. But the main house draws on some deeply spooky center of the mind. The second notable comment is the sheer difficulty of what the set designers have done. Gaudi an absolute master had difficulty pulling off what he did. Here the Casperites had an even greater challenge when I go in a space the relationship between me and the space is intimate just a simple dialog. But when the space is presented through a medium the designers have to dramatically exaggerate elements so the combined effect appears normal.' Its the same as with what actors must do as compared to ordinary people you encounter but an environment is more complex more multidimensional less semiotically loaded than a person. Mastering this greater palette of form is remarkable and that's before you even accommodate the physical needs of production camera placement sound wiring...Check this out it's interesting.

	schema:reviewBody "Well he still is. When I watched the Nostalgia Critic episode reviewing this movie I can't believe how ungodly annoying he is. I feel like I just want to punch that flying balding little yobbo square in the face. I mean he's so annoying he makes Spongebob Squarepants look like a normal person. But never mind that episode let's take a good long look at this movie. 1 The pointless cameos. Okay don't get me wrong but Clint Eastwood Dan Akroyd and Ben Stein are way too talented to make cameo appearances in this moronic piece of monkey diarrhea. 2 Overuse of puns. California Roll Smellogram Closet Case and a dozen others make no sense and aren't funny even if you TRYemphasis on the word try to put effort in them. 3 Casper. When I was a kid Casper was a kind of friendly ghost you'd knowJust like in the cartoon's theme song but adults and animals would turn literally white and run away if they come across him and that's for laughs. Well in this movie maybe Casper got a little TOO friendly. Just don't expect this ghost to come back and haunt you anytime soon that's all I could say.".

	schema:reviewBody "Casper is a 1995 film that stars Bill Pullman from While You Were SleepingChristina Ricci from Penellope and Brad Garrett who voices Fatso in this movie. The movie tells the story of Casper a friendly boy who happens to be a ghost. Kat HarveyRicciand her dad Dr James HarveyPullman who is a ghost hunter btwmove to another city and land in a house that was once owned by a young boy who use to live there.But what Kat and her dad don't know is that Casper and his uncles StretchFatso and Stinkie are still living in the house. Of course the reason why Dr Harvey moves is because these peoplewho were going to live in this house that they moved inis haunted so he stays there with his daughter.Also Dr James Harvey lost his wife so he raises Kat by himself.So when Kat one day is packing her bags in her roomCasper shows up and she freaks out that she can see him. Kat of course has to start school and she gets bullied by this girl who wants to have a Halloween party. But when Kat mentions that she lives in a haunted housethe kids want Kat to have her party in her place. But the girl who bullies her sets up some guy to go with her as a date where she has her party. Of course Casper later falls for Kat and his afraid to admit it since Casper is dead and can't come back to life. So he tells Kat later on in the film that there is a machine that his deceased dad worked on that can bring people back to life again. So will Casper become a human and be with Kat?Well overall I liked this film as a kid and I found it to be a truly heartwarming story. The charcthers are cute and I like the chemistry between Ricci and the guy that voices Casper. Also I like how Casper wishes to be human for one night and Ricci's charcthers mom shows up and makes his wish come true. So he becomes a human for the night to be Kat's date. I found it cute.Overall like I said I liked this movie as a kid and I still do.610".

	schema:reviewBody "Brad Silberling has done a lot of directing for various TV episodes and such but he does also direct movies. In this case he brings the story of Casper to life in an impressive way. This is one fun film from start to finish.There isn't much to the story especially in the first half but this is where it is the most fun. The nicely thought out dialogue and the funny antics of the ghostly trio Stretch Stinkie and Fatso all keep this picture highly entertaining. The second half of this 100 minute film slows down just a bit to get more story going. At this point the ghostly trio are a little less involved and Casper takes the stage.The CG is outstanding. I know the ghosts look all cartoony but this is a childish film. Anyhow they look great. The voice acting is also spot on. Joe Nipote Joe Alaskey and Brad Garrett match wonderfully to their ghost characters. Malachi Pearson is also a solid Casper.All the actors for the human characters are magnificently cast as well. Christina Ricci and Bill Pullman portray a nice father daughter relationship. Cathy Moriarty matches as the evil Carrigan Crittenden and who better than Eric Idle to play her goofy comedic sidekick. There are also a ton of enjoyable cameos in this movie including Dan Aykroyd as the Ghostbuster Raymond Stantz.Casper is truly one fun family film except for a couple occasions where the B word comes out of somebody's mouth. Watch this if the opportunity arises.".

	schema:reviewBody "I recall this film popping out of nowhere really saw a trailer for it out of the blue liked the look of it and went to see it. The creepy Addams Family visuals along with some really sweet looking effects hooked me and overall I really enjoyed this little kiddie flick.The plot is a simple Scooby Doo type affair really. There's a big old spooky mansion where Casper and his three uncle ghosts reside. An evil tyrannical female inherits the mansion and wants to find the treasure hidden within its bowels then tear it down problem is the ghosts. So she hires Bill Pullman a paranormal therapist and his daughter Ricci to get rid of the spooks.This being a kids flick its very predictable so I needn't tell you how things unfold. What I will say is the film is a highly enjoyable ghostie adventure with some really nice looking cobweb ridden sets charming locations quirky humour acceptable performances and great CGI amazingly. The ghost effects on Casper are really nice and hold up well today. He's easily the best of the bunch visually he looks quite realistic actually. The three naughty uncles are slightly more cartoonish looking and act so. The jokes and slapstick from them is very childish you can see the one liners and sight gags coming a mile off but that's expected. Other ghosts that materialise during the film also look more like cartoons and not as effective as Casper not too sure why Pullman's wife appears as a proper human though when all the others are CGI emotional moment I guess.The other thing that impresses is how well the actors interact with the CGI spooks believe it or not but they do look in all the right places and at the right times. You'd half expect this film to have hokey effects and badly directed live action but its really good all the way through. There are some unnecessary quickfire cameos that's for sure the only clever one was seeing Dan Aykroyd turn up as 'Ray Stantz' I liked that.Hot on the heels of a certain Charles Addams creation Ricci follows on with her adopted kooky persona with this halloween caper and its suits her perfectly. Pullman is a blundering but lovable father to Ricci's character whilst Casper is voiced nicely and acted well by a young Devon Sawa in human form. The only let down is the rather lame villainess and her henchman played by Eric Idle who didn't really need to be here.At times this film is actually very sweet and can bring a lump to your throat it has that sickly sentimental touch especially during the finale. But overall this is a great fun film if you enjoy lighthearted supernatural silliness. To sum up it isn't too far from a kids version of 'Beetlejuice' or 'High Spirits' and much better than the Eddie Murphy vehicle 'The Haunted Mansion'. 710".

Little do they Know that the house they moved into has a friendly ghost named Casper. The house is also being over run by SNOOTY rich girl Carrigan Crittendon played by Cathy Moriarty and her assistant Dibs played By Eric Idle who want the fortune in the house.This movie works in so many ways because I think it appeals more to adults than to kids. This is a really vulgar film filled with a ton of curse words and sexual innuendos. The film is very funny Especially The cameo made by Dan Akroyd playing Ray From Ghostbustersand I would pop this movie in anytime of the day.

I'm not sure if the film's themes are really appropriate for children's cinema.";

CASS grew up in a time before political correctness and was forced to endure racist bullying on a daily basis until one day when the years of pent up anger came out in a violent burst. CASS found through violence the respect he never had and became addicted to the buzz of fighting. His way of life finally caught up with him when an attempted assassination on his life saw him shot three times at point blank range. His inner strength somehow managed to keep him alive but he was left with a dilemma whether to seek vengeance as the street had taught him or renounce his violent past.";

	schema:reviewBody "As a contemporary of Pennant and veteran of the 1970's and 1980's terrace cultureI was keen for this film to succeed. Sadly with some good intentions it fails and joins the other flawed attempts to recreate the halcyon days of the hooligan. The authenticity of the background to the film is often well observed. But Director Jon Baird fails to have the expertise or I suspect the budget to faithfully realise the period..Pennant's biography is well written and a good read. It also covers over 40 years. A 108 minute screen running time was always likely to be crippled by compromise vignette and crude symbolism and so it turns out. His story does have dramatic potential and sociological significance but neither Baird nor Pennant have the discipline or know how to deliver it.For lovers of football violence there is not a lot of it. Three 20 a side rucks with Wolves Leeds and Newcastle are the set pieces. For an 18 Certificate the grizzly reality of these confrontations is pretty sanitised giving succour to the dreamy romantic retrospection that it was just like minded boys fighting and finding a sense of family in hooligan gangs.The key scene when one of Pennants lieutenants gets jumped by three Arsenal thugs and is slashed to ribbons needing 1000 stitches is strangely understated .Its setting is grimly authentic three against one the assailants armed no chance of defence or escape for the victim. Yet we see only the healed welts on the victims face some time later not the grim reality of a cowardly bloody attack.As a child the casual racism and bullying which Carol suffers alongside a complete lack of personal identity is well observed. Bravely time is also found for racism he suffers at the hands of a black Rasta in jail. When his mother dies unexpectedly his remorse at not having told her how much he loved her is genuinely poignant. Sadly though these promising scenes are sketched in the same shorthand as the violent ones  which is very frustrating.The rucks themselves are fleshed out with some ageing faces from the past Bill GardenerMark Chester from Stoke and Gilly from Wolves amongst them. It does not help the realism of the scenes to have time worn middle aged men in amongst what was a pretty exclusively young crowd at the time. This sop to some old boys to enable them to relive their youth is pretty risible. Equally Pennant himself appears uncredited as a bouncer alongside Frank Bruno also uncredited.West Ham's North Bank and Chicken Run are not mentioned once the South Bank gets two unreferenced name checks.One of the best moments in the book is when Pennant steps in to save a random black kid from getting a beating from some racist skinheads  only to discover that he has saved Frank Bruno! Pennants close subsequent links with the boxing fraternity are only dealt with in short hand in the film and his chance meeting with a similarly incarcerated Ambrose Mendy left out all together as is inexplicably his saving of Bruno.Virtual unknown Nonso Anozeo successfully carries off the role of the adult Pennant.Tamer Hassan plays a convincing cameo as boxer Ray.. Otherwise the ensemble provides background only to the main events. However the fundamental rush of football hooliganism the massed clashes of sometimes several thousand protagonists is missing. As others have found it is very difficult to recreate with so many of the old grounds gone. What grounds and stands do remain are out of bounds to hoolie film makers from clubs eager to protect their sanitised reputation.The hackneyed use of Thatcherite film clips as she pronounces on a subject she knows nothing about is cheap and adds nothing. Amusingly shots of the infamous Millwall riot at Luton are shown twice but Millwall the ICF's great rivals are not mentioned once.As a stand alone bio pic this is poor. Pennant is no Mandela. If you were there there is enough to keep your interest but not enough to win your praise. In aiming to be more than a hoolie film this bio pic tries to achieve much but ultimately falls victim to its own over ambition and vanity.".

Adopted into a white family in an age of racism and violence Cass finds his natural environment in the place where you would have thought he would be the biggest victim.The script is based on Cass Pennants book 'Cass' and you can't help but feel it was copied and pasted from novel to script. The main problem is that this could have been one of the best football thug films if they had managed to get decent actors. Not that they don't do a good job its just not great. Nonso Anozie is pretty good as the main character Cass its interesting to see a generally soft natured character flip out now and again in a hooligan film instead of the typical hotheaded cockney. The rest of the cast however don't support him very well and it seems as though they are forcing the drama rather than acting in a biopic. Overall though its an interesting insight into a real character in hooliganism how he ended up and kept going back in the hooligan 'business'. If you are looking for another rise of the footsoldier or a football factory type film then this may not be for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "STAR RATING  Saturday Night  Friday Night  Friday Morning  Sunday Night  Monday Morning A film highlighting the true story of Cass Pennant Nonso Anozie a baby born to a Jamaican mother who was raised by a white working class couple who's doorstep he landed on. The film charts his youth getting his first taste of football violence in it's heyday of the early 70s through to a decade later when he was leading London's top firm The ICF Inter City Firm into battle which ended up getting him a lengthy spell in jail. He came out and tried to turn his life around getting into the nightclub doorman business but his past caught up with him and after an attempt on his life he turned his back on his old life for good and is now respected as a renowned author.After the true life story of Carlton Leach was documented in the woeful misfire Rise of the Foot Soldier Cass arrives trying to do the same thing with black ICF leader Pennant. The Football Factory meets This is England a praise caption for want of better phrasing proclaimed when I first saw the poster for this. Okay already I was thinking 80s Britain Thatcher hooliganism a bit grim. I wasn't disappointed in this respect but in others Cass did disappoint me quite badly.For a film that's ended up on the big screen the film looks remarkably cheap like it's more suited as a TV film than here. Up until the end for some reason director Jon S Baird has shot his film in a grainy blurry style that you can't help but notice. Maybe this was to help give off a feel of how bleak and grim life in England during the 70s and 80s was but it didn't come off as too subtle with me. The use of stock footage from old news reels showing the football violence also didn't help in this respect. But aside from this the film goes to great pains to dramatize Cass's life story veering away from any exciting football action but rather than involve us in the end the film has come off more as dull and boring unfortunately.The film benefits from an undeniably fine lead performance from Anozie as the titular character an articulate thug with a lot of pent up anger in him but who also has an intelligent side that comes to be his guiding light. He does try and justify his actions at points by blaming them on Thatcher as when talking about his clashes with police at games saying 'they were her army versus ours' without realizing no matter heavy handed they might have been they were trying to stop violence rather than cause it. Nathalie Press as the girl who becomes his wife tries hard but her voice is rather annoying and grating and this put me off a bit. Leo Gregory who was also in Green Street is good in a supporting role as Cass's mate. Tamer Hassan does his usual glaring quietly menacing hardman act and Dennis Pennis himself Paul Kaye also does well as the man behind Cass's shooting. Performances wise there's really nothing wrong with the film it's in other areas it lets itself down.The distributors picked a stupid time to release it as it really didn't stand a chance at this time of year up against bigger films like The Dark Knight the new XFiles film and The Love Guru. I remember seeing a little feature on it on the news which now makes me think it was just desperate for any publicity it could get. It had about one showing time when I went to see it but the theatre was packed and it seems to have had a stay of execution for this week too so maybe it'll do better than it seemed.It's not awful by any means with some strong performances and an interesting story that sadly came off as dull rather than how it should have.

	schema:reviewBody "Way more than just a football thuggery story as our protagonist has to weave his way from being an orphaned Black kid Nonso Anozie raised by White foster parents in a predominantly White London east end neighborhood to being a selfrespected man with a job family and peace of mind. Along this most circuitous route he encounters racism by both Whites and Blacks by Whites because of his color and by Blacks because of his cockneyed White sounding speech patterns and by his reluctance to go Black to his socalled AfricanJamaican roots. He is quite content to merely be himself and is fully comfortable with his Caucasian foster parents who brought him up with love and attention. He cares far more about his family and his mates than for some artificial and ephemeral politicalracial cause. The jail cell scene with the back and forth dialogue between Cass and his Rastaish cellmate bears this point out. But his issues with the aforementioned football thuggery with its concomitant need for constant revenge through violence is keeping him from the realization of his true inner self the real man he wants to be. The thrust of this film deals with how over long periods of time he must manage to extricate those inner demons in order to achieve any sort of lasting peace. And a superlative job indeed is done to portray this metamorphosis by Jon Baird  co. especially the lead role by Nonso. No fancy existentialpsychological drama in this hardhitting straightforward piece just a man in search of himself with the hopes of finding some semblance of a peaceful fulfilling existence.".

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed this film just enough to watch the whole 90 minutes but it felt like i had already seen a dozen movies like this  football factory green street rise of the footsoldier the firm 2009 version. it was a film that left me feeling unsatisfied for some reason i cannot explain.The story is simple  A black baby raised by a white couple who grows up in London. He grows up in very racist times and as he gets older he earns his respect by fighting rival fans at football gameshe is a West Ham fan. This is the third football film in the last 3 years that revolves around West Ham united Green Street and Rise of the foot soldier which is pretty tiring as it makes you wish that the main character supported another dam team for once! Now one thing i will give this film credit for is the acting. you get a pretty good performance from Nonso Anozie and Leo Gregory who you will notice from green street. Tamer Hassan also has a bit of screen time who you will recognise from the football factory and he does his tough man act pretty well. And thats basically it...... a football hooligan no other story apart from the obvious confrontations that brings his way. He meets a women settles down and end of story. I'll admit that i felt cheated by this film i thought there would be a better story....but never mind.If you are a huge fan of these hooligan films then by all means you will love it but if like me you are getting bored of these type of films then stay awayBy Scott Dewhurst".

He grows up in very racist times and as he gets older he earns his respect by fighting rival fans at football gameshe is a West Ham fan. This is the third football film in the last 3 years that revolves around West Ham united Green Street and Rise of the foot soldier which is pretty tiring as it makes you wish that the main character supported another dam team for once! Now one thing i will give this film credit for is the acting. you get a pretty good performance from Nonso Anozie and Leo Gregory who you will notice from green street. Tamer Hassan also has a bit of screen time who you will recognise from the football factory and he does his tough man act pretty well. And thats basically it...... a football hooligan no other story apart from the obvious confrontations that brings his way. He meets a women settles down and end of story. I'll admit that i felt cheated by this film i thought there would be a better story....but never mind.If you are a huge fan of these hooligan films then by all means you will love it but if like me you are getting bored of these type of films then stay awayBy Scott Dewhurst";

I for most of my childhood grew not too far from Cass's home town and were subject to similar experience's but had the sanctity of a home to which I culturally belonged. coincidentally I have also known Nonso in my past and I am truly proud at his portrayal of the man. as for Elaine Cass's wife not knowing a damned thing about the man's better half I felt that Natalie Press was not wooden or poor but actually quite sweet and find that viewers and critics alike expect Hollywood stellar performances far too often from actors portraying sweet n simple everyday fault filled folk. sadly or maybe not so sadly the budget was low so the film was kept gritty and simple as was working class Britain back then but the sentiment was high. a simple but great 1 man against the world and winning story.".

	schema:headline " A very well told hooligan story with a great storyline";
	schema:reviewBody "Having seen pretty much every football hooligan based film available I was pleasantly surprised by this film. Perhaps the fact that the film is based on a true story explains why the storyline seems so fresh and original. Clearly there is the classic basis of a plot as for most films of this nature  new guy in the firm earns respect works the way to the top gets a family suffers a traumatic event or 2 and then seeks revenge. I think the reason that this film didn't bore me with the storyline is because you got a lot of background information on the main character Carol a.k.a. Cass which is different to a lot of other films of this subgenre.The film has a good balance of drama comedy and violence. The drama is focused mainly on the main character and his relationships with the people closest to him. The comedy is very 'laddish' usually focused around sex and violence as you would expect of a film of this type! and is very dry.As for the violence I was very impressed about the varying ways it was shot. In the big fights in between the firms the camera puts the viewer right in the middle of the action with shots coming from the centre of the firms as they run towards each other. This is not to say you don't see any individual oneonone scraps but it is refreshingly varied.To conclude this is a very good film that drew me in quite quickly. The main character is very well played by Nonso Anozie and it is easy to understand how he became to be how he was. I would recommend this film to anyone who is bored of the other 'hooligan' films and wants to see the hooligan life from a slightly different angle. The only thing to note about this film is that there is very little focus on the actual football side of things so don't expect to see the firms at any matches! All in all this is a great film and I would give it a 910.".

Any attempt to try and reenact scenes such as the heisel disaster would have looked cheap and insulted the memory of those who lost lives and loved ones on that tragic day. Yes the editing could have been better but for what essentially is a low budget film by a fairly inexperienced director it is an entertaining viewpoint into the life of one of Britain's most famous football casuals. The acting was brilliant all round and most of the fight scenes well choreographed even if they did lack the gore of rise of the foot soldier a brilliant film about the life of Carlton leech or the high budget effects of greenstreet a Hollywood let down in the football violence genre yes this is no ID or The Firm but it is a good honest insight into what went on and IS based on real events unlike the aforementioned 2 films".

	schema:reviewBody "The trouble with movies like Cass is that they are not bad films by any means nor do they fail to entertain or live in the memory. It's just the memory already seems overloaded with literally dozens of these flashy flashback 80s set designer violence dramas that glorify the exploits of the disaffected youth through their frustrations inside and outside football stadiums. Whilst the obvious difference with this film is that the main character must overcome not only tribal football clashes but the added dimension of racism as well you can see why the book originally written by the main protagonist himself purported to offer such a rich vein of narrative to adapt into a film. But these kind of movies are now so commonplace they struggle to offer something new that we haven't already seen many times over. And for that reason the slightest slip up can be catastrophic and any loose direction or production can see a movie like this lurch from the sublime to the ridiculous quicker than it takes to whack someone with a knuckleduster. Nonso Alonsie plays the lead role with passion and controlled aggression but somehow fails to quite deliver the same menace as the real life 'hero' himself. Witness Cass Pennant in his own words in the special features available on the DVD and he is much more able to display a propensity for violence just bubbling neatly under the surface. But the movie is well worth watching and doesn't outstay its welcome. It's difficult to recall when the conveyor belt was switched on with this genre it possibly goes back to the 70s with Alan Clarke's 'Scum' but as a viewer one is just waiting for Danny Dyer to pop up at any moment. Instead we have Tamer Hassan on hand who is thankfully a reassuring presence albeit a familiar one. The movie perhaps also deliberately decides to pull back from the glorification of graphic violence and is all the better for it.".

The audience are left with the feeling that screenwriter director Jon S Baird is trying to tell a story of social relevance involving a black child being adopted by a white couple but decided to just chronicle the activities of the ICF since this is the selling point of the movie For a film that involves a football tribe it's rather average with the usual shouts of  FAHK  and  KANT  in mockney accents which probably sums up how self limiting the hooligan sub genre is . There's nothing you've got here that hasn't been done before and has probably been done better in THE FOOTBALL FACTORY . Perhaps the worst failing is the lead performance by Nonso Anozie as the eponymous anti hero . It's not a bad performance at all but Anozie comes across as being far too likable to play someone who breaks heads for a hobby".

It's not a bad performance at all but Anozie comes across as being far too likable to play someone who breaks heads for a hobby";

I went in looking for a blackandwhite headbusting superhero flick but I got a lot more than I bargained for.First off the photography is gorgeousas director cinematographer and editor Kazuaki Kiriya makes excellent use of color and grain in his film. At times it's a fuzzy glowing dream while at others it's stark blackandwhite sandpaper on your brain. It's an ingenious device to change the mood of the film instantaneously.There are hints of any number of films hereMetropolis Frankenstein Mononoke Hime Terminator Tetsuoand yet the film definitely stands on its own. By no means a slavish adaption of the original animated series it does contain a number of nods to elements of the original that fans will surely recognize I leave it to other viewers to catch these for themselves. I was particularly impressed by the first appearance of Luna who looks like she stepped out of a painting by Tatsunoko alumnus Yoshitaka Amano in that scene.The action scenes are backed by a driving rock score which reminded me of The Crow for some reason. Hardcore action fans who are hoping for a Matrix Reloaded bumpertobumper slugfest will be sorely disappointed though. The fight scenes actually run counter to the message of the filmthat as one character states War makes humans inhuman. There is a long tradition in Japanese fictionand animation in particularof the hero becoming what he hates to triumph over his enemy. The perfect example of this is Devilman who becomes a demon to do battle with other demons. There is also a saying in Japan kokoro wo oni ni suru or steel your heart with resolve and Casshern proves that some decisions will indeed set us on the road to having the hardened heart of a demon. In the end most conflicts can never be woneven if you win you lose as you have more than likely sown the seeds for the next conflict.I have no idea how foreign audiences will take to the message in this film but I could hear a number of people crying in the darkness around me and the crowd was uncharacteristically silent as they left the theater. As a translator I hope this gets the treatment it deserves when it gets subtitledthe dialog isn't particularly difficult for those with a moderate knowledge of Japanese and there are vast stretches of film with no dialog at all but there are also a number of nuances that might be lost. The omnipresent Chinese and Cyrillic characters of the Asian Federation create an oppressive mood that'll be difficult to conveythe nearest example I can think of is the subliminal messages in John Carpenter's They Live. Some of the other devices used in the film such as multiple voices repeating portentous words You don't know what war's like might also be difficult to convey with normal subtitling. Nevertheless I hope to see this film made available to a larger audience soon.".

	schema:reviewBody "At last I understand. We hurt others by our very existence. That's just the way we live. I began watching Casshern with absolutely no idea of what to expect. Seeing a preview for it on the internet I ordered the DVD and waited. Hearing extremely mixed reviews I was tense. Did I spend my money stupidly? Would this movie just sit on a shelf collecting dust after I watched it? Then it came. I put it in fiddled for about five minutes getting the subtitles to work in English the entire DVD menu was written in Japanese sat back and was promptly blown away. Casshern was a visual feast for the starving moviegoer. After Star Wars Matrix Trilogy and other scifi movies that have butchered CGI special effects to the point where they should now be called normal effects Casshern utilized the technology brilliantly. Stylistic and visually stunning the visuals could be compared to other recent Asian imported movies such as Hero or House of Flying Daggers. The comparison ends there though.Based off of a 1970's anime Cashan The Robot Hunter Casshern is set in a futuristic alternate universe where after fifty years of stressing warfare the country called Greater Eastern Federation triumphs over another country called Europa and has gained control of the Eurasian continent. It is a hollow victory though as the years of warfare have left the continent devastated with nuclear waste and new diseases have decimated the already exhausted population. Out of this rubble one man a Dr. Azuma has proposed a plan using neocells that are like stem cells on steroids in order to regenerate humankind. Scoffed at by the government and scientists Dr. Azuma is forced to receive his funding from a shady branch of the military. During his experiments Dr. Azuma realizes that his neocell theory is absolute bull but unwittingly stumbles upon a well of eternal youthstrengthreanimation. Thusly he creates a race of mutant beings called Shinzo Ningen that vow revenge upon the humans after the military slaughter all but four of the creatures.Casshern was dumbly marketed and labeled as an actionadventure movie when in fact the movie has only three real action scenes in it. It instead focuses on the moral issues surrounding warfare. Whether it is ever right to utilize war and destruction and it brings up many thoughtprovoking issues such as what is ethically and morally right? How far can one go for love? What does it mean to be part of humanity as a whole to be alive? That was one of the reasons why Casshern received such low ratings especially in America. After being raised on Hollywood cookiecutter plots and car chase scenes Casshern was an interesting break from the norm. It doesn't dumb down its plot or sugarcoat the issues it deals with and even leaves many answers up to you to interpret. The movie rarely lets the viewer stop and take a breather nor wastes time with superficial plot lines. Casshern wants to get its point across in the most dramatic and breathtaking way that is possible and boy does it deliver.This is Kazuaki Kiriya's directorial debut and he certainly brings his unique style to the movie. Having previously been a music video director you can see the influences of it in sharply contrasting scenes and surrealistic narrative. Casshern understands what it means to be a movie mainly a visual art form. That is what it is a visually stunning piece of art with an intriguing plot line.".

It takes up questions such as Why do we fight wars? What is ethical? What would you do for love? What does it mean to be a father a son lovers a citizen of a nation a national leader human alive? Visually the movie is just breathtaking. It's gorgeous. Kiriya is not afraid to do what he feels does justice to the scene. He was the one behind the camera not a common place for the director to get the shot exactly the way he wanted it. Quite scenes are thoughtful and even the fight scenes are purely intense. Fantastic.The movie is based on a 70s anime which is quite different. But it is interesting to note the places where the movie pays homage to the original anime.The English subtitles are quite good and quite accurate. There are a few parts that I would have translated it differently but over all the integrity of the film is totally intact.I highly recommend this film for true lovers of scifi who are looking something that is more than mindless battle scenes.".

If you realize that director Kiriya who also penned the screenplay is primarily known for directing music videos you'll have a good understanding of where he's coming from in making this film. Indeed Casshern is at its best when the on screen action is complimented by the energetic music of veteran composer Shirou Sagisu. Several of the film's strongest segments are montagelike action sequences yet action is not its primary focus and action fans may feel a bit let down.Scifi fans on the other hand will have much to love. The film's retrofuturistic steampunk aesthetic is appealing and completely realized. The story while plainly told is interesting and has that rare mystical quality that leaves you wanting to know more. This film can be described as thoughtful though this aspect of it seems a bit forced at times. The catastrophic ending with resolution is so common in Japanese film as to be trite and it appears here as well is less odious for some reason than it could have been.A note on subtitles the American DVD released by Dreamworks comes with subtitles that are grossly inaccurate. Yet at the same time they do a better job of explaining the story than a strict hard may have done. Whether this is a positive thing or not comes down to whether your philosophy favors a completely faithful translation or one that better conveys the spirit of the film with clarity. As a proponent of the former I was a bit disappointed in the subtitles but those with no understanding of Japanese will not be led astray.In all I found Casshern to be an enjoyable film but may not please viewers who expect more of it than they should.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the trailer for this film i was expecting an effects laden action movie oozing cool but with no real substance.boy was I wrong. The story when summarised may seem like a pretty run of the mill scientist plays god with disastrous results type of tale but it is so full of depth and drama that the film is elevated beyond anything I expected. The look of this film is beautiful. Every frame looks amazinglargely in part to the fact that it was almost entirely shot on digital film with no backgrounds and there is a otherworldly feel throughout. The film's message is without doubt about the futility of war. The key characters views and beliefs are tested by what is going on around them and even the supposed hero questions whether what he is doing is right. Also the lead bad guy Burai is one of the most sympathetic villains I have seen in a movie in years. He is played fantastically by the brilliant Toshiaki Karasawa who I hope we see more of soon. There are some eye popping set pieces as well and although it's not an action movie per se the few action scenes the movie does contain are brilliantly realised. Being an anime fan myself I loved the little reference to the original CASSHERN Robot Hunter TV show that the movie is based on. The incredible montage of devastation when the bioroids attack with their robot army looks like a manga comic that's come to life and sprang from the page. The film is also one of the only truly successful anime to film adaptations I've seen as most have been disastrous. In short If you're looking for a scifi movie with some brains plus some really cool sequences that's thought provoking and visually artistic as well check this one out.".

	schema:reviewBody "What can I say about Casshern? The movie is essentially a beggar parading about in the clothing of an emperor. But beneath all of the CGIenhanced effects and varied bits of an alternate world that Casshern creates it fails to deliver any cohesive storyline albeit a very thin one. The movie is completely disjointed there is absolutely no character development and the pacing is choppy and disconnected at best. The different camera techniques used here make the movie seem more like a music video than a 2hour feature length film and these techniques get old fast.From what I can tell our lead man Casshern was once Tetsuya the son of a doctor involved in neocell research. However he hates his father we're not really sure why and decides to fight in the remnants of a 50year war with Europa the loser of the battle against the Eastern Federation. His fathers research is not going so well when suddenly something happens which spawns a mutant humanoid race from his experiments so aptly dubbed neosapiens. Some of these neosapiens escape kidnapping Tetsuya's mother in the meantime and go to the North to a socalled sector 7 to set up their stronghold. Meanwhile during the war Tetsuya dies his father is so overcome with grief that he brings his son back with neocell technology thus remaking him as a superhuman. This leads Tetsuya on the path to becoming Casshern. Plot doesn't sound TOO bad huh? Well unfortunately there's not much else by way of story line for the remainder of the film aside from clichd progressions which lead to the inevitable apocalyptic climaxes followed by the why must humans destroy each other? questions so often found in Anime not surprisingly this movie is based on an old Japanese Anime series of the same name. And considering the movie has a runtime of 2hrs 20min the story is definitely spread far too thin.The only things that keep me from giving this move the lowest rating are the sometimes breathtaking effects sequences some of which are quite memorable. However since this film is essentially spawned from an anime even some of these sequences tend to meander towards the absurd and cartoonish. But I digress there are some very interesting representations of future cities weapons and assorted devices that keep the movie from being unwatchable.I would suggest this movie to anyone who is either a fan of this anime series or enjoys some serious CGIaided visual stimuli. If you like MTV you might be a big fan of this shortattention span audiovisual bombardment...there is certainly plenty of eye candy. But if you enjoy a riveting storyline deep and thought provoking characters and themes and basically anything else that turns a series of images beautiful or not into a cohesive movie you probably will want to steer clear of this...it is basically an expensive fiasco and not surprisingly I heard it was recently voted one of the worst movies of the year in Japan.".

Perhaps it was because the action scenes were so bombastic but I found it very difficult to spur my interest in the characterdriven moments and this consequently made the twoandahalfhour running time feel a tad too long.The final closing message which runs contrary to the adrenalized midsection of the film is presented rather clumsily.

On the one hand I loved the movie the style of the film was exceptional every aspect of the world the director had created strained with the quality that is lacking in most western films. The cinematography was perfectly executed the design work was breathtaking and the idea at the core of the narrative was ingenious. On the other hand these qualities cannot make up for the script which is overly long and excruciatingly convoluted taking an unnecessarily long and ponderous route to a conclusion that in the hands of a better writer could have been much more straightforward without necessarily losing any of the emotional complexity of the narrative or its characters. I would recommend seeing this movie if just to experience the spectacular visual feast that it is but I can't help thinking that the story could have been treated so much better.".

As many scripts set in Japan do they revolve the drama around honor and whatever twisted concept the characters have of it. Often honor demands that everyone dies.

People do things for impossible reasons and unlikely motivations twisted sense of honor becomes a generic excuse. To their credit with such a twisted plot piecing together scenes they don't make the mistake of turning the plot on a dime anywhere so you won't get lost. You know who the bad guys are 3 different groups! and who the good guys are the hero his immediate family and all innocents and you know who it's going to come down to in the end.

This is a nice looking film that shamelessly and playfully draws on HG Wells Mary Shelley Da Vinci and a host of other highbrow sources. Absolutely nothing wrong with that in fact there is even a postmodern motif at work here  the cobbling together of so many sources to create something unique shadowing the main plot drive of this film. However I use the word 'plot' loosely here. Kiriya throws this all together like so many patchwork music videos. Some music video directors can make feature films but Kiriya just does not seem able to make the jump based on this outing. The plot holes are glaring from the mechanical lightening bolt that acts as catalyst for the mutants' conception to the discovery of a castle conveniently packed to the gills with armed robots. And the girlfriend's survival of an atomic blast at the end is a humdinger of the highest order. This is not an antinarrative statement by Kiriya  it is complete ignorance of the basic rules of narrative. Such convenience and contrivance is a feature of one kind of contemporary JCinema and people like Kiriya get away with it because there is no Hollywoodstyle rulebook based on threeact structure to be followed. This is a film that should stand on its own and not require reference to the original anime in order to figure out the story. Incredibly people are making claims for this piece of flimsy as a philosophical treatise. Noticeably nobody seems quite able to articulate what that philosophy is. Mouthing a few glib lines about man's savage nature and the cruelty of combat does not an antiwar film make. The big reveal when it comes  from a character who has no right to hold the 'knowledge' he espouses  that the mutants are gasp human too is a bit bloody obvious. And it takes so loooooong to get there. Completely lacking in character development credible storyline or nuanced dialogue Casshern is worth sticking on at a party for background visuals but not much else. A real clunker.".

	schema:reviewBody "I bought the CASSHERN DVD after reading the plot description and positive reviews on this site. I was sorely disappointed and angered by this film. This is a masterful mistake and a narrow minded attempt at bringing the anime and manga experience to film.WARNING THIS NEGATIVE REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS Firstly this film is directed by a person who makes music videos. Already there is a conflict from the beginning due to the inherent contradictions of both visual genres. My impression is that this is a surrealistic narrative. I understand that given such a structure there are bound to be elements of the story that will be lost or left up to the viewer to define and gain meaning from. But this film is incomplete in its execution. In the first thirty minutes it fails in establishing both setting and character development. The few scenes portraying the different conflicts are not enough for the audience to gain a moderate understanding of the story and appreciation for the individuals involved. Yet towards the final hour of the film the main characters begin to partake in long winded monologues of why war and hate are bad.

Moments after his awakening the villain decides to escape to the mountains and miraculously finds a castle with a seemingly inexhaustible army of robots. When Casshern and the villain first meet in battle the villain conveniently leaves Casshern bruised but alive.

Many sequences are telegraphed every time the music builds up the viewer knows something grand is going to happen i.e. a battle a last minute comeback or a moment of revelation.All in all this film is meant to be a visual feast. But it fails in this aspect as well. Many of the scenes look as if they were given to a Japanese Chef for editing. There isn't enough time to soak in the details because of the incessant quickcuts from one scene to the next. This hurts not only the action sequences but the emotional melodramatic scenes as well. The eye is not given enough time to relax and appreciate the costume design the set design and even the CGI sequences. There are only two instances when this type of quick cutting makes cinematic sense The initial battle between Casshern and the robot army and The montage of the robot army attacking the humans.The incessant music does not help matters either. This is a clear indicator that the film cannot stand on dialogue and visuals alone. It needs to pump up the audience in order to keep them interested in what's happening on screen. Frankly throughout the entire film I cared not for the fates of any of the characters. They were all one dimensional in my view again for the reasons I stated above.In conclusion the film CASSHERN is an attempt at bringing to life the vision of anime and manga. And for me it remains merely an attempt. As for teenage and younger audiences I think it has succeeded. But to more mature viewers of cinema CASSHERN suffers from oversaturation of popular culture and having a music video director at the helm is also a sure sign of that. Mind you director David Fincher who directed ALIEN 3 and FIGHT CLUB brought his music video eye to film and succeeded in creating visual works of art that had stellar narratives so I am not biased against music video directors. There are those that say that narrative isn't everything that film is primarily a visual art form and I would agree. But let us be aware that if we let works become too abstract then we risk being saddled with meaningless art.".

	onyx:emotionText "I bought the CASSHERN DVD after reading the plot description and positive reviews on this site. I was sorely disappointed and angered by this film. This is a masterful mistake and a narrow minded attempt at bringing the anime and manga experience to film.WARNING THIS NEGATIVE REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS Firstly this film is directed by a person who makes music videos. Already there is a conflict from the beginning due to the inherent contradictions of both visual genres. My impression is that this is a surrealistic narrative. I understand that given such a structure there are bound to be elements of the story that will be lost or left up to the viewer to define and gain meaning from. But this film is incomplete in its execution. In the first thirty minutes it fails in establishing both setting and character development. The few scenes portraying the different conflicts are not enough for the audience to gain a moderate understanding of the story and appreciation for the individuals involved. Yet towards the final hour of the film the main characters begin to partake in long winded monologues of why war and hate are bad.

The movie is extremely stylish and schizophrenic it has a touch of the video clips in computer games merged with a screen style like a musical Pink Floyd The Walland action scenes that are a so unbelievably perfect realization of anime that it seems you are watching GhostitShell2 with TheMatrix layered over it. Don't even think you'd be able to follow the seemingly simple comic plot every scene you can consider yourself lucky if you manage to process who is currently in the picture in front of which stunning background. Not everyone will like this for sure it far too outlandish and a real challenge at the same time the seemingly comical story might scare some viewers away or the overall style of the movie that seems almost like the distinct brushstroke of a painter might not please everyone. Even animefans will need some time to get used to the fight sequences as realism always steps behind for style and effect here.

Sure there are times in the film where an unlikely chain of events happens but isn't that the beauty of film? That we are able to free ourselves from the shackles of reality and express our perspectives in a different manner? If it's possible to have talking animals in films why shouldn't it be possible for a group of refugees to stumble upon a castle?For me the film offered some very provocative ideas from the age old questions on the human condition to modern questions on equity science and many others. It provided a dynamic mix that i found very original and potent in todays society. The cinematography was very well done although one can argue that it was generic the musical score was brilliant at setting the mood the story line coherent.All in all if you're looking for an average run of the mill 'unique' story with some flashy action scenes and are quite discriminative about what's on the surface this movie will probably not be for you.

	schema:reviewBody "Contains mild spoilersI heard great things about Casshern... well I just heard it was great so when I saw it on sale I thought Why not? I'll give it a go!. This film has two main features the first is that it is beautiful. The film has an amazing style and awesome effects however sometimes they do take away from the story and are often completely out of place. The second feature of this film is that it make absolutely no sense. OK this isn't completely true but it might as well be. The film revolves around a scientist called Professor Azuma who is working on Neocells which appear to be super stem cells that can be used to grow new body parts and reanimate the dead. Azuma is recruited by the army who set up a lab and pay him to continue his research on these neocells. Then one very unlucky day a big metal bolt of lightening crashes into his lab and makes all the body parts he has been working on turn into people. On the same day Azuma finds out his son has been killed while fighting in a war. To cut a long story short the Frankenstein people now called Neoroids ?! run away taking Azuma's blind wife and happen upon a castle which also luckily happens to be a super robot factory. Also Azuma's son Tetsuya is plunged into the neocell pool and is reborn and gets some random cool armour. That is the part that makes sense for the next 2 hours the film addresses quite well I think the issues of war ethical research what a nation should be etc etc which all seem fairly random during the film. I wouldn't hold your breath for everything to be explained. The end of the film makes very little sense there appears to be A LOT of explosions and A LOT of people die followed by a few laughable scenes with the neoroids and everything ends. I am a fan of Asian cinema and I can see the virtues of this film and I am sure that if you really sit down and think about this film it may make a little more sense but not much. Watch this film ONLY if you are a fan of Asian cinema and like dementedly arty films.".

	schema:headline " Immensely epic scifi fantasy epic based on an original Japanese superhero!";
	schema:reviewBody "The past decade exploiting superheroes their adventures and their origin stories has become a trend. It's rare that you will find a film depicting the truth behind the legend since I guess where is the fun in telling a story that has already been told?!It has angered me many times to see a perfect comic book character or anime character ruined by the poorly unoriginal efforts of writers producers and directors in their bid to appeal to mass audiences and all because they had absolutely no faith in the character to begin with. As a more mature film viewer I appreciate films that speak in volumes films that both have a fair amount to say yet allow me the opportunity to think for myself. So most superhero film directors I wouldn't trust to read my weekly shopping list correctly let alone my comic book collection.One film that actually flourished from a little audiencefriendly editing was V For Vendetta but I'm not here to talk about that. One the one hand V was mellowed out and softened for mass audiences. The character in question was actually darkened and made so antiheroic that the film he was given was hardly a superhero film at all. Instead it was a work of genius...One sadly overlooked film released in 2005 under the title 'Casshern' pronounced Kyashaan. Based on a 70's anime series about a cybernetic human's attempt to save the world from all out destruction the live action film throws one hell of a curveball not avoiding the original story but rather telling the tale from a different perspective and cleverly being chock full of action while avoiding any glorious sense of heroism whatsoever.All credit to Kazuaki Kiria as Writer Cinematographer Editor and Director who succeeded in moulding the film perfectly into his own unique vision proving him an auteur to be taken very seriously.Kiria was a music video director before producing Casshern which should have been a warning sign as music video directors these days tend to have little imagination beyond intertextual references and sticking cameras up women's arse cracks and labelling it artistic expression but Kiria managed to take his knowledge beyond greater boundaries than those surpassing 'Sin City' before it was even made.Casshern is something of a heavy metal fantasy opera that utilises the green screen to the fullest and combines it with trick photography stunning visual effects colourful epic set pieces and comic book styled animation not so much to wow the audience but to tell a story in the best way Kazuaki Kiria knows how. He has read his comic books clearly and what isn't an establishing shot is either a body shot or a close up of intense facial expressions. Only difference is you're reading from subtitles instead of speech bubbles.Casshern tells the story through a multistrand narrative and follows them from humble beginnings establishing their places in the world and so the plot unfolds and their agendas slowly spread out in different directions as they all head unwittingly towards the same dramatic conclusion with methodical similarities to your average Coen Brothers film. It's a family affair which is fitting as it deals with the consequences brought about by hatred tragedy and selfishness. Even your easily pinpointed villains have their secret agendas which they hide from their own families before eventually betraying them and Casshern becomes rife with Machiavellian surprises at the end of every scene.With a heavy metalorchestraletherealtechno soundtrack playing over the vastly panoramic visuals you're drinking up the similarities between the original soundtrack and the memorable sounds of Michael Kamen Vangelis Brian Eno and Massive Attack. You find yourself moved often by the sweeping orchestrations but the film also gladly knows when to shut up just for simple dramatic effect. But Casshern boasts some of the finest music ever committed to film.Kiria's take on Casshern is utilised to overall tell an antiwar story to protest heavily against violence and to show just why it's so important to. Indirectly telling you the story by not spoon feeding it to you you are left to make up your own mind about a lot of the events that occur throughout. The context is universal and reaches one simple and very honest conclusion. Themes of religion politics science and the paranormal are brought together in relation to the story's take on love and war life and death greed and poverty justice and injustice revenge and tragedy etc. and the one thing it all begins and ends with is how discrimination blinds us all. Upon discovering the bombshell delivered in the penultimate scenes of the film upon seeing where that massive curveball was aimed at I damn near bawled my eyes out not for the protagonist but for his greatest and most powerful nemesis he who Casshern holds so much anger and contempt for.Casshern is a genius piece of film that should be remembered always and something that ought to be passed onto the younger generation. I recommend you watch it when you realise your life sucks and you're feeling a bit vulnerable from it!".

Even your easily pinpointed villains have their secret agendas which they hide from their own families before eventually betraying them and Casshern becomes rife with Machiavellian surprises at the end of every scene.With a heavy metalorchestraletherealtechno soundtrack playing over the vastly panoramic visuals you're drinking up the similarities between the original soundtrack and the memorable sounds of Michael Kamen Vangelis Brian Eno and Massive Attack. You find yourself moved often by the sweeping orchestrations but the film also gladly knows when to shut up just for simple dramatic effect. But Casshern boasts some of the finest music ever committed to film.Kiria's take on Casshern is utilised to overall tell an antiwar story to protest heavily against violence and to show just why it's so important to. Indirectly telling you the story by not spoon feeding it to you you are left to make up your own mind about a lot of the events that occur throughout. The context is universal and reaches one simple and very honest conclusion. Themes of religion politics science and the paranormal are brought together in relation to the story's take on love and war life and death greed and poverty justice and injustice revenge and tragedy etc. and the one thing it all begins and ends with is how discrimination blinds us all. Upon discovering the bombshell delivered in the penultimate scenes of the film upon seeing where that massive curveball was aimed at I damn near bawled my eyes out not for the protagonist but for his greatest and most powerful nemesis he who Casshern holds so much anger and contempt for.Casshern is a genius piece of film that should be remembered always and something that ought to be passed onto the younger generation. I recommend you watch it when you realise your life sucks and you're feeling a bit vulnerable from it!";

The cast is very highpowered and the cameos by Michael Redrave as W.B.Yeats and Edith Evans as Lady Gregory are superb  as is a young Maggie Smith as O'Casey's girlfriend. Julie Christie looks great but doesn't have much to do. Rod Taylor is surprisingly good in the main role but I feel it suffers a little from the change of director and is ultimately unsatisfying rather rushing towards its conclusion. It could have been a great movie but the pacing is off. For me the 60s Dublin locations are the real stars.".

The cast is very highpowered and the cameos by Michael Redrave as W.B.Yeats and Edith Evans as Lady Gregory are superb  as is a young Maggie Smith as O'Casey's girlfriend. Julie Christie looks great but doesn't have much to do. Rod Taylor is surprisingly good in the main role but I feel it suffers a little from the change of director and is ultimately unsatisfying rather rushing towards its conclusion. It could have been a great movie but the pacing is off. For me the 60s Dublin locations are the real stars.";

Superb perf by Rod Taylor an ideal choice for the title role in an always interesting vision of the early life and career of Irish playwright Sean O'Casey from his autobiography. Dublin in the 1920s with all the period feel and detail John Ford can muster.  He fell ill and was replaced by Jack Cardiff who carried on seamlessly.  Ted Scaife photographed it brilliantly in gorgeous Color on actual locations.  A splendid cast brought the days of O'Casey and the Troubles to vibrant and bitter life. Rod Taylor's best perf in many ways though he did so many good movies and gave so many fine perfs during his heyday it's hard for me to choose just one. Maggie Smith is marvelous as O'Casey's lost love I'm a small simple girl.  I need a small simple life not your terrible dreams and your anger.  Smart girl but two hearts are broken as Sean boards the boat for parts unknown. Julie Christie's a revelation as Daisy one of three stunningly good perfs she gave in her golden year.  Michael Redgrave's perfect as Yeats and Flora Robson gets a late career lift as O'Casey's ma. The entire production takes the viewer back in time to the setting of this exceptionally good and unfairly overlooked film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Young Cassidy was to have been directed by John Ford but he had to withdraw owing to illness about three weeks into filming and was replaced by Jack Cardiff who was credited as director. Had Ford completed it it would have been his penultimate film he was to complete one more film Seven Women the following year. Ford was himself of Irish descent and occasionally made films on Irish subjects such as The Quiet Man. The film is a biography based upon the life of the dramatist Sean O'Casey here called John Cassidy. O'Casey's original name was John Casey although his family also used the name Cassidy. He Gaelicised his name to Sen  Cathasaigh and eventually settled on Sean O'Casey a compromise between the English and Irish forms. The name may have been changed to allow the filmmakers greater freedom to introduce fictional elements into O'Casey's life. For example in 1926 the year the film ends he would have been 46 no longer particularly young and more than a decade older than Rod Taylor was in 1965. The film opens 1911 when Cassidy is working as a labourer in Dublin and chronicles the beginning of his literary career ending with the performance of his play The Plough and the Stars which provokes a riot at the Abbey Theatre. The film also chronicles his relations with his family his love life and his commitment to both socialism and Irish nationalism. Other historical figures are introduced such as W.B. Yeats Ireland's leading writer who hails Cassidy as an outstanding new talent and the literary patron Lady Gregory. The film's main weakness is perhaps summed by a critic's reaction to one of Cassidy's plays namely that it is strong on character and weak on plot. The same could be said about the film itself. Although the various characters are well developed there is no strongly developed plot line. There are occasional action sequences in themselves well done such as the scenes of the Dublin LockOut a violent industrial dispute of 1913 the Easter Rising of 1916 and the Plough and the Stars riot in between these the film is rather static and dominated by conversationPotentially interesting themes tend to be dealt with in a throwaway manner. Cassidy's girlfriend Nora rejects his proposal of marriage and leaves him even though she is deeply in love with him because she fears that marriage will have a deleterious effect on his artistic creativity. The idea of a woman sacrificing her happiness for her lover's art could have been an interesting one could indeed have furnished the subjectmatter for a whole film but here it is dealt with very briefly. Similarly the film touches on but does not really deal with the underlying tension between the two political causes to which Cassidy gives his allegiance socialism with its ideals of international brotherhood and Irish nationalism with its ethos of ourselves alone the literal meaning of the Irish phrase Sinn Fein. It was in fact this tension which led to the Plough and the Stars riot when conservative middleclass nationalists in the audience took exception to O'Casey's more leftwing perspective and what they saw as his disrespectful attitude to the heroes of the Easter Rising. They also objected to his treatment of religion and sex especially his making one of his characters a prostitute in the film one protesting woman exclaims that there is not a single prostitute in the whole of Ireland!The film does however also have its strong points and its two greatest strengths are its sense of place the Dublin of the 1910s and 1920s is brought vividly to life and the acting. Strangely enough few of the leading actors were actually Irish Taylor was Australian and Maggie Smith Julie Christie Michael Redgrave Edith Evans and Flora Robson were all English. Christie received second billing even though for such a wellknown actress she had a surprisingly small role that of Cassidy's early mistress Daisy Battles. Nevertheless the Irish accents are well done and never go over the top as sometimes happens with English actors called upon to play Irish roles. Taylor makes Cassidy a strong and rugged hero and Robson is particularly good as Cassidy's stoical longsuffering workingclass mother. Young Cassidy has its points of interest but overall I felt that O'Casey was obviously a fascinating character both as a man and as a writer and that a stronger biography could have been made of him. 610".

The film is based on his autobiographies there are 6 volumes I believe which are apparently quite readable but not entirely trustworthy. As a committed socialist even a communist and protestant O'Casey was to find he had no place in the conservative catholic Ireland of De Valera. This is the great central irony of the man's life and of the history of Irish literature of the time that one of the few great Irish writers to deal directly with the Troubles was eventually driven from the country  so much so that he spent the last 35 years of his life in England and never once went back home. The film Young Cassidy is a pretty decent attempt to capture the man and his oddities. Rod Taylor looks nothing like the man but gives an energetic likable performance. Other performances are OK and it is always nice to see Michael Redgrave here as Yeats he looks as little like the real man as Taylor does. Started by John Ford this looks like one of his Irish pictures but thankfully never descends into the blarney that films such as The Quiet Man did Jack Cardiff who directed most of the film deserves more credit than he is usually given for his role. Filmed in Dublin it has a very authentic look. The main problem is in toning down O'Casey and his politics he was far more radical than he was portrayed here and also far more of an irritant to whatever country he lived in. In summary a decent biopic overlooked but worth watching by Ford fans or those interested in Ireland.".

John Ford worked his usual magic and was well replaced by Jack Cardiff after Ford fell ill and a wonderful vision of Ireland in the early 20th Century took shape. It tells of Young Jack Cassidy O'Casey and his attempts to break out of the poverty cycle he has been trapped in to get away and pursue a career as a writer. He is faced with the prejudice that all common Irish faced and then has to survive the madness that overtakes Dublin during the Easter Rebellion of 1916 before he finally gets a chance and sails off to London. I have not seen this film in 20 years and I wish I knew why it was so unavailable. It adheres quite well to O'Casey's Autobiographies though it is more fun to read his words than see them portrayed.".

He also has a quick affair with a prostitute Julie Christie and falls in love with a bookstore owner Maggie Smith who catches him trying to swipe half a dozen books on outr subjects like Cavalry Tactics in the Sudan. Cassidy gets a check for some of his writing. Fifteen glorious pounds. And he needs it because his sister has just died and now his mother is deathly ill at home and there isn't enough food or tea let alone medicine. She dies at home and the funeral director refuses to remove her body until he's paid. In an incident reminiscent of a scene in Crime and Punishment Cassidy runs around trying to get cash for his fifteenpound check. He seems never to have SEEN a check before and has no clear idea of what it is. Meanwhile his mother's body lies in its casket in the parlor while the blackclad vultures from the undertaker sit there tapping their fingers with impatience.That roughly ends the first half of the movie. The second takes us from Cassidy's poverty and love affairs to his literary career in a rather abrupt shift. I mean Cassidy had to teach himself to read and write and it appears that overnight he's a playwright.He meets the aristocratic dramatist Lady Gregory Dame Edith Evans and the perceptive William Butler Yeats Michael Redgrave both of whom along with others founded the Abbey Theater in Dublin. The Abbey was to stage several of Cassidy's plays including The Plough and the Stars and Juno and the Paycock. The Plough caused a riot. It was considered undignified profane because it cast aspersions on Ireland and because it included a prostitute in Act II. His literary success cost Cassidy dearly though. He loses his best friend who has found the play repulsive and personally insulting. And he loses his lover Maggie Smith who feels that she can't accompany him on what she predicts will be a rise to dizzying literary heights.It's curious though not mentioned in the film that the Irish nationalists we see are of mixed religions. Cassidy himself was a Protestant and so was Lady Gregory. Yeats was not a Catholic and neither was George Bernard Shaw. The armed conflict that was restarted in Northern Ireland in the 1970s was clearly divided along religious lines but the nationalist movement of Cassidy's time was not.Where was I? The film is beautifully photographed. As it should have been the director having been a splendid cinematographer himself. See Black Narcissus if you have a chance. Much of the neighborhoods we see are those dismal row houses flung up during the Industrial Age to accommodate the disenfranchised who flocked to the cities looking for wage work. The buildings themselves are of dingy gray brick and residents tried to brighten them up by painting the doors and window casings a bright color  white or sometimes crimson or sky blue and sometimes a deep dull green which was in my opinion a damned big mistake unless you want your residence to look like Sing Sing.Rod Taylor does a professional job as a cocky but tormented young man. Julie Christie seems to be in the movie only to show that Cassidy isn't very discriminating in his love life  and because she is after all Julie Christie. The oustanding performance is Maggie Smith's. She's youthful and radiant in a unique way.John Ford began directing the movie before it was necessary to shovel him off to the states disheveled and drunk. I was trying to pin down the footage that might have been his and came down on two scenes 1 the many elderly ladies wearing shawls and repeatedly making the sign of the cross as Cassidy's mother's body is loaded aboard the hearse. 2 A rollicking fist fight in a saloon that ends with both sides piling onto a carriage and singing. Maybe two more. When the new flag is revealed the camera rolls across the solemn faces of the IRA as they reverently remove their caps. And another moment when Cassidy is on a picnic and an explosion sounds from Dublin signaling the beginning of the revolution. There is a huge close up of Cassidy's face as he stares at the smoke billowing above the city and mutters The fools. The magnificent fools. Of course all these scenes might have been directed by Jack Cardiff. Anybody can make a mistake.Nice job though overall. Well worth seeing if it shows up which it rarely seems to do.".

This sequence is extraordinarydescribed and narrated by Taylor's monologue and actions. This does not stand up to the quality of the rest of the film which is below average. Now Cardiff is a good cinematographer. He has to deal with a great cast assembled by Ford who individually perform very well and are captured well by Cardiff's visual eye but lack the vision of a great director to string the pearls together into a great necklace. The film's ending is amusinga poor man turned rich man handing a crown to a vagrant who appreciates the worth of the money. What had the ending to do with what preceded it? If anything the final scene is ambiguous and one begins to wonder whether the director was making a hero of Sean O'Casey or was he chastising him as are the film's oblique comments on Yeats living in sheltered house policed by the British. The poor man turned into a rich and famous playwright is presented to us in fits and starts. The film did have a good intention but it lapses into mediocrity. Only two characters develop wellthe mother Robson and Nora Maggie Smith.Julie Christie is mesmerising in any film but her character is never developed. Maggie Smith has charmed audiences over the years but this film is definitely one of her finest. Dames Robson and Evans are daunting thespians. Add to them Michael Redgrave. All great actorsincluding Aussie Rod Taylor. The film does not end with a bang but with a whimper.".

He doesn't look right he doesn't act right and above all he lacks the charisma and personality needed to sustain audience interest over what seems an incredibly long 108 minutes. Nor  as often happens in these cases of main role mishaps  do the support players rally to the hero's rescue. Dame Edith Evans is impossibly mannered and theatrical as Lady Gregory admittedly her lines are trite while Sir Michael Redgrave makes of the romantic Yeats a drearily pompous stuffed shirt. Even the usually ultrareliable Flora Robson plays her part as one critic aptly commented  with an oddly absentminded air. Indeed aside from Julie Christie's exciting presence in a tiny role and a gallery of highly credible Irish studies from many of the bit players acting is hardly Young Cassidy's strong point. The screenplay must also take its fair share of blame. The plot is episodic and loosely constructed the characters not only one dimensional but stereotyped the dialogue dry. As for its philosophy whilst O'Casey's antiBritish sentiments are given a good innings his equally virulent anticlericalism is not mentioned at all. Not so much as a whisper. Yet as said the antiBritish stuff is played up. In fact the early scenes of police brutality when dispersing striking transport workers and of the army gunning down innocent bystanders during a siege of the rebelheld postoffice are by far the most effective in the movie. Taken as a whole however the writing lacks power. Nor must we exclude the director. When Ford fell ill after directing a few days' work with Rod Taylor and Julie Christie Jack Cardiff took over. Aside from the two action scenes described above Cardiff's direction rarely rises above the commonplace. It lacks soul. Heart. The ability to inspire.".

His sister gave him a love of reading and writing which belies his rough exterior. Johnny loves his family and feels the loss of family members very deeply particularly his sister and his mother Flora Robson.But Johnny is young and enthusiastic and as portrayed by Rod Taylor very attractive. I don't think the real O'Casey was quite as good looking.Cassidy becomes involved with a prostitute Daisy Battles Julie Christie and his good friend is Mick Mullen Philip O'Flynn. Mick gets him involved in Irish nationalism defending the working class and ending the British rule over Ireland. Much of that activism seeps into his writing and informs it. One day walking into a bookstore he mets Nora Maggie Smith the clerk and ultimately they fall in love.Little by little Cassidy finds success as his work is published and the Abbey Theatre decides to put on his plays. This is a controversial and difficult decision as there will be some who will find the plays unacceptable. But the founders William Butler Yeats Michael Redgrave and Lady Gregory Edith Evans take that chance anyway. A powerful story with good production values that was let down by the script. It's a shame with a cast like this to give them such weak writing. Frankly it was difficult for me to keep my attention on the movie.But the making of the film was not without problems. John Ford became ill and was replaced by Jack Cardiff and supposedly only 4 minutes of Ford's work remained in the finished film. Had Ford's hand been all the way through the film might have come off better.Ford wanted Peter O'Toole or Richard Harris in the lead and the role was offered to Sean Connery. Any one of them would have been effective and had great gravitas but there was nothing wrong with Rod Taylor's work. And I think casting him gave the other actors a chance to shine as well.The big surprise for me was Flora Robson as Cassidy's mother. In Fire over England 1937 I would have told you she was in her fifties so I assumed she would be doddering around in this. She was 35 in 1937 and 63 here. She's excellent as Cassidy's encouraging and loving mother.All in all interesting but for me not really great. Deserves to be seen for the acting and the production values.".

My favorite part of the movie was when the three Cassidy brothers got into a pub brawl with a team of hurly players. I remember thinking that in the books Sean had no real liking for his brothers.The depiction of the hardpressed folks of Dublin is very realistic and grim. After years of English oppression the Irish nation was ready to boil over into one final uprising to free their land from John Bull's tyranny.Oddly enough Sean O'Casey spent much of his life as an exile in England. His writings like Shadow of a Gunman and Juno and the Peacock were produced in the Twenties and he never recaptured the magic once he left his native land.I'd recommend the movie for St. Patrick's Day viewing because of its' Irish nationalistic theme.".

I won't give away anything else except to say that it'll be a shame if this film flies under the radar. Jenkins is a character actor that everyone recognizes but that few of us know. Here he occupies the first third of the film practically alone and reminds us in moments of the Jack Nicholson character from About Schmidt with his dry humor that is on display for his crabby piano teacher.Don't you just love watching an actor up there alone who keeps you spellbound in a subtle way? That's how this movie starts and gradually we come to meet the couple in Jenkins' apartment and the mother of one of them. The movie flows economically and with much care but by the end it creeps up on us and makes us feel glad along the way as well as making us pause and reflect on the state of our world.Lovely lovely movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I absolutely loved The Station Agent in Sundance 2003 so I put Tom McCarthy's newest movie The Visitor at the top of my list. Boy was that a good call. This is a lovely gentle and touching film that works on many levels. Richard Jenkins gives a perfectly understated performance. A veteran character actor I counted 75 roles since 1985 that's about five per year! it's the first time I've seen him as a lead. And the rest of the cast is terrific as well including Hiam Abbass Haaz Sleiman and Danai Jekesai Gurira.Walter Vale Jenkins is a widower who teaches economics at a Connecticut university. No longer motivated by his work he lives alone struggling to find passion and meaning in his life. In New York to present a paper at a conference he goes to the apartment that he has kept since his wife was alive but hasn't visited for some time only to discover a young couple living there having been duped by an acquaintance who rented it to them. Despite their great cultural difference Walter befriends Tarek Sleiman a Syrian citizen and drummer and gradually builds a friendship with Esi Gurira his girlfriend from Senegal. One day when returning from Central Park with Walter Tarek gets arrested for jumping a stuck subway turnstile despite the fact that he had paid. The police discover he does not have legal papers and transfer him to an immigrant detention center in Queens. Feeling responsible for and connected to Tarek Walter stays in New York to help and support him. Not hearing from her son Tarek's mother arrives from Michigan to find out why and she and Walter support one another while they attempt to free Tarek.The movie is a painful illustration of the inhumanity of the post911 immigration policies and procedures. At the same time it beautifully illuminates the wonders of friendship kindness reaching out exploring life and finding meaning in a challenging world. Despite it's gentle pace the story glides by establishing characters that we care deeply about. The Visitor has a lot of heart. The audience reaction was effusive and gave McCarthy the longest standing ovation I have heard at Sundance in some time. Scheduled to be released April 11 in New York definitely put this one on your list.Sundance Moment McCarthy talked about Participant Media which helped fund the production and also Syriana Charlie Wilson's War An Inconvenient Truth and other causerelated movies. Visit their website at www.takepart.com to explore meaningful causes and how you can become informed and get involved. McCarthy also said that he wrote the screenplay with Jenkins and Abbass in mind tailoring their roles to the two of them.".

	schema:headline " McCarthy's Small Film Shows Passion Can Be Found in the Most Unexpected Places";
	schema:reviewBody "A genuinely unexpected gem. As he proved with his first film as a director and screenwriter 2003's The Station Agent Thomas McCarthy knows how to convey the fine line between solitude and loneliness in his characters' lives with an emotional preciseness that doesn't call attention to itself. It's not surprising that McCarthy is an actor because he's able to capture the very subtle nuances in behavior in actors that make his work feel like Edward Hopper paintings come to life. As a result you pay attention to a simple gesture a passing glance a resigned sigh. This time his protagonist is Walter Vale an enervated middleaged economics professor at a Connecticut college. Widowed and wholly lacking in professional motivation he begrudgingly accepts an assignment to go to an academic conference at NYU and present a paper on globalization he really didn't write.Coming back to a Greenwich Village flat he rarely uses he is surprised to find a couple living there. Not squatters but unfortunate victims of a rental scam they turn out to be illegal aliens a Syrian percussionist named Tarek and his girlfriend Zainab a Senegalese who makes and sells handcrafted jewelry. As withdrawn from life as Walter is he slowly finds himself bonding with the couple and lets them stay indefinitely. Zainab is slow to trust Walter but Tarek and Walter become close over a mutual love of African drums. As his wife was a famous classical pianist Walter had been futilely attempting to find musical inspiration since her death. However just as this charming tale of world harmony plays out it comes back to harsh reality when Tarek is arrested and taken to a detention center in Queens for deportation. What McCarthy does from this point forward is show how sadly restrictive the post911 environment has made immigration laws and how there is no recourse to be found under the constant surveillance of a bureaucratic government protected by the latitude of the Patriot Act.None of this is hit over our heads with a politically motivated sledgehammer. Far from such polemics the story singularly focuses on Walter's emergence of purpose in helping Tarek. When Tarek's mother Mouna arrives from Detroit McCarthy adeptly shows how Walter's closeness to Tarek translates without condition to her. It's a moving transformation of a formerly lonely man finding intimacy in the most unlikely situation. In a onceinalifetime role character actor Richard Jenkins brings heart and soul to Walter in the most economical manner. Best known as the ghostly father in HBO's Six Feet Under he has worked steadily in films for three decades his most memorable turn being the gay FBI agent high on heroin in David O. Russell's Flirting with Disaster. With his constant look of resignation on the verge of revelation Jenkins gives a wondrously poignant often dryly funny performance that deepens as the story evolves.Haaz Sleiman and Danai Gurira are terrifically winning as Tarek and Zainab and they make their bonding with Walter more than credible. As Mouna Hiam Abbass is no stranger to persevering maternal roles as she brought her particular brand of strength to HanyAbu Assad's controversial Palestine Now and Eran Riklis' family dramedy The Syrian Bride. In response to Walter's fumbling overtures she affectingly conveys her character's resolute stillness and gradual blossoming. There are brief cameos by comic actor Richard Kind as Walter's unctuous neighbor Deborah Rush as a wealthy and ignorant customer of Zainab's and Broadway legend Marian Seldes as Walter's failed piano teacher. At first I thought the film's title was blandly generic in describing those who are here from other lands but I realize now that the visitor is really Walter as he discovers his soul. The last shot is memorable and captures the fury of his passion with potent force. Strongly recommended.".

	onyx:emotionText "A genuinely unexpected gem. As he proved with his first film as a director and screenwriter 2003's The Station Agent Thomas McCarthy knows how to convey the fine line between solitude and loneliness in his characters' lives with an emotional preciseness that doesn't call attention to itself. It's not surprising that McCarthy is an actor because he's able to capture the very subtle nuances in behavior in actors that make his work feel like Edward Hopper paintings come to life. As a result you pay attention to a simple gesture a passing glance a resigned sigh. This time his protagonist is Walter Vale an enervated middleaged economics professor at a Connecticut college. Widowed and wholly lacking in professional motivation he begrudgingly accepts an assignment to go to an academic conference at NYU and present a paper on globalization he really didn't write.Coming back to a Greenwich Village flat he rarely uses he is surprised to find a couple living there. Not squatters but unfortunate victims of a rental scam they turn out to be illegal aliens a Syrian percussionist named Tarek and his girlfriend Zainab a Senegalese who makes and sells handcrafted jewelry. As withdrawn from life as Walter is he slowly finds himself bonding with the couple and lets them stay indefinitely. Zainab is slow to trust Walter but Tarek and Walter become close over a mutual love of African drums. As his wife was a famous classical pianist Walter had been futilely attempting to find musical inspiration since her death. However just as this charming tale of world harmony plays out it comes back to harsh reality when Tarek is arrested and taken to a detention center in Queens for deportation.

	schema:reviewBody "Much of the art of the writerdirector and cast of 'The Visitor' resides in the fact that nobody gets in the way of the important story the film tells which is essentially a parable. What might happen it seems to ask if average white middleclass Americans became truly sensitive to the horrific plight of many foreigners in this county? The strength of The Visitor' is that the strong feelings it awakens lead to some serious thoughts. Our average guy is an intelligent professional who's tellingly cut off from the rest of the world even what's immediately around him. Walter Vale Richard Jenkins is a widowed professor like Dennis Quaid's character in the much inferior 'Smart People'not an egocentric bore like the latter however but an essentially decent person. Walter is impeccably dressed polite to everyone but reserved and distant. Walter as he admits later is just pretending. He's dried up has ceased to be fully alive. He lives alone in Connecticut where he teaches and is detached toward students and colleagues alike. Remarkably since he still seems to have a reputation he has not revised his course on global economics for fifteen years. He's published books and claims he's finishing another but isn't really working on anything. He dabbles with piano lessons in honor of his late wife a celebrated pianist but that isn't going anywhere he keeps firing teachers.Walter has recently agreed to be listed as coauthor of a paper another teacher wrote. When the real author can't read the paper at an NYU conference he has to go. That takes him back to a New York apartment he's left unoccupied for some timeand when he enters it and discovers its been illegally rented to a young Syrian man and his Senegalese girlfriend his life is changed.The uninvited occupants are Tarik Khalil Haaz Sleiman a drummer who's in a small jazz band and also likes to jam in the park and Zainab Danai Jekesai Gurira who makes original jewelry she sells on the street. They immediately gather their possessions to move out but Walter takes pity on them and lets them stay provisionally. Obviously Walter could use some excitement. The couple are focused energetic alive radiant with hopeall Walter has ceased to be. Tarik is extremely outgoing warm friendly to Walter. His drumming immediately engages Walter and before long the uptight professor is trying his hand at it. Zainab however is cautious and fearful. For good reason as it turns out since neither she nor Tarik is in this country legally.What happens later is heartwrenching not only for the young couple but for Walter and perhaps for viewers some of whom may identify with the American professor others with the two outsiders who have so much to offer yet aren't wanted here. Walter becomes deeply involved to the extent of a burgeoning relationship with Tarik's widowed mother Mouna Hiam Abbas and he does the best he can but he ends up angry and helpless.The US has only 5 of the world's population but 25 of the world's prisoners and the highest incarceration rate of any country. This is part of the story told here because many wouldbe immigrants in the US are in longterm openended detention another scandal and horror perpetrated in America of which 'The Visitor' provides a haunting vivid glimpse. The film conveys a clear sense of the insensitivity and blind arbitrariness of a US immigration system that grinds up lives rapidly and heedlessly behind unmarked walls.Todd McCarthy's first film 'The Station Agent' was an accomplished and wellreceived indie artifact quirky and cute. It was pitchperfect in its way but a little fey. This time he's done something completely different 'The Visitor' by clear implication takes a pretty strong if generalized stand on immigration issues speaks out not for an oddball few but for multitudes of ordinary people and does so forcefully. Yet it's not preachy. Its narrative follows a course that's seemingly obvious but keeps grabbing you just the same.There are many immigration stories often lengthy intricate and epic. This one has the simplicity and occasional sketchiness of a short story. There is admirable restraint in that. What's also significantly different from many citizenship sagas is the way 'The Visitor' draws an American of privilege into the picture as more than a mere observer. This has a kind of Brechtian effect for the American viewer. This isn't us. But suppose it were us? It wasuswas our ancestors our parents or grandparents. How many degrees of separation are we hiding behind? One main way the film avoids interfering with its story is that the experienced Richard Jenkins and the three other principal actors Haaz Sleiman Hiam Abbas and Danai Jekesai Gurira never overdo or underplay. They just seem like they're being themselves which is an actor's triumph but also a director's. And McCarthy is also the writer. The whole film is an admirable illustration of the maxim Less is more. McCarthy and his cast make it all look easyand that's not easy.".

McCarthy has proved himself as a sensitive directorwriter and he extracts a magnificent performance from Richard Jenkins a character actor who gets his first leading role at the age of 60. Jenkins is fascinating to watch as an ordinary man trying to find himself he gives one of the best male performances of the decade and I'd love if he got at least an Oscar nomination since I can see him remaining in my top 5 by the end of the year perhaps still as my favourite. I know that the movie's small indie weight and the fact that it was released early in the year will probably hurt his chances the Independent Spirit Award could be his biggest reward but if it's strongly campaigned it might get a nod  la The Savages even though I know he's not half big a name as Laura Linney. Anyway I hope he gets some sort of recognition  he'll also be seen later this year in the Coens' Burn After Reading. If you like human dramas sensitive writingdirecting and superb acting you should check The Visitor  the finest 2008 release I've seen so far. 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "Thomas McCarthy's second film after the charming Station Agent is a quiet hard look at several different aspects of humanity. The Visitor centers on Walter Vale masterfully portrayed by Richard Jenkins. A solemn economics teacher he spends his time pretending to write on his book and learn piano. Walter finds himself in New York on business and runs into two illegal immigrants Tarek Haaz Sleiman and Zainab Danai Jekesai Gurira who were tricked into renting his apartment. Tarek and Walter strike up an unusual friendship when Tarek begins to teach Walter how to play the drums. This is interrupted by Tarek's arrest and detention while it is decided whether he will be deported or not. Soon Walter is joined by Tarek's mother Mouna.The Visitor is a wonderful piece that brings together some of the best performances I have seen this year. McCarthy disarms us with wry humor quiet wit and a meditative pace and before we know it we've found ourselves immersed. When the credits have rolled however it's not so much the plot that stays with us as the characters. The most perplexing and fascinating character is Walter Vale. The transformation undergone by his character is done perfectly the changes are noticeable but not intrusive. Tarek and Zainab who have only a handful of scenes together manage to share incredible chemistry. Hiam Abbass as Tarek's mother deepens the connection between the characters almost filling in the cracks to complete a whole.At first glance the Visitor seems political in nature. Thomas McCarthy has actually said that was not true the deportation aspect of the film actually came into the script later in the process. The Visitor instead of political aspirations merely seeks to show us that anyone can change your life and that change is all around us and is indeed a good thing.In the end Thomas McCarthy succeeds in bringing capturing the humor tragedy and change of the human experience in his new film. Brought to life by incredibly stirring performances particularly Richard Jenkins the Visitor is the most emotionally powerful film to light up the big screen in a while.".

	schema:headline " The Visitor";
	schema:reviewBody "The Visitor strings together unlikely events in the lives of a professor and his visitors. Remarkably sincere and touching the unimaginable events feel natural.Awkward Connecticut economics professor Walter Vale Richard Jenkins has essentially checked out from his job his personality and his life. Walter is forced by circumstance to return to his abandoned New York City apartment. When he returns he meets Tarek Haaz Sleiman and Zainab Danai Jekesai Gurira who have taken up unauthorized residence in his apartment. Tarek and Zainab teach Walter to live again to come out of his shell and remind him how unfair life can be.Writer and director Thomas McCarthy wrote all of the characters in The Visitor with almost contradictory personality attributes which gives them each a complex humanity.McCarthy wrote Walter Vale painfully dull and bumbling but it was Richard Jenkins who also makes Walter charming and heart breaking. In nearly every setting Jenkins both makes the audience scrunch their faces at Walter's social inadequacies while simultaneously bringing out our Florence Nightingale instincts. As Walter changes in the course The Visitor Jenkins keeps the essential qualities of Walter but changes him in surprising ways.The supporting cast isn't any less remarkable in The Visitor. There is a master of life a vision of unabashed sadness and an embodiment of sensual motherly warmth. Haaz Sleiman who plays Tarek is damn foxy full of life as Tarek. His esprit fills Tarek the audience the other characters and actors with such vitality. Danai Jekesai Guria plays Zainab Tarek's girlfriend. So much of Zainab is forlorn despondent dejection. Rich with beautiful hardness and unnaturally attractive pain Danai Jekesai Guria made Zainab so hard to watch but impossible to pull your eyes away from. Hiam Abbass plays Mouna Tarek's mother. Her fear is palpable but she never loses her intangible sensuality.The most remarkable part of The Visitor is the way it organically shows the way life can change unexpectantly unfairly and without warning and does it with real raw emotion. Just when you think you've figured out what the movie is about you slapped with a new reality. It is frightening timely and angering. Even the ending which is not the typical movie ending is emotive in a subtle and realistic way. I was not overwhelmed or underwhelmed by the movie I was perfectly whelmed a task indeed.The pacing is the one complaint I have with The Visitor. The editing could have been much better. There are beautiful scenes sometimes drawn out to boredom. Scenes that were the actors' timing is slightly off are only highlighted by the shoddy editing. The Visitor is an artsy movie but Tom McArdle checked out completely in a few of the scenes.Slow bits aside The Visitor is a rewarding film with rich characters beautiful acting and complexities that might make those people who are quick to tears cry.".

Tarek and Zainab teach Walter to live again to come out of his shell and remind him how unfair life can be.Writer and director Thomas McCarthy wrote all of the characters in The Visitor with almost contradictory personality attributes which gives them each a complex humanity.McCarthy wrote Walter Vale painfully dull and bumbling but it was Richard Jenkins who also makes Walter charming and heart breaking. In nearly every setting Jenkins both makes the audience scrunch their faces at Walter's social inadequacies while simultaneously bringing out our Florence Nightingale instincts. As Walter changes in the course The Visitor Jenkins keeps the essential qualities of Walter but changes him in surprising ways.The supporting cast isn't any less remarkable in The Visitor. There is a master of life a vision of unabashed sadness and an embodiment of sensual motherly warmth. Haaz Sleiman who plays Tarek is damn foxy full of life as Tarek. His esprit fills Tarek the audience the other characters and actors with such vitality. Danai Jekesai Guria plays Zainab Tarek's girlfriend. So much of Zainab is forlorn despondent dejection. Rich with beautiful hardness and unnaturally attractive pain Danai Jekesai Guria made Zainab so hard to watch but impossible to pull your eyes away from. Hiam Abbass plays Mouna Tarek's mother. Her fear is palpable but she never loses her intangible sensuality.The most remarkable part of The Visitor is the way it organically shows the way life can change unexpectantly unfairly and without warning and does it with real raw emotion. Just when you think you've figured out what the movie is about you slapped with a new reality. It is frightening timely and angering. Even the ending which is not the typical movie ending is emotive in a subtle and realistic way. I was not overwhelmed or underwhelmed by the movie I was perfectly whelmed a task indeed.The pacing is the one complaint I have with The Visitor. The editing could have been much better. There are beautiful scenes sometimes drawn out to boredom. Scenes that were the actors' timing is slightly off are only highlighted by the shoddy editing. The Visitor is an artsy movie but Tom McArdle checked out completely in a few of the scenes.Slow bits aside The Visitor is a rewarding film with rich characters beautiful acting and complexities that might make those people who are quick to tears cry.";

The beginning scenes unravel artfully and launch into the story where Walter is abruptly introduced to the young couple Tarek and Zainab.The ensuing impromptu friendship that develops is well conceived. The wariness and strongwill of Zainab contrasts well against her boyfriend Tarek's more forthright relaxed nature. The interplay between Tarek Zainab and Walter is at times awkward at times touching. I felt that these quality performances go a long way towards forgiving the unlikely set of circumstances and responses that brought and kept the three characters together.I thought the scenes where Walter learns to play the djembe were beautifully played Walter's awkward but curious initiation to drumming and the unexpected expression of pure joy on his face while playing added believable depth to an otherwise restrained and austere performance.Walter's exposure to the djembe perhaps underpins the films wellintentioned message  that our lives are enriched by living sideby side with other cultures. Good intentions aside I think the second half of the film suffers because of the filmmaker's heavyhanded desire to go further and promote the idea that 'good people suffer in the hands of US immigration control'.In my opinion producing a film with any agenda is problematic because it requires a degree of rationalisation and simplification which works against interesting characterisation. Life is very rarely straightforward  and when it is straightforward it isn't interesting to watch.In the case of the second half of The Visitor I felt that this overarching requirement to show the characters in a positive light removed any sense of conflict the characters might have otherwise possessed. The story no longer had a life of it's own  and seemed to involve reaching a predetermined conclusion through any route possible.The character of Tarek's caring  strong  dignified mother fell short of the highexpectations that I'd builtup during the first half of the film. I felt her portrayal was lacking  and I didn't fully understand the function her character played. The subsequent relationship that develops between Walter and Mouna seemed gratuitous and left too many questions unanswered.After watching this and Tom McCarthy's first film The Station Agent it's clear to me that McCarthy is an accomplished director  writer  who perhaps excels at directing characterbased stories. I think this film suffers because halfway through the film McCarthy attempts to move focus from a rich exploration of character to a slightly illconceived issuebased drama.Nevertheless I thoroughly enjoyed The Visitor.".

	schema:reviewBody "Thomas McCarthy's second feature film had the potential to be a poignant human drama but instead sacrifices the story for the message. The Visitor unfortunately turns out to be one of those political message films that for me is impossible to review or talk about without giving away the ending and discussing the message.A meek economics professor a likable but uninteresting Richard Jenkins goes to New York City for a conference only to find an illegal immigrant couple has been living in his apartment for two months. The premise is weak and was unbelievable as I didn't feel any one of the three would've reacted the way they did in this situation. They all just seemed too nice and polite completely unlike real people. However I was willing to forgive the premise if the film were to turn into a believable character study like writerdirector Thomas McCarthy's previous film The Station Agent. Sadly The Visitor offers no such insight into human relationships. There were some mildly amusing moments where the character Tarak Haaz Sleiman teaches the professor to play the African drums and Zanaib the beautiful and quietly emotive Danai Gurira walks in on the professor practicing alone. However these moments didn't add up to anything as the film slowly devolved into a preachy political film where we witnessed Tarak arrested erroneously for jumping a subway turnstile detained the professor hired a lawyer to help him his mother Hiam Abbass came to the city to his aid and formed an unlikely friendship with the professor and director McCarthy in not so subtle ways delivered his message.The major problem with the film is the weak screenplay that doesn't give us the details behind why Tarak his family or his girlfriend had to enter the country illegally. We're given stereotypical reasons why they wanted to leave their homelands i.e. political strife denial of civil rights family members dying but no background on how they got to the U.S. and why they stayed here illegally. McCarthy depicts the agencies handling immigration detention and deportation as a monolithic coldhearted corporation that doesn't take into account the human element. I don't doubt there is much truth in this generalization however McCarthy gives us no solution on how to reform that or point to any specific law that could be changed to prevent nice people like Tarak from getting deported. Strangely the only argument he presents is that Tarak was a nice guy. The bottom line is Tarak was here illegally he was essentially without a job homeless and his mother unbeknownst to him deliberately circumvented the proper legal channels. In the end the lawyer trying to defend him had no recourse. I surely sympathized with the characters on the superficial level where McCarthy presented them but I didn't totally disagree with the end result of Tarak being deported though the means to that deportation seemed cold and tactless.Though the pace seems static and the dialog stilted much of the time McCarthy peppers the film with a nice multiethnic New York feel and for the most part the performances are solid. However by presenting us with an overly simplistic nice people shouldn't be deported message he unfairly leaves the audience to sit along with Richard Jenkins while he takes out his frustrations on his drum in the subway. I would've liked to have known the characters a little more then maybe the message would've carried some more weight and we wouldn't feel so apathetic.".

Until one day he has to go to New York for an academic conference. He finds that in his apartment in the Big Apple a couple has moved in. This changes his life forever.One thing I noticed when I watched the feature is that when Walters life changed for the better and I saw his first smile I got genuinely happy. It is funny to see the white old man sitting in a public place playing the African drum associated with young black men and actually LOVING it. But we laugh with Walter and not at him. I also found myself almost praying for things to go well both for Walter and the visitors like I said I deeply cared for them all and my eyes were constantly fixed on the screen.The movie had great performances not only from Jenkins but also from especially Haaz Sleiman as Tarek.

	schema:reviewBody "Walter Vale is a man who in spite of his status in life has nothing to show for himself he seems to be living in a fog and nothing affects him. This is a college professor of economics that doesn't show any emotions in his private life. We watch him trying to learn the piano perhaps to stay connected to his late wife who evidently had a career as a pianist. Unfortunately he has no talent even for that.When he has no alternative but to substitute for a colleague at an economics conference in Manhattan he embarks in a trip that will transform him into the kind of person that even surprises Walter. What rattles him out of his dreary existence is the surprise he gets when he goes to the apartment he keeps in the city and finds a black woman using his bathtub. He is shocked to find his home invaded by Zainab and her boyfriend Tarek both young and illegal immigrants.Walter who is not a bad person allows the couple to stay and share the apartment with him until they can get another place. Loving music he gets interested in the African drum Tarek plays. When the young man offers to coach Walter in the use of the instrument Walter awakens to the rhythm produced by it. Those cadences conquer Walter. When Tarek invites him to join the impromptu players in the park he realizes what he has been missing.Unfortunately Tarek is apprehended in a subway incident in which he is an innocent victim. Because not having the documents to live in the United States he is jailed at an immigration detention center. Tarek's mother Mouna who lives in another state but keeps in contact with her son realizes something is happening and arrives at the apartment where Walter is now alone since Zainab has moved with relatives.

	onyx:emotionText "Walter Vale is a man who in spite of his status in life has nothing to show for himself he seems to be living in a fog and nothing affects him. This is a college professor of economics that doesn't show any emotions in his private life. We watch him trying to learn the piano perhaps to stay connected to his late wife who evidently had a career as a pianist. Unfortunately he has no talent even for that.When he has no alternative but to substitute for a colleague at an economics conference in Manhattan he embarks in a trip that will transform him into the kind of person that even surprises Walter. What rattles him out of his dreary existence is the surprise he gets when he goes to the apartment he keeps in the city and finds a black woman using his bathtub. He is shocked to find his home invaded by Zainab and her boyfriend Tarek both young and illegal immigrants.Walter who is not a bad person allows the couple to stay and share the apartment with him until they can get another place. Loving music he gets interested in the African drum Tarek plays. When the young man offers to coach Walter in the use of the instrument Walter awakens to the rhythm produced by it. Those cadences conquer Walter. When Tarek invites him to join the impromptu players in the park he realizes what he has been missing.Unfortunately Tarek is apprehended in a subway incident in which he is an innocent victim. Because not having the documents to live in the United States he is jailed at an immigration detention center. Tarek's mother Mouna who lives in another state but keeps in contact with her son realizes something is happening and arrives at the apartment where Walter is now alone since Zainab has moved with relatives. However much he tries to help Tarek he is rendered impotent because of the legal aspect of the situation.Walter finds in Mouna a kindred spirit. Mouna in turn finds the goodness in Walter's heart in the way he goes out of his way to help her son.

	schema:reviewBody "I was very worried that The Visitor would end up being a politically correct liberal message movie and sadly that turned out to be just the case. I went to see it against my own hunch and better judgment because 1 it was rated well by Roeper's At The Movies and 2 it had a score of 7.7 in the IMDb and a score of 8.0 in my age range. However the IMDb 7.7 score was based on a small population of about 500 voters and so probably those votes came mostly from people involved in the production of the movie and their family and friends.Sadly it is a mediocre movie It progresses at a snail's pace and the ending is very unsatisfying. The first 13 of the movie is reasonably interesting because the main characters are set up. However the remaining 23rds of the movie gets bogged down in problems illegals have with the immigration system and the movie becomes extremely boring from this point on.If the movie had concentrated on how the main character continues to grow and change finding new friends new activities new love etc. then it could have become a good movie. Unfortunately it is the worst kind of message movie. The illegals give little speeches about how they've done nothing illegal and how it's unfair that the government wants to deport them. They also seem to be completely ignorant of immigration laws and procedures which I find VERY hard to believe!. The main character who is a university professor of international policy and author of several books seems incapable of doing anything to help his illegal friends also hard to believe. Why didn't he get some advice from law faculty at his university? He gives a rant also about how unfair it is. His argument is that after living numerous years in the U.S. the illegal has a life  a pretty weak argument and totally unbelievable when coming from someone who is supposed to be a university professor. Altogether an extremely unsatisfying and mediocre little movie. This is the first movie review I have ever posted anywhere. I did this in order to save others from the same disappointment.".

Luckily McCarthy is an actor's director and Jenkins is able to be subtle about it and able to convey frustration when required very naturally. He depicts a loneliness to the character that is cracked through his ties to these new characters including Tarek's mother and all of the actors around him are up to 'snuff' too especially Haaz Sleiman as the goodnatured man who got screwed over by a faulty immigration process. They help make such a smallscale story worth telling and it's a true sleeper that demands some more attention at some point or another which might be on video or on the inevitable screenings on the IFC channel.".

	schema:reviewBody "With a highly inventive introduction to cheerfully mismatched characters The Visitor is a daring look at the hopelessness of unfortunate immigration circumstances. Superbly acted and beautifully scored the film doesn't back down from its touching subject matter and realistically tragic events but instead infuses them with aptlytimed comic relief and the persuasive power of music and romance.Bitter and bored college professor Walter Vale Richard Jenkins travels to his New York apartment after being forced to attend a conference on global economization. Immediately he discovers a couple living in his home and out of kindness and the appeal of company he invites them to stay. Tarek Khalil Haaz Sleiman plays the drums and soon gets the unsociable Walter to take up the instrument. Tarek's girlfriend Zainab is slower to acknowledge Walter's hospitality but eventually warms to his presence.When Tarek is arrested at the subway and taken to a detention center for illegal immigrants Walter shows estimable concern for his newfound friend. Weighing his teaching job back in Connecticut against helping a man he's known for less than two weeks Walter hires a lawyer to aid in Tarek's release. When Mrs. Khalil arrives to find out what's happened to her son Walter finds himself rediscovering romance as well as what is truly important in his life.Great care is taken to create sympathy for Tarek and Zainab even though they are chiefly at fault for their uncertain positions. They've done nothing wrong in the eyes of the viewer and its best that it stays that way  for the law they break is too complex to designate as morally right and wrong. The Visitor unflinchingly demonstrates the bleakness of their situation and ensures that their story represents the likely majority of factual examples. The mocking sign Know Your Rights at the detention center foreshadows the unfortunate prejudices and consequences of an unsympathetic law. In the end Walter's selfrealization and inner revelations are the solace that must outshine his visitor's discouraging plights.Richard Jenkins' acting is phenomenal even though his role is to remove a wide array of emotions from his weathered face. Offering many scenes of comedy relief and the amusing rediscovery of longabandoned romance Jenkins delivers a wholly believable character that is relatable and easily liked. His distaste for his work and his discontent with life gives his eventual recognition of purpose even more of a cinematic edge. And being a mismatched companion and an unlikely friend lends to further depth and appeal. Though Tarek and Zainab are the first visitors and Mrs. Khalil after that  truly Walter is the visitor to their world  one he was previously completely oblivious to.Part romance part comedy and many parts drama The Visitor presents moral conflict with the faceless evils of uncaring laws and heartfelt bonding between a weary lonely man and a freespirited musician. While the film slows in a few spots the constant interjection of humor safely guarantees that audiences won't lose interest. The Visitor is an uncommonly sincere film that manages to mix harsh realism with crowdpleasing entertainment.Mike Massie".

Immediately he discovers a couple living in his home and out of kindness and the appeal of company he invites them to stay. Tarek Khalil Haaz Sleiman plays the drums and soon gets the unsociable Walter to take up the instrument. Tarek's girlfriend Zainab is slower to acknowledge Walter's hospitality but eventually warms to his presence.When Tarek is arrested at the subway and taken to a detention center for illegal immigrants Walter shows estimable concern for his newfound friend. Weighing his teaching job back in Connecticut against helping a man he's known for less than two weeks Walter hires a lawyer to aid in Tarek's release. When Mrs. Khalil arrives to find out what's happened to her son Walter finds himself rediscovering romance as well as what is truly important in his life.Great care is taken to create sympathy for Tarek and Zainab even though they are chiefly at fault for their uncertain positions. They've done nothing wrong in the eyes of the viewer and its best that it stays that way  for the law they break is too complex to designate as morally right and wrong. The Visitor unflinchingly demonstrates the bleakness of their situation and ensures that their story represents the likely majority of factual examples. The mocking sign Know Your Rights at the detention center foreshadows the unfortunate prejudices and consequences of an unsympathetic law. In the end Walter's selfrealization and inner revelations are the solace that must outshine his visitor's discouraging plights.Richard Jenkins' acting is phenomenal even though his role is to remove a wide array of emotions from his weathered face. Offering many scenes of comedy relief and the amusing rediscovery of longabandoned romance Jenkins delivers a wholly believable character that is relatable and easily liked. His distaste for his work and his discontent with life gives his eventual recognition of purpose even more of a cinematic edge. And being a mismatched companion and an unlikely friend lends to further depth and appeal. Though Tarek and Zainab are the first visitors and Mrs. Khalil after that  truly Walter is the visitor to their world  one he was previously completely oblivious to.Part romance part comedy and many parts drama The Visitor presents moral conflict with the faceless evils of uncaring laws and heartfelt bonding between a weary lonely man and a freespirited musician. While the film slows in a few spots the constant interjection of humor safely guarantees that audiences won't lose interest. The Visitor is an uncommonly sincere film that manages to mix harsh realism with crowdpleasing entertainment.Mike Massie";

Ninetyeight percent of us know this many of us have experienced it and all of us have seen this theme in countless films. Nothing new andor extraordinary here.INS Nuts and bolts. Many 'atop soap box' reviews spend major time castigating the 'epitome of EVIL' INS as a major theme of the film. Now to the flip side. There are no countries without immigration laws. Consider this young woman's web posting My husband comes from a very poor African country. Even I as his wife cannot just move there and work there without knowledge and permission of the government there.Many say See how the INS destroys the life of a talentedproductive person Tarek in an instant and without warning? NOT! Truth in cinema be told the INS did NOT snap up Tarek without warning but rather some time earlier sent Tarek a letter explaining what they planned to do. None mention that when it comes to Tarek's current plight his mother Mouna points the finger of blame AT HERSELF for a very specific act on her part which directly set the stage for Tarek's detention.Tarek and Walter rage over the unfair INS laws. Yet no one suggests the U.S. become the only country with open borders and no immigration laws.Tarek argues to Walter I've done nothing wrong at the same time his girlfriend tells Walter I can't visit Tarek because we are here illegally. Clearly a disconnect.In the end INS aside the human stories and high caliber acting carry the film and warrant its near universal praise. It is heartening to view an uplifting life altering event and also disheartening to see the event so very quickly lead to utter sadness and great personal loss. And yet that is the slice of life delivered in this excellent indie production.".

Each  every character is so memorably wacky you gotta love em from the gorgeous Nydia Thala to her spastic father Paul Rodriguez and even the painfully repulsive mobster perfectly played by Robert Costanzo who becomes the center of a crazy morbid scheme to attract business to the failing restaurant.

	schema:reviewBody "Eli Roth has learnt a lot of things from his mate Quentin Tarantino but without a shadow of a doubt how to talk was the one he learnt best. If you believed everything that came out of the Hostel Part 2 director's mouth you'd be under the impression that this was a new lesson in extreme cinema pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable on screen to new and previously unheard of levels. Gorehounds though will most likely walk out the multiplexes with the same aftertaste that the first Hostel left it's violent sure but it's not the harshest most disturbing film ever made by a long shot. In fact the only reason you should approach with kid gloves is because this time it is girls that suffer. Young nice and pretty girls with much to offer the world and whether or not dismembering them is more shocking than torturing and killing a horny male jock is a matter for feminist academics to debate.The story this time focuses on a trio of art students studying abroad who decide to do some travelling during their holidays. Convinced by a local of the attractions to be had in a Slovakian spa uhoh! tough girl Whitney Bijou Philips rich confident lesbian Beth Lauren German and nerdish murderermagnet Lorna Heather Matarazzo set off for a few relaxing days in the former Soviet block only to find themselves being splattered all over the walls instead. It's grim and it's nihilistic but not without a vein of dark humour running throughout the hellspawn local brats play football with a severed head but unlike the first film's bewildered hero Paxton Jay Hernandez it's difficult to cheer the protagonists on. Thankfully we're spared the gratuitous borderlinepornography of the last film but the girls are so twodimensional it's hard to care when their holiday starts to go wrong Lorna for instance being so sweet naive and childish that she might as well be a parody.That said though if you're after more of the same arcing blood sprays and annihilated bodies Hostel 2 delivers. However it neither matches nor surpasses the original. Claret still flies of course but in a bit more subdued way and surprisingly the final act doesn't even come close to matching the frantic battle for survival that Paxton went through two years ago. Much of the violence takes place off camera where the audience imagination is set to run wild to the screams of the mutilated but only one scene towards the end is liable to make you wince. Considering the shockvalue of the original lay in tendon slicing fingers being severed a girl exploding as a train hit her and the eyeball scene it seems like a step backwards as far as gore is concerned. Instead Roth goes for a dark psychological approach but woefully mishandles it. The shocking about turns of the plot are more predictable than the director seems to think and what should have been a tense nailbiting conflict of wits misfires giving us nothing but loads of shouting and a dramatic but unbelievable personality shift. Roth may know how to do gore but characterisations? Forget about it.As a result Hostel Part 2 is evidence of how far you can go if your selfbelief is spectacularly high but that is all. All talk of this being a doomladen intestine shredding nervejangler can do nothing to disguise the fact that it apes the masters but doesn't outdo them. Consider how good this would have been if Neil Marshal had directed it for example? Unfortunately Roth and Tarantino were presumably too busy headbanging to men being torn apart by dogs girls getting buzzsaws in the face and the gruesome 'Bathory' scene to notice. The Tarantino connection however is rather apt and had this not been a sequel it could just as easily have gone under a different name and been attached to the Grindhouse project. Don't be surprised if future installments wind up going straight to DVD.".

While partying in the village they are lured and offered in an international auction to sadistic members of the Elite Hunting under a contract that does not allow leaving the torture chamber in a hidden facility alive.Hostel  Part II is a good sequel of Hostel disclosing the fate of backpacker Paxton that escaped alive from the facility in Bratislava Slovakia of the first movie and then following the tragic tour of three American friends. The story is quite similar to the first one except the great twist in the last five minutes with the action and revenge of the clever and rich Beth. This violent and gore movie is recommended only for fans of the genre and those that liked the first Hostel will certainly appreciate this sequel.

	schema:reviewBody "I don't write reviews very often but i had to say something about this film  IT IS THE WORST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN! The 1st Hostel was pathetic  to do a sequel that follows exactly the same plot as the original shows how poor a filmmaker Eli Roth really is. The only difference between this and the first one is... wait for it... it has girls instead of boys as the lead characters! I suppose that was to up the horror factor like seeing girls tortured is more horrifying than seeing boys tortured. Wrong wrong wrong. As with the first the characters so stupid and clichd you couldn't care less about them. There's the geeky girl who's dialogue is so poor you really just want her to die quickly the annoying party girl and of course the 'heroine' who is not all she seems.The 2 guys who are in on the kill are terrible they act like 15 year olds smoking pot for the first time and were just hilarious. Their lines were weak  the F word 4 times in every sentence one convincing the other that they 'had to do this dude' etc. As if 40 year old businessmen calling each other 'dude' isn't bad enough the predictability of their role reversals at the moment of truth is a howler.Another thing that annoyed me like the first in the first 35 minutes absolutely NOTHING happens. Its just talking where the characters involved cross paths until finally one of them gets kidnapped with not one bit of interesting character development.Thats enough I can't go on. I never want to think about or see this rubbish ever again. The only people it will appeal to is 14 year old boys andor incredibly stupid people. The sad thing is I fastforwarded through half of it and still understood it all as most of the talking parts which is 98 of the film with 2 horror is completely unnecessary. This film is boring there's hardly any horror the acting is poor and the plot just pathetic. Avoid this film.".

Hostel 2 follows the same path it's just that the guys pass on the baton to 3 girls this time. And of course unlike the guys these girls venture off to the unknown for pleasures which probably includes sex for one of the 3 characters but not just sex! But what makes Hostel 2 work is the the whole dynamics of the Elite Hunting organization that Eli Roth showcases. The torture scenes might be a dejavu of SAW 3 or the previous Hostel movie but it's the concept of the Elite Hunting that makes one shudder. The vast reach of the gang it's working style the 'contracts' that are signed when bidding are finalised they make a very disturbing and should I add a chilling viewing. Hostel 2 is no landmark cinema but it's a tad above the first installment. Watch it for it might make you think about the concept of an Organisation!".

	schema:reviewBody "Oh Eli. What happened? Cabin Fever was a fun horror flick and the first Hostel had its moments but this? My excitement over a Roth helmed Cell has just dropped dramatically.Opening where the first film left off things get off to a bad start as we meet back up with Paxton with Jay Hernandez phoning in a curiously wooden performance. The first scares are very poorly handled and obvious.After the pointless prologue we meet our new gender swapped protagonists. Bijou Phillips's is the obnoxious onedimensional slut who just wants to sleep with Viktor Krum. Heather Matarazzo's Lorna should have been a good character. Matarazzo is a talented actress but here she hams it up too much and Roth piles on the she's an introverted nerd! touches far too heavily. She's sorta the Josh of Hostel II only Lorna is a cartoon where as Josh actually seemed like a guy you could meet in a college algebra class. Lauren Graham turns in a pretty good performance and Beth is the only one of these females who actually feels somewhat like a real person.The new twist on the formula lies in Roger Bart and Richard Burgi's prospective killers. Here's where Roth could have gotten really dark and interesting. Everyone who saw the first Hostetl remembers Rick Hoffman's whacked out creepy performance as the American Client. Bart and Burgi's characters could have been used to expand on that creepiness as well as bring in some genuine interest in Bart's character's reluctance amping up the suspense. But no! Instead these characters are shallow barely explored personalities and Roth uses them for some cheap plot contrivances in the third act.For a horror flick the movie has surprisingly little scares. Scratch that it has no scares. There was not a moment in this movie where I didn't see the jumps coming and there is little in the way of suspense. The first Hostel had some genuinely suspenseful moments and Cabin Fever even had a few don't do that! moments. This film has gruesome moments for sure that this movie got an R rating is the final nail in the coffin for the MPAA's credibility. If Shakespeare in Love and Hostel II share the same rating something is seriously wrong. The first kill is undeniably effective in being unnerving but it lacks suspense which is the secret when a film is toeing the line of bad taste. This was simply inescapable murder on display.Interestingly the rest of the gruesomeness that ensues is much different in tone. Much of the third act has an almost slapstick vibe but Roth lacks the grace and timing of splatstick alumni like Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson to truly pull it off. There is also a completely superfluous scene involving a man with a gun and some children that literally served no purpose. Roth was trying so hard to be shocking in that scene that it had the opposite affect on me I just stared blankly at the screen. I couldn't care less about this completely pointless detour featuring Roth going look! Aren't I shocking!One last complaint and boy is it a big one Nathan Barr's score. This movie had one of the worst scores I've heard in years. Barr's music sounds like something someone would write if they were making fun of all the clichs of the horror score. That worked for the campy tone of Cabin Fever but it completely destroys any opportunity for suspense in this film.I know Eli Roth has a really good film in him. After Hostel II I fear the wait for that movie will be longer than I was expecting. I hope he's finally scratched that itch for paying homage to his favorite horror flicks and his shock for shock's sake fetish. If that makes its way into his adaption of Stephen King's Cell we'll have lost a great story ripe for screen translation to a promising young filmmaker whose head got too big too fast.".

I had a huge problem with some of the scenes in the film. For example the scene where the woman is bathing in blood it could definitely had been shorter if they would have cut down the men lighting up the candles. Also when Stuart Roger Bart first untied Beth Lauren German but then retied her again. It made absolutely no sense. In addition I believe that the entire begin was okay where we thought Paxton Jay Hernandez was trapped and killed that is until he woke up next to a young woman who by the way serves absolutely no purpose to the movie and got killed for good.Another issue that I had with this movie was how predictable it was. The young American women were so nave that of course we felt they had to be killed. Like Lorna Heather Matarazzo didn't your mother ever tell you not to go alone with strangers? Again too pathetic. I say don't waste your money time or effort to watch this film you would truly be disappointed.".

Simple tricks to get the characters out of situations such as guns which I despise in films. No twist and a boring story line. I think these films are best left to the producers and directors of the Saw films. Dehumanization of beautiful woman must of been a main object in the director's mind which was also overused. I did not enjoy the directing or acting. Such things as others have stated as the shock tactics were the main man behind the system has the gun to the children and ends up killing one child which I believe did not work because you could envisage what the director writer had in mind. The end scene does not make any sense to the rest of the film which seemed like a quick simple way to end it due to the lack of story. One last thing the gore is boring as well. However if you enjoy pointless mind numbing poor quality films I recommend this film to you. All in all a waste of time and money.".

I know there are not that many fans to the first film I understand somewhat it's not for the faint of heart and the first half is like a soft core porno not to mention the blood and gore that's involved. But I think somewhere down the line it will be a classic cult film. Now for the sequel I thought despite a few flaws here and there I thought it was just as good maybe even BETTER than the first. Not the most shocking ending I've ever seen either but it was a good one.Well the tables have turned now we have 3 American girls who are the target of this blood hound club's addiction to torture and death. Two brothers are in this together one isn't quite sure if he could do it one is psyched out. One of the girls is a bit naive one is a total slut and one is the calm and collected one. But when they are taken by the same people as in the first film falling into the same trap they soon realize the massive trouble they're in. But I think one of the girls has heard the term if you can't beat 'em join 'em a little too much when she realizes what she's in for.There are some massive gory scenes a warning in advance. I thought that they kinda took an idea if you ever heard this woman from history they called her Countess Blood I believe look her up if you do not know what I'm talking about because there is a scene that is very much like that in Hostel 2. I would only recommend this for fans of the first Hostel or if you have an open mind it's not for the faint of heart. It's very gory and very disturbing but it's a great horror flick with a great ending! 810".

Hostel was one of them by no means a perfect film but a very good effort. This however is so bad that it actually ruins the first. All the stuff you had in your head goes away you see too much of the inner workings and it just doesn't make sense. The acting is awful with the exception of the lead girl the one who lives. The character switch at the end makes absolutely no senseThe big guy knows they'll kill him if he doesn't finish her off and whats a bullet to the head when you've sawed her face off? The whole scene on the train is cringeworthy the set ups look bad the crowd of Italian soccer fans are all wearing fake jerseys for instance. And the end is crap Don't get me wrong I squirmed in my seat when she had scissors wrapped around his nuts decent horror moment and kind of funny. But one why the hell would you be calling her names  NO MAN WOULD!!! and two why did the evil group let her chop off the other girls head. The bubblegum kids don't work it takes 40mins to actually see the torture place again. Jay Hernandez should have been in a more central role although I did like his death scene. The bloodbath was good  the rest sucked  I've seen Last House on the Left and a woman bite off a wee willy I don't really need to see it again. Although I think Eli Roth does again and again and again. The whole character switch thing is rubbish one guy bottles it AFTER he puts a saw through a girls head and ther other goes a little mental when he looks at a picture of his wife BS! I wanted to see them pick up all sorts of different weapons from the rack in the trailer like that bit in Kill Bill. I wanted more humour and more smarts. A man's penis getting chopped off and fed to a dog was funny sick and made everyone squirm but as for a big payoff it was a waste of time. Eli Roth is in fact a crappy film maker who got lucky and kudos to the guy for jumping on QT train and riding it all the way I would too. In terms of being the horror guy of this generation  Aja Marshall Wan and all the other splat pack dudes are waaaayy ahead  even those who've only had one film! Another point  The MPAA should seriously be ashamed of themselves they're a joke. Whats the point of them if they don't say  No you can't show a man's penis being cut off and fed to a dog  just cut away. This should be a NC17 no way a Rated R. I'm not one for censoring films. Devils Rejects SAW franchise etc all had good points in trying to push their films by the board but this is getting ridiculous just scrap the MPAA. They don't do anything but get talked into stupid ideas.".

It was in fact not very good but what it did have was an intriguing premise a club whose wealthy members pay to torture and murder abducted people. What worked was that such an idea was not entirely inconceivable. I would argue that such clubs just like snuff films currently exist and that was what made the film interestingly creepy for me.Hostel Part 2 however offers nothing original. Instead it robs from various horror films of old. For example the opening scene mirrors that of Friday The 13th Part 2. In another scene as I watched a female clubmember bathing in the blood of her purchase I couldn't decide which vampire film the scene reminded me of most there are so many. It was at the ending that I actually let a laugh slip. The foiled attempt at irony was followed by a scene reminiscent of Blood Sucking Freaks.

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING! DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T LIKE SPOILERS!!! It amazes me that they can show murder torture and blood and gore in this movie yet when it comes to nudity they have to hide it by blurring the images. Even swearing with the Fbomb is omitted out which is stupid. In this movie murder torture and even decapitation are somehow more acceptable to televise but no swearing or nudity allowed? The Network censors are nuts! This movie is sick and very disturbing! It's about an international club of sadistic rich people who pay big bucks through a bidding process to murder a man or woman through torture. Victims come from the hostel in Slovakia and their passport images are scanned and sent out to members. Once you enter into a contract to do this you cannot leave until you murder your victim. Each of the members have a dog tattoo that identifies them as part of the club. Expect to see kids have guns pointed to their heads one is shot in the head cannibalism dogs tearing a person to pieces and a woman having her face shredded up with a saw to name a few. It seems like everyone in this town is bad to the bone.You get the sense that once you're marked as a victim there really is no escape from the factory where they keep the victims. Even if you do the reach of this group is so wide that they can still get you as you'll find out with Jay Hernandez's character. You really need to see the fist movie to understand the second although you can get the gist if you have not. Sadly we see a decent caring person forced into becoming a monster herself first in a bid for survival then for revenge! It seems that in both the first and second movies the lead characters commit murder without hesitation after being victimized themselves. The message is that having enough money can do anything even turn the tables on those that would have you be the victim. I think most of us like to see evil people get their comeuppance so seeing some of them pay for their evil deeds is satisfying but unfortunately not all the people that deserve it do and it thus opens the door for yet another sequel! If you have a sick sense of humor you will like the ending with the street kids playing soccer with someone's head! It's disgusting yet the victim got her comeuppance for being evil so to me it was good!I won't divulge who it was.".

	onyx:emotionText "WARNING! DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T LIKE SPOILERS!!! It amazes me that they can show murder torture and blood and gore in this movie yet when it comes to nudity they have to hide it by blurring the images. Even swearing with the Fbomb is omitted out which is stupid. In this movie murder torture and even decapitation are somehow more acceptable to televise but no swearing or nudity allowed? The Network censors are nuts! This movie is sick and very disturbing! It's about an international club of sadistic rich people who pay big bucks through a bidding process to murder a man or woman through torture. Victims come from the hostel in Slovakia and their passport images are scanned and sent out to members. Once you enter into a contract to do this you cannot leave until you murder your victim. Each of the members have a dog tattoo that identifies them as part of the club. Expect to see kids have guns pointed to their heads one is shot in the head cannibalism dogs tearing a person to pieces and a woman having her face shredded up with a saw to name a few. It seems like everyone in this town is bad to the bone.You get the sense that once you're marked as a victim there really is no escape from the factory where they keep the victims. Even if you do the reach of this group is so wide that they can still get you as you'll find out with Jay Hernandez's character.

	schema:reviewBody "It's strange that the critics who are giving this movie bad reviews aren't even giving an argument. They're simply saying it's crud and torture porn. They are complaining that there is too much violence while fans complain that there isn't enough. I strongly believe that this film deserves more credit than it's receiving. I also read a user comment on IMDb that said this film had the worst cast ever. That almost makes me think that the person did not see the movie.The cast was the strongest aspect of the movie. German Phillips and Matarazzo were pretty damn perfect for their roles. They are the three leads but the core of the film is the duo of Richard Burgi and Roger Bart. I knew they both looked kind of creepy but I had no idea they could act so well. Lionsgate did a very good thing by not pressuring Eli Roth into casting huge stars. I can honestly say that Burgi and Bart give the best performances in any horror movie I've seen in a long time. I also love how Roth wrote their characters. They were very real and believable because they're not just evil villains they are family men. I thought I knew exactly where the characters were going but Roth was successful in surprising me. I found it very entertaining to watch these two characters unravel. In addition to the main characters the many offbeat minor characters were freaking amazing. I'm not certain at the moment who was in charge of casting but to whoever was I salute you. There are countless new characters with great faces as well as the return of the desk clerk who is surprisingly menacing. Roth also knows that he owes a lot to Italian cinema from the 70s and 80s. He's cast two famous actors from that period as well as the director of the most infamous movie of all time. Their cameos were very for lack of a much better word good. I also have to mention the bubblegum gang. This time the kids are interwoven nicely into the narrative. Their scenes were comedic but also had genuine emotional impact.It is easy to notice that the photography editing and set designs of this film are much improved from the original. Unlike in the Saw films the viewer is not distracted by these elements. Instead the experience is enhanced. I was quite impressed.I respect Roth much more as a filmmaker after this movie. There are several awesome montages which I'm always a sucker for. He also constantly builds up our expectations and based on his other movies we think everything will go according to plan only to shatter them and fulfill in them in another way. This in my opinion is the way to go because it's both surprising and satisfying.All in all this movie offers SO much more than most horror sequels. Saw II even though it was very successful went in the direction of most horror sequels focusing more and more on the killings instead of the people involved. Hostel Part II does the opposite similar to Kill Bill. Fans may be disappointed that the torture scenes are shorter than in the first but I think Roth handles the material wisely in most instances. And yes the girls' story is almost a mirror image of the boys' in the original but it all feels fresh since we get to watch their journey knowing what's happening every step of the way.The introduction with Jay Hernandez is one of the only things feels like something that's done in a lot of sequels. He should have been given more to do. It wouldn't have been necessary but it would have been more interesting. His scenes here feel kind of forced even though they're well done.Oh and about that ending. I didn't know how to feel at first. Roth has been promising so much. My first words after the movie were That wasn't the most shocking ending in history! But the more I think about it the more I love it. It's not a twist like I was expecting although there is a nice twist in the climax. The final scene is very entertaining however straightforward it may be. It's still more fun than watching a bunch of billionaires steal money.".

	schema:headline " Solid Horror Sequel";
	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw Hostel back in 2006 I thought it was a solid entertaining flick but still full of flaws so when a sequel was announced along with its official synopsis and promising cast I naturally got really excited as I thought it sounded great and had lots of potential to be even better than the original hence this easily became one of my most anticipated movies of the year. After finally seeing the film I have to admit that I still like the original a tad more but I'm happy I waited as this is surely one of the better horror sequels I've seen recently.The plot this time focuses around 3 American college students  Beth Lauren German her best friend Whitney Bijou Phillips and the sweet Lorna Heather Matarazzo who are studying art in Rome for the Summer and plan on going to Prague to explore Europe. However they cross paths with the mysterious Axelle Vera Jordanova a beautiful model from their art class who somehow convinces them to skip their journey to Prague and head to Slovakia where they can relax and enjoy the country. Soon they find a hostel for the weekend and it seems like everything is going to be great but little do they know that staying at a hostel was the biggest mistake in their lives and that they are going to pay the price in the worst possible way.To be honest I was never too big on Eli Roth before. I thought Cabin Fever was very mediocre and full of clichs and pointless nudity whereas Hostel a big step from Cabin with an interesting and original concept but still full of flaws so I guessed if Roth continued to improve this could have even been better than the original. I was wrong though as I actually found myself liking this a bit less than the first one but still thinking this is definitely one of the better and gorier horror sequels in the last few years and one of the most entertaining movies this year. Without a doubt the best thing about the movie is the great acting. Honestly as much as I'm a HUGE horror fan even I admit there are really rare horror movies or even movies in general in which most of the actors did a great job but fortunately that was the case here. Heather Matarazzo who has really grown up since her debut in Welcome to the Dollhouse does an amazing job in portraying without a doubt the sweetest character in the whole movie and when bad things start happening to her you really feel bad for her as she just gives a great performance. Lauren German who played the unfortunate hitchhiker in the awesome Texas Chainsaw Massacre Remake gives an amazing performance too and I was happy to see her as a lead in a horror movie as I thought she was great in the Chainsaw remake. Bijou Phillips also does a great job in playing the loyal and tough bestfriend type of character and she is surely one of the bets characters in the film something she didn't have a chance to be in movies like Venom for instance. Worth mentioning is also the newcomer Vera Jordanova even though her character is waisted and should have gotten more screentime. The other characters are greatly build up and you really do feel bad for them when bad things start happening to them thanks to both the already mentioned great acting and a good script written by Eli Roth who actually surprised me in the movie as I thought he did a pretty good job and didn't put any unnecessary nudity like in Cabin Fever. I also liked how the movie didn't just center on the 3 girls and their torturing but also the tortures themselves played by Roger Bart and Richard Burgi and their fears and thoughts which was a pretty fresh add to the plot. No need to say this is way more brutal than the original too even though the ending could have been less comical and more actionpacked.Of course there are weak points of the movie though. First of all I was very much disappointed with the route Eli went with the character of Paxton Jay Hernandez our hero in the last movie as I thought it was very clichd and already seen before in other horror sequels. The movie also felt rushed towards the ending as all the action and torture scenes were fairly short and incomparable to the ones in the original. The movie also didn't feel as dark as the original and some scenes were just pointlessly funny but that's probably why I liked this sequel it wasn't trying to be a carbon copy of the original actually quite the opposite  it was trying to a different yet loyal follow up.In some sequels that method never works but in this one it did. Hostel Part II isn't as fresh as the original but it's a solid Horror Sequel and an impressive follow up to the original. 610".

	schema:headline " Preferred Over The First Film But That's Not Saying Much.";
	schema:reviewBody "Hostel Part II follows a group of American art students who are studying in Rome. Among them are goodgirl Beth Lauren German wild Whitney Bijou Phillips and the softspoken Lorna Heather Matarazzo. This group of girls end up on a train to Prauge where they meet a model Axelle Vera Jordanova who convinces them to go to Slovakia with her to a mineral spring spa. The girls arrive to Slovakia where they enjoy spending a few days at the youth hostel. Little do they know the girls have been auctioned off to wealthy tycoons who want to find the thrill in their murder  and at an abandoned warehouse they can do that. Soon after the three young women are taken off to the warehouse one by one where their grisly fates await them  but can they make it out alive?To be put plainly I didn't like the original Hostel. The only reason I saw this was because a friend of mine convinced me to go I would've rather seen something else. To my surprise I enjoyed this movie a little more than I did the first if that means anything. Storywise this movie is essentially a complete rehash of the events in the original minus the fact that our main characters are young women rather than a bunch of hormonecrazed guys. There are some tweaks on the story as well so it isn't a complete copy. Some of the writing is clever and I thought there was a small bit more of depth for instance the exploration of the businessmen themselves who were paying to torture but it has it's fair share of problems as well. I thought the film got off to a decent start but after sitting through the first thirty minutes my hopes for it diminished. Like in it's predecessor Hostel Part II contains some utterly ridiculous moments. At times I wasn't sure if the movie was going for a bad comedy or a horror flick  it balances on that line awkwardly and it doesn't work out well. That was one of my biggest problems with the original the humor just didn't work. Both of these movies could have been very suspenseful and terrifying but the attempt at dark comedy and the overthetop violence ruined it.As expected the violence and gore is amped up for this sequel and I was thoroughly grossed out on quite a few moments. But the problem is that that's basically all Eli Roth knows how to do. Sure I may have squirmed  but was I scared? Of course not. The idea that the Hostel films are based upon is intriguing but you need some solid suspense and terror to get a good reaction out of me and this movie failed to do that. Call me old fashioned but the majority of these gorefilled horror movies don't cut it for me. As for the acting that was one thing I did enjoy about this movie  I personally liked the cast. Lauren German Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake plays our lead quite well along with Bijou Phillips Venom who turns in a good performance in the type of role she plays often. And Heather Matarazzo Scream 3 was excellent in her role as the quirky and naive Lorna. I have to admit I did care about the characters in this movie so in that sense it did something right in my eyes but that is mainly due to the actors and nothing else. As for the finale of the film it ended with another ridiculous gag that was attempting to be funny but I just thought it made the film seem even more unbelievable and stupid.Overall Hostel Part II is one gross flick but the gore doesn't do anything for the story. It's awkward balance of humor and horror doesn't mesh and the ridiculous gore gags in this film add to it's stupidity more than it's scariness. The cast was good I'll give it that  but unfortunately they can't redeem it.

	onyx:emotionText "Hostel Part II follows a group of American art students who are studying in Rome. Among them are goodgirl Beth Lauren German wild Whitney Bijou Phillips and the softspoken Lorna Heather Matarazzo. This group of girls end up on a train to Prauge where they meet a model Axelle Vera Jordanova who convinces them to go to Slovakia with her to a mineral spring spa. The girls arrive to Slovakia where they enjoy spending a few days at the youth hostel. Little do they know the girls have been auctioned off to wealthy tycoons who want to find the thrill in their murder  and at an abandoned warehouse they can do that. Soon after the three young women are taken off to the warehouse one by one where their grisly fates await them  but can they make it out alive?To be put plainly I didn't like the original Hostel. The only reason I saw this was because a friend of mine convinced me to go I would've rather seen something else. To my surprise I enjoyed this movie a little more than I did the first if that means anything. Storywise this movie is essentially a complete rehash of the events in the original minus the fact that our main characters are young women rather than a bunch of hormonecrazed guys. There are some tweaks on the story as well so it isn't a complete copy. Some of the writing is clever and I thought there was a small bit more of depth for instance the exploration of the businessmen themselves who were paying to torture but it has it's fair share of problems as well. I thought the film got off to a decent start but after sitting through the first thirty minutes my hopes for it diminished. Like in it's predecessor Hostel Part II contains some utterly ridiculous moments. At times I wasn't sure if the movie was going for a bad comedy or a horror flick  it balances on that line awkwardly and it doesn't work out well. That was one of my biggest problems with the original the humor just didn't work. Both of these movies could have been very suspenseful and terrifying but the attempt at dark comedy and the overthetop violence ruined it.As expected the violence and gore is amped up for this sequel and I was thoroughly grossed out on quite a few moments. But the problem is that that's basically all Eli Roth knows how to do. Sure I may have squirmed  but was I scared? Of course not. The idea that the Hostel films are based upon is intriguing but you need some solid suspense and terror to get a good reaction out of me and this movie failed to do that. Call me old fashioned but the majority of these gorefilled horror movies don't cut it for me. As for the acting that was one thing I did enjoy about this movie  I personally liked the cast. Lauren German Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake plays our lead quite well along with Bijou Phillips Venom who turns in a good performance in the type of role she plays often. And Heather Matarazzo Scream 3 was excellent in her role as the quirky and naive Lorna. I have to admit I did care about the characters in this movie so in that sense it did something right in my eyes but that is mainly due to the actors and nothing else. As for the finale of the film it ended with another ridiculous gag that was attempting to be funny but I just thought it made the film seem even more unbelievable and stupid.Overall Hostel Part II is one gross flick but the gore doesn't do anything for the story. It's awkward balance of humor and horror doesn't mesh and the ridiculous gore gags in this film add to it's stupidity more than it's scariness. The cast was good I'll give it that  but unfortunately they can't redeem it. I'll admit I enjoyed it a tad bit more than I did the original and I was entertained throughout it but that's really not saying much. If you didn't like the original I wouldn't bother seeing this sequel. I could tolerate it but it's nothing even remotely remarkable. 410.";

	schema:headline " Two Visits to the Hostel and hell its better second time!";
	schema:reviewBody "Hostel was a very flawed movie made tolerable by the simple fact the main idea about people paying to torture and kill people was a very good one. It was disturbing and the brief screen time that storyline occupied the movie made it worthwhile. Overall that film was 710 movie at best it was gory fun and had a great storyline. Yet its characters and the plot surrounding them was a mess. I didn't care less about a group of American college guys going to have lots of sex. Not only were they irritating as hell but they also never seemed believable. By the time we saw them start dying in gruesome manners I was practically cheering the killers it made there irritating mannerisms seem worthwhile as we saw them operated on beheaded and having half a hand cut off with a chainsaw. I was looking forward to seeing Hostel Part 2 as I was intrigued where Eli Roth would take the story. Would he follow the survivor of the original or follow a new group of people altogether. The answer is a bit of both as Paxton does make an appearance but the major storyline follows a group of girls off to Slovakia to go to a spa. And its with these three lead character Hostel Part 2 succeeds. These three are believable and actually likable. We have the normal one the party loving one and also the sweet and considered slightly irritating one. They seem like real people so by the time the nasty events begin we feel for them. Hostel Part 2 is a rare thing in the horror genre a sequel that surpasses the original. It might not be as gory in my opinion but its more horrific more scary and overall a lot better movie than the original ever was.So let me start off with the cast of the movie as the cast are surprisingly decent here. As I said the three leads are pretty good only one who started to grate after a while. We have Lauren German as Beth she does a great performance here. Its not too showy and it never seems the average dumb idiot girl that's killed off in horror movies. Nor is she the ridiculously kick ass female either she just seems normal. There's also Heather Matarazzo as Lorna. Now she was my personal favourite of the movie. She's geeky but she's a genuinely nice person. Her character definitely seems the most believable of the entire movie. The final of the lead girls is Bijou Phillips as Whitney. Now she irritated me at first and after her first few minutes I was waiting anxiously to see her head mounted on a wall and her intestines spilling out everywhere. However her character grew on me and in the end I found her quite likable although certainly the least believable. Yet the lead three aren't the best bit of this movie. No what Hostel Part 2 decides to do is show us the killers world the world of the rich businessmen who auction to kill the people. Its this storyline and the characters that inhabit it that works brilliantly. Roger Bart is the best character and best performer in the movie I won't spoil anything about his character he's too good to spoil. He has the best moments in the movie and I'm glad to see the actor doing more roles. The other supporting cast are pretty great as well definitely an improvement on the original movie.So what of the gore then as unfortunately for a lot of people that's what seeing this movie will all be about. Well its hardly gory on the scale of Saw 3 or even Hostel for that matter. So for people going to see this movie foe extreme violence they will probably be a bit disappointed. Only one sequence near the end made me cringe like crazy the rest seemed pretty tame although a lot of it still left me disturbed. Especially a sequence involving a scythe and a bath don't ask. Nothing comes close to sickening like the eye ball sequence in the original all this does is horrify through other means. This movie rather than opting to sicken decides to unsettle you. And it does that through clever ways. There are no boo scares in this movie you won't jump at all. This works through psychological methods and a great little touches. The most disturbing and horrifying sequences in the movie follow the actual people who auction to kill the people its an unusual method to unsettle but when you see them auctioning at first it creeped me out. Other methods and the actual character inhabiting the world are genuinely frightening and leaves you a bit nervous. This might not be terrifying for a lot of people but it is genuinely creepy and a lot more disturbing then the last movie.So what are the faults of this movie as clearly its not a perfect movie hence the 910 and not 1010. Well if this movie has one fault I'll have to admit its probably the ending and also the fact some people might complain about the set up a bit as the set up does take a while. Also the storyline at the start seems a bit superfluous by the end of the movie. Anyway apart from the ending leaving me a bit disappointed and the fact that at least one cast member seemed unnecessary this is a very good movie and definitely a superior movie to the original. Whther this does well or not depends on what people are looking for in terms of gore this won't satisfy the gore hungry fans who've seen Saw 3. But for the people who want a creepy unsettling and admittedly very well made movie Hostel Part 2 will not disappoint.".

Basically we have the same story of the first one except with girls in the main parts going to Slovakia just to be victims of Elite Hunting a murderforprofit company that sells to rich bored people the opportunity to inflict suffering on others just for the pleasure of doing so. Point for point this is what seems the problems with Hostel 2 1. Bad awful acting. The film's main character is played by Lauren German who couldn't act to save her life. She can't transmit emotion sadness fear no emotions. She just gives us the entire time that unnerving I am so better than you look that makes me want to join Elite Hunting just to take care of her character!Add to this the annoying Bijou Phillips who seems like a cardboard of these horror film's blond dumb bimbos. Hell people could simply cut the scenes of Sarah Michelle Gellar from I Know What You Did Last Summer and paste it on this crap. The same old stuff over and over again hot blond teenage who thinks only about sex and puts people down every chance she has. To top it all we have the two main bad guys who overact all the time and can't deliver a line without trying to chew the scenery. 2. Horrible characters. When the main character is a spoiled rich and arrogant little brat you don't give a damn if she survives it or not. The blond bimbo is annoying as hell and doesn't have nothing interesting to say for her whole screen time. She just goes through the motions trying to be sexy as hell and gets a chainsaw in her head by the ending. The two rich American guys were written as the typical American rich Joes in every horror movie nowadays you have the full of himself bastard and the best friend who seems like a nicer guy but reveals himself as an even bigger scumbag than his full of himself friend.Both bored with their lives with the fact that they have a lot of family health a house a great jobs etc. The same old tired clich. They are bored on screen and I offscreen! 3. Ridiculous script. How can you sum the story?Like this three rich girls decide to take a trip to Rome. Enter the mysterious European cold villainous snake who lures them to Slovakia instead after a fake attack on board a train where the European snake gains the trust of the three Americans. The girls arrive in Slovakia cue the obligatory party scene and they are caught one by one. Cue torture scenes lots of blood etc. The I am so better than you girl escapes gets revenge on the European snake and by the end director Eli Roth proving to us how a great guy he is gives as a scene in which small kids play football with the European scumbag's head. In one linethe plot is boring as watch paint dry stuffed with unnecessary brutality. 4. Bad directing You would expect something from the guy who directed the first Hostel and was hailed as the next best thing. You won't find anything new here. Not a singe stroke of genius. Any other Joe could direct this crap and the result would be even better. The good points Mind you there are only THREE good points by the end of Hostel 2. First the one responsible for saving this from utter disaster is a girl named Heather Matarazzo. This brilliant talent who made a career for herself as Anne Hathaway's best friend in Princess Diaries is by far the best actress in the whole cast. She outshone every single actress or actor on the screen. Her character a naive sweet girl is killed too soon so the I am so better than you girl and the blond bimbo can get more screen time. Hostel 2 would be a better film had Heather be given the focus but she wasn't Lauren German was and Lauren German won't find a great future ahead of her not after this crap and not after we all saw what a horrendous actress she is. The scene in which Heather is hang naked and then beaten and cut to death by a cold merciless European older woman crying for help and pleading to be freed made me fell so sorry for her character and for Heather herself to play a scene that was surely so tough to face. She is a sweetheart a cute talented girl I cheered for her character and felt that the movie was basically finished after Heather's gets caught in the hands of the European woman and is subsequently beaten and tortured to death. Secondly good photography of some European villages saves something of the picture. Great scenery wonderful use of location. Thirdly there is only one moment in which you actually fell scared and it's right on the beginning in which we get to see Paxton Jay Hernandez recovering on a hospital. He receives the visit of a detective and her translator. The scene plays out perfectly the detective giving the details from what his investigations led him the charming but at the same time mysterious translator who seems to be analyzing Paxton's reaction and the ending of the scene a real shocking moment that kicks off Hostel 2 so greatly but after Paxton's demise it all goes downhill. I could see a better film had the detective and the translator be given more importance.".

	schema:reviewBody "During the first ten or so minutes of Hostel 2 i was sitting there thinking 'wow this is gonna be a hell of a lot better than the first' The only surviving character from the first film Paxton returns found on a train by the Russian feds. He is then interrogated in a Hospital by the Russian government asking about what happened in the Hostel. He informs them about the bloodhound tattoo all the killers have the man interrogating him replying 'you mean this tattoo' in a classic clich horror way. And then he wakes up and he's lying in bed next to his wife. It was a nightmare. Oh god i did not see that coming. Paxton and his wife argue you then see her in bed alone and being woken by a noise outside. She goes to her balcony and see's the gardener trimming a tree with a chainsaw if you didn't see what was going to happen next then this film could prove a treat for you. She then wanders the house shouting for Paxton and finally wanders into the kitchen where he is sitting. Oh yeah and his head is gone. Those first 10 or so minutes were the best part of the film for me and even they were clich ridden predictable and seen it all before. So if that's the best part of the film what's the rest like? Well essentially it's the first film all over again. But seriously ALL OVER AGAIN. A group of travellers this time three girls meet somebody who tells them about this great place this time not a sex Hostel but a spa  see what they did there? Girls don't want Hostels they want Spas and they go there. One by one they're picked off in stupid albeit sometimes shocking ways until the final girl who escapes obviously. This film was pointless. If you've seen the first one there is no point in seeing this which is funny because people who go to see this will more than likely have seen the first. Sure it has it's share of disgusting moments although nowhere near as much as the first and i thought even the first lacked in the disgusting factor it promised and the appearances of not one but TWO characters from Desperate Housewives did make me chuckle and they played their parts well but it doesn't stop it from being a bad film. If this was executed differently it could have been rather brilliant just like the first film. But it wasn't and it isn't. It's yet another teen horror film that will be seeing bargain bins around the world in a few years. 410".

	schema:reviewBody "Most horror sequels are entertaining but completely unnecessary. Hostel 2 justifies it's existence by elaborating on things fans were curious about and creating a very different tone while keeping the flavor of the original. Hostel bordered on Rated R teen comedy before switching gears to horrorthriller. This sequel is largely a pitch black darkest of dark comedy. The movie certainly contains horror but it is in the form of individual scenes and there is even an overall sense of doom that hovers over the eventual victims that the first movie never had in it's first act. Even still the movie is largely a dark comedy very aware of it's own ability to create uncomfortable laughter. In my opinion Hostel 2 is a fun movie that delivers the goods and never feels like a rehash. That's all anyone can ask of a sequel.One last bit on it's running time. While every summer blockbuster tries to come in at about 155 min. Hostel 2 comes in at a shade over 90. It's refreshing leaving a movie wanting more rather than thanking Christ the movie is finally over.".

In the previous films Ryan was presented as a family man and played by Alex Baldwin and Harrison Ford. This time around we are asked to accept a Ryan who is 25 years younger Ben Affleck unmarried and a nerdy wet behind the ears CIA historian. The age difference would have been more believable had the film been set in 1973 when the story begins rather than the present. Anyway the story is about a disgruntled exNazi Dressler Alan Bates who acquires a nuclear device and plans to instigate a war between the USA and Russia and then take over when the super powers destroy each other. The new Russian President Nemerov Ciaran Hinds is set up by Dressler to be blamed for a nuculear attack which wipes out a large part of Baltimore. U.S. President Fowler James Cromwell calls in the CIA headed by William Cabot Morgan Freeman.  Cabot enlists the aide of historian Jack Ryan Affleck because Ryan has done a thorough study on Nemerov. Ryan believes the Russian to be innocent even though all around him believe him guilty. As each side prepares to launch their respective missles Ryan and CIA Operative John Clark Liev Schrieber are busily gathering information and Ryan is racing against the clock to convince Fowler of Nemenov's innocence. Affleck tries his best to make us forget Harrison Ford but to no avail. He simply cannot be taken seriously as the man who holds the world's fate in his hands. Freeman is excellent as always and Cromwell and Hinds stand out as the two world leaders. Bates makes a nasty villain and Schrieber is good as the mysterious man with a past Clark. Bridget Moynahan appears as Affleck's love interest and future wife. The real star of the picture are the special effects. The nuclear explosion is realistic and believable and the attack on the aircraft carrier is equally good. I hope that in the next Jack Ryan movie he is portrayed by someone who is at least old enough to shave.".

Adviser and a possible power struggle on the Russian government is completely left out.And how come that you can link without any problem from a Palm in the middle of a burned city?";

	schema:headline " Great book horrible HORRIBLE adaptation SPOILERS";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me preface my comments by saying that I loved Clancy's book when I first read it ten years ago.  It was a gripping pageturner and a marvelously intricate work building suspense in layers.  I've since reread it several times.I realistically expected that elements of the massive tome would have to be changed or condensed for the screen version.  But so much is changed and so many critical elements removed that it hardly resembles its novel origins. As a result I find it difficult to believe that Tom Clancy had much creative control over this effort though he's credited as Executive Producer.First for some inexplicable reason this movie jumps away from previous Clancy continuity by completely revamping the character of Jack Ryan. Rather than a middle aged CIA administrator Ryan is now a young handsome PhD with little Washington experience.  Apparently this is to boost the chickflick quotient of this outing as it adds nothing tangible to the film and only detracts from the continuity that had been built to this point.  There's even a scene where Kathy is asked how cute Ryan is on a 110 scale and she says a 12.  Ugh! They had time to include this garbage yet skip vital character development later in the film?Yet even worse this Ryan is the UberRyan.  Yes the man is everywhere and involved in virtually every action sequence in the film.  He finds the bomb lab in Russia and saves Clark CLARK for crying out loud shouldn't it be the OTHER way around??? races to Baltimore in a helicopter to warn President Fowlerwho in yet another huge change is caught in the blast himself he gets caught in the nuclear blastand hardly gets his hair mussed how cliche! he personally sifts through the rubble of Baltimore for evidence another inexplicable change as Denver was the city nuked in the book then goes on for a cliched confrontation with the terrorists who are VERY poorly developed characterwise totally unlike the book mano y mano in a darkened Baltimore warehouse.   Oh and I almost forgot there was the obligatory and oh so overused Hollywood death scene where Ryan again Ryan personally kneels at the bed of Morgan Freeman as he expires in a tearful sequence.  Yes it was painful but not in the way intended.I thought Clancy's books sometimes stretched the believablity of Ryan's capabilities to the breaking point yet this goes way beyond anything Clancy has previously done.   It's SuperRyan to the rescue more 007 than distinguished cerebral CIA analyst even though he supposedly had little if any experience in espionage forensics or any of that.  It is very cliched and very tiresome to watch at least for anyone that's actually read the books.One of the best parts of the novel was the realism.  Reading it you really believed that the plot Clancy put in motion could occur.  Not this movie. Believable Islamic terrorists were replaced with cartoonish middleaged white european neoNazis who make stock Hitlerloving speeches that any avid moviegoer has heard a million times before.  Dr. Evil would love these guys.  They even got to kill one of their own rank ala Dr. Evil after he experienced the convenient cinematic crisis of concience.  You could see it coming a mile away!  I guess that's so we can understand these men are serious and mean businessOh and on the subject of business since the typical european NeoNazi is young skinheaded devoted but not terribly affluent these Nazis were conveniently welltodo businessmen with the financial assets and experience to put their scheme in motion.  Is this Tom Clancy or James Bond?  I guess its not politically correct to feature the actual type of real world Middle Eastern gentlemen with the aid of foreign government sponsorship who even now are striving again in reality to make weapons of mass destruction to use against us?  I guess its always safe to once again bash caucasian conservativeappearing men in business suits.  Whatever the reason its another major plot element from the book down the tubes.On the subject of the bomb  there was a great deal of detail in the book about the bomb that was completely overlooked in the movie.  For example in the book the bomb was originally intended to be a multistage ie HYDROGEN bomb.  It fizzled.  The original yield was overestimated by twenty fold by military analysts because of reflection of the snow and other factors. The President's advisors didn't think terrorists could build a multistage weapon thus the suspicion was immediately upon the Russians. It was only after frantic detective work that the true yield of the bomb was discovered and it put Ryan on the proper track AND gave him leverage to help defuse the situationno pun intended.  It's a common worry that terrorist groups might get ahold of a low yield fission suitcase bombs yet right from the start in the movie no one including the President suspects terrorists!Another fond memory I have of the book is that Clancy took us to the very brink of Armageddon where the US and Russia were nearly in a shooting war because of the misinterpreted size of the bomb and the tank battle that the German terrorists cause to happen in Berlin.  Yet here the Russians attack and virtually destroy a US nuclear carrier we bomb a Russian airbase and we're still standing at that brink.  Somehow I think if events got that far there'd be no turning back.  Clancy seemed to know that when he wrote the book  he seems to have forgotten it here though.These are just a few of the major problems with this film.  The pacing is bad  one minute the bomb is still being constructed and a few minutes later its already placed in Baltimore and about to explode with the cliche of Ryan hot on the trail trying to warn the President.  In the book the bomb catches everyone completely offguard but not here ANOTHER irritating change.  There is also very little character development the President's motivations are poorly understood the paranoia of Fowler over the new Russian President's motives was poorly developed etc etc.Avoid it if you can.  I turned the last 5 minutes off it was so bad.".

	schema:reviewBody "The only thing you have to know about this film is that it has the Super Bowl taking place in Baltimore. That's right. Super Bowl. Baltimore. That tells you how much thought was put into this giant piece of crap.The plot involves neoNazi's who obtain an Israeli nuclear bomb from an Israeli plane that was shot down in the 1973 Yom Kippur war and use Russian nuclear scientists to refurbish it and then ship it to Baltimore just in time for the Super Bowl to try to blow up the President of the US.The Nazi's goal is to trick the US into thinking the Russians carried out the attack hopefully starting a nuclear war which then allows the neoNazi's to do what exactly? Take over the smoldering remains of the earth? The movie never adequately explains the rationale behind their actions since their actions are completely selfdefeating. A nuclear exchange between the US and Russia would destroy most of the Western World leaving precious little left for the Nazi's to rule over. In the novel Islamic terrorists were the bad guys which makes sense since they don't care if they live or die and because the Middle East would be relatively unaffected by a nuclear war between Russia and the US. Changing the villains to Nazi's sends this movie into fantasyland.Ben Affleck is wrong as Jack Ryan  he's just too much of a sarcastic punk. You can't buy him as the CIA analyst turned action hero. The rest of the cast is good but most of the characters are complete idiots. Its hard to believe that the President of the US and the Premier of Russia wouldn't talk to each other over the telephone during an international crisis but in this movie they email each other over AOL like a couple of adulterers.According to the trivia Harrison Ford and Wolfgang Peterson Director of Air Force One turned down the opportunity to participate in this fiasco. They were smart to do so since there was nothing to gain but scorn for having any part in this horrible horrible movie.".

It is a reasonably well implemented thriller. Not great but worth seeing.However the book is about Arab terrorists performing terrorist acts by means of thermonuclear devices causing the two superpowers to come to the brink of a nuclear war. The movie has replaced this foe with some nonsense story about emerging neoNazis wanting to take over the world. This is just utter rubbish. It is obviously a political decision by some asshole not wanting to upset the Arab community so he picks a safe bad guy instead. The speech where the head Nazi compares themselves with a virus was just unintelligent writing and painful to watch.Nazis are obvious bad guys and can be put to good use in movies just as communists and Muslim terrorists and a whole bunch of other groups but not when the original material uses another much more logical foe. The original foes in the book would have some force behind them in the radical Muslim community that made their plans for world takeover after the superpowers had annihilated each other at least somewhat plausible. If you ignore minor details like that there would really not be much to take over after a barrage of nuclear missiles from USA and Russian of course. But a few twisted old Nazis that sits in hiding in dark rooms cooking together this hairbrained scheme? No way! I am sad to say that whoever asshole that decided to rewrite the main adversary of this movie ruined it totally for me. I am really happy that I never watched it when it came out in the theaters but instead watched it in a sense for free on my Netflix subscription.".

The film is a prequel to the other Jack Ryan films while the novel was a sequel to the other books.

In the film a modernage Hitler is attempting to begin turmoil between Russia and the U.S. with the nuke  there are no arabs. Also in the novel the way the bomb was sneaked into the superbowl was much more interesting than the method they used in the film. Also in the book Morgan Freeman's character was a dumb man who hid throughout the novel. In the film he's a hero. There's countless other things that don't really matter but still made me a bit disappointed in the film.

The film was in no way awful and is the best Tom Clancy movie to date but it's still not as good as the book.3.55 stars John Ulmer";

Sure some scenes are changed and others unfortunately left out. But being that the book is only based on the story it is NOT GOINT TO BE the story itself. Somethings don't translate well on screen. A book is several hundred pages long. A movie two hours and they can't very well put every detail from the book into the movie. I saw the film and thought it was good. I also saw all the other Clancy films and enjoyed them for what they were. Maybe not so good by comparison to the book but never the less good for what they were.

	schema:reviewBody "Sum of All Fears is an enjoyable thriller and the type of movie the Hollywood studios have always been good at making. It's slick expensivelooking wellacted and two hours of farfetched fun. Ben Affleck plays CIA Agent and superman Jack Ryan PhD. Ryan is a former marine linguist and allround polymath who saves the world from impending disaster. Affleck is youthful and convincing as Ryan and makes him seem fallible and likable. Ryan becomes a confidant of the wise and sensible CIA Director Bill Cabot Morgan Freeman and acquires a beautiful and successful girlfriend Bridget Moynahan who believes he's a historian. The plot is complicated and involves a new Russian leader Ciaran Hands who spouts antiU.S. rhetoric. A Russian chemical attack on Chechnya increases the tension between the two countries. An Israeli atomic bomb is found in the Egyption deserta relic of the 1973 ArabIsraeli conflict. NeoNazi terrorists led by Alan Bates want to provoke a nuclear conflict between America and Russia. They acquire the bomb from a South African arms dealer and explode it in Baltimore. The U.S. blames the Russians and the two countries are about to commence allout nuclear war until Ryan works out what is happening and it all ends happily. The message is that the new Russian leaders are reasonable men signifying that the world has moved on from the Commie bashing flicks of the 1980s.The idea of a terrorist nuclear attack is topical but unfortunately the NeoNazi villains seem very 1970s. The film has good character actors in supporting roles e.g. Liev Schrieber James Cromwell. I much prefer Afflek's Ryan to that of the 52 yearold Harrison Ford who by 1994's Clear and Present Danger seemed too old and surly for the role.".

This movie doesn't even go that far.The real fun is how many clueless people say wow what a great movie and don't even begin to realize what they're really missing by not PICKING UP A DAMN BOOK EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE!!!Hollywood continue to play down to the lowest common denominator if you must but leave the worthwhile stuff in life alone for those of us that can still read.

	schema:reviewBody "After reading several negative reviews I was shocked when I finally saw The sum of all fears'. I simply LOVED this movie . It was totally thrilling. It had all the ingredients of a great adventure and to top it off it was visually poetic and emotionally stirring. I never read the book this is based on and I'm  not a Tom Clancy fan. I came into this movie expecting to hate it because I have hated all the other films in the Jack Ryan series. They were too dry and technical lacking immediacy or emotion and they felt more like lectures on the way government works and how the military operates than movies. Those films were made for Tom Clancy fans. The sum of all fears was made for a different audience which is unfortunate since it is based on one of his novels. There is no doubt that it crosses the line into fantasy several times for dramatic effect. Things happen that probably wouldn't happen in real life. People do things that are impossibly heroic and unrealistic. I'm convinced this is why Clancy fans hate this adaptation.  For me these traits considered flaws by many people helped free the movie from the constraints of absolute realism allowing it to become more poetic and powerful than it ever could be otherwise.Director Phil Alden Robinson deserves most of the praise for this film. He's a new name for me but looking at his filmography it was interesting to see that he was the writer and director  for field of dreams another film that I totally loved.  He was a very odd choice to helm this film because field of dreams is a bizarre movie where reality and fantasy meet head on. It's an ultra surreal American fairy tale. It's like a happy David Lynch film or a Luis Buuel film with a wholesome center. This is not the kind of director you would normally choose to make a movie like the sum of all fears. The clash between the ultra realism of Clancy's material and Robinson's willingness to forgo realism in favor of  dreamy fairy tale lyricism creates a wonderful sense of vibrancy that I would never have anticipated.After seeing the sum of all fears I am now convinced that Robinson will go on to make a huge name for himself. He is a truly gifted director with an incredible ability to communicate through images. I can't wait to see his next film. If field of dreams is any indication he is just good a writer as he is as a director and I am excited to see what other sorts of ideas he might produce.The movie also has tremendous performances by Morgan Freeman and surprisingly Ben Affleck. He's way to young to play Jack Ryan so he doesn't even try. The Jack Ryan in this movie is a reinvented character. He's basically a young guy with the mentality of an idealist  working his way up in the CIA while trying to juggle a bachelors social life. For me he works in this film and he plays that kind of character perfectly.The bottom line is this If you love Tom Clancy and you've read every one of his books  you're probably going to hate this movie. If you have never read the book and have no real interest in Clancy's work you'll probably at least enjoy it. If your like me and you don't mind films that let drama interfere with rationality you'll probably love it.".

Morgan Freeman also didn't seem to have a solid cast in this movie.The story was fairly captivating however Cromwell was good to watch as always and Morgan Freeman did his best given the role Overall worth a rent but probably not a buy guys.

Morgan Freeman also didn't seem to have a solid cast in this movie.The story was fairly captivating however Cromwell was good to watch as always and Morgan Freeman did his best given the role Overall worth a rent but probably not a buy guys. Catch it on TV if you can and you will be probably entertained for that night.710";

	schema:reviewBody "The entire Jack Ryan franchise has been so royally screwed up it just makes no sense. The sequence of Patriot Games Hunt for Red October Cardinal of the Kremlin book only Clear and Present Danger and the Sum of All Fears all build upon each other not to mention the books Debt of Honor Executive Decisions and The Bear and the Dragon which follow. If you have seen the movies my guess is you have no personal interest in Jack Ryan's character whatsoever and don't really see how any of them are related. With no interest in the main character I see little that would interest me in the plot  and therefore the film  let alone the franchise. This isn't just a the book was so much better than the movie rant. This movie sucks. The original book wraps such incredible tension into the characters as they all  unknowingly  approach the inevitable moment. There is no preconceived knowledge of what is about to happen. This movie reduces that tension on the stereotypical can you hear me now? poor cell phone connection to meaningless drivel with Affleck's moronic the bomb is in playI repeatthe bomb  is  IN  PLAY!!!. There was more plot in Transformers Dark of the Moon  and that's saying something.The real story is meant to revolve around how the characters react to what happens according to each's preconceptions and personal shortcomings and the larger ramifications those reactions have to the government the country the world. The heroism results from the actions taken by a desperate broken man who acts with complete personal disregard ... to save the very system that has deliberately broken him. The psychological effect of the key moment in this story and the desperation that ensues in its aftermath are nonexistent in this movie.Do yourself a favor  read the books in order. Then realize that they were written before 911 before biological attack scares stock marketcyberattacks before Iraq before the current tension with Iran before what doesn't seem to be too far off into the horizon with China. Starting with Clear and Present Danger it will seriously freak you out to see that some 20 years ago Clancy predicted many of the traumatic major world events that have occurred in the past decade and may yet be unfolding in the near future. Not that I walk around wearing a tin foil hat but seriously it's freaky.OK I guess this is a the book is so much better than the movie rant after all.".

It may be a little disturbing however to some people after 911. If this had been released before then it would have been seen as just another Cold War movie.  It's very welldone but no great shakes...the attack scenes are frightening to watch.Affleck is very good as Ryan.  He's young goodlooking intelligent and Affleck's lowkey acting fits the Ryan role like a glove.  Morgan Freeman shows up again as a mentor to Ryan.  Nothing against Freeman but hasn't he played this role once too often?  Also John Cromwell is excellent as the president completely covering his British accent.So an enjoyable drama...unless 911 really hit you close to home.  If it did avoid this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jack Ryan's entry with lots of noisy action  thrills  chills  tension and amazing thriller . This blockbuster is an acceptable adaptation of the novel by Tom Clancy  companion to other prior renditions . The title is paraphrased from a Winston Churchill speech Why you can take the most gallant sailor the most intrepid airman or the most audacious soldier put them at a table together  what do you get? The sum of their fears. It deals with CIA analyst Jack Ryan Ben Affleck along with a ranking member Morgan Freeman of Presidential administration must thwart the plans of a terrorist faction that threatens to induce a catastrophic conflict between the United States and Russia's newly elected president by detonating a nuclear weapon at a football game in Baltimore. As there are 27000 Nuclear Weapons and One Is Missing . Now Ryan goes back in action for the most vital assignment of his life  to save the President James Cromwell and the nation .Stirring outing filled with emotion  suspense  chills  twisted intrigue and extraordinary nailbiting action scenes . This film is a prequel to the others in the Jack Ryan series . The 'Harrison Ford' films are direct followups to The hunt for Red October 1990 despite the recast of Alec Baldwin's role . Nevertheless in this film we see Jack Ryan meet John Clark something which also happens in Clear and present danger 1994 . Therefore this film might be best understood as a reboot of the Jack Ryan series . Interesting screenplay plenty of twists and thrills by Paul Attanasio and Daniel Pyne . However  the filmmaker changed the villains from Islamic extremists  in the novel  to NeoNazis  this was done because prior to the 11 September 2001 attacks he did not believe Arab terrorists could plausibly accomplish all that was necessary for the plot to work on film . Good production design  in fact  the CIA scenes were filmed at the actual CIA headquarters  this was one of the times the CIA had ever done such a thing . And this was the first American film unit to enter the Kremlin  though Red Heat 1988 was the first American unit to film in Moscow . The spectacular Super Bowl scene takes place in Baltimore  the two teams playing in the game are portrayed by the Toronto Argonauts and the Montreal Alouettes . Real U. S. Marines along with two Marine Corps CH53E Super Stallion helicopters were used for the sequence of rescuing Fowler from the wrecked motorcade . The picture has a very good support cast who gives excellent performances such as James Cromwell as President Fowler  Bruce McGill as National Security Adviser  John Beasley as General Lasseter  Philip Baker Hall as Defense Secretary  Joseph Sommer as Senator  Michael Byrne  Liev Schreiber  Alan Bates  SvenOle Thorsen  Ron Rifkin  Colm Feore and special mention to Ciaran Hinds as Russia President . Spectacular musical score fitting to action and suspense by maestro veteran Jerry Goldsmith . Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by John Lindley . The picture is well directed by Phil Alden Robinson  though Philip Noyce director of previous entries was offered to direct but turned it down and Wolfgang Petersen was also offered the chance to direct but declined.This blockbuster is an entertaining adaptation of the novel by Tom Clancy  companion to The hunt for Red October by John MacTiernan with Alec Balwin and Sean Connery  followed by Patriot games 1992 by Philip Noyce with Harrison Ford taking over the role of Ryan from Alec Baldwin and again Clear and present danger1994 by Philip Noyce with Harrison Ford and Anne Archer . Then Harrison Ford dropped out of reprising the role of Jack Ryan because he and director Phillip Noyce could not agree on the script and Noyce ended up dropping out of the film as well. And finally  Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit 2014 by Kenneth Brannagh with Chris Pine as Jack Ryan  Keira Knightley and Kevin Costner .".
