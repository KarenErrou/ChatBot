And through the course of the film one group after another chases the reporter after he meets with the Nazi. The problem is with all these folks trying to capture him he can't help them because the Nazi's message is so vague he has no idea what it meant! I loved this idea. And when you finally learn how his uncle is THE keythis was brilliant!! But in the meantime yuck! Ron Silver was a good actorbut here he is totally miscast. The film called for a man who was a combination of James Bond and the Rockbut Silver was all wrong.

Yet inexplicably Silver's character won't accept help from anyone and yet he manages to come out unscathed by the end of the movie!!! In between there are some other insane moments such as sneaking him into the embassy in a VW trunk when the place is surrounded by police who are told to allow NO ONE inside as well as the women who throw themselves at this very ordinary looking man....and MANY MANY other insane moments. With a bit of a rewrite such as making the reporter an exCIA agent or a god would have helped and plugging up holes it would have made a dandy filmperhaps capable of earning an 8 or more. Instead it's a dumb film with a few great moments.I should repeat that my wife and uncle were far more charitable than I was. When they asked me what I thought of the film I found I was becoming angryangry because the film SHOULD have been better and sucked me inonly to disappoint again and again. My wife felt it was fun schlock. My uncle thought he could have used his time better sleeping in his hammock. I felt it was a waste of my life and I felt stupider as a result of having seen it.

	schema:headline " A Genuine OldFashioned International Thriller!";
	schema:reviewBody "I admit to having found The White Raven a good little film. A return to the sort of Blist thrillers studios used to churn out on a regular basis. The title refers to an enormous diamond hidden during World War II. The last man to know of its whereabouts played with barely restrained menace by the imposing Hannes Jaenicke is in a European prison and is dying. He reveals a vital clue to Tully Windsor a reporter for the Christian Science Monitor and Windsor suddenly finds himself the target of several groups competing for possession of the diamond.No The White Raven definitely wasn't Foreign Correspondent or Ministry of Fear or even Beach Blanket Bingo. But thanks to directors Jakub Rucinski and Andrew Stevens it carried enough nice touches to make at least one viewing a worthwhile pursuit.Chief among these was the late Ron Silver as Tully Windsor. After a career of playing slimy villains Silver took on a heroic role and made it pay off. His usually sinister features easily metamorphosed into a cool calculating James Bondlike expression and he moved from crusading reporter to MAC10 wielding hero without missing a beat.Silver was one of a small handful of domestically recognizable faces within the cast of the film. Elizabeth Shepherd especially shone as Hannah Rothschild one of the people hunting for the White Raven. She wore the matronly European powerbroker role well reminding us that she was originally considered for the role of Mrs. Peel in The Avengers.Elsewhere Roy Scheider practically slept through his role of Silver's boss within the Christian Science Monitor. Along with Scheider there was Doug Lennox as a somewhat stereotypical corrupt American military officer. The remaining cast of The White Raven read like an Eastern European phone directory which was actually one of the film's major strengths. After years of enduring small films continually set in either New York City or Los Angeles it was refreshing to encounter new faces and foreign locales. I had mentioned James Bond earlier. In many ways The White Raven stands as sort of a James Bond film with a reduced budget.Back to the cast. I had already mentioned Hannes Jaenicke playing Hannibal Lector as a WWE wrestler. There was also Jack Recknitz as one of those former Nazi concentration camp guards who miraculously managed to take on a highlevel Eastern European law enforcement job after the war. Besides these worthies we also had Joanna Pacula . . . veteran of numerous television and film appearances . . . as a sculptress who becomes involved in the plot and subsequently takes on the role of romantic interest for Silver. She does well especially since she has to make the audience suspect that Not Everything Is As It Seems Here.Which brings us back to one of the problems of the film. Michael Blodgett's adaptation of his book tends to confuse whoever we're supposed to be rooting for in the course of the picture. It becomes difficult for Silver's character and by default the audience to identify positively with anyone because we're never sure who is with who at any one point. Was Recknitz's character associated with the Parisbased group run by Elizabeth Shepherd? Was Lennox working independently? Was Balboa fond of bananas? Who put the bomp in the bompshubompshubomp? Who is John Galt? The situation isn't helped by the fact that people end up being killed left and right to the point where keeping a scorecard might be handy. You watch the film and almost wish someone would live longer than five minutes simply so that they could deliver some useful information. And speaking of action while parts of it did work in the film others didn't succeed as well. For instance while I was aware that Silver was the hero of the picture I felt he managed to escape too easily from many of the tense situations he found himself in. Since he wasn't going up against Imperial Stormtroopers from Star Wars perhaps the worst shots and stupidest searchers in all of motion pictures then the average viewer could be forgiven for raising an eyebrow. In one instance Silver manages to escape a group of pursuers through the simple act of hiding in a doorway and standing still . . . which would've worked if he'd been Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton but he wasn't. Rucinski and Stevens did an overall remarkable job with what they had but what the film needed for such scenes was a director like John McTiernan someone who has a feel for actually inflicting suffering on a hero and setting up genuine fear for his survival.But the pendulum swings both ways and the film builds nicely in other directions. Especially at the denouement when the location of the diamond is finally revealed as well as revealing how a large diamond can be smuggled out of a Nazi concentration camp. As with many other jewels The White Raven possessed its own unique flaws but it also managed to occasionally shine brightly.".

	onyx:emotionText "I admit to having found The White Raven a good little film. A return to the sort of Blist thrillers studios used to churn out on a regular basis. The title refers to an enormous diamond hidden during World War II. The last man to know of its whereabouts played with barely restrained menace by the imposing Hannes Jaenicke is in a European prison and is dying. He reveals a vital clue to Tully Windsor a reporter for the Christian Science Monitor and Windsor suddenly finds himself the target of several groups competing for possession of the diamond.No The White Raven definitely wasn't Foreign Correspondent or Ministry of Fear or even Beach Blanket Bingo. But thanks to directors Jakub Rucinski and Andrew Stevens it carried enough nice touches to make at least one viewing a worthwhile pursuit.Chief among these was the late Ron Silver as Tully Windsor. After a career of playing slimy villains Silver took on a heroic role and made it pay off. His usually sinister features easily metamorphosed into a cool calculating James Bondlike expression and he moved from crusading reporter to MAC10 wielding hero without missing a beat.Silver was one of a small handful of domestically recognizable faces within the cast of the film. Elizabeth Shepherd especially shone as Hannah Rothschild one of the people hunting for the White Raven. She wore the matronly European powerbroker role well reminding us that she was originally considered for the role of Mrs. Peel in The Avengers.Elsewhere Roy Scheider practically slept through his role of Silver's boss within the Christian Science Monitor. Along with Scheider there was Doug Lennox as a somewhat stereotypical corrupt American military officer. The remaining cast of The White Raven read like an Eastern European phone directory which was actually one of the film's major strengths. After years of enduring small films continually set in either New York City or Los Angeles it was refreshing to encounter new faces and foreign locales. I had mentioned James Bond earlier. In many ways The White Raven stands as sort of a James Bond film with a reduced budget.Back to the cast. I had already mentioned Hannes Jaenicke playing Hannibal Lector as a WWE wrestler. There was also Jack Recknitz as one of those former Nazi concentration camp guards who miraculously managed to take on a highlevel Eastern European law enforcement job after the war. Besides these worthies we also had Joanna Pacula . . . veteran of numerous television and film appearances . . . as a sculptress who becomes involved in the plot and subsequently takes on the role of romantic interest for Silver.

They can make a James Bond type of film in which the hero will keep falling into traps most terrible from which he will miraculously escape with his life and tie undisturbed  which is quite OK because we all know in advance that he is indestructible. Or they can make a realistic movie in which the hero is very much destructible and has to depend solely on his wits and on some more or less sympathetic people to survive  if he does survive at all we can never be sure.And then there is the third type which tries to combine the first two  which seems to be a sure formula for disaster. The White Raven is of course just one of many such movies which may start as this one does quite decently in the realistic direction and then suddenly turn around becoming more and more laughable right to the last deus ex machina in this case one of the most stupid I have ever seen.As such the movie could perhaps be enjoyed as an unintentional parody if it were not for repeatedly ghoulish scenes which make one think that its authors are fetishists of a rather unpleasant sort and only to their kind can The White Raven be safely recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the finest political movies ever done. And if he doesn't decide to return to the screen post his 90th birthday it is a fitting swan song to the career of Richard Widmark.James Spader's Tim Gerrity and John Cusack's Peter Burton meet on the first day of law school and get assigned to be roommates. The film follows the career paths each take the same woman they both are involved with and the values each takes from his background and develops along the way.Spader is the idealistic upper middle class kid who is born to a tradition of public service and attracted by the idealism of it. He's good in his part but it's John Cusack's portrayal that really drives this film.Driven is the word for it that is exactly what Peter Burton is. He's from a lower middle class background and he's desperate to escape. In fact he's invented a background for himself that's phony and the scene where that is revealed is one of the movie's high points. I will not say any more.I've known a few Peter Burtons in my time too. Desperate to succeed at any price willing to sacrifice friends and family to do it. It's what makes John Cusack's performance so real for me. I think it is the finest thing he's ever done on film.Richard Widmark plays United States Senator Joseph Stiles a Yankee blue blood type to the manor born. Harry Carey Jr. in his memoir In the Company of Heroes described Widmark as one of the smartest and most literate men he's ever encountered a man able to talk intelligently on a variety of subjects. Because of that I have to believe that this role must have been a personal favorite.The best scene in the movie is when Cusack who Widmark has made a protg of essentially blackmails Widmark into supporting Cusack for an open Congressional seat. Widmark is a politician and one who has he himself describes can play hardball if needed. But he's also there to try and do some good. He has to give into the blackmail for reasons I won't go into but he does rip open the character of Cusack in some unforgettable dialog.I would also commend to other actors in this. Mandy Patinkin who plays an unscrupulous businessmanracketeer with an understated malevolence and Paul Guilfoyle who is Widmark's chief of staff who has Cusack's number but is unable to do anything about it.I'm surprised that no Oscar nods came with this film especially for Widmark as a supporting actor. I couldn't give this film a higher recommendation.".

He's good in his part but it's John Cusack's portrayal that really drives this film.Driven is the word for it that is exactly what Peter Burton is. He's from a lower middle class background and he's desperate to escape. In fact he's invented a background for himself that's phony and the scene where that is revealed is one of the movie's high points. I will not say any more.I've known a few Peter Burtons in my time too. Desperate to succeed at any price willing to sacrifice friends and family to do it. It's what makes John Cusack's performance so real for me. I think it is the finest thing he's ever done on film.Richard Widmark plays United States Senator Joseph Stiles a Yankee blue blood type to the manor born. Harry Carey Jr. in his memoir In the Company of Heroes described Widmark as one of the smartest and most literate men he's ever encountered a man able to talk intelligently on a variety of subjects. Because of that I have to believe that this role must have been a personal favorite.The best scene in the movie is when Cusack who Widmark has made a protg of essentially blackmails Widmark into supporting Cusack for an open Congressional seat. Widmark is a politician and one who has he himself describes can play hardball if needed. But he's also there to try and do some good. He has to give into the blackmail for reasons I won't go into but he does rip open the character of Cusack in some unforgettable dialog.I would also commend to other actors in this. Mandy Patinkin who plays an unscrupulous businessmanracketeer with an understated malevolence and Paul Guilfoyle who is Widmark's chief of staff who has Cusack's number but is unable to do anything about it.I'm surprised that no Oscar nods came with this film especially for Widmark as a supporting actor. I couldn't give this film a higher recommendation.";

This movie demonstrates that the lust for power if unchecked corrupts. That following Christmas my friend's family gave me TRUE COLORS as a Christmas gift.

For me it's a tossup between James Spader and Anthony Michael Hall.John Cusack was mesmerizing back in his earlydays. He was a teenager but he looked sounded and acted very adult for his age. The Sure Thing put him on the map and Say Anything... made him a household name.But while Crowe's Say Anything... was obviously a great movie it was both a blessing and a curse for Cusack who has rarely played anything else in his career. I know I know. He's been in countless other movies. But a rose by any other name... His character no matter what the movie is essentially always Lloyd Dobbler.Spader sometimes played other types besides the oily Steff from Pretty in Pink. His typecastbreaking turn came when he played the lead in this movie. But I know Cusack can do more. I keep waiting for him to. Which was one of my guilty pleasures of this movie.The story and plot are the right out of the old fable about the rich man and the poor man who come together and create something special... and then the rich man betrays the poor man and casts him aside. And the poor man plots to take revenge...Another big twist that True Colors has is it's twist in typecasting. Cusack specializes in playing sharp calculated smarterthanaverage teenager... who's heartbroken and devastated... and is desperately trying to win back the girl. Here Cusack plays a character who's as smart as the heroes he usually plays though here he uses his intellectual gifts for evil instead of good. His goal is usually to win the girl's heart. Here he betrays the girl and his close friend in order to get what he wants.And Spader usually plays blueblooded silverspoon fed upperclass yuppie scummy villains. Here he's still a rich blueblooded yuppie. But a hero who uses his financial connections to right wrongs and do just.The two meet the first day of law school where there's a fenderbender and brief scuffle. Cusack angrily attacks Spader violently and blames him for the whole thing and the two have to be pulled apart. Later on things get worse as they discover... their assigned to be roommates. Cusack smooths things over by admitting the whole thing was his fault. You'll see why.Afterwords the two form a fast friendship and Spader even uses his financial backgrounds and connections to help Cusack out. Later we find out that Cusack is lying about his background to fit in and the payoff feels lifted out of a soppy moralizing and insipid sitcom where today's moral is... If you have to be someone else to get a friend then they're really not your friend.Richard Widmark is great as well as the ailing senator who sees potential and ambition in Cusack after he sees what looks like Cusack doing him a favor little realizing how dangerous Cusack is. Spader girlfriend considers breaking off the relationship for Cusack who can keep her bringing in big cash. She doesn't realize that Cusack is willing to betray her too in order to get what he wants.One of the major problems is that their true colors are obvious from the beginning. Cusack is clearly someone not to trust from the start and Spader all but actually walks on water. Another is that the movie is too thin. There isn't enough entry.The movie... skims too much of the surface. And Spader's big plan and the finale is pretty tacked on.The movie aspires to be a movie like Patriot Games or Citizen Kane. But everything is routine and predictable and there are precious few new touches to this tired formula. If screenwriter Kevin Wade could've given the script a bit more depth and discovery into these characters and done a little more with the formula this could have really been something special. The cast does what it can but inevitably a good cast can only take a movie so far. Still it's worth seeing just for Cusack turn towards the dark side and Spader as a yuppie with heart.Oh well...Filled With Personal Politics Dane Youssef".

They hit it off from a small automobile accident pardon the pun and progressed from minor adversaries to best of friends. Until Peter's ambition gets the better of him as he aims to become Congressman in 10 years.From the start we see a flip side to Peter's goodytwoshoes character. He always has something to hide and has an ulterior motive to things that he does. He tells little white lies to get his way and has a siege mentality that it's always him versus Them. He gets envious of Tim's seemingly good life and coverts Tim's girlfriend Diana who is the daughter of a Senator. And thus begins the Kane and Abel like story of betrayals and counter betrayals between the two men.Peter gets involved with the mob in his bid to become elected while Tim working for the Justice Department volunteers himself to get the dirt on Peter. It's always about the girl or is it? And as Tim puts it aptly only somebody close to you can do the most damage. They know your secrets and best of all they have your trust. It's true though if you think carefully about it the best person to ruin you reputation etc is none other than the person you trust the most. Again looking at the two characters there is no right or wrong it all depends on the methods one uses to achieve one's goals.It's also an interesting look at the shady dealings of politics of allegiances made because of donations or help to campaign funding of owing favors to those who voted in favor of you. Things are never that simple and the mantra shared by both characters are so long as you don't get caught.John Cusack has got this charismatic charm and in this film uses it well as he seeks to become a politician you have to have charisma as you deliver those speeches. James Spader too holds his own as the naive Tim who slowly discovers betrayal and decides to turn the tables against the hunter. Fans of John Cusack you must catch this!

	schema:reviewBody "This middling little movie is about a lot of things. Friendship politics betrayal ambition classism and idealism are just a few. What it is about more than anything else however is how its two main characters are totally not gay.Peter Burton and Tim Gerrity John Cusack and James Spader start out as law school roommates. Peter is a charismatic young man on the move reinventing himself as he goes while Tim is the sort of doggedly earnest dogooder who disdains things like money and power the way only a rich man's son can. Diana Imogen Stubbs is the Senator's daughter who comes between them. She starts out with Tim but grows weary of his desire for the small life and transfers her attentions to Peter and his big dreams. And the fact that both guys get involved with the same girl proves they are totally not gay.Eventually Tim ends up in the Department of Justice and Peter joins the staff of Diana's father Richard Widmark angling constantly for his own advancement. Always ready to cut corners Peter gets a shady developer to bankroll his run for Congress. Always full of integrity Tim sets himself the task of taking down his old friend. And remember they are totally not gay.In most respects True Colors is a fair piece of work. It's take on political and personal corruption is simultaneously a little nave and melodramatic but Cusack and Spader overcome that by giving you an early look at how they'd become such magnetic performers. Richard Widmark brings a little old Hollywood style to things and Mandy Patinkin glimmers as sleek worldly temptation. Yeah the story never gets much beyond a superficial level. However it looks good sounds good and moves along at a nice clip. This is some professionally constructed entertainment.And did I mention that Peter Burton and Tim Gerrity are totally not gay? Yes they clearly care far more about each other than either did about Diana. Sure they hang out together and vacation together and trust each other more than anyone else in the world. And of course the film's big emotional climax sees them rolling around on the floor in each other's arms. But they are totally not gay.Seriously.Not gay.At all.Really.".

It's take on political and personal corruption is simultaneously a little nave and melodramatic but Cusack and Spader overcome that by giving you an early look at how they'd become such magnetic performers. Richard Widmark brings a little old Hollywood style to things and Mandy Patinkin glimmers as sleek worldly temptation. Yeah the story never gets much beyond a superficial level. However it looks good sounds good and moves along at a nice clip. This is some professionally constructed entertainment.And did I mention that Peter Burton and Tim Gerrity are totally not gay? Yes they clearly care far more about each other than either did about Diana. Sure they hang out together and vacation together and trust each other more than anyone else in the world. And of course the film's big emotional climax sees them rolling around on the floor in each other's arms. But they are totally not gay.Seriously.Not gay.At all.Really.";

	schema:reviewBody "For cinema in general even if a story is derivative or clichd good writing can sometimes bolster an average or even subpar story. Take director Herbert Ross's True Colors staring 2 young and talented actors of that 1991 year John Cusack and James Spader. You can sniff out the storyline from a mile away. It lacked surprise and is utterly predictable. Even so it doesn't matter because despite this the filmmakers and actors keep it interesting with good lead and supporting performances and fairly good dialog and acting. Top punchline in dialog was the saying about morning dew  if you see the movie you'll know. Still there is some cheese on sound in the stodgy old 90s era Jazz background and the 80s materialism and hairdos. Overall though I liked Spader and especially Cusack who were a great pairing and full of energy. Good Movie  710 Recommended.".

But ultimately I felt like this film just couldn't pull it off.The writing and dialogue were incredibly contrived. I mean some of Ibsen's dialogue feels more natural than this. Also every scene was a distracting and incredibly bizarre set piece which they pretended to include in some casual offhand way as if to suggest what rich and powerful people do with their free time from a skiing holiday to schmoozing with politicos at Super Bowl XXIII in Miami to sport fishing off the back of a yacht. It felt like they were just plucking ideas from old episodes of that ridiculous show 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.' I'm surprised they didn't throw in a scene with characters chatting while on an African biggame safari in Tanzania.Even though I love both actors at their young ages in these roles Cusack and Spader were playing above their weight class. They looked more like little boys playing dressup and pretending to be adults.Imogen Coot or Stubble or Stubbly or Whatever was horrible. Her 'American' accent was literally all over the place to the point that they had to add a line about boarding school in England to try to excuse it. Her 'acting' was atrocious.The only thing that kept me mildly intrigued were the oodles of homoerotic overtones whether intentional or not that seemed to pop up in so many scenes between Cusack and Spader. The writers apparently didn't know how to show us that these guys were really close friends and they ended up writing scenes that just look incredibly embarrassing today. Unless they included the whole secret gay subtext on purpose.Someone on the message boards jokingly labeled this movie 'Brokeback Capitol!' Hahahaha!  I wish. Just take Imogen Idiot out of the middle of it and let our two young heroes struggle with their secret love affair vs. their conflicting political ambitions. That actually would have been a better movie.Finally it's a little sad that this was the final role of the great Richard Widmark. At least we know that when he got to yell at young James Spader for being such a cocky little sunnabitch he probably didn't have to work too hard at it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I liked this movie. I really did. Someone very close to me has a mother very much like this. It's reality folks not everyone has a sensible loving mother that grasps the role of motherhood like a duck to water. Some people remain stuck in a selfish state where they blame everyonething else for all their unhappiness and the misdirection of their lives. I'm glad there's a movie that brought that subject to light. One user said the movie is celebrating an alcoholic but that's untrue. You're watching a woman go further and further into a downward spiral of selfpitying despair and hatred for the events of her life. I also didn't find Vivi's mother to be evil but she seemed to have been desperately trying to claim her role as a respectable wife. When your husband treats horses better than you you get a little miffed. He dismissed her as his partner in life for a child she gave him so the woman aimed her frustrations at her child instead of her husband. At that time what could she have really done to the husband? He would've beaten her most likely. I appreciated the fact that Vivi was flawed. Just humanly flawed and admitted it. It sucks that people have parents like this but Sidda learned to deal with it in her own way. I'm glad it wasn't a typical reaction like drugs or promiscuity. She just accepted her mother for what she is flawed and screwed up. Motherhood doesn't make you unselfish and wellversed in letting go of your troubles. That's something you learn over time and the movie showed that. It might take 40odd years as it did them or someone could get it the moment the child is born. What I got from the film is that your parents had dreams and nightmares before you came into the picture and it takes a lot out of them to come to terms with being responsible for a life that they may or may not be ready for. I also really loved the part where Sidda begins to question her ability to be a good mother and wife. I think that resonated well. I certainly would start to wonder. Parents can screw up their kids easily I tell ya. It's not a responsibility to enter into lightly. I'm sure there were flaws like the accents of Louisiana and technical stuff but altogether the movie really reaches many levels.".

Great if they can put it behind them but it seemed ridiculous. And too bad those great yaya sisters didn't try to be as good of friends to the poor children at any point in their life as they did to the mother.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not O.K. and you're not O.K. and that's O.K. That's one of the messages of this funny profound honest film. The flawed humanity of its characters stands alongside the transcendent miracle of friendship.Young Siddalee Walker played with passion and humor by Sandra Bullock has made it as a playwright in New York. She has been successful in starting an entirely new life in the process gaining distance from her alcoholic mercurial mother back in Louisiana. She has escaped  or has she? Something makes her send a postcard home by giving an interview to Time Magazine in which she attributes her creativity to the mistreatment she suffered as a child. That serves as a call to action for her mother's lifelong friends Fionnula Flanagan Shirley Knight and the incomparable Maggie Smith wheeling an oxygen tank. It seems likely at this point that Siddalee's mother Vivi Ellen Burstyn will go to her grave without ever speaking to her beloved daughter again. Drastic action is called for and these three ladies are no frail blossoms.They kidnap Siddalee bring her to a backwoods cottage in Louisiana and set about the task of helping both mother and daughter to remember that growth comes from acknowledging connections not severing them. They are aided in this task by an ornate scrapbook that the four of them kept of their youthful adventures as the YaYa Sisterhood.The members of this sisterhood do not turn a blind eye to each other's shortcomings. In one of the film's many poignant moments Siddalee does a cruel impersonation of her mother. As the audience readies itself for Vivi's friends to rush to her defense one of them Maggie Smith of course says dryly She's got her pegged all right. These women who are about as far from perfect as the cottage in Louisiana is from New York dare to love each other with eyes wide open.Flanagan Knight and Smith are delightful as Vivi's three friends and James Garner contributes a fine performance as the quiet forbearing husband and father. Most memorable of all is the wounded beauty of Ellen Burstyn as the tempestuous Vivi who has grown up with two kinds of savagery  the naked brutality of her father and the merciless piety of her mother. Through the whole film shines the keen emotional intelligence of director Callie Khouri.This film is a masterpiece that should not be missed.".

Shortcuts were taken left and right in this film much to the detriment of the storyline.  For instance Shep is not a living saint Vivi did not simply beat her children because of dexamyl Teensy's mother is barely mentioned Vivi's stay at the boarding school was left out and where is Aunt Jezie grownup Lulu Little Shep and Baylor?  I realize that it was a two hour film but an adaptation should never have been attempted if it wasn't going to be done faithfully. Everything in this film was explained away too easily.  Sidda needed much more than a sob story about her mother's loss and use of dexamyl to explain her behavior.  Too easy too simple too cheesy.  No one could possibly come away with a clear understanding and resolution of the plot.  My recommendation  SKIP IT and read the fabulous books this was supposedly based on  Little Altars Everywhere and The Divine Secrets of the YaYa sisterhood.".

While it's all those things it's also about a mother Vivi Ellen Burstyn in the present Ashley Judd in the past who drank too much and beat her kids.  Yes she lost her true love in the war.  Yes she had a nervous breakdown.  And yes she really really feels bad about beating her kids.  But when daughter Sidda Lee Sandra Bullock goes public about her abusive childhood Vivi doesn't apologize she pitches a fit and has another Bloody Mary.Don't get me wrong.  There were some good times in Sidda Lee's childhood and her father reminds her that she should remember those instead. Because it is the adult child's responsibility to understand and forgive the abusive parent.  Yes that strange sound you hear is my blood boiling.So with the help of the mostly drunk YaYa Sisters kidnapped Sidda Lee comes to understand that her mother was heart broken and sometimes the kids all got sick at the same time and that's why she drank and beat the crap out of them.  So Sidda forgives Vivi even though Vivi still never apologized. Then the band plays and everyone is happy.Were there times when I laughed?  You bet.  There are some great lines. But the movie is slow jumps around in time far more than necessary and handles serious issues like alcoholism and child abuse far too lightly.  I have no idea why this film was championed by Bette Midler Bonnie Bruckheimer Callie Khouri and Sandra Bullock.  Surely they could have found a better women's story to film.".

I thought at the least that the boy lost in the war would turn up at some point to explain the mother's mental episode.There is no explanation for the mumbojumbo behind the YaYa of the title and certainly no reasonable explanation why four child hood friends should after 50 years remain livng in close enough proximity to be able to go driving every where together.  And are we also expected to believe that a boyfriend of some 7 years has yet to meet the parents?  Yeah right.Maggie Smith can act  but sadly a Southern accent is for her 'a talent too far'.  The Oxygen mask I can only assume was a device designed to explain or hide her lapses into English.In general  a disappointment.".

Story starts out with 4 girls in the woods about 50 years ago who invent a club just for them called..Oh you know. Well forward ahead to modern day and we see Sidda Walker Sandra Bullock who is a successful playwright and she gives an interview to Time magazine and says her childhood was difficult. The article comes out and Sidda's mother Vivi Ellen Burstyn reads it and is furious and writes her out of her will and tears up her photo's and acts very melodramatic. The rest of the YaYa's are Teensy Fionnula Flanagan Necie Shirley Knight and Caro Maggie Smith and they travel to where Sidda lives and spike her drink and somehow get her back to Louisiana but don't tell Vivi that they have her. Well she finds out from Sidda's fiance' Conner Angus Macfadyen that they have her but she is not allowed to see her. While at their place Sidda looks at their old scrapbook and then the film uses flashbacks to view several events including why Vivi was a difficult mother and her bout with depression and being hooked on pills. This film is the directorial debut of writer Callie Khouri who wrote the screenplay for Thelma and Louise and she displays tremendous patience in her storytelling and the film goes on way to long. The characters all play Southern Belles and there are times during the film that it is difficult to understand exactly what they are saying. Smith is an English actress and her Southern accent is just not believable. As I watched this film I kept waiting for the big scene that is suppose to tell us about Vivi but it never really comes because we already know in advance about her troubles and yet the film is still a solid two hours long. James Garner plays Shep and the actor that plays him as a young man appears to be a good foot taller then he is. I didn't hate this film because with a great cast like this it would be impossible. The most effective scenes in the film come from Ashley Judd who is suppose to be a young Vivi and although I'm not convinced of how good of an actress she is she is good in this film. This film could have benefited from more editing and more realistic dialogue. Great cast tries hard but except from a few scattered moments this is a big disappointment. YaYa!".

The actors represent cranky characters that might be hilarious for Americans but they're just barely funny here. The dialogues are predictable and not really funny either. And this also one of those films that entices people into the cinema with a trailer that creates a totally false impression of the film. This film is more sad than funny. What you see in the trailer lasts a few minutes at the most and it's not really related to the main action. The actors may give their best but it's just not possible to be good in a film like this. At least it's better than Steel Magnolias which is a film that I wouldn't even give 1 point. Everything in that film seems to be fake.

	schema:reviewBody "Divine Secrets Of The YaYa Sisterhood is a chick flick for sure. I didn't like it much but I think that's because I'm a man. Women I know who have seen this movie liked it a little more that I did my mom for example. On the other hand I also know women who didn't like this film. Now I'll talk about the film itself.Ellen Burstyn stars as Vivi Walker mother of magazine article writer Sidda Walker Sandra Bullock. Sidda writes an article how she didn't like her childhood and blames her mother. Vivi reads the article and refuses to speak to her daughter. Vivi's three friends Teensy Fionnula Flanagan Necie Shirley Knight and Caro Maggie Smith notice that she isn't acting like herself and when they found out what happened they beg Sidda to come down and make peace with her mother. Upon her arrival the three friends reveal to Sidda about the YaYa Sisterhood a life long band formed by the three friends and Vivi when they were children. They promised that they would be blood sisters or something like that I don't remember very well. Along with this story we flash back to Sidda when she was a child and see her relationship with her mother played in these scenes by Ashley Judd. James Garner costars as Vivi's husband but he's a very small part of the movie.I liked some of the acting particularly Maggie Smith and Sandra Bullock and the film tells a story worth telling but some problems drag it down. First during the flashback scenes I noticed that Sidda had a few brothers and sisters. However in the present scenes they're no where to be found. I admit that the movie is mainly about the relationship of Vivi and Sidda but considering what happens in the flashback scenes which I won't reveal It would have been more plausible if we found out about the siblings now that they've grown up. Also for me the movie went on too long. The film is two hours long but it feels more like it's four hours. Lastly I thought that the Ellen Burstyn character was kind of a disappointment. Burstyn was much better and more convincing in Requiem For A Dream 2000 which she got a Best Actress nomination for.So I didn't hate this movie but it didn't work for me. I think I didn't like it because I'm a man. I have nothing against chick flicks. I think that some overcome the only women will enjoy it thinking such as Emma 1996 Kate And Leopold 2001 The Evening Star 1996 and arguably the best example Gone With The Wind 1939. YaYa doesn't cross that line. I know that women will enjoy it much more than men. I'm thinking some men would compare viewing this movie to medieval torture. Even though I didn't like it I didn't think about it like that. To prove my point I'm going to quote a couple I saw in the video store trying to pick a movie out. The woman saw YaYa on the shelf.Woman Oh look. Divine Secrets Of The YaYa Sisterhood. I wanted to see that.Man You can see that one by yourself I'm not going to see it.I at least was willing to see this film. Women will most likely enjoy it most men probably won't but I could be wrong.2 Stars out of 4 Stars".

On the negative side I did find the new characters introduced in this one to be almost universally unlikable and annoying. Did that ruin the movie? No but I definitely cared about the wellbeing and survival of these people less than those that came before.

This has to become a game at some point. The attacks do become a bit repetitive but the story is given an extra kick by expanding on the demonic possession themes. This sets it apart from other zombievirus movies. It had plenty of jumps and did unsettle me. Wouldn't mind watching the two films back to back for an ultimate experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am huge fan of the original horror film REC which of course inspired the American remake Quarantine. So of course once I heard that they were making the sequel I was up for it completely. The first film still scares me to this day even though I've watched it several times. While I'm not sure I could have the same experience with REC 2 the movie is still a great horror film.REC 2 starts almost immediately after the events that took place in the first film and follows members of the S.W.A.T. team going to the apartment complex from the first film. Equipped with video cameras they go in to find any remaining characters and find the antidote to the virus that is spreading. We also follow a group of teenagers who end up finding their way in too. We see both vantage points including the horror that both teams face.The way this film is shot is breathtaking. In the first film we had only one perspective from a TV camera. In this film the S.W.A.T. team uses cameras that can link to mini cameras so that when one of the characters is on his own we can see what's going on. Some may feel this doesn't keep the realism but I feel it does. Lawenforcement men take cameras with them all the time and if you were a kid going into the apartment to see what's going on naturally you would have a camera. In terms of a technical achievement REC 2 definitely brings it up a level.In the last film what this virus may be is merely hinted at. In here the directors move more into the mythology they created and expand it. We learn without giving too much away that the virus is much more than what we thought it was something that leads back to the Vatican and religion in general.While I wouldn't say the second film is as scary as the first it still carries the creepy atmosphere set up in the first REC. There are many scenes were you feel trapped and you can't get out and not knowing what's gonna happen next.I was very pleased that they brought back Angela Vidal the main character for the second film. I felt that the actress did well and the directors brought her character to the right point which leads into my next topic The ending. I was wondering how the film's climax would be and if it would top the first film's ending which goes down as one of the most frightening things I've ever seen. The answer is yes it does go in the right direction shocks you and sets you up for the third film.The biggest problem that I can say about REC 2 is that while characters in the first film were well developed and memorable you don't get that with these new characters. Sure we fear for them sure they're not bad characters at all. But none of them really made me think about them afterward and the only character that was memorable was Angela Vidal who was in the first film.It felt a little too shaky at times for me. While it does keep the film tense especially in it's more obscure moments I really wished the camera could stop and calm down at a few points.While REC 2 may not be as incredible as the first it still takes things that were done well in the first film and makes them better. So if you liked the first movie and you're hyped for the second you shouldn't be disappointed.".

This evening Rec 2.This is not an awful film after all but several points below the first one I voted the first 810.Rec 1 transmitted to me a sense of confusion mystery it really makes you feel like you are one of the people trapped in that apartment who doesn't really know well what is going on both inside and outside the building. But the first film is realistic deals about science a virus zombies although they are faster and more intelligent then the standard physical infection.Rec 2 changes this to a demoniac possession which reminds the Exorcist. First film was science second film is religion. I preferred science. In this second film Satan talks through the infectedpossessed people and like in The Exorcist is able to change the voice of its victim. I found that quite ridiculous kind of a thing that would be never happened in 1st film where the villains were infected and not possessed! So now why this stupid change?! It is just a bad mismatch if you pair it with the realistic horror masterpiece that was Rec 1.Also the characters were better in the first. They were just common people their reactions were understandable but why in the sequel a police team that should be quite prepared acts stupid more than once? They should know when to shoot and react less hysterically even if the situation was tragic.Even the camera was better in the first movie. You feel that the camera is really inside the movie but here seems more external. The cameraman never does anything except filming like if in a situation were you are in a high risk of death your first thought is keep the camera in position. Then one of the policemen says how could we make the people outside believe what is happening here? Nobody is going to believe us!. Now think about it you took a member of your team that does nothing except filming all the time and you have no proof?! Bah.So my final suggestion watch Rec 1 that is very well made realistic full of suspense does his horror movie job very well. Rec 2? Not so bad but more than 1 stupid storyline decision that ruined this sequel like the introduction of Satan and supernatural elements and lack of characterization.".

It had a lot of tension and suspense and an amazing set up who are these people? How did they end up here? Can they get out? What is happening?? Is it a virus?? Possession?? And all these factors made for an amazing and unique experience. But the movie worked because the story worked.Having said this REC2 lacks any true character development and most of the suspense and mystery from the first one is gone. Instead it has tons of action gore terror and a never ending climax it sounds like any Hollywood sequel right?? Well it isn't simply because behind those deliberate elements lies a truly frightening horrific and original story.REC2 works simply because the story works. And said story demands none of the elements form the original it doesn't need any involvement with the characters it doesn't need to establish them the setting or the situation anymore. All they have to do is tie all those loose ends and give us a frightening movie while they're at it. AND IT WORKS!!! The movie manages to stay fresh yes even with the hand held camera and the relatively same setting because it is told in three acts each act from three different points of view. They expand the world from the first one so that you can understand what is going on outside how they will proceed and why it has to happen inside the building again. The pace is frenetic and five minutes into it you already have gore scares and just pure horror. You have one hour and a half of constant climax and terror. And what really saves it from being disposable entertainment is the amazing plot which takes everything we knew and throws it away giving us a brand new and absolutely genius take on the circumstances.The ending is of course a cliffhanger and a freaking shocking cliffhanger that is even more so than the first. And as most of you already know REC3 has been confirmed for 2011 so I say we are looking at one of the best horror franchises ever. 28 days later who??I give it 9 out of 10. A MUST SEE!!!MILD SPOLERS AHEAD.... Angela comes back for the last 10 minutes or so in a PIVOTAL role. Let's just say if they decide to make a sequel to Quarantine it will be extremely different because of what said remake left out.... The final shot is the continuation of the first shot I already said what the first shot is. We meet Jennifer's father We still don't know what happened to the dog or how it got infected no that it matters anymore...".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all I really enjoyed the first REC film. It had an original realistic and creepy feel to it. The characters were well built and developed funny at times and interesting story lines were built around the main frame of the film. The sequence of events was intriguing from the very start as to see the gradual escalation of events in a zombie film was untouched ground as zombieesque movies tend to start straight in with survivors trying to stay alive in a fullyfledged infection. Everything was well done the ending particularly ambiguous and creepy and I found the unfinished story lines the unnerving is this actually religious or just crazy experimentation gone wrong? ending the way everything built on a gradual crescendo to the nailbiting finale kept me thinking about the film for days.REC2 takes away all of the impact of the first film. They feel the need to explain. everything. There is no nailbiting crescendo which puts you firmly in the shoes of the actual victims there is no development of characters or interesting substory lines. There is just one bad bad movie spinoff from the game Doom.The dull predictable attackscenes which seemed to follow exactly the same formula some shadowy figures appears charges the camera each time the slightly ridiculous decision to go down the purely exorcistesque route the lack of a moredetailed plot just kills everything that could and should have been good about this film.The ending shock is horrifically predictable yeah it's really believable that the former lead just got away from the infected girl who so easily dragged her into darkness at the end of REC and with the ending meaning the demon successfully got out of the building it's difficult to see what direction the film can go in without it being completely different from the first two. Presumably something to do with the two kids who appeared to survive having been locked in the room by SWAT.A sorry excuse for what could have been an excellent franchise. DO NOT WATCH.".

There is just one bad bad movie spinoff from the game Doom.The dull predictable attackscenes which seemed to follow exactly the same formula some shadowy figures appears charges the camera each time the slightly ridiculous decision to go down the purely exorcistesque route the lack of a moredetailed plot just kills everything that could and should have been good about this film.The ending shock is horrifically predictable yeah it's really believable that the former lead just got away from the infected girl who so easily dragged her into darkness at the end of REC and with the ending meaning the demon successfully got out of the building it's difficult to see what direction the film can go in without it being completely different from the first two. Presumably something to do with the two kids who appeared to survive having been locked in the room by SWAT.A sorry excuse for what could have been an excellent franchise. DO NOT WATCH.";

So for me this plot is joke and from know movie don't deserve for anything higher than 5 as an continuation of Rec 1. So why I gave 1? Because of thing called characters behavior This is the weakest thing in REC 2. I can't say if I was more mad or amused watching what main characters are doing. The special task group act like a pssies. They have guns which they're not using. they're almost afraid to use them even when they life is in danger  so one of them get killed. Also the funniest thing or most stupid is that the first person who shoots in movie is who? If you were thinking this going to be done by special task force member who supposed to be one hard piece of mocker than no. This going to be priest who have more balls than this task group.I think none of You should watch this movie. Think about Rec 1 as about alone movie this ain't funny continuation.".

The way the movie is shot works so well it is like participating in a superb horror game.Now what I didn't like about Rec 2 was the whole possession and Christian propaganda approach they had decided to turn the story to. But looking beyond that the movie in its entirety came together as a good experience. There were no major frights though but there was a constant thrill and a sense of being stalked and feeling boxed it. That worked so well.The ending was very predictable and anticlimatic though. And as such the movie experience is just a notch below the first Rec movie. And I am sure this will also spawn a crappy Hollywood Americanized version of the movie like the first Rec movie.

	schema:headline " Disappointing and by the numbers.";
	schema:reviewBody "Below are some very minor spoilers for the film that won't affect your viewing pleasure. However if you haven't seen REC you might want to stop reading now!I really really enjoyed the original REC but its sequel was just.. well disappointing. The original is focused and intense with no real regards to a complicated plot whereas the sequel falls into territory that most sequels do trying to expand on its back story. The film seems to bare a similar structure to the original people running around a scary apartment building all seen from the viewpoint of a camera situated within the story. REC 2 starts off on relatively solid ground but once the inevitable happens people being attacked of course the film starts to create story points that dig it into so many plot holes it will leave your head spinning. For me a major drawback of the film was its introduction of demonic possession as the definite cause for the infection with a Hail Mary being sufficient enough to stop an attacker yet not used to the protagonists advantage. Go figure. The second drawback to the piece is that it's just not as scary as the first one... Obviously the cat is out of the bag in terms of what is to be faced in the apartment but the filmmakers sporadic approach of throwing everything at you loud and fast makes the film oafish more than anything else. There were moments I thought I was watching someone playing House of the Dead.

	onyx:emotionText "Below are some very minor spoilers for the film that won't affect your viewing pleasure. However if you haven't seen REC you might want to stop reading now!I really really enjoyed the original REC but its sequel was just.. well disappointing. The original is focused and intense with no real regards to a complicated plot whereas the sequel falls into territory that most sequels do trying to expand on its back story. The film seems to bare a similar structure to the original people running around a scary apartment building all seen from the viewpoint of a camera situated within the story. REC 2 starts off on relatively solid ground but once the inevitable happens people being attacked of course the film starts to create story points that dig it into so many plot holes it will leave your head spinning. For me a major drawback of the film was its introduction of demonic possession as the definite cause for the infection with a Hail Mary being sufficient enough to stop an attacker yet not used to the protagonists advantage. Go figure. The second drawback to the piece is that it's just not as scary as the first one... Obviously the cat is out of the bag in terms of what is to be faced in the apartment but the filmmakers sporadic approach of throwing everything at you loud and fast makes the film oafish more than anything else. There were moments I thought I was watching someone playing House of the Dead.

However that didn't stop it spawning a sequel which takes place immediately after the events in the first film.If you haven't seen REC then stop reading and watch it now. It is the better of the two movies but as far as sequels go REC2 is actually pretty good. Here a team of armed police officers enter a quarantined building to see what happened to the original occupants. And here's a clue zombies.Of course naturally things don't go too well for our boys in blue and if you can ignore the fact that armed welltrained men get easily overpowered and forced onto the back foot by unarmed albeit zombified civilians then you can enjoy this one too. There's more gunplay as the budget is bigger than the original so they can afford to add a few shootouts into the mix. However if you've seen the original you'll have already seen the best scares. REC2 certainly isn't as intense as its predecessor but it's still a decent enough followon.Plus you probably won't care about the central team as much as they're all just 'men in armour' and it's hard to make out who's who. There are some other characters added a little way into the film but that feels like an interruption as you've done your best to follow and care about the initial team before this new lot are thrown into the frying pan.It's not as good as REC but in a world of terrible cashin sequels it certainly stands out as one of the better ones which is more than I can say for 'REC3'.".

In a plot that picks up right where the first movie left off with a swat team preparing to enter the quarantined building after having lost contact with the team sent into the building in the first film the directors waste no time in getting to the action. In fact that seems to be the main problem with the sequel the glaring absence of any attempt at characterization. The first film had a strong protagonist in the plucky reporter who follows the police into the building. The sequel has wholly interchangeable characters who might as well be called Swat Team Member X or Teenager X. The first film at least made some attempt at meaningful dialogue. The sequel has screaming profanities and exposition masquerading as religious mumbojumbo.The lack of characterization is unfortunate because the film is chock full of interesting ideas that were hinted at in the original think The Exorcist crossed with Dawn of the Dead. Moreover the handheld firstperson camera gimmick is employed in novel ways particularly with a thirdact reveal that has a night vision camera being used like it never has before. However because the characters are wholly generic the film feels like you are watching a friend playing a particularly wellmade and creative video game.

A great use of the fake documentary genre taking hold. I even liked the U.S. remake Quarantine. I was looking forward to seeing this sequel with baited breath. However what a terrible terrible god awful movie this turned out to be. While production values are high enough with decent technical credits all around save for some sloppier camera work than the predecessor which results in more things unclearly seen than necessary the script is just abysmal. Characters don't act rationally. The second half with the teens is teethgratingly annoying. Everyone in the film acts like an ahole. Which is so strange as the first film had people acting rationally and believably. Even if they did something stupid it was believable the character would act that way. In this film people just act so stupid you are praying to see them gutted. I guess that would be fine in a horror film if you didn't find yourself in such utter disbelief every two minutes. That and the explanation for the disease is so ridiculous. I liked that in the first one it just seemed to be a disease  like rabies but in humans and more aggressive. The extra reasons added here turned the whole thing upside down and made it feel like a one of those ludicrous Exorcist ripoffs from the late 70's and early 80's that only played in grindhouses late night cable and straight to video films. Be afraid. Be very afraid. You won't get your 2 hours back ever and you only have so much time before you die.".

One thing I really hate about movies is when the sense of Logic and Common Sense is lost in the making. A few things I have to point out about the SWAT teamLarra was so easy go get agitated that's not really a SWAT professional trained. And he tried to open the window like a girl come on he's got a gun and he can't get out of a window without trying to shoot it or break it with something.When they need the Night Vision why didn't they go back and get another team of SWAT or more reinforcement with better guns better equipment and brief of the situation inside. It's not protocol at all.When the woman zombie attacked the SWAT member in the beginning scene he only shot her TWICE. That's a 12gauge shotgun with 7 shells. Maybe if it's jammed but I imagine a good professional trained SWAT member would always maintain their weapon clean at all time.If you see an undeadlooking zombies charging at you you shouldn't wrestle it with your hands but shoot it instead. Or isn't that not common sense?Special Force squad when engage with enemies always put a bullet in the head of the enemies after they're down to make sure it's dead. But not here the SWAT team acted like a bunch of amateurs who scream and panic like a bunch of little girls.The kids who sneaked in the house is dumber than a banana. Who see a massive pool of blood like that on the ground floor and has the guts to carry on upstairs to find out what's going on...... It's really not believable at all since even stupid kids are smarter than getting themselves killed.This movie made me angry beyond imagination compared to the first movie which was so well made. I thought this movie could do so much better and carry on impressing me like it did. But I just found it ridiculous when the theme of the movie change from Zombies to Demon Possessed because I don't believe in demons and ghosts. It's like Science vs Religion as in Zombies vs Demons.

Something that people could relate to. REC 2 goes beyond that. Little do often are there sequels that are good or better than the first and REC 2 is no exception. This time around this film is truly a direct sequel taking place 15 minutes after the first and from the perspective a SWAT team. Now tell me how can you not get exited for a story like that? REC 2 has the scares the action the horror the mystery and a bit of human drama. Now for the heart of the twist....Spoilers right here People argue that throwing the demonic possession into the mix and only being able to watch certain things in absolute darkness is lame and that it might have even ruined the film experience for you.I think otherwise.This is what enhanced the REC mythology. The demonic possession made the storyline more intriguing. Having paranormal and completely strange phenomenon presented to us in such a realistic way was completely amazing and simply perfect. This is what REC was known forPushing the envelope. Taking things in a new direction and presenting ideas in a real and effective way. From the very beginning it was clear that the directors wanted to have the same approach to REC 2 but with a twist a twist that would change the movies perspective and make it for once different.

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERSAlthough I am sure you already know them by nowThe whole point of REC was creating a new horror movie. Something original in a real life environment. Something that people could relate to. REC 2 goes beyond that. Little do often are there sequels that are good or better than the first and REC 2 is no exception. This time around this film is truly a direct sequel taking place 15 minutes after the first and from the perspective a SWAT team. Now tell me how can you not get exited for a story like that? REC 2 has the scares the action the horror the mystery and a bit of human drama. Now for the heart of the twist....Spoilers right here People argue that throwing the demonic possession into the mix and only being able to watch certain things in absolute darkness is lame and that it might have even ruined the film experience for you.I think otherwise.This is what enhanced the REC mythology. The demonic possession made the storyline more intriguing. Having paranormal and completely strange phenomenon presented to us in such a realistic way was completely amazing and simply perfect. This is what REC was known forPushing the envelope. Taking things in a new direction and presenting ideas in a real and effective way. From the very beginning it was clear that the directors wanted to have the same approach to REC 2 but with a twist a twist that would change the movies perspective and make it for once different. As a horror fan I absolutely loved it. REC 2 is everything I wanted in a sequel and much more. 1010";

First we have the story of longtime friends Anthony Hester played by Scott Mechlowicz and Julian Simms played by Alphonso McAuley who team up to make a private investigator company and end up hot on the trail on a rather big case. American senator Bill Krebb played by Christopher McDonald is doing shady business in Eastern Europe and is caught on video with prostitutes a video he doesn't want to go public and this event was Catalina Rona played by Paz Vega witness to. Hired to clean up the loose ends and the mess is professional hitwoman Helen Bingham played by Janet McTeer.Essentially it is a highoctane thriller of catandmouse chase mixed up with some spy activity and just the right amount of comedy. And the end result was awesome.I found Cat Run to be incredibly entertaining both storywise actionwise and comedywise. This movie had all the ingredients required for a great movie.The action sequences in the movie were really great nicely choreographed and could easily as well have been something right out of a James Bond movie. Thumbs up on that. And thumbs up for Janet McTeer she was off the charts in the action sequences.The people cast for the roles in Cat Run were doing really good jobs with their characters. Especially Janet McTeer she was really the driving force behind this movie.If you like action movies like spy movies and like comedy movies then you definitely owe it to yourself to sit down and watch Cat Run because it is well worth it.

The palatial house is owned by a mean guy named Carver. When the ambassador gets rough and kills one of the girls all hell breaks lose. Carver decides to kill all the girls. Cat manages to escape.Next morning while on the run she makes a phone call at a restaurant owned by Anthony. She steals his car and his friend's phone. Around this time the friend named Julian proposes they start a private detective business. Anthony eventually agrees. They get an office in a porn theater hire a guy missing 3 limbs as an assistant and take on the case of finding Cat.Also looking for her is Carver. As it turns out Cat stole a hard drive of his with evidence of all sorts of wrongdoings. He hires a hitwoman Helen a prim and proper English woman. And she's mean. She and the two morons follow the same trailCat's family in Spain her pimp and eventually the two find Cat just as Helen finds them all. They barely manage to escape. When Helen fails to do her job Carver sends a hitman after her. That causes Helen to join forces with the other 3 who now go after the ambassador and Carver. They crash another one of his parties and violence and the resolution ensues.This movie is not at all what it seems like. Cat is a very secondary character and no she isn't not some action chick. Initially it's all about the two fools chasing after Cat. And they make terrible lead characters. Since they are so weak the appearance of Helen livens things up considerably except that she it detestable. Things improve when the Scottish hitman appears but unfortunately he's there only for a short time. While the characters are lame the story is alright and the action is pretty good. This movie delights in some of the extremes it shows. The settings in Serbia are pretty neat and interesting. Overall a fairly decent movie that's at times annoying but overall entertaining and action packed.".

	onyx:emotionText "A bunch of prostitutes go to a fancy party. Among them is Cat and a friend of hers. Among the guests is an American ambassador. The palatial house is owned by a mean guy named Carver. When the ambassador gets rough and kills one of the girls all hell breaks lose. Carver decides to kill all the girls. Cat manages to escape.Next morning while on the run she makes a phone call at a restaurant owned by Anthony. She steals his car and his friend's phone. Around this time the friend named Julian proposes they start a private detective business. Anthony eventually agrees. They get an office in a porn theater hire a guy missing 3 limbs as an assistant and take on the case of finding Cat.Also looking for her is Carver. As it turns out Cat stole a hard drive of his with evidence of all sorts of wrongdoings. He hires a hitwoman Helen a prim and proper English woman. And she's mean. She and the two morons follow the same trailCat's family in Spain her pimp and eventually the two find Cat just as Helen finds them all. They barely manage to escape. When Helen fails to do her job Carver sends a hitman after her. That causes Helen to join forces with the other 3 who now go after the ambassador and Carver. They crash another one of his parties and violence and the resolution ensues.This movie is not at all what it seems like. Cat is a very secondary character and no she isn't not some action chick. Initially it's all about the two fools chasing after Cat. And they make terrible lead characters. Since they are so weak the appearance of Helen livens things up considerably except that she it detestable. Things improve when the Scottish hitman appears but unfortunately he's there only for a short time. While the characters are lame the story is alright and the action is pretty good. This movie delights in some of the extremes it shows. The settings in Serbia are pretty neat and interesting. Overall a fairly decent movie that's at times annoying but overall entertaining and action packed.";

Their first case though takes them further into danger than they ever expected.I hate the word derivative. In fact the only time you'll ever see it used in one of my reviews is when I'm making fun of it. Why? Well when a critic uses the word to describe a movie they're basically just saying that the film was imitating another one. In a lot of cases I find that it's less imitation and more inspiration. I mean directors grow up watching movies and honed their styles in the memory of their favorites right? So almost every one of them has been inspired by something someone else made. If a critic simply means the movie is cookie cutter or unimaginative  then they should just say that. I feel like it's just a word those people use to sound more elitist.Cat Run was not well liked by critics. I think the lot of them were watching the wrong movie or something because I thought the film was hilarious. There's a lot of sex and nudity but considering the main plot it makes sense for there to be a lot of sexuality. There was also the buddy detective aspect because of the two main characters. Most of Cat Run actually seemed like an episode of Psyche with different actors. It did have some relatively original parts though and I thought the characters came alive through the actors. There were some plot holes. The only one that I can mention without adding a spoiler alert however is that it's never explained why Anthony has such superior observation skills his skills are revealed roughly 10 minutes into the movie. I would have liked to know the story behind it.".

The vicious assassin Janet McTeer parades herself as a British nanny. Much like Sylvester Stallone in 'Rhinestone' and Arnold Schwarzenegger in 'Junior.' The fish out of water scenario is so over the top it's just plain unfunny.The plot also does a complete 180 on us when the sadistic assassin we're supposed to fear and hate for torturing innocent victims to dead suddenly switches sides and becomes a caring and selfless heroine whom wants to help Cat and crush McDonald.Of course the mindless heroes mindlessly accept McTeer as their ally mindlessly forgetting all wrongs.Sadly McTeer is the least annoying of the over acting assassins. They're more. Many more. Like a Scotsman whom resembles Fat Bastard from the 'Austin Powers' films. Except 'Cat Run' is supposed to be and action comedy not a slapstick comedy. Hence these henchmen all come across as out of place very annoying.The single biggest nail on the chalkboard is the screenplay itself which seems to be written by a 10 year old boy who thinks any type of vulgarity is funny. It's not! And someone should have stopped this script in its tracks from ever being turned into a movie.Crude humor can be done well but this script totally ignores the second part the humor.

This is really her movie and without her the story would be only average. I loved the line We'll always have Angola. The two private detectives are more comic relief than main characters but the kilt dance made me laugh out loud for about 5 minutes. The supporting characters are numerous and familiar which helps the story along. Paz Vega is pure window dressing.Cat Run certainly won't win any awards and most of the characters are rather predictable but it was still great fun if you just don't take it too seriously. By the time the movie ended I was thoroughly engrossed so maybe it helps to pay less attention in the beginning where the story truly bogs down.

I mostly enjoyed the serious part of it the mature violent kills and gory scenes i also loved the setting of the film that took a wide tour through European countries capturing some beautiful scenery which added much to the movie.Action scene were pulled off with perfection gun fights and a final fist fight not to be missed.In short the movie was flawed in certain areas but was actually pretty entertaining and worth a watch for sure at least for Janet Mcteer's performance and some solid mature action. I say 7.5 out of 10".

I mostly enjoyed the serious part of it the mature violent kills and gory scenes i also loved the setting of the film that took a wide tour through European countries capturing some beautiful scenery which added much to the movie.Action scene were pulled off with perfection gun fights and a final fist fight not to be missed.In short the movie was flawed in certain areas but was actually pretty entertaining and worth a watch for sure at least for Janet Mcteer's performance and some solid mature action. I say 7.5 out of 10";

If you gave mentally subnormal 8yearolds toy guns and told them to run riot in the back yard they'd come up with a better plot behind the gunplay than whoever was responsible for the script to his breathtakingly abysmal film.Cat Paz Vega  who? is at some political orgy shindig in Eastern Europe when everyone is suddenly killed and she finds herself marked for death and on the lam because she knows. Many characters come and go over the running time most of which seem to be occupying their own story as the movie feels very disconnected.I've seen many poorly edited films in my time but Cat Run wins the top prize by a million miles. Characters warp through space and time with no coherence or cohesion. Cat Run feels like three separate terrible movies chucked into a blender fed to pigs collected as feces then painted on the screen in brown smears. It is truly mindbogglingly jawdroppingly agonizingly terrible.The worst part of this brain torture is that Cat Run actually thinks it is smart and funny. John Stockwell's direction makes you long for the crude childish eye candy of Michael Bay. It will even make you forgive Guy Richie for all his previous sins. Nothing but nothing about this drek can possibly be any worse.Shame on all involved. Who would want this on their resume? If you dropped Cat Run in a public toilet bowl it would regurgitate it back in your face.You honestly think that there are worse films than this? There's not.

This here isn't a horror but a pure entertaining flick. But it is also that kind of flick you watch and forget afterwards because it isn't a major blockbuster. And people who are thinking that they will see a Mission Impossible or Bourne will be disappointed. This is pure fun and even not for kids to watch due the nudity involved which is full frontal shaved and unshaven. You also don't go watching it for the performances although I have to say that Janet McTeer as Helen Bingham is stunning. She gives away a stiff British performance but with literally a killing attitude. Due the nudity it's definitely one for the guys. There is also a bit of CGI gore here and there but I did dig it because it was done in slomo or POV from the bullet itself. There's a lot of action going on. Still for many the thespians will be unknown but some are familiar to the ones who love Bmovies. Paz Vega Cat did the lead in Luca Y El Sexo 2001. Tony Curran will be recognized by horror buffs from Midnight Meat Train 2008 and Shuttle 2008 or from blockbusters like Underworld 2006 and Gladiator 2000 for example. But I do recommend it also for the ones who love action flicks with a bit of gore and humour. I laughed out loud with a few situations especially when Alphonso McAuley who plays Julian Simms is transferred into a Scottish bloke he's black and of course he has to show he isn't wearing underwear hilarious situation you couldn't see coming. Ideal for an evening with your male friends sexy chicks nudity in the beginning gory situations and comedy.

While this simple juvenile humor might not work or seem crude in other movies it was hilarious when they did it primarily because they didn't harp on crude humor. Even the slap stick type humor was funny because it was quick and they didn't dwell on it. This is a 5 star movie even without the nudity. The movie works better as a comedy than an action film.

	schema:reviewBody "Cat Run is a useless needlessly crass and unpleasant piece of pseudo europulp garbage with not a redeeming factor in sight. It tries its best to do the whole assassin mad dash al Smokin Aces and such but there's no heart no discernible frequency to jive with and it ends up so thoroughly dead on arrival that you can feel the lack of pulse simply by watching a hastily cut trailer. The story is a glossy parade of silenced pistols broad characterizations and graphic genre prototypes that offers nothing fresh beginning with a murder scandal involving a scumbag politician Christopher 'Shooter McGavin' McDonald and a high class escort Paz Vega. This causes subsequent fallout and bloodshed as all kinds of freaks and lowlifes come crawling out of the woodwork. They include two moronic wouldbe businessmen Eurotrip's Scott Mechlowicz and Alphonso McCauley a mysterious oddball DJ Hughley an Eastern European mobster nutjob always cool to see Karel Roden and Helen Bingham a ferocious assassin played by British thesp Janet McTeer. They've made her character excessively ridiculously arch and violent hovering so far over the top she flies into orbit. The thing about these low rent hard boiled high octane ensemble capers is that you have to have a balance a flow of all energies involved that stays streamlined and congruent.

	onyx:emotionText "Cat Run is a useless needlessly crass and unpleasant piece of pseudo europulp garbage with not a redeeming factor in sight. It tries its best to do the whole assassin mad dash al Smokin Aces and such but there's no heart no discernible frequency to jive with and it ends up so thoroughly dead on arrival that you can feel the lack of pulse simply by watching a hastily cut trailer. The story is a glossy parade of silenced pistols broad characterizations and graphic genre prototypes that offers nothing fresh beginning with a murder scandal involving a scumbag politician Christopher 'Shooter McGavin' McDonald and a high class escort Paz Vega. This causes subsequent fallout and bloodshed as all kinds of freaks and lowlifes come crawling out of the woodwork. They include two moronic wouldbe businessmen Eurotrip's Scott Mechlowicz and Alphonso McCauley a mysterious oddball DJ Hughley an Eastern European mobster nutjob always cool to see Karel Roden and Helen Bingham a ferocious assassin played by British thesp Janet McTeer. They've made her character excessively ridiculously arch and violent hovering so far over the top she flies into orbit. The thing about these low rent hard boiled high octane ensemble capers is that you have to have a balance a flow of all energies involved that stays streamlined and congruent.

	schema:reviewBody "First entry in Torrente series starred by the most grotesque detective and well played by Santiago Segura he is a real private dick  a poster child for police corruption . Featuring politically incorrect private detective Torrente Santiago Segura  he is a macho man  lazy  rude  drunkard  Athletic fan  caring only about protecting and serving himself  here he fights against the oriental mafia in Madrid and patrolling the city looking for delinquents . Despite that he still manages to get the job done . Torrente follows the exploits of Jose Luis Torrente  a Bad Santa of the police force  a peculiar and fatty man  being a El Fari fan . Torrente was rejected from police duty and he has returned to private investigation . He lives in a rotten flat with his wheelchairbound daddy Tony Leblanc  whom he treats quite badly and wipes out of the money he had gained in begging . One day in his decrepit slum appears a new family of neighbours move in  and the gorgeous young  Amparito Neus Asensi  catches his eye . Cheesy Torrente becomes a good friend Rafi Javier Camera  to get closer to her . Rafi is a naive young who loves action movies  guns and imitates Robert De Niro's Taxi driver . Later on  the botcher dirty private eye  being helped by Rafi her nerdy neighbour and a group of geeks  all of them attempt to detain the local Mafia . In one of his cases he discovers the illegalities and irregularities of a powerful drug lord Espartaco Santoni and gets involved in the middle of a nasty's plot to introduce lots of drug in the city . As we find our antihero in a delicate situation but he can count on to help him some people  as Rafi and his equally geek friends  one of them results to be a Karate man  Bruce LeeMark Dacascos enthusiast  using Shuriken and other Ninja weapons . This is 1 installment in Torrente series . These films are made to entertain  and this movie  especially for a good time and a nice entertainment . Torrente is a passable and unapologetic dark comedy with great special effects  it has several funny and hilarious scenes and quite successful action scenes with persecution  car crashes and many other things . The picture contains thrills  noisy action  tongueincheek  grotesque situations and above all  humor . Although there are also nudism  badmouthed language  bad taste jokes and profanities . Torrente 2 is written directed produced and stars Segura whose production house Amiguetes Entertainment produced the film  UIP holds Spanish distribution rights . The screenplay is absurd as well as crazy  just what makes laugh a lot  that the character Torrente a very slutty  clumsy  sexist  Machista  extremerightwing  on a real person is despicable  being not adequate  but this is a film that satirizes all this and that just means he's a pathetic character  though he also has his unsettling charms . Here Torrente discovers that a band of drug traffickers are operating in a nearby Chinese restaurant and along the way  he falls in love for sexy Neus Asensi . This first Torrente which set box office records in its day took 707000 and Torrente 2 grossed more than 22 million in 2001 . The film contains many cameos of famous people familiar faces such as Javier Bardem  Carlos Bardem  Chus Lampreave  Tony Leblanc  Antonio De La Torre  Luis Manquia  Espartaco Santoni  El Gran Wyoming  Daniel Monzn  Mariola Fuentes  Pablo Carbonell  Manuel Tafalle  Luis Cuenca among others . The cameos are very amusing and fun and there are lots of laughters and jokes . The movie contains a colorful and adequate cinematography by Carles Gusi . Thrilling as well as appropriate musical score by Roque Baos . Santiago Segura dares to make films with total entertainment and bemusement . And Torrente  is pure eschatological fun  it is 90 and some minutes of fun and laughters . It is a commendable effort by Santiago Segura to make a film like this . Few directors are able to achieve results as Torrente  the biggest boxoffice in Spain until 8 Apellidos Vascos. This film will not disappoint Santiago Segura fans.The first outing was this Torrente El Brazo Tonto De La Ley  being followed by Torrente 2 Mission in Marbella with Juanito Navarro  Jose Luis Lopez Vazquez  Paloma Cela  Santi Millan  Jose Mota  Pablo Carbonel among others  Torrente 3 El Protector in which the horrendous Spanish detective becomes a bodyguard  being performed by Jos Mota  Javier Gutirrez  Carlos Latre  Yvonne Sci  Eduardo Garca  Fabio Testi  Torrente 4 Lethal crisis with Carlos Areces  Kiko Rivera  Javier Gutirrez  Fernando Esteso and Torrente V Misin Eurovegas with Alec Baldwin  Anna Simon Neus Asensi  Pablo Motos  Chus Lampreave Andrs Pajares . The movies were written by directed by and starred popular Spanish comediandirector Santiago Segura and is getting the remake treatment from New Line Cinema  all of them were produced by Andres Vicente Gomez who exec produced the Academy Awardwinning Belle Epoque".

Yes all the films are Spanish subtitled in English but in very easy to read yellow lettering so it's no big deal at all. Most women I'm guessing will be turned off by these flicks.

These satires are rude crude lewd insensitive offensive amoral sexist racist homophobic grossly politically incorrect and hilarious with likely no socially redeeming value.

Why would a person that can buy anything would still want more? this is answered in Inside Job and by many behavioral economic studies.Let's continue. Neoliberalism is widely repeated in the one hour and half documentary. It is presented as an ideology risen in Economic schools in the western world the same way Inside Job did that has nothing to do with real world. Documentary shows with many examples how massive privatization and efficiency do not go handinhand as neolibs would affirm because pure privatization of natural monopolies generally leads to worse services and higher prices of final costumers which is agree with economic theory of monopolies that can lower their production in order to increase prices because their aim is to maximize profit not to serve the people.More stuff. Politics and democracy are central subjects of debate in this work. Why in democracy is happening such selfdestruction of middle class? Catastroika argues that Mass Media is monopolized by the neolib opinion and oppositeside points of view are rapidly insulted as populists or comunist. Have anyone ever asked why in western cultures those words are insults? Has anything to do with the fact that the capitalist block won the Cold War? Why communist or real socialist parties are seen today as extremists by popular culture? Is it extremist to seek the wellbeing for ALL citizens and not only the ones who possess huge amounts of capital? Why a system based on a yet fragile balance of Capitalism and StatedrivenSocialism is now so put to doubt and yet it provided the fastest expansion of human development in the 50s and 60s of past century? Catastroika has the ability to help viewers answer some big questions and still let space for far more questions to be answered. Because the research of the undergrounds of the REAL system we live in needs more answers and more documentaries like Catastroika.".

The film portrays the debt crisis in Greece as an element of cannibal capitalism through privatization and lists Chile Russia Thatcherist Britain and East Germany in one breath as examples. Chile was a CIAfostered coup aimed at curbing Communist expansion the Soviet Union was bankrupted in the course of the arms race with the US which enabled new private banks to sell and confiscate assets for a pittance  which is how the oligarchy started and Greece went several times over the Euro stability criteria to finance political promises and the Olympics thereby increasing its borrowing costs until the crisis hit. Thatcherism is indeed a perfect example of neoliberal capitalism but in this film all kinds of nonconnected things are thrown together to create the illusion of a global conspiracy. Your head will spin over movie clips snippets of Slavoj Zizek and Naomi Klein and how they connect Greece with British rail privatization and Enron.I can only determine the full scope of disinformation here on the bits about Germany. The experts consulted here are with one exception members of Die Linke the followup of the sole East German party SED. Which means these people were part  benefited from the ruling elite and since they lost their privileges upon reunification they have created their own mythology about evil West Germany taking over the innocent East. No word about East Germans being adopted into the Western pension fund and health insurance scheme financed by a solidarity tax of 5.5 on top of income tax  until today! No word about the Lnderausgleich which obliges states like Bavaria which generate a budget surplus to finance states on a deficit which are the Eastern ones. But of course for Greeks Germany and the EU are evil because they insisted on compliance with the Euro stability pact before agreeing to bail them out. Yet had the evil Troika not pressured Greece into this and chosen Grexit instead there would have been state bankruptcy and no bank would have vouched for Greek debt. The Greeks would have had to negotiate a deal with private equity funds like Argentina they would have returned to the Drachma leading to hyperinflation and the overall situation would have been way worse than it is now. But hey those are facts and who gives a damn about those these days. You'll either applaud this fact manipulation because it fits your view of the world or you'll shake your head over people believing this nonsense.".

	schema:reviewBody "I read quite a lot of good reviews so I was pretty excited when I when to watch the film. Unfortunately it was one of the worse films I've ever seen. If you know even a few things about Greek mythology then do NOT watch it. I didn't expect them to follow it completely but since they are using the names of heroes and gods they could at least use their background.First of all Theseus was not a bastard as they call him. His father was the king of Athens Aegean and he certainly was not a peasant since he became the king of Athens himself.Second there were 12 gods not 6 and I've never heard of Zeus killing any other god or about the law of not interfering with humans. Gods loved to play around with people.Third as soon as I saw the so called Titans I felt like leaving the theater. The last time I checked they were not blue people who jump around like monkeys and have no intelligence.Fourth I am not a racist. I have friends from all around the world but using an Indian actress as Phaedra and black people for warriors feels out of space. I repeat I am not a racist but in a film based on Greek mythology they could at least use actors that resemble the people of the country and since the priests were talking in Greek they could at least make it sound like Greek. It took me some time to realize they were not talking in an alien language and when I did I still read the subtitles to understand what they were saying even though it is my first language.I do not want to over analyze the mistakes concerning the mythology but I have to day that Phaedra was not a priest but a princess and Theseus definitely did not bury his mother in the labyrinth of minotaur which is in Crete minotaur was not a man with an iron mask on his head and Theseus did not follow his own bloody traces to leave the labyrinth.I could write pages about mythology but I will stop here. Other than that I did not really enjoy the fights much. I must say that some of them were amazing but most of them concentrated on showing too much blood. If you enjoy watching people chopping off body parts and literally smashing people into nothingness in slow motion then this is a film for you.Also there was not depth in the characters. They are all shallow and you can easily guess what their choices they will make or how they will react to certain situations. The same goes with the plot. The ending is pretty much known from the beginning there is no mystery at all. We learn everything in the first 20 minutes and then just watch several fights until the end.All in all the makers just used some famous names from the Greek mythology and created a lot of violent fights in an attempt to gain the attention of the viewers.".

	schema:headline " Immortals is like you're dating the hottest person on the planet but it turns out they're dumb as a box of rocks";
	schema:reviewBody "If you're going to mess up Greek mythology I guess you might as well make it pretty. Immortals is a semirelatedsequel to the incredible film 300 which not only looked beautiful but had this incredible story of triumph and strength overcoming powerful numbers with a sense of knowing who you are and the pride you have. Immortals was created by director Tarsem Singh who also directed The Cell which was an alright story followed up by some great visuals the same thing happens here. I think Tarsem is just known for making a beautiful movie with a weak story he's more of a visualist rather than a story teller. I still couldn't wait to see Immortals and sadly was very disappointed unfortunately this was just a weak story with some bizarre miscasts.King Hyperion has declared war on humanity. He searches for the Epirus Bow a legendary weapon created by the war god Ares which will allow him to free the rest of the Titans from Tartarus and take revenge on the Olympians who brought about their downfall. In accordance with ancient laws the gods are unable to take a side in the war between Hyperion and humanity. It is left to Theseus who was chosen by Zeus and accompanied by the priestess Phaedra and a thief named Stavros to protect his homeland and save the gods.To begin with the positives like I said the visuals really are incredible. Now the CGI is over the top but sometimes I don't mind we need the pretty occasionally. Plus like I said if you are going to mess up mythology at least we could make it beautiful to look at. When I go to a museum and look at the Greek statues I am in awe and that's what I felt with some of the visuals in the film. The fight scenes were so well choreographed a little ripped off from 300 but that's alright. They took the 3D to their advantage with the blood splatter and the stabbings and honestly it was fun to watch. And if not for the script the story was actually very good it's something that just needed some work.The cast though Henry Cavill as our hero Theseus I don't know if it was the actor or the way he was written but I couldn't really root for his character. He seemed to lack the charisma that made me believe that not only is this man a hero but that he's a God. He has this scene where he is giving the big speech to his army that is freaking out when they see the numbers they are about to face in war and he says something along the lines I bleed like you bleed and randomly they're just like Yeah! that's it? It didn't take much encouragement and the way that Henry delivered it was weak in my opinion. Freida Pinto beautiful lady decent actress however was an unneeded character and had no chemistry with Henry. Stephen Dorff did an alright job as the sidekick who often lends a joke when needed but makes for a good fighter and has some good action scenes. Mickey Rourke really does try very hard to be the bad God like King Hyperion but again the threat wasn't so much there. He mumbles so many lines and won't stop eating when on the screen why not just give him a cat to stroke while talking about his plan? The ending fight scene between Hyperion and Theseus was so anticlimatic to me. The mighty legendary incredible God Zeus played by Luke Evans? Oh myslaps head and groans I don't think I need to say more that was just wrong.I think that if the story besides some casting issues maybe if the film was trimmed down a bit the film would have worked a lot better. Despite being over the top I like the Greek mythology as a soap opera of some sorts that's what it was like while writing and telling these stories. The film has a lot of flaws however I would recommend seeing in the theater if anything go see the matine. The visuals are absolutely beautiful and the fight scenes are a lot of fun. But don't expect the story to be there this movie is not a rental even as a blu ray I'd recommend just seeing it in the theater if you want to see some great special effects. But Tarsem does need to work on his stories I know he has some major potential 300 was pretty and had a great story to boot if there's a sequel you have one more chance to make this story into a classic that we can proudly display with Jason and the Argonauts.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching Immortals is like eating a big platter full of candy and sugary sweets. There's plenty to look at and many savoury sweets to indulge in... Only for you to not realize that by the time it's all over and done with you'll be left with a lingering stomach ache. Which is exactly what is the problem with all types of candy eye candy or the actual food itself. It's not until you're finished devouring such huge portions of it you realize you've absorbed absolutely nothing.I have nothing at all against Tarsem Singh an amazingly talented and visionary director. I loved The Cell even though it was a bit mindscrewy though as soon as it's done you realize what was real and what was not. Every shot in that film was to die for starting with the opening frame of Dead Vlei. The Fall was a movie that I managed to stumble upon by accident on IMDb. I watched the trailer and quickly decided I must see this!. Soon after I rented the DVD watched it and thought holy crap that was amazing.So as you may or may not be able to tell I went into Immortals solely due to Singh's namesake and the one thing that entered my mind as soon as his name appeared over the closing credits was did someone hold a gun to his head and force him to direct this boring 'movie'?It really is a shame. I love Greek mythology and I thought Singh would be able to carry a Greek mythology themed film well. Let's say he did well with the visuals part his trademark visual brilliance is all over this film. Every single frame of the movie is a work of art in itself. That said the script is so agonizingly slow boring and disgustingly patronizing.Sure there's a lot of holes in the mythos Theseus being a bastard the sacred bow etc. But those are the least of the films problems. The story and sequence of events plays as if it were adapted from a goreobsessed 10 year old's paper on Greek mythology. One particularly insulting plot hole comes from the bow when Theseus buries his dead mother in the cave we are to assume the bow chose him and deemed him worthy of using the bow itself yet Hyperion can use it without problem?!The acting is insultingly awful. Cavill seems to think that just standing there and looking handsome and what not is acting. And while he is indeed a handsome fellow he fits the role of Theseus in looks only. He barely emotes throughout the film and even the one scene where he watches his mother get killed isn't enough to redeem his boring performance. Freida Pinto does an alright job though her performance wasn't nothing we saw in Slumdog Millionaire or Rise of the Planet of the Apes. And I have a gigantic man crush on Mickey Rourke but he was just hilariously bad. He rehashed his performances from Iron Man 2 and Sin City and the result was not good.The film plods along at a snail's pace. We get a handful of action and all are very short. Even the battle scene at the end was boring as frack. The slow sedated pace wouldn't be such a problem if the dialogue weren't so awful. The dialogue sounds like an immature 14 year old wrote it and I wouldn't be surprised if one did. The exploding heads scene was awesome but that was it.In short guys will go see Immortals for the battle sequences and gods fracking stuff up and girls will go see it for the guys walking around letting their absmuscles be the center of attention neither of which being anything they wouldn't get from viewing the IMDb publicity stills for the movie something they can do for free. Well girls if your boyfriend takes you to this movie swiftly pull him aside and tell him maybe you and me being together just isn't working out for either of us.... Guys if your group of buddies drags you to this movie immediately cut all ties with them and inform them that they're idiots.And to the writers your scripts are more suited for notalent hacks like Michael Bay or Terrance Malick. Have you seen either of Singh's previous 2 films? That guy has a wicked imagination. Let him use it on worthy scripts.OVERALL 310THE GOOD It looks pretty. There's exploding heads and Mickey Rourke. And Freida Pinto naked.THE BAD ...everything else.".

I have watched many films in 3D where it didn't add a whole lot to the movie this is the first time where I can safely say not only doesn't it add ANYTHING to the movie it probably makes the viewing WORSE. So steer clear of 3D.Now onto the movie it starts off promising I'll give it that. The first 5 minutes of this movie are probably the most exciting of the hole movie. The introduction builds suspense intrigue and excitement. Remember that feeling as from that point forwards you won't feel that anymore. Rather you'll start to feel confusion frustration and mild nausea. Acting is mediocre at best. Micky Rourke's performance is dry in this film as is Henry Cavills and the rest of the cast. The script is pathetic really. The dialogue is corny at best.The story doesn't feel suited for a movie either that or it hasn't been executed well. Throughout this whole film I kept thinking to myself the story and sequences would be much better suited to a video game. On top of that there are MAJOR plot holesWhy is the king after the bow? if world domination is on his mind then how does freeing the 'titans' going to help him achieve this goal?? Why do the titans run around like thoughtless monkeys? Why in one scene is Phaedra intent on keeping her gift of foresight and in the next scene gives up the gift to sleep with a man? Why put so much emphasis on her faith and devotion if she plans to give away her gift anyway? Why am I even asking these questions when the director has already cashed out at the bank??The final blow from this movie is through the trailer. The action sequences you see in the trailer are ALL the action sequences you will see in this movie. The trailer is substantially more exciting than the movie.Don't waste your time with this one.As for anyone calling this movie art I'd suppose they are pompous and pretentious fools who don't know what real art is. I do agree some movies can be considered 'art' but only if they are visually stunning great story great acting soundtrack etc...i.e a whole package. When a movie just has several nice pictures in it it's not art it's just trying to hide the fact that the story and dialogue is lacking..310".

It really could have been. But the plot had major holes and attempted to do too much without the development to support it. Everything just flitted between one thing and the next. One second the Virgin Oracle was determined to keep her virginity and her gift foresight. The next minute and for no apparent reason she decides she wants to give it up for the chance to be normal and has sex with the main character. This was completely and entirely just for a meaningless sex scene. They hardly interact for the rest of the movie. Beyond that there's a 20th century style dam which they are using as a wall. Okay sure but why is it in the middle of a desert with a mountain next to it that looks like it has always just been a mountain? Plot hole. And okay so Titans vs. Greek Gods it isn't original but it has the potential to be good. But why do the titans look like they were covered in gray paint and made to wear silly helmets? And why do they keep flying out of the floor in an endless stream? I really could keep going. Like why were they determined to find the bow when the King couldn't find it. So by finding it they were leaving it open to be stolen which it was... immediately. Just don't go to it. Rent Alexander or Agora or a mindless action movie by someone like Steve Austin. Just...

Human nature being what it is if you watch a film with high expectations and it lets you down it must ergo the film's fault. Usually it is. But I had occasion to watch this film two more times in different environments and with no expectations to speak of it was better in almost every way than I first remembered. And the deal closer here is Rourke. Hard to believe that in days gone by not Ancient Greece but close he was a Hollywood prettyboy playing hiimpact romantic leads. As most of you probably know he dropped out sight for a spell and then reappeared in 2008's THE WRESTLER where his letitallhangout performance blew away both critics and audiences. In 2010 he popped up again as a bad guy in the otherwise forgettable PLEASE FORGET IT Ironman 2. His casting as a uberbad guy in a super hero film caught a number of eyeballs and his performance was arguably the most memorable thing in the picture. Dennis Miller who had a nightly talk show at the time got a lot laughs by running a small clip of Rourke from IM2  a scene where Rourke's character is sauntering down a major boulevard turning cars to cinders with his magic whip and then asking the rhetorical audience in Miller's unique deadpan style I wonder if Mickey realizes he is actually in a movie? This film arrived a year after IM2 and Rourke really chews the scenery here. It is hard to keep a straight face when every second piece of dialog you have is a promise that your lineage will rule the earth for centuries to come. But Rourke pulls it off. For this unique performance and allowing for the overexpectations of audiences at the time of release I believe this film deserves a higher rating than it currently has.".

That averages out to a 6.67 movie. So that's what I went in expecting.This movie had a bit more story time than I anticipated a lot of time was spent away from epic battles but there was plenty of fighting to keep me happy. Special effects were great stylized blood was plenty but not too much Frieda Pinto is gorgeous and Henry Cavill is jacked. The acting was pretty good to be fair not very much was necessary from anyone besides Henry Cavill but none of the actors underperformed.The quality of the fight scenes was great. Not a single fight scene went by where I was like ok I waited 5 minutes for that!?. The fight with the Greek Gods was very well done although many people may disagree more on that in the next paragraph. Most of the fights are just look at Thesius... oh how he knows how to fight. But I personally couldn't care less how many people are fighting as long as the fights are well done.The fight pertaining to the Gods is seen partly in the trailers when you see people floating in mid air as they and their friends get punished continuously. It's very MatrixKung Fu style and some people didn't like that. But the way I see it these are Gods fighting not humans and legends. The fight has to have a different substance than just simple blood and guts.What really irked me were the inconsistencies with Greek Mythology and the lack luster epicness of the Eperius bow. For one the number of Gods present in this movie is 5. Zeuss Poseidon Apollo Athena and one more... as far as the movie goes they could of at least shown all of the Olympians. Also the Titans are shown as rabid monkeys against the Gods. As far as I remember they were equal to the Gods in strength and intellect. Lastly the Eperius Bow was not as epic as they had built it up to be especially the first time it's shot it sort of just happens.All in all the movie was what most people should expect from it.

But in some ways it works.The battle scenes are bloody and wellstaged and obviously influenced by 300 but the movie would have been improved by making them more frequent. This is a dark violent flick and it's easily at its best when carnage covers the screen.The story serves but it's pretty forgettable. Theseus a peasant unknowingly trained in battle by Zeus himself must stand against a vicious king who the gods are unable to touch and keep him from releasing the dreaded Titans. I don't predict many awards for best screenplay in Immortals' future but there's enough story to keep the characters moving and motivated as long as you don't think about it too hard. Despite the influence of 300 in the heavy use of slowmotion in the action scenes Immortals has its own look and tone that helps it stand apart. Both the sets and the characters are visually memorable and the movie never sinks to the generically dull depths of the recent Clash of the Titans remake even during its slower moments. Immortals never really rises above decent and won't topple 300 as the recent king of the genre but it does manage to have an exciting epic feel to it and it's entertaining enough to be worth a watch for fans of bloodsoaked sword and sandals flicks. In the end it boils down to a bombastic orgy of killing with little substance behind it but hey that's actually kind of alright with me.Oh and if you're somehow unfamiliar with how exquisitely gorgeous Freida Pinto is prepare to have your eyes opened.

	schema:reviewBody "In the trailer they mentioned prominently it was from the 300 producers probably to entice 300 fans into watching it. Well what difference does the director make then! This is from the guy who directed The Cell with Jennifer Lopez and more recently Mirror Mirror with Julia Roberts. Here the director was rather good with the visuals as he usually is but managed to tell a weak disjointed story where we don't really care about the characters or the proceedings. It felt as if some important transitional or plot scenes were left on the cutting floor no they're not in the deleted scenes. For example a few times I didn't know why certain characters were at a certain place. Finding the main artifact felt nonsensical and anticlimatic. The acting was mundane the characters kinda thin except perhaps for the gruff villain played by Mickey Rourke and Zeus in his different incarnations who were more somewhat complex and interesting. A speech by the hero obviously intended to be stirring actually felt corny and had for me the opposite effect. Perhaps worst of all the chemistry between two of the leads was absent making their romance feel rushed and unbelievable.You would think the battle scenes might have saved this. Here again they felt underwhelming as if we had seen them done better somewhere else. The exception to this would be when the gods actually battled with their super speed. Unfortunately the main menace the Titans were not only mythologically inaccurate but severely disappointing. A bunch of similarlooking savage mute humansized blokes. The halfdozen Greek gods were a bunch of mostly unidentified pretty boys and one woman with ridiculous helmets. Since this is a movie based on a myth you might expect mythological creatures. Nothing there except the humanlike Gods and Titans. Even the Minotaur was a human with a metal grid helmet. The saving grace might be the visuals that offered a kind of otherworldly surreal look similar but weaker than 300. It also had very few locations. All in all Immortals should be ashamed of even being mentioned anywhere close to the great 300. It's even weaker than the mediocre Clash of the Titans. Immortals doesn't work as an epic fantasy and it doesn't work as a decent retelling of the myth and not just because it's so inaccurate.Rating 3 out of 10 Poor".

The acting was mundane the characters kinda thin except perhaps for the gruff villain played by Mickey Rourke and Zeus in his different incarnations who were more somewhat complex and interesting. A speech by the hero obviously intended to be stirring actually felt corny and had for me the opposite effect. Perhaps worst of all the chemistry between two of the leads was absent making their romance feel rushed and unbelievable.You would think the battle scenes might have saved this. Here again they felt underwhelming as if we had seen them done better somewhere else. The exception to this would be when the gods actually battled with their super speed. Unfortunately the main menace the Titans were not only mythologically inaccurate but severely disappointing. A bunch of similarlooking savage mute humansized blokes. The halfdozen Greek gods were a bunch of mostly unidentified pretty boys and one woman with ridiculous helmets. Since this is a movie based on a myth you might expect mythological creatures. Nothing there except the humanlike Gods and Titans. Even the Minotaur was a human with a metal grid helmet. The saving grace might be the visuals that offered a kind of otherworldly surreal look similar but weaker than 300. It also had very few locations. All in all Immortals should be ashamed of even being mentioned anywhere close to the great 300. It's even weaker than the mediocre Clash of the Titans. Immortals doesn't work as an epic fantasy and it doesn't work as a decent retelling of the myth and not just because it's so inaccurate.Rating 3 out of 10 Poor";

	schema:headline " Erotica for the simplistic sadistic bicurious human";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a really stupid movie.The best thing about Immortals is the acting. John Hurt is a great actor and this role doesn't seem to take much out of him. Mickey Rourke isn't bad considering his twodimensional character and cast well because he is what some of these very good looking males will look like if the try to destroy their bodies. This makes the story utterly simplistic which is not good or bad good guys are bodybuilders with good jaw lines bad guys are the scarred ugly people who enjoy torture and murder and so on. Considering that all the actors seem so be chosen because of how good they look shirtless and that every character is two dimensional I am surprised by how good the acting is. The chief bad man Rourke murders a person every time he hears bad news which is taken straight from the worst JeanClaude van Damme movies.The first flaw I'll discuss is that no body seems to be able to act rationally. When the oracle says to the men 'stand your ground when the cloudless sky roars' paraphrased they actually flee and pretend that they followed the oracles advice. The boat would actually have made a great excuse to transport the gang of heroes to another location. Not to mention that they then wouldn't have the strange plot hole of escaping a tsunami by jumping behind a cliff.By the way why did the boat have the shape of a Dutch wooden shoe? Was it really just to make the scene change work? When a bow is found no one ever tries to gain distance from the target to actually use the bow the way it is intended and it is actually lost after only one useful use by the hero. In the scene where the heroes know it is a trap Theseus storms after the monk with the bow and doesn't think to stay on top of the cliff to shoot his arrows to the bad people below is baffling. The dam at the end which is actually a wall has a small opening in it where the hordes of bad men need to get through. Considering the obvious influence 300 has had on the style of this movie it is strange to me that the people in the narrow passage do not use the tactic which made the battle portrayed in 300 so historic closing the narrow gap by locking shields. The scene where Theseus has sex with the oracle is simply weird. The tension seems all wrong there is no chemistry and if I were to read the mood just before they kiss I'd have said that the oracle would have decided not to have sex. Oh if you are having sex like this you are not satisfying your partner The lack of character development becomes painfully obvious in this scene the growing together of the two characters consisted of maybe five lines spoken to one another something about visions being a curse or a gift. At the end the characters just separate and then Theseus dies the end. There is a point in the movie where miners are mining something around a temple it seems they are merely doing this to fill the screen. No mention about funding the army or something just people digging a hole.The graphic quality is not bad. The makers seem to have gotten the jest of how to do the action in the 300 way but do it just a bit more sloppy. The 30 seconds it takes Zeus to slam his whip into a god is a bit much especially since it doesn't help the plot much. There is a point where a soldier jumps with two feet onto an enemy shield knocking them over to anyone who says Immortals is not like 300 this exact jump is done in 300. The worst thing about the the look of the film is the idiotic costumes. The soldiers are often wearing Roman armor which I don't really care about but the gods really have the most ridiculous stuff on their heads. Aries seems to have strapped gold colored fence poles to his head in the form of a Mohawk and Poseidon has princess Leia buns made out of plastic. Also the non god characters Hyperion with a Venus fly trap helmet with bunny ears and the minotaur with a barb wire invented in 1900 or something helmet.The worst scene to me is when the gods fight the Titans. The Titans are apparently bluegrey goblins scurrying around in a hole. The gods beem in like the are the Power Rangers and at the end the battle and death of some of the five? gods seems to be pointless because Zeus just lets the mountain collapse. This part is sloppy acting since the movement Zeus makes does not imply an enormous effort.Overall this movie has some good visuals but is flawed in script logic characters dress locations bad use of source material and if it didn't have a lot of extremely bloody violence and naked people there would be no reason to go see this movie at all. A number of other movies have done parts of the visual style of Immortals but they have done it better so go see those and not this.".

I must admit i was pleasantly surprised. I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this film from beginning to end. Tarsem knew exactly what he wanted and its evident in every shot. The cinematography was magnificent the set design was superb and the costumes were just gorgeous. The fight scenes were definitely impressive and left me mumbling yeah and that what im talking about under my breath. Henry Cavill did a great job as our hero. He had a strong presence that makes me anxious to see him as the new Superman. Mickey Rourke is always a good villain but i must say his performance topped any other he played as an antagonist. Luke evans brought a power to the screen as Zeus and besides being superhot Kellan Lutz dud a good job as Poseidon giving more depth than he does in the Twilight Saga. Freida Pinto and Isabel Lucas are both gorgeous and commanded the screen as our two leading ladies. Charleg and Vlas Parlapanides did an excellent job writing the film. There were no cheesy lines or inane dialogue. Everything that happened in the film had a purpose. I was very impressed with the pacing if the film. Being only 98 minutes it wasn't too short or too long to do what it needed to do. My favorite moments was seeing the Gods take a more active role in the film. When they appear its not for show or exposition. Whenever you see a God you better believe there will be hell pay.Overall this movie is a wonderfully stylized Greek fantasy that definitely will leave you in your seat saying Oh My God. I definitely recommend seeing thus movie because it's probably one of the best films of the year. Tarsem has definitely made a fan out of me".

The story isn't anything amazing or anything like that but the cinematography the violence and the mythological powers that is portrayed in this movie makes it worth a watch.

I was prepared for the total of lack of a consistent comprehensible plot and the movie didn't let me down. I was prepared for poor acting  check! I was prepared for all kinds of anachronisms  they were all there! The story of Hyperion trying to wreak his vengeance on the gods thank you IMDb reviewers you helped me understand what the hell he was actually driving at with all this running around and butchery and the story of Theseus achieving his hero's status are intertwined in a manner worthy of a fiveyearold composing a story with nothing better to do there are not many logical links between scenes and events and no smooth unfolding of a story in general. This is what makes it so excruciatingly boring. However as I said for all that I was prepared. But I expected visuals because I still remember the Cell more than ten years since and in that film the visuals made up for the absence of a story they were a story in themselves and they evoked if not rational then at least emotional response. In this film I thought the visuals were boring monotonous and borderline ridiculous. To top it off the characters' sensibilities are thoroughly modern Sybilla actually talks about changeable future! About free will! Ye gods!. Then suddenly almost at the end of the film Theseus says something that could only be said by an ancient. I will not say what it is for that would mean spoiling it for those who haven't yet wasted their time on this piece of boring entertainment but this unexpected bit of authenticity doesn't even come near redeeming what has passed before.".

	schema:headline " Groundbreaking and colorful rendition about Greek mythology with breathtaking images and impressive battles";
	schema:reviewBody "The picture is a fun sword and sandals epic with stirring adventures  struggles  bizarre scenarios and turns out to be an acceptable story and quite entertaining . The story is very loosely based on Greek mythology  creating a potpurr of Gods and legends  mingling elements of various myths . As screen writers state that they chose to change many aspects of the ancient Greek stories to reflect the fact that the Greeks themselves often revised their mythology to conform to new ideas and knowledge . In Classical Greek mythology  Immortals were members of the second order of divine beings descending from the primordial deities and preceding the Olympian deities . Based on Mount Othrys the Titans most famously included the first twelve children of the primordial Gaia Mother Earth and Uranus Father Heaven. They were giant deities of incredible strength who ruled during the legendary Golden Age  and also composed the first pantheon of Greek deities . As they had overthrown the primordial deities the Immortal Titans were overthrown by younger gods including many of their own children  the Olympians  in the Titanomachy or War of the Titans. There were twelve Olympian gods and goddesses and they were immortal and unkillable as well . The Greeks may have borrowed this mythology from the Ancient Near East . There were only 12 titans in the myths and they were immortal and invincible . There was a war in the heavens and the Titans lost . Zeus then threw them into Tartarus  which is represented as a mountain in the movie but in the old myths was a cave at the center of the Earth with minor similarities to Hell to be imprisoned for all eternity . The picture takes Greek Gods here and there  as in the myths  Theseus Henry Cavill  he trained for 8 hours 5 days a week to get in shape for the film was actually King of Athens and in some versions a son of Poseidon Greek god of sea and Zeus' brother being played by Kellan Lutz although his legal father was King Aegeus of Athens . Theseus killed the Minotaur  a creature with the body of a man and a head of a bull imprisoned in a labyrinth depicted here as a man with a helmet made of wires and horns with the help of princess Ariadne whom he later married . In the Theseus story Crete had its capital at Knossos and its ruler was cruel King Minos  here Hyperion Mickey Rourke  he chose to do this movie instead Conan  2011 defies the Greek God  Zeus Luke Evans he appeared a year earlier as Zeus' son Apollo in Clash of Titans . Hyperion origin is from a different myth and was the name of one of the 12 Titans . Epirus Bow doesn't exist in any mythology but it might be inspired by the bow of Heracles aka Hercules which was used by the Greeks to defeat Troy in the great war . Other Gods appearing are the followings  Apollo Corey Sevier  Athena or Minerva Isabel Lucas who is the daughter of Zeus or Jupiter and Metis a daughter of the Titans and goddess of wisdom  Heracles Steve Byers a son of Zeus who was the only hero to ascend to Olympus to rule with the Gods and Poseidon  he is the Greek god of the sea equivalent to the Roman Neptune . Furthermore  Sibyl Freida Pinto though Lily Collins auditioned for a part but was turned down by director was the ancient Roman title for prophetesses . Big production that blends Greek Gods  fights  feats and spectacular images by means of Computer Generator . Violent movie combines historic events  drama and breathtaking fights . The flick packs nice settings  characters with elaborate costumes and a seamless combination of practical and CGI effects . Every little scene has been given maximum detail as gowns  environment and set design  adding too much C.G.I. backgrounds and lush frames showing overwhelming combats between Gods and humans . To achieve the effect of gods moving much quicker than humans those scenes were shot at 1000 frames per second . Brilliant and glimmer cinematography by Brandan Galvin  being done in Renaissance painting style . Vibrating and shaking musical score by Trevor Morris . This passable picture was originally directed by Tarsem Singh  though has some flaws and gaps . Tarsem Singh described his approach to the film as being like Caravaggio 1986 meets The fight Club 1999 . He frequently collaborated with the late costume designer Eiko Ishioka  until her passing she was the only designer he had worked with . Tarsem also made similar experiments filled with light  color and weird frames such as The fall The celland Mirror  Mirror .".

The picture takes Greek Gods here and there  as in the myths  Theseus Henry Cavill  he trained for 8 hours 5 days a week to get in shape for the film was actually King of Athens and in some versions a son of Poseidon Greek god of sea and Zeus' brother being played by Kellan Lutz although his legal father was King Aegeus of Athens . Theseus killed the Minotaur  a creature with the body of a man and a head of a bull imprisoned in a labyrinth depicted here as a man with a helmet made of wires and horns with the help of princess Ariadne whom he later married . In the Theseus story Crete had its capital at Knossos and its ruler was cruel King Minos  here Hyperion Mickey Rourke  he chose to do this movie instead Conan  2011 defies the Greek God  Zeus Luke Evans he appeared a year earlier as Zeus' son Apollo in Clash of Titans . Hyperion origin is from a different myth and was the name of one of the 12 Titans . Epirus Bow doesn't exist in any mythology but it might be inspired by the bow of Heracles aka Hercules which was used by the Greeks to defeat Troy in the great war . Other Gods appearing are the followings  Apollo Corey Sevier  Athena or Minerva Isabel Lucas who is the daughter of Zeus or Jupiter and Metis a daughter of the Titans and goddess of wisdom  Heracles Steve Byers a son of Zeus who was the only hero to ascend to Olympus to rule with the Gods and Poseidon  he is the Greek god of the sea equivalent to the Roman Neptune . Furthermore  Sibyl Freida Pinto though Lily Collins auditioned for a part but was turned down by director was the ancient Roman title for prophetesses . Big production that blends Greek Gods  fights  feats and spectacular images by means of Computer Generator . Violent movie combines historic events  drama and breathtaking fights . The flick packs nice settings  characters with elaborate costumes and a seamless combination of practical and CGI effects . Every little scene has been given maximum detail as gowns  environment and set design  adding too much C.G.I. backgrounds and lush frames showing overwhelming combats between Gods and humans . To achieve the effect of gods moving much quicker than humans those scenes were shot at 1000 frames per second . Brilliant and glimmer cinematography by Brandan Galvin  being done in Renaissance painting style . Vibrating and shaking musical score by Trevor Morris . This passable picture was originally directed by Tarsem Singh  though has some flaws and gaps . Tarsem Singh described his approach to the film as being like Caravaggio 1986 meets The fight Club 1999 . He frequently collaborated with the late costume designer Eiko Ishioka  until her passing she was the only designer he had worked with . Tarsem also made similar experiments filled with light  color and weird frames such as The fall The celland Mirror  Mirror .";

There was so much hype about it it just doesn't meet the expectations. There were several mythological and historical anomalies. There are some good scenes but they are few and far apart. The movie contains plenty of blood gore and violence. But be warned its not sophisticated violence as in most war movies. Its more of a sadistic type of violence.The Gods and Titans SUCK!Titans are supposed to be mountain sized powerful and almost godlike. They are definitely not supposed to look like savage cannibals.The Gods need to be more Godly. In the movie they look more like pompous kings. The weapons are all wrong. Zeus should fight with thunderbolts. Not iron chains. This not the Ghost Rider.Athena is the Goddess of wisdom. She shouldn't fight at all!!I do not know why THOR appears among Greek gods.There should be 12 gods. Not 6. Several of the most powerful gods were missing. Heracles is not a proper Greek God.I could go on forever but there is no use. The only good parts are the gods smashing heads. There is one part which is a complete ripoff from 300In this narrow tunnel their number count for nothing!Bottom line Do not expect something awesome. Do not compare with 300. Watch it if you like blood gore and sadistic violence like boiling humans.".

He was marvelous in 2000 horror thriller The Cell starring Ms. Lopez. 3 Do we treat this voiceless Henry Cavill as a hero? or a motivator? certainly not. He looks like one of the sideactors in 300. No charisma whatsoever.. 4 the romance is only .001 baked..we get to see the slim derrire..or the rear of Frieda Pinto when she is bedding Henry..the love scene is pathetic and juiceless.... just compare with Lena Heady and Gerard Butler in 300.

	schema:reviewBody "First of all I'm currently doing a degree in History and classics. I really do not understand why people get so annoyed about when characters in movies about the Greek gods are not 'true' to previous representations. For a start there are always more than one version of a Greek heroes story. that he was the son of a king is one another is that his mother was raped by Poseidon in human form of course so could have been a 'villager' like in the movie and that he was brought up be his grandfather like his mentor in the movie so actually it's not that far removed if you take it from that version. I could go on using other examples from other reviews but I think I've made my point. Also a few people are saying that the oracle having sex with him is gratuitous. Well I don't remember at any time the Oracle saying SHE was actively trying to protect her gift everyone else was doing it. Theseus guesses at her true feelings about her 'gift' and she says he's right so actually it's not that much of a shock. Also for those saying they don't interact enough after  you obviously HAVEN'T read many Greek myths p Besides it not a romance movie! I was impressed with the acting being slightly worried at first about Mickey Rourke and the CGI was good and nonintrusive there's nothing worse than fussy overdone CGIscapes ruining the feel of the movie. I actually found it had more brains than 300 which for me was very much a LAAADS WHEEEEY movie where as this although violent pretty much the whole way through never felt gratuitous and was always interestingexciting. As for the appearance of the Titans offending some people  who is to say what the Titans looked like? They were cosmic representations of different aspects of nature  and they seemed to do pretty well in the fighting stakes so not really seeing the issue there either... Although I do draw the line at Athena dying. That's just ridiculous. I think people go to these films with their 'critical hats' on and just ruin any enjoyment that you can get out of a film like this. Just relax and enjoy the 'ride'! My boyfriend thought it was the best film he'd seen all year and better in lots of ways than 300 too. Just my opinion anyways!".

Warfare's farreaching ramifications touch us individually and globally even into the 21st Century and beyond.

I love the actors and I love how Nichols directed it. However I was disappointed of the changes they made where's Dunbar? He was like my 2nd favorite character. He was Yoyo's best friend.... Also they said it was Hungry Joe who was cut in half by McWatt but it was really Kid Sampson I could see how they didn't want to have too many characters to keep up with in the book I felt like that was true but still Hungry Joe was...amazing he was hilarious. Also I'm not sure if I liked how Nately died opposed to the books version. I suppose it made more since to kill him off when Milo's deal the bombing thing but it was when he died in combat mission that really broke Yossarian. I think Jon Voight did an fantastic job of Milo he was really how I pictured Milo I was really excited about that. The poignant walk through Rome that Yossarian takes was so perfect as well. But all in all this was an excellent portrayal of the book I totally imagined this movie the settings what Yossarian looked like everything pretty much as I was reading the book.".

But the story is the least important element of either fine books or movies. No intelligent viewer looks for sameness in an adaptation.I think the reason is simple. We are happy to accept war as heroic. Deep down that's what we believe whether as an inescapable fact of evolution or of chauvanistic indoctrination. Against this backdrop we apply the stuff of our apparent convictions that war is funny MASH the escape movies or grossly brutal and confusing Platoon the first part of Pvt Ryan which then reverts to the noble. We just cannot accept the view that war comes from stupidity and selfishness because it convinces that we all of us every one is at root stupid and selfish. This movie is so good it convinces of that fact and that's why no one wants to watch it. So no one is convinced. That's the catch.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are several films I consider perfect. Not all are brilliant.  There are quite a few I consider brilliant and only a few of those are  perfect. Catch22 is not only perfect but if there is a stronger word  than brilliant it's that too.  The camera shots the editing the sound the pacing the casting the  flawless acting the incredibly complex staging of many scenes all  done to perfection. Mike Nichols directs films sparingly but his list  of titles reads like a who's who of the greatest classics. Catch22 is  his masterpiece as far as I'm concerned. You may not know that he  earned an Oscar not for this a Tony and an Emmy all as best  director. He may be unique in this regard but I don't know.  The book was absolutely wonderful. No movie can be an exact depiction  of the bookit just doesn't work that way. However this movie  delivers the story spirit and theme not to mention the egregious  comedy of the book better than I ever would have imagined.  I could write a whole book on what I like about this film and I won't  but after all my sweeping superlatives I need to cite a few concrete  examples.  1. The mess hall conversation with Martin Sheen and others very  complex with overlapping dialog wonderful facials and voice  characterization by Sheen and a few timely cuts not to mention the  incredible rapid fire lines delivered by Arkin.  2. The runway scene with Doc and Yossarian in which the essence of  catch22 is explained the soundthe roar of the engines that almost  but not quite drown out the dialog in spots the incredible inverted  shot of Doc handing Yossarian his hat and responding it's catch22  the best there is! Then the incredible visual of the planes taking  offstaying with the shot showing the sheer beauty of it and pausing  from the story for a minute so we can catch out breath. I would say  Nichols is Hitchcock's equal at providing incredible visuals and being  innovative at doing it.  3. The scene about Nately's 60 shares of MM Enterprises. The cut to  the close up delivery of then they'll understand. Exquisitely  chilling line.  4. The endless stream of priceless cameo scenes Orson Welles  Take  that man out and shoot him. The movie is outrageously funny the  script and dialog are incredibly witty and intelligent the acting is  inspired the theme is clear without touting itself at all.  A final aside for those of you who were not in the military I  wouldn't be surprised if you thought the whole military depiction was  just silly beyond words but I can assure you that it's only one or two  degrees of hyperbole. I had my share of Yossarianlike experiences in  the navy.".

I'm not an unrealistic person so I understand that they had to cut out scenes and characters and subplots to condense it for the film. Overall of course it lost some of its greatest moments which are in the ironic humor of the narrative style of the book. But it was not a bad film at all. In fact I thought it was one of the best adaptations I have seen. I think almost everything you see on screen happens in the book.   Apart from that it was extremely well casted. The characters were just as I have envisioned them in my head while reading the novel except that Major Major shrank about a foot... but that's not matter because Bob Newhart was great anyway. The cinematography was beautiful the acting was awesome Alan Arkin was perfect and the flashbacks to Snowden were done stylishly and surrealistically. Basically it's a good movie. But it's an even better movie if you've read the book and you know exactly what is going on in some of the characters' heads and what is going on outside of the scenes we see in the film.

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Mike Nichols the screenplay by Buck Henry is totally brilliant. The novel by Joseph Heller is itself brilliantly written with nuances and subtleties many readers miss. Henry caught the gist of the novel and got it on screen using the device of returning again and again to an airplane with a scene we don't fully see showing us a little more each time then fading to white as we get the voice over of the next scene. We get the circularity of the novel and the scattered sanity of Yossarian as he struggles to keep his shredded reality less tattered if not totally intact.The cast is incredible. Nichols gives us an allstar cast without the drivel of such disasters as A Bridge Too Far and The Longest Day. The cast includes Alan Arkin Martin Balsam Richard Benjamin Buck Henry Bob Newhart Anthony Perkins Paula Prentiss Martin Sheen John Voight and Orson Welles among many many others.Henry had to make a movie out of the novel so he made some hard choices excising characters and situations that some find disappointing. My suggestion is to see the movie as the movie without comparing it to the book on the other hand I'm astounded at how well Henry captured the essence of Heller and his work. Jon Voight is chilling as Minderbinder who is in my very humble opinion the lynchpin of the movie. When Minderbinder tells Yossarian Then they'll understand the full impact of World War II and who's the real enemy shatters Yossarian's weakening sanity.For me the end of the novel and the end of the movie are unsatisfying but the ride is still worth it.Trivial notes concerning the people involved in the movie. Mike Nichols also directed The Graduate with Anne Bancroft and Dustin Hoffman. Charles Grodin Arfy Aardvark was supposed to play Benjamin but couldn't agree on a salary with Nichols so Bancroft suggest Dustin Hoffman to Nichols  she'd heard about Hoffman from her husband Mel Brooks who had just signed Hoffman for his movie The Producers. Hoffman bailed on Brooks and did The Graduate instead. Norman Fell Sgt. Towser played Benjamin's landlord in a short scene also involving Richard Dreyfus in The Graduate. Bob Balaban Capt. Orr was in Midnight Cowboy with Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman of course. Buck Henry wrote a TV series for Richard Benjamin Major Danby who is married to Paula Prentiss Nurse Duckett. Orson Welles General Dreedle did the voiceover narration for Mel Brooks's History of the World. Mel Brooks and Buck Henry developed Get Smart. Bob Newhart Major Major Major and Peter Bonerz Capt. McWatt were in The Bob Newhart Show together. And Susanne Benton Dreedle's WAC had a completely unrelated role in the totally unrelated A Boy and his Dog. Hollywood is a small town.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mike Nicholl's 1970 film of Joseph Heller's book 'Catch 22'  published 9 years earlier  is set in a US bomber unit during the latter part of the Second World War in Italy. Heller himself served in Corsica as a bombardier on B25 Mitchell bombers the aircraft which feature in the film. He flew 60 missions. Buck Henry who plays Lieutenant Colonel Korn in the film wrote the screenplay.We find our hero bombardier Captain John Yosarian Alan Arkin as entrenched and battlecrazed as the other confused and confusing members of this unusual army air force unit. In conversation with Colonel Cathcart Martin Balsam and Lt. Col Korn Buck Henry as the film opens the substance of his conversation is lost beneath the roar of aircraft taking off nearby. As he walks away from the conversation he is murdered by a civilian who is apparently gardening near to the base of the bombed out operations tower.The course of the film takes us on the nightmarish journey leading up to this apparently motiveless crime. It has to be understood that where human beings of any age or nationality are forced to remain in circumstances that are sufficiently challenging and unremittingly lifethreatening they evolve a series of unique and often incomprehensible strategies to protect what's left of their own sanity. As the film develops we begin to get a feel for how each individual in the unit fights their own personal battle to preserve their sanity in this intractible situation. Among these people Yosarian seems to be rather special. Not the sharpest tool in the box yet he alone seems to keep some fragile sense of what is intrinsically absurd in his surroundings and what is simply the product of the confusion in the minds of the other members of his unit. Or maybe we just get sucked into Yosarian's own particular madness and see all the others from his own beguiling perspective.Along the way we get to know the company Doctor Jack Gilford who is the first to try and explain 'Catch 22' which turns out to be the meaningless apparent solution to a conundrum that seems to underpin everything the army thinks or does. It's as meaningless as the old rhyme 'Mother may I go out to swim ?' 'Yes my darling daughter.. Hang your clothes on a hickory limb But don't go near the water !'Doc Daneeka hates flying so flies on paper as an absent passenger. But when the plane he is logged as flying in crashes even the suggestible Sgt Towser Norman Fell is so switched off and tuned out that he can no longer believe the evidence of his own senses. He is no longer sure what he is permitted to acknowledge as real and happening.Major Danby Richard Benjamin leads the flight briefings apparently under the impression that he is fronting in a TV commercial for soappowder aimed at suburban housewives. While messofficer Milo Minderbinder Jon Voight manages to avoid combat duty by bartering most of the operational equipment for contraband returning later having cut a deal to bomb their own base.This film is a tremendous portrait of ordinary people in really extraordinary circumstances. By the time we see Yosarian endearingly using the army's twisted logic to gently seduce an Italian girl who has become more accustomed to bartering intimacy for cigarettes and stockings we realise that we too have somehow finally cracked.".

And through stunning visual work with crisp and deadpan dialogue the 'Catch22' is effortlessly able to capture the immense spirit of Heller's novel and at the same time stand alone as a master film.'Catch22' takes place on the Mediterranean Island of Pianosa and the film has a strange narrative time order which mainly includes flashback. Yossarian Alan Arkin a bombardier during World War II walks out just after a meeting with the high command and is stabbed. While lying on the surgery table he begins to remember the strange events of the war including the catch that doesn't allow him to go home catch22. In order for a person to be grounded from flying the set number of missions which is constantly being raised by the mean spirited Colonel Catchart Martin Balsam he must declare himself insane to Doctor Daneeka Jack Gilford . The catch is that by declaring himself insane and requesting to not fly anymore missions he has proved himself sane! Through recalling major events such as the painful death of the new gunner Snowden his romantic entanglement with a prostitute in Rome and other crazy wartime events Yossarian slowly unravels the story. The world seems to be slowly disintegrating around him as a his friends either go crazy or are killed in combat and at the same time mess hall officer Milo Minderbinder Jon Voight is constantly taking away plane equipment in order to make a profit. The difficult task of adapting such a complex plot from the novel was solved handled breathtaking skill. While some characters major or minor do not make the transition from Heller's novel to Henry's screenplay the spirit of the novel is captured. The surreal feeling of wartime and the bizarre and comedic events that take place are stunningly well delivered.The cast does a good job of taking their characters and elevating them. Yossarian is arguably one of the most enjoyable characters in literary history and Arkin gives a very well rounded performance as a man extremely paranoid about the war but for good reason. The supporting cast including Sheen Voight Welles and even Henry himself as Colonel Korn gives able to support to the events of the story although the main events really encompass around Yossarian.'Catch22' was released in 1970 three years after Mike Nichols' popular film 'The Graduate' for which he nabbed a Best Director Academy Award. It also came four years after his adaptation of Edward Albee's play 'Who's Afraid of Virgnia Woolf?' Nichols' debut piece that showcased his ability to handle sharp dialogue and direct a poignant story and ensemble from another popular literary work. Nichols fresh off the success of these two films along with a directing Oscar and another nomination directs 'Catch22' with a strongly appeasing visual style and a remarkable subtlety. Even during the more hectic scenes such as a raid on the airbase Nichols is able to continue his momentum throughout. The film as mentioned many times in this review looks absolutely stunning and Nichols' is also able to effectively command his large ensemble. Buck Henry who collaborated in the writing of 'The Graduate' manages to not only capture the extremely significant and memorable dialogue of 'Catch22' but at the same time capture the pure depth and at times cynicism which author Heller portrayed.In the end 'Catch22' proves a success in its storytelling and visual style. While the film overall fell in the shadow of the popularity of Robert Altman's 'MASH' which also took major Oscar nominations instead the film nonetheless stands out amongst its time proving itself an extremely tight and well done adaptation of a complex piece of literature.1010".

I called the station and pleaded with someone to tell me the name of the movie. They did and the following day I ran out and bought it. I'm a filmmaker and love those type of films. I thought the pace was excellent quick and jerky in the beginning then settling in the middle and then up again at the end. Especially when Yossarin made his escape. I love the clever way in which the pilot I forget his name was practicing and planning his escape.I also agree with Andy's point about the book. I read the book by Joseph Heller much later and felt the film and the movie were two different entities not to be judged the same.There is no way to escape the great lines in this film. Especially the explanation about what a 'catch 22' is by Doc Daneeka to Yossarin. It was delivered with such length patience and a matter of fact way that made it hilarious to me. That was some of the funniest stuff in cinema history...That's some catch that catch 22! It's the best there isss!".

He devises a scheme to have himself grounded as crazy so he can leave the war. However his plan may backfire due to the so called catch22 law.

Yossarian is QUINTESSENTIAL Arkin. He knows that the concept of war is completely insane and eventually comes to realize that the big brass has it's own private agenda. He and the other men in his squadron are mere pawns in this exercise and Yossarian wants NO part of it.

Another feature is the irony and gallows humor that comes through so much so that it could been mistaken for a British movie because there is no relapse into the normal Hollywood clichs.

This movie is a mustsee in particular in todays world with its warped values of profiteering corruption abuse of power lying cheating and claims of being guided by 'higher' forces.

It is simultaneously funny and tragic and this material fits naturally with the cinematic talents of Buck Henry and Mike Nichols.  They achieve the same tone as Heller's book but with requisite condensation even if this film had been twice as long it wouldn't have been able to capture everything in the book which is not a condemnation.The book runs in circles chronologically so does the film.  The book repeats the Catch 22 theme on almost every page it is certainly the focus of most dialogue the film isn't as rife with its references but is more explicit when invoking the Catch.The tragedy of Snowden is a dramatic focal point for both unfortunately the film builds it up more due to its comparative brevity but falls short in explicating the relevance.Fortunately the adaptation works incredibly well on several levels.  In terms of characterization Alan Arkin IS Yossarian Anthony Perkins IS Chaplain Tappman and Bob Newhart IS Major Major albeit briefly.  The dialogue which closely follows the novel for the most part works as well orally as in the written form.  And the insanity of war which underlies all of the book is well represented.As a creative work this film is impossible to divorce from the book which is difficult to say about many adaptations.  As a creation of its own it suffers some without knowledge of the base material and as an adaptation of that material it is bound to disappoint fans of the original.  There's that Catch again.  Viewed with a balance between the two positions if that's possible it works extremely well and shows its depth with each viewing in the same way the book does with each reading.".

John Yossarian gets a permission to leave the war but he gets stabbed.Now we see all the crazy phases of this crazy war.We see men in the air wanting to be anywhere else but there.Mike Nichols is the director of Catch22 1970.It's based on the novel by Joseph Heller.I haven't read the book.I probably should.The movie is a real good satirical look on the war topic.Catch22 makes a statement that war is not good.But it can make a good movie.This movie is filled with loony characters.And those actors and fine comedians portraying those characters are just priceless.Alan Arkin plays Yossarian who tries to prove that he's lunatic so he doesn't have to go flying and bombing.Martin Balsam is the lousy Colonel Cathcart who wants to increase the number of flights.Bob Newhart's entrance into the movie is memorable.He plays this nervous and stuttering Mr. Major who becomes a Major.That's Major Major.Very easy to remember.The legendary Jack Gilford is terrific as Doc Daneeka.Art Garfunkel who we know also from his singing career does his movie debut playing Captain Nately.Gina Rovere plays Nately's whore.Bob Balaban is great as Capt. Orr who was in Sweden when we last heard of him.Charles Grodin does another great role as the pipe smoking Aardvark.The legendary big man Orson Welles plays Brigadier General Dreedle who would execute the soldiers if he could.Austin Pendleton is wonderful playing Lt.Col. Moodus his soninlaw.Susanne Benton is Dreedle's WAC.Norman Fell is First Sgt. Towser.Peter Bonerz plays Capt.J.S. McWatt who slices one soldier in half with his plane and then crashes himself to the mountain.Bruce Kirby father of the late Bruno Kirby is Doctor.Collin Wilcox plays the part of Nurse Cramer.The movie is full of funny and zany stuff.It's hilarious when Arkin's Yossarian and Grodin's Aardvark are in the cockpit together without any parachutes and Yossarian is panicking while Aarfy stays calm smoking his pipe.And we see Yossarian getting a medal from Dreedle without any clothes on.And of course the bunch of horny soldiers staring at Dreedle's WAC.Or when Chaplain Tappman goes to see Cathcart and he's sitting on a toilet.Mike Nichols told Steven Soderbergh on the DVD commentary that it was inspired by something the young Elizabeth Taylor experienced with the MGM chief Louis B. Mayer.It's often also very serious like when Yossarian tries to help the dying soldier Snowden.The movie moves somewhere around surrealism and dreamlike state.You see in flashbacks all the events that have taken place.Except that those flashbacks seem more like a dream that Yossarian is having.Places can change quickly or the screen can be filled with whiteness and Yossarian finds himself in the plane and hears through the intercom said by Dobbs Help him! Help him! Yossarian Help who? Dobbs Help the bombardier! Yossarian I'm the bombardierI'm all right.Dobbs Then help HIM help HIM! And there lies Snowden covered with blood and you also see the guts falling out of his body. It reminds me of Franz Kafka and his character K from The Trial when Yossarian walks in the dark streets of Rome and he sees dead girl killed by Aarfy.Then in Aarfy's room he says they're coming to arrest Aarfy but they arrest him instead of going AWOL.The movie bombed both critically and commercially which is a shame.Catch22 makes a clear point that there is no point in war.And it does it brilliantly.".

It certainly ranks with Carnal Knowledge and the Graduate as the best pieces of work Mike Nichols ever made.  Alan Arkin gives by far the best performance of his entire career.  The rest of the cast is nearly perfect.  It is a long movie and moves at a very quick clip.  Like 2001 A Space Odyssey it begs to be viewed again and again.  I love the closeup photography which adds to the sense of claustrophobia  combustibility of the insane war situation of the characters.  There are no panoramic vistas of Italy here. In fact Italy has probably never looked so ugly in a movie.  I love the way the action moves from scene to scene based on the thoughts of the characters rather then strictly chronologically  a technique Quentin Tarantino has utilized throughout his more recent career.  Unlike most of the rest of you I love the pacing.  I love the hilarious fastpaced first hour of the film and then I love the slower somber horrific second hour. Later I read the novel and while it's certainly true that everything in the novel could not possibly have been used in the movie I prefer to judge the movie strictly on its own merits.  It seems as though most of you prefer to compare the two.  I always like to see the movie first.  Case in point I believe I liked the World According To Garp so much because I had never read the novel before  I had no preconceived notions of what the characters looked like or how they should behave.  Then when I read the novel I realized that all the action of the book could not possibly have been used in the film but the film gave me a good solid basis from which to begin reading the book.  Was the movie is good as the book?  Of course not.  Is it ever?  Was To Kill A Mockingbird as good as the book.  Again of course not.  But didn't you love the movie anyway.  Same with Catch22. NOT comparing it to the book but comparing it strictly to every other movie I've ever seen it ranks as my favorite war movie of all time my favorite comedy of all time my favorite film of 1970 a year full of good movies and one of my favorites period.  It is a classic.  Rent it.  Watch it over and over again.  It's well worth it!".

The dialog is pretty dumb in spots.This is also unique because they can't seem to figure out how long this film runs. When I first saw it on VHS the box said it was 102 minutes but it was really between 112115 minutes. When the DVD came out it also said 102 but only ran 99 minutes.

Apparently he submitted and initial cut that ran over three hours and was then distraught when it was deemed too long and culled to a lean 90 minutes.As a viewer I can only pass judgment based upon what I see and I can sympathise with both parties. For one I cannot fathom sitting through another 90 minutes of this eyevomit but on the other hand it seems that an absolutely insane editing decision renders the viewing experience incomprehensible.The upshot of that is as always noone wins.Consider this Anne Jodie Foster is an avantgarde artiste who witnesses a murder within approximately 27 seconds of entering a 'bad neighbourhood'.This moment of incredibly inopportune timing puts both mob and the FBI on her trail after she refuses to testify and shoots through to pursue a lifetime on the run in disguise.Dennis Hopper plays Milo the elite hitman hired by the mob to eliminate Anne and put an end to this nonsense only Milo is apparently entranced by Anne's artwork and almost instantly changes from a cold blooded hitman into a creepy stalkerrapist.Now. While all this is indeed mostly reprehensible it is not yet implausible. But wait there's more I would ordinarily warn of Spoilers to a 20 year old film here but they are blabbed all over the back of the DVD cover so I don't feel so bad. After Milo kidnaps Anne threatens her life forces her to don sexy a word that should never appear in the same sentence as Jodie Foster lingerie and rapes her  her words  we cut abruptly to a scene apparently only a short while later where they are both very much in genuine love.Wait. What the fck? Anyway the rest of this godawful mess exists if you care to find it. I wouldn't suggest it. Repeatedly punch yourself in the groin instead it's more fun and burns more calories. Unfortunately for me I didn't take that option and was still sitting glassy eyed when the credits rolled The only other thing worth mentioning is that this stain of a film actually boasts a topnotch cast of actors punching well below their weight Fred Ward Joe Pesci John Turturro Dean Stockwell Catherine Keener and Charlie Sheen all wasted parts of their lives appearing in it.As for the 'headliners' Jodie Foster was always miscast in a role that demanded 'sexy' and Dennis Hopper overacts to sht in this film. If that isn't enough he adopts a ridiculous and annoying accent. Not being an American I have no idea if the accent is authentic or not and frankly I don't care all I will say is that if it is legit perhaps it is advisable to simply not have characters from that particular region in film from this point on.Like this film there are things that don't need to exist.Final Rating  3.5  10. If I was Dennis Hopper and had to live with the realisation that I was even partially responsible for BackTrack  CatchFire  CinematicTurd I wouldn't seek to remove the name Dennis Hopper from the film I would seek to remove myself from Dennis Hopper.".

Unfortunately for me I didn't take that option and was still sitting glassy eyed when the credits rolled The only other thing worth mentioning is that this stain of a film actually boasts a topnotch cast of actors punching well below their weight Fred Ward Joe Pesci John Turturro Dean Stockwell Catherine Keener and Charlie Sheen all wasted parts of their lives appearing in it.As for the 'headliners' Jodie Foster was always miscast in a role that demanded 'sexy' and Dennis Hopper overacts to sht in this film. If that isn't enough he adopts a ridiculous and annoying accent. Not being an American I have no idea if the accent is authentic or not and frankly I don't care all I will say is that if it is legit perhaps it is advisable to simply not have characters from that particular region in film from this point on.Like this film there are things that don't need to exist.Final Rating  3.5  10. If I was Dennis Hopper and had to live with the realisation that I was even partially responsible for BackTrack  CatchFire  CinematicTurd I wouldn't seek to remove the name Dennis Hopper from the film I would seek to remove myself from Dennis Hopper.";

	schema:headline " Even a hit man needs love...";
	schema:reviewBody "This film mixes some features rarely found together mob violence guns murder chases and crashes a woman in jeopardy... AND some understated humor wouldyabelieve romance and kindness to animals and a happy ending of sorts.Dennis Hopper took his name off the cut version which apparently omits among others parts of scenes featuring Jodie Foster's nudity. This is the version I saw and even thus cut I give the film a 7.The plot is straightforward a hitman Dennis Hopper hired to kill a woman Jodie Foster who witnessed a mob murder gives her the option of staying alive and being his. Then since he defaulted on his assignment they must flee mob reprisal.My relatively high rating is based on Hopper's direction and on the acting principally of the two main stars. Joe Pesci and Dean Stockwell contribute wryly amusing mafioso figures.This is certainly not a comedy or romance film nor is it intended to be. Nor is it warm human drama. It's not at all slapstick or maudlin.What impressed me most were Hopper's characterization and the scenes of their developing relationship. Hopper's Milo is a professional killer a man of little polish contrasting the wheelchairridden Vincent Price as the mob boss.But a man's a man for all that. Especially good is a scene early in their relationship in which the hitman expresses his awed smittenness for his thencaptive. His plainspoken awkwardness shows lowkey the loneliness and vulnerability of a man who has not experienced much love in his life.And if you think a woman in such a situation could never respond favorably albeit gradually you don't know much about women  and I don't mean the Stockholm Syndrome? that phenomenon of hostages warming up to their captors. The dynamics of their relationship  the gradual subtle shifting of their feelings and reactions  are masterfully but quietly almost incidentally portrayed by Foster and especially Hopper. This film is certainly in the European style.Still you action fans shouldn't stay away though not much gore there is a sufficiency of sinister dread gratuitous violence and crashings and burnings.".

	schema:reviewBody "Backtrack aka Catchfire is one of those classic Alan Smithee cases but unlike say David Lynch's Dune it's hard to feel too sorry for the filmmaker in the case of producers fiddling with the original vision. Dennis Hopper's original cut of the film was three hours which is more akin to a move out of Erich von Stroheim maybe it is genius in its full form but perhaps Hopper would have been better just taking what is a halfbitter halfsweet neonoir with pitch black comedy and crazy romance as a shorter feature. Is the question more that a 3 hour cut may still be a mess rather than it's a lost masterpiece? Originally Easy Rider had a fate like this with Hopper's original cut something like 4 hours then trimmed to 95 minutes it was great. A Magnificent Ambersons butchering it also is definitely not. No tears are shed over BacktrackCatchfire's status.Matter of fact there is a 2 hour director's cut which somewhat sadly is hard to track down. So taking into account this 98 minute studio cut studio in a loose term since Vestron is no longer even around it's bound to have flaws. To give Hopper his credit a lot of this is due to a choppy rhythm sometimes there's a spectacular cut i.e. when he jumps from a rooftop it cuts right away to him opening a drawer in a room and sometimes it really does feel like a little extra detail or moment is excised in favor of keeping the plot going.It's not a bad plot either if somewhat typical in the film noir tradition a woman has one of those freak chance of occurrences on a road as her tires go flat on a highway and walking along the side of the road she sees in a wasteland a mob hit. The mobsters see her she escapes in time goes to the cops and then when the mob comes by and kills her boyfriend she goes on the run  not taking into account a strange soulful hitman is on her trail more as a stalker than a killer leading to a very challenging moment halfway where the gears shift in tone.The first half is fairly fun as a chase movie and has some surprises mostly in cameos that had me smile Vincent Price and shaking my head and laughing like I was having a hallucination Bob Dylan with Hopper creating what looks to be another in a line of classic psychos he has the skill of a puzzlesolver following Foster's trail and sometimes plays the saxophone to relax. The mood also reflects wonderfully a sense of the noir with Foster changing her look blonde wig and black jacket with the conventional jazz music put behind her. When he finally tracks her down however there's a possibly great scene Hopper with a tie around her neck and handcuffs on her hands gives Foster a choice either die right now or be mine so that she would be under his total control. There's such tense acting here by the leads that it promises that this will lead to an electrifying second half.This is not the case. Instead we get a fairly quickly unfolding of a romance oddly enough as Hopper's quasicaptive finally falls for her sort of sensitive and awkward hitman and there's even a weirdly cute scene where Hopper fulfills a secret that she has which is to have lots of pink Hostess cakes! There's a sort of absurdity here that maybe echoes Bunuel it's kind of sadistically dangerous and at the same time starts to make less sense even as it ratchets up some memorable baroque images the burning figure at night right before Hopper goes into Foster's room to take her sort of hostage. The acting isn't bad either but again the sense of rhythm is off and it's hard to look past that as the film is what it is and has to be seen like that.As a curiosity it's surely a mustsee  it's got a who's who of stars and character actors from Charlie Sheen to Price to Joe Pesci to Catherine Keener to Jon Tuturro to Paulie from the Sopranos  though it's hard to exactly call it a very good movie. Too much of it ticks and tocks with a near originality to ignore it but it's too flawed to see as some work of tortured genius either.".

The idea of a hitman giving his prospective hit a choice of death or come with me with on a provisional basis is a good one.  The cinematography is nice also with some shots of the American midwest I suspect. The supporting actors are a refreshing bunch as well including Vincent Price nice to see him away from all those creepy horror movies of the 50s and 60sand Dean Stockwell who is a very likable and I think an underrated actor may be best known in Quantum Leap as Al.

Joe Pesci and Charlie Sheen are missing from the credits perhaps because they insisted on it. John Turturro has since thankfully shown great skill Quiz Show but in this he must have been sleepwalking. Jodie Foster was ever pleasant to look at but even her talent couldn't bring the stillborn dialogue and maimed story to life. Hopper's ludicrous accent was at least funny. Vincent Price sat under a fancy hat and greatcoat in a stretch limo and looked suitably glum.Stockholm syndrome could not account for Anne's Foster sudden change of heart toward her captor. Empathy may develop but most people don't feel moved enough by it to start looking for the bedroom. A professional hitman would never allow himherself to fall in love with a target unless they were already thinking of getting out of the game though perhaps that was the point. The final section of the movie the escape from the mob in a helicopter had me looking at my watch but to be honest I'd been doing that from about ten minutes in. If you find any of it believable there may be a brat of a movielet somewhere within but this version was worthy of going straight to Betamax and thence to the bin.I'm wondering if qaaludes were involved somewhere. For example Easy Rider was not great because of what it was but because of what it represented and how it resonated with counterculture people at the time. Mr. Hopper probably lived a lot from the fat of that. His best role remains as the photojournalist in Apocalypse Now and that was because he wasn't really acting everybody was stoned.".

Vincent Price sat under a fancy hat and greatcoat in a stretch limo and looked suitably glum.Stockholm syndrome could not account for Anne's Foster sudden change of heart toward her captor. Empathy may develop but most people don't feel moved enough by it to start looking for the bedroom. A professional hitman would never allow himherself to fall in love with a target unless they were already thinking of getting out of the game though perhaps that was the point. The final section of the movie the escape from the mob in a helicopter had me looking at my watch but to be honest I'd been doing that from about ten minutes in. If you find any of it believable there may be a brat of a movielet somewhere within but this version was worthy of going straight to Betamax and thence to the bin.I'm wondering if qaaludes were involved somewhere. For example Easy Rider was not great because of what it was but because of what it represented and how it resonated with counterculture people at the time. Mr. Hopper probably lived a lot from the fat of that. His best role remains as the photojournalist in Apocalypse Now and that was because he wasn't really acting everybody was stoned.";

And then there is Jodie Foster who I'm not usually very fond of watching and the main man himself. Hopper does lumber himself with an accent he seems not really to be able to manage but the chemistry between the two is unmistakable and a delight to watch. The dialogue red hot at the start gets a bit groggy towards the end and I see Alex Cox is part credited with the script another name withdrawn.

Or nonconnected collection of shocking images that include virgin beauty contest the winner of which would marry a billionaire Mr. Kapital John Vernon with golden penis an intercourse in Eiffel Tour that ends up with a spasm a dinner party with the members of Viennese commune Friedrichshof a revolutionary siren vampire Anna Planeta who sails a riverboat with a huge Karl Marx head on its bow on the canals of Amsterdam and lures men and young boys aboard with her seductive songs for sex candies and death? Sweet Movie is all that and it shocks you even more and I think it is a good and deep movie. It is extremely disturbing and it really tests its viewers on how much and for how long they would endure watching some of very disgusting stuff but everything what happens on screen does make sense and does prove the writer director's many points. Actually first hour or so is a wild and funny surreal black comedysatire of which my most beloved filmmaker Don Luis Bunuel would be proud. The two scenes closer to the end really push all possible envelopes. After I found out that the participants in the commune scene were actually the real members of Friedrichshof the Viennese commune that had been founded and run by artistfilmmakerpainter Otto Meuhl and everything we see is pretty much real I was shocked even more. Dusan Makavejev explains in the interview on the Criterion disc who the people are and why they engage in the shocking activities. From what I understood the acts of people urinating on each other indulging in emetophilia coprophilia were the part of Wiener Aktionismus or Viennese Actionism the Art movement which is remembered for the willful transgressiveness of its naked bodies destructiveness and violence. Makavejev added that what those people were doing to themselves and one another was also a part of the group therapy. Whatever it was I had to fastforward some of the scene. The most disturbing and important scene in the movie and it is often overlooked by the viewers and critics is a real footage of the 1943 discovery of mass graves at Katyn Forest by Germany after its armed forces had occupied the big European part of the former USSR in 1941.From Wikipedia The term Katyn massacre originally referred to the massacre at Katyn Forest near villages of Katyn and Gnezdovo about 12 miles 19 km west of Smolensk Russia of Polish military officers confined at the Kozelsk prisonerofwar camp in 1940. Estimates of the number of executed persons ranges from 15000 to 21768.The Soviet Union continued to deny responsibility for the massacres until 1990 when Mikhail Gorbachev in his attempt to openness acknowledged that the NKVD People Committee of Internal Affairs later known as KGB  Committee of State Security secret police had in fact committed the massacres and the subsequent coverup. The Russian government has admitted Soviet responsibility for the massacres although it does not classify them as war crimes or as acts of genocide. Including the footage of the war crimes of such scale that were completely unknown to the West during the high point of the Cold War and trying to get attention to those crimes and acknowledge their victims was a courageous act from Makavejev. As he said in the end of his interview  as long as we remember the ones who died they are not dead.Reading the reviews and comments about Sweet Movie I realized that some posters were puzzled and somehow confused with the revolutionary part of the story that involves Anna Planeta and her killing boat. Since I also came in from the Cold like Dusan Makavejev did his many references to the history of Eastern Europe of the last century including two World Wars and Revolutions make a lot of sense to me. For those who want to learn more I highly recommend watching featurette with the film scholar Dina Lordanova. This 20 minutes long documentary may help you to understand better what is behind all the shocking imagery and what Makavejev wanted to say. I already mentioned interview from 2006 with the directorwriter which is very interesting. The last featurette presents Anna Prucnal who talks about the impact Sweet Movie made in her life and she sings the song The Urchins Down In the Meadow in Italian it is performed in Greek in the movie during the Katyn Forest scene. Pier Paolo Pasolini wrote the Italian lyrics for the song.Senior Pasolini I think I am ready for your movie now.".

Finally after months of being on an amazon.com waiting list I checked Ebay and 1 copy was available. Sweet Movie is very bizarre surreal funny and at times disgusting. It's like Alejandro Jodorowky and John Waters teamed up to make a film. There are so many strange images in this film I can't even remember everything I witnessed. The story concerns a girl who enters a virginity pageant and wins. She marries a rich oil tycoon with a golden penis. She doesn't want to stay with him so he has a muscular man pack her in a suitcase and ship her to Paris. There she meets a Spanish singer and they have sex in public and get stuck together. At the same time another lady by the name of Anna Planet is on a Marxist ship she gets kinky with a sailor and kills him while having sex in a pile of sugar. She also uses candy to seduce children. Although she strips in front of the kids and this scene is extremely uncomfortable to watch Makavejev leaves the sex off screen as the kid goes behind a curtain. Miss Virginity Carol Laure is not so virgin like now as she joins the strange anarchist sex antics of The Vienna Aktionists. This is when the film starts to become repulsive. They urinate on each other smear feces on one another vomit dance naked and many other depraved acts. Then later we see actress Carol Laure masturbating in a vat of chocolate. Although Sweet Movie sounds disgusting it's actually pretty funny. In the first part I was laughing in the second part gasping. To top it all off it's somewhat a musical! I can't get the theme song out of my head. Is there life on the earth? Is there life after birth? sing it with me Sweet Movie is a very important work of world cinema.

	schema:reviewBody "Another reviewer here wrote that this film is like Pasolini's Salo as a comedy  that's best description of it I can think of.Sweet Movie is definitely flawed as is the brilliant Salo some politicalsocial messages are a bit heavy handed and it's not half as subtle or subtly crafted as Makavejev's earlier films. But maybe that's the point. You make a movie with Viennese Actionists you're not going to get a very subtle film.Makavejev is bizarrely forgotten or dismissed by critics and audiences alike these days just look at the supercilious reviews for this film and WR in a certain Londonbased film guide!. Personally I think he is as great a director as Bunuel or Godard. In fact the Miss Canada storyline in Sweet Movie is very Bunuelian reminiscent of Viridiana. Some of it is perhaps a bit too slapstick but it must be said her journey to Paris in a suitcase is a stunningly surreal image. Makavejev's depiction of her journey from sociallyacceptable intact 'purity' innocently collaborative with the people who try to destroy her to isolation and madness and finally to a model gyrating then seemingly drowning in chocolate is pretty shocking.Makavejev seems to be interested in how people and primarily their bodies including corpses and er their sexual being are used and abused by all of us personally and within an institutional context. Often this stuff is sugarcoated for our 'protection'. The Actionists show this by breaking practically every taboo of polite society. But like the portrayal of Reich in WR Sweet Movie does not portray the Actionists' bodily 'freedom' unironically. Miss Canada's reaction to their ecstatic antics is finally one of disgust and alienation which seems to be true of Carole Laure's own opinion of the film!.The other storyline in this film in which a revolutionary sea captain with sugar and other things in her hold falls in love with a Kronstadt sailor continues Makavejev's themes of what constitutes 'revolution' and 'freedom' what are its dangers and what are the truths and lies present in that word. The scene in which the captain does a striptease is uncomfortable viewing to say the least. This seems to be another comment on what should or should not be taboo about the way we use our bodies and those of others. Hanzel and Gretel allusions about whom to trust are also pretty evident. The captain feels compelled to ensnare adults and children to preserve a vision of Soviet revolution in a weird Jeffrey Dahmer way. She is a vision of revolution hopeful free angry loving ... and sometimes murderous.Anyway Sweet Movie is not Makavejev's best and seems to have blighted his career but it's still one of the most challenging and provocative films you're likely to see. All I can say is Long Live Makavejev. Any producers out there give him some money to make another film!".

Personally I think he is as great a director as Bunuel or Godard. In fact the Miss Canada storyline in Sweet Movie is very Bunuelian reminiscent of Viridiana. Some of it is perhaps a bit too slapstick but it must be said her journey to Paris in a suitcase is a stunningly surreal image. Makavejev's depiction of her journey from sociallyacceptable intact 'purity' innocently collaborative with the people who try to destroy her to isolation and madness and finally to a model gyrating then seemingly drowning in chocolate is pretty shocking.Makavejev seems to be interested in how people and primarily their bodies including corpses and er their sexual being are used and abused by all of us personally and within an institutional context. Often this stuff is sugarcoated for our 'protection'. The Actionists show this by breaking practically every taboo of polite society. But like the portrayal of Reich in WR Sweet Movie does not portray the Actionists' bodily 'freedom' unironically. Miss Canada's reaction to their ecstatic antics is finally one of disgust and alienation which seems to be true of Carole Laure's own opinion of the film!.The other storyline in this film in which a revolutionary sea captain with sugar and other things in her hold falls in love with a Kronstadt sailor continues Makavejev's themes of what constitutes 'revolution' and 'freedom' what are its dangers and what are the truths and lies present in that word. The scene in which the captain does a striptease is uncomfortable viewing to say the least. This seems to be another comment on what should or should not be taboo about the way we use our bodies and those of others. Hanzel and Gretel allusions about whom to trust are also pretty evident. The captain feels compelled to ensnare adults and children to preserve a vision of Soviet revolution in a weird Jeffrey Dahmer way. She is a vision of revolution hopeful free angry loving ... and sometimes murderous.Anyway Sweet Movie is not Makavejev's best and seems to have blighted his career but it's still one of the most challenging and provocative films you're likely to see. All I can say is Long Live Makavejev. Any producers out there give him some money to make another film!";

Makavejev has created a brave brave film. It communicates very engaging thoughts without spoonfeeding us. It does this visually and relies on the experiences and intelligence of the audience to make of it what they will. Montage is used in a smart way. Collages are created with the misenscene. Hilarious juxtaposition vibrant colors and detailed textures are constant. The music is underground and reoccurs in natural points in the. And politically speaking it's an incredibly brave and isolated film that accuses the soviets of a crime they had long since denied at the time. Sweet Movie is NOT a snuff film. It is NOT a cult film. Those adjectives water down this intelligent avantgarde film. This is film is nothing like the films of John Waters. Plus I would like to criticize some of the harsh critics of this movie. Many dislike the film because of the brutal scene in the commune where the members vomit and spit amongst other things. And this film was banned in London because of the scene where the young boys are seduced on the boat traveling through Amsterdam canals. I find it peculiar that those are the scenes that would disturb you when there is an gutwrenching intercut scene of raw footage revealing the aftermath of heinous massacres where bodies have been burned to a crisp and shoved in the ground. It's an example of how society finds sex and bodily functions more disturbing than the savagery of genocide.".

This is a very funny movie for its first half because oneofakind director Dusan Makavejev populates his mess of randomness with the same docuinyourface absurdity and crude outrageous view of sex that his best film WR had. We meet Mr. Kapital John Vernon of all people though it is not his own genitals used when the character is seen on camera with them dipped in gold who brushes a napkin across his daughter if it is his daughter maybe his girlfriend played by Carole Laure on one side of the super loose narrativeside and on the other Potemkin Sailor hoho who takes on board a stray even though to have sex with her will lead to certain death. Then there's also Jeremiah Muscle who flaunts his black snake like it's nobody's business but the lady's and a Hispanic singing sensation on record only of course as he makes a music video with the backdrop of the Eifel tower leading to getting stuck with another women in the act all mixed up in a crazy lot of scenes that emphasize phallus imagery the female form and bright primary colors as Makavejev put it a love letter to Kodak.This isn't to say the film doesn't take more than a little actually quite a lot of work on the viewer to know what the hell is going on. Like WR the director throws in a few times throughout some real founddocumentary footage only this time without much relevance to the film that the director has made around it albeit the song used in the clips is excellent. And yet for the first half of Sweet Movie this isn't of a terrible concern at least for one knowing that the unexpected and anarchic is all in tasteless fun. It's is a little like if there was a rogue Marxist i.e. the awesome pipe Kapital has and the ship's main mast who got kicked out of Monty Python and was obsessed with genitals and went off and made an independent film. That is for the first half anyway. After this when Miss Canada1984whomever runs into the commune group this is where all of a sudden the randomness of tasteless acts starts to try one's patience. I can even see what Makavejev was going for here without trying to add to much meaning to what it all is the disgusting depravity with food vomiting infantilism nudity barbarism of communism as satire. But it just goes on for much too long where the first half had little stabs of wild wit this along with the long sequence with Anna Planeta around the young boys soon fall flat not because of there not being any cohesive narrative structure but because they just aren't as captivating or hilarious as what came before. It might be a tough act to follow such a crafty and controversial hybrid like WR Mysteries of the Organism but Makavejev's method of throwing caution completely into the wind soon starts to reel into the tedious with the exception of the sugar sex scene and Laure's naked chocolate session which are some of the best scenes in the film. This being noted the shards that do work in Sweet Movie make it a somewhat worthwhile viewing certainly for those who are diehard avantgarde cineasts Sweet Movie marks as something like an Xrated milkshake lots and lots of nudity and pushingtheline sexual acts done to a style that can only come out of a man with a real vision at work. What it is precisely I can't quite say. It is at the least an 'experience' of its time and mood. That it's not the sort of work one would want to watch it again from start to finish for quite a long time unlike WR is its biggest sort of drawback.".

The box of the VHS I watched describes the film as a erotic comedy with a tongueincheek attitude towards the psychiatric world. Wellyeah maybe. But still I wouldn't really recommend it to fans of ordinary comedies or to admirers of erotic cinema and I can't even begin to imagine what eminent people in psychiatry would make of it! I'd say that Sweet Movie is exclusively meant for cult cinema hunters with a passion for arthouse atmospheres experimental story ideas and extremely eccentric characters. This is a unique and thoroughly bizarre film yes but I wouldn't go too far in calling it shocking sick or repulsive as that might frighten people unnecessarily! Undoubtedly Makavejev's script contains a truckload of offensive elements and unsubtle social statements but the wholesome remains stylish and inexplicably funny at all times. There's two main story lines but unlike I expected they do not merge together in the end. The first story revolves on a young introvert beauty and her introduction to the dangerous world of sexual perverts. Being the winner of a virginbeauty contest young Miss Canada is married off to a sardonic industrialist withumpeculiar body parts truly fabulous appearance by cult icon John Vernon!. Following a series of events that are too insane to mention the poor girl ends up among an assembly of artists that work with their own faeces and vomit. People that are familiar with the work of Otto Mhl know exactly what to expect of this and yes it's all shown in detail... The other story is  believe it or not  even more deranged than the first and follows a strange lady as she navigates her flamboyant ship down the Seine. She has sex on deck seduces young schoolboys and brutally kills people atop a large pile of sugar! Sweet indeed! How do you begin review a movie like Sweet Movie? As mentioned before you have to be very careful who to recommend it to. Makavejev's filming style and world perspectives are perhaps similar to the oeuvres of acclaimed directors John Waters Pink Flamingos and Alejandro Jodorowsky El Topo but his motivations and political convictions clearly differ. Also some people will think the controversy in Sweet Movie is artsy whereas others will label it as pure and meaningless trash! Fact remains that this movie is unique and courageous especially considering its period of release and lands of origin. The first story with Carol Laure loses a bit of its impact near the end and I didn't really like the climax but the other story starring the Polish Anna Prucnal only gets more depraved with each twist and eventually reaches a stunning denouement. The sex sequences couldn't be more explicit and somehow Makavejev is the ONLY director capable of being tasteless and stylish at the same time! The use of music is brilliant and the decors as well as the set pieces are downright breathtaking. It may not be for all tastes but if you're searching for an exceptional cinematic experience there's NOTHING that even remotely matches this sweet sweet sweet SWEET MOVIE".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those great cinematic endurance test films. It's really an amazing piece of cinema maybe like Godard meets Jodorowsky. It is reminiscent of Pasolini's Salo except it has more humour and is nowhere nearly as bleak as that film. It has a well deserved reputation of being a shocking polarizing film but I think it's amazingly good.Dusan Makavejev is a great director and there are other things going on here aside from a boring staid debate over Communism vs. Capitalism.

Even though Dusan explains who they are and what they were about in the interview on the disc it doesn't detract from the strangeness or the mystery of why they are there and why Little Miss Virginity ends up partying with them. The scene is so wild that you can't believe it actually happened. Here we see people urinate on each other here indulge in emetophilia and coprophilia. And later a couple makes love in sugar and chocolate. Does this sound interesting to you? It should because the film makes other points as well. It's not just shock value here.And despite the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe and the USSR the film hasn't really dated. An absolutely fascinating aspect of this film is that it starts out as a 70's time capsule at least that's what I thought when I started watching it. The Little Miss Virginity contest would have shocked audiences in 1974 but not today. But as the film progresses it gets stranger more surreal many things are left unexplained and the ending is very haunting. It is not a time capsule but a continuously challenging bit of cinema. It has retained its power over the years quite like its stoic humourless cousin Salo. The movie burns into your retina and you can't shake it no matter how jaded and hip you think you are. It's really quite outstanding and I'm very thankful that Criterion released this film on DVD. It has been notoriously hard to find especially in its uncut uncensored version. Many films use the word uncensored as a marketing gimmick but this film was really censored in many countries and is still banned in many of them today. I won't go into any more details about it other than you will never forget this film.".

It is reminiscent of Pasolini's Salo except it has more humour and is nowhere nearly as bleak as that film. It has a well deserved reputation of being a shocking polarizing film but I think it's amazingly good.Dusan Makavejev is a great director and there are other things going on here aside from a boring staid debate over Communism vs. Capitalism.

	schema:reviewBody "Wow this movie may not be the greatest surreal movie put to film but the director Dusan Makavejev sure didn't pull any punches. As I talk about the story keep in mind that I'm not making this up. An oil millionaire is holding a beauty contest to find himself a virgin bride. It can't be just any virgin bride. She has to be willing to be urinated on by the millionaires golden penis which he proudly shows off in the film many times. No folks it's not a statue or anything he just happens to have a gold penis. He finds the seemingly perfect bride but she doesn't take well to this lifestyle after awhile and runs away. She ends up in a large suitcase which ends up being shipped to France. Once there she still finds a life of weirdness and nothing but strange people. She eventually comes across a commune where a large number of people urinate all over each other and eat their own feces and rub it all over each others bodies. The story if you can call it that also involves a sailer and a girl named Capt. Ann who can't get enough sex. Eventually there is a love scene which takes place in a large tub of sugar which turns to a sticky red batter after being bloodied up by Ann stabbing her partner. Keep in mind this is all surrealism and perhaps a little of the directors sick selfindulgence. I only understood a little of what I saw after seeing one of the special features on the DVD. You really need to know a little about foreign politics of the 60's to understand the film which I don't. I get the feeling however that even with that education you will be scratching your head for a lot of the movie. Surprisingly there is actually a decent soundtrack to the film as one of the songs heard was actually a hit in Europe and is quite nice. Keep in mind this is not a sex film but uses it to attack us in an unsettling way. I promise you won't be turned on by any of those scenes. Although I can't say I really liked this film since I didn't find the entire thing interesting I can say that it's a hard movie to be passive about because of the symbolism I actually did understand. Watch at your own risk!".

The entire film is a deliberate affront to or subversion of cinematic conventions and societal norms. Familiar images symbols and scenes are smeared with excrement or defiled with incongruous sexual and violent overtones.

It is the perfect antidote to the solemnity melodrama and mawkishness of popular cinema. Few directors possess the genius to conjure up a sugar boat or chocolate bath and even fewer the effrontery to incorporate these images into a film particularly in the peculiar and outrageous manner that Makavajev does. Sweet Movie was destined to be censored or banned from the moment its conceit gave birth to a film. Indeed Polish authorities found Anna Prucnal's Anna Planeta participation in the film so objectionable that they prohibited her from entering her country of birth for several years! The film centers around a few set pieces whose utter originality and depravity make them unforgettable. To avoid revealing too much about the film I shall discuss one. The scene of the feasting orgy at which the actress Carole Laure was so appalled she quit the production is one of the most disgusting in the history of cinema. I consider this an achievement. The food and drink consumed at a feast is summarily expelled vomited or excreted at on or nearby the feasting table. A second childishness inexplicably possesses the revelers leading to incontinence babbling and egregious misbehaviour. Each excess is mimicked or met with an even greater one. The scene culminates in a few miscreants depositing their own faeces on platters and parading them around the warehouse to the merriment of all present. Sweet Movie is thus a film one can taste smell and feel. The film is besides so wellseen that the viewer for better or for worse cannot unsee it.Sweet Movie is not merely the expression of a chaotic explosion of creativity devoid of any meaning. Makavajev has messages for the viewer notwithstanding his extremely oblique way of communicating them.

Deplorable conduct and outright criminality moreover when presented in a pleasant manner by way of a beauty pageant for instance or perpetrated by a person whom society has arbitrarily judged as reputable such as an extremely wealthy man is met with disbelief or entirely excused.Sweet Movie dredges up parts of our psyche that we wish we didn't have or pretend we don't and unflinchingly even joyously captures them on film.

	schema:headline " I hear Ron Howard's planning a remake";
	schema:reviewBody "Many people have compared this film to Pasolini's 'Salo' an obvious comparison in a sense insofar as both films were made around the same time and employ deliberately shocking imagery as part of a larger polemical strategy. These films along with other contemporaneous outre classics such as Nagisa Oshima's Ai No Corrida Shuji Terayama's Emperor Tomato Ketchup and Walerian Borowczyk's La Bete can be seen as the last convulsive death throes the final joyrideintooblivion of the commercial avantgarde or political arthouse film before the cultural and political seachanges of the late70s and 80s. However I would argue that Salo and Sweet Movie are as much counterparts to one another as anything else. Both films are an attempt to reduce political issues to a series of sensuous affective responses but where Salo's politics are negative Sweet Movie's are largely affirmative. The disgusting but immaculately staged scenes of Salo comprise a kind of savage political theatre wherein systems of power not only Fascist power are literalised stripped down to their bare deformed bones so that the real exploitation humiliation and abuse are made viscerally evident. The sht blood and tender scarred nude flesh of the film's young victims are pointedly contrasted with the beautiful furnishings Modernist paintings and elegant manners of the Fascist protagonists all attempts to legitimise or prettify the brutal transactions of power. The overall effect of 'Salo' is like that of Brecht directing a snuff movie. 'Sweet Movie' is a film equally confrontational in its means but this stems from Makavejev's intellectual honesty in the exploration of his own progressive politics. This politics is informed by the libertarian marriage of Marx and Freud expounded most famously in the writings of Reich and Marcuse. Despite differences too complicated to go into both theorists concurred in putting social revolution in the service of personal selfgratification fusing the emancipation of the working class with the emancipation of the body. Marcuse's postrevolutionary society would entail the liberation of all the libidinal 'drives' suppressed by both capitalism and Stalinism. Presumably this would involve all those components of 'polymorphous perversity' stipulated by Freud though Marcuse has been criticised for not going into specifics on these matters for effectively shying away from a true clear picture of what such 'liberated' sexuality would look like. But if Marcuse was coy Makavejev is hyperexplicit. To this end he enlists the notorious performance troupe of the Vienna 'Aktionist' artist Otto Muehl  semifictionalised here as the 'Therapy Commune' but delivering a fairly representative sample of their stage routines defecating urinating writhing and muling or Muehling like babies vomiting and playing with food. Another notorious sequence flirts with 'benign' paedophilia...The point of such edgy sequences is in my opinion to act as a kind of litmus test of the viewer's own sexual or political radicalism. Makavejev can be seen as addressing the young American and West European revolutionaries who would have comprised much of the film's original audience thrusting in their faces the messy visceral details of the sexualpolitical utopias which they claimed to be committed to realizing and effectively asking them 'How radical are you really? How can you call yourself a libertarian or a progressive if you find these images disgusting?' Conversely the film's graphic but thereby compelling scenes can be seen as a snare for the uninitiated a kind of cinematic shocktherapy that might open the doors to libertarian 'new consciousness'.If these unpleasant scatological images are intended to visualise film's 'radical' elements then the 'sweet' images of chocolate sweet meats and mountains of sugar paradoxically betoken in Makavejev's sensuous political discourse the destructive ideologies of capitalism and Soviet Communism. Another critic whose name I have for the moment forgotten has written that the film is about the insidious 'sweetness of ideology' and I think that 'sweetness' is here meant to represent the alluring strategies used by ultimately negative political systems to entice their adherents  whether these strategies be the luxuries of consumer capitalism bathing in a vat of chocolate is at first sight obviously preferable to its radical counterpart smearing oneself with excrement or Soviet 'revolutionary' rhetoric. Hence the film's key image of a mound of sugar mixed with the blood of Pierre Clementi's murdered Kronstadt sailor. Admittedly the film's symbolism is somewhat confused in its rendering of Anna Planeta who is both admirably Reichian and progressive in her liberationist stance and a personification of homicidal Sovietstyle tyranny. In general if Pasolini showed the horror of Fascism in ways that Stanley Kramer or Spielberg would never have dreamt of 'Sweet Movie' can be seen as a robust corrective to the pallid confused hippiedrippie manifestos embodied by such films as 'Easy Rider'. It is as much an audiovisual assault as a work of aesthetic delectation and demonstrates the courage of its extraordinary convictions like few other films.".

These films along with other contemporaneous outre classics such as Nagisa Oshima's Ai No Corrida Shuji Terayama's Emperor Tomato Ketchup and Walerian Borowczyk's La Bete can be seen as the last convulsive death throes the final joyrideintooblivion of the commercial avantgarde or political arthouse film before the cultural and political seachanges of the late70s and 80s. However I would argue that Salo and Sweet Movie are as much counterparts to one another as anything else. Both films are an attempt to reduce political issues to a series of sensuous affective responses but where Salo's politics are negative Sweet Movie's are largely affirmative. The disgusting but immaculately staged scenes of Salo comprise a kind of savage political theatre wherein systems of power not only Fascist power are literalised stripped down to their bare deformed bones so that the real exploitation humiliation and abuse are made viscerally evident. The sht blood and tender scarred nude flesh of the film's young victims are pointedly contrasted with the beautiful furnishings Modernist paintings and elegant manners of the Fascist protagonists all attempts to legitimise or prettify the brutal transactions of power. The overall effect of 'Salo' is like that of Brecht directing a snuff movie. 'Sweet Movie' is a film equally confrontational in its means but this stems from Makavejev's intellectual honesty in the exploration of his own progressive politics. This politics is informed by the libertarian marriage of Marx and Freud expounded most famously in the writings of Reich and Marcuse. Despite differences too complicated to go into both theorists concurred in putting social revolution in the service of personal selfgratification fusing the emancipation of the working class with the emancipation of the body. Marcuse's postrevolutionary society would entail the liberation of all the libidinal 'drives' suppressed by both capitalism and Stalinism. Presumably this would involve all those components of 'polymorphous perversity' stipulated by Freud though Marcuse has been criticised for not going into specifics on these matters for effectively shying away from a true clear picture of what such 'liberated' sexuality would look like. But if Marcuse was coy Makavejev is hyperexplicit. To this end he enlists the notorious performance troupe of the Vienna 'Aktionist' artist Otto Muehl  semifictionalised here as the 'Therapy Commune' but delivering a fairly representative sample of their stage routines defecating urinating writhing and muling or Muehling like babies vomiting and playing with food. Another notorious sequence flirts with 'benign' paedophilia...The point of such edgy sequences is in my opinion to act as a kind of litmus test of the viewer's own sexual or political radicalism. Makavejev can be seen as addressing the young American and West European revolutionaries who would have comprised much of the film's original audience thrusting in their faces the messy visceral details of the sexualpolitical utopias which they claimed to be committed to realizing and effectively asking them 'How radical are you really? How can you call yourself a libertarian or a progressive if you find these images disgusting?' Conversely the film's graphic but thereby compelling scenes can be seen as a snare for the uninitiated a kind of cinematic shocktherapy that might open the doors to libertarian 'new consciousness'.If these unpleasant scatological images are intended to visualise film's 'radical' elements then the 'sweet' images of chocolate sweet meats and mountains of sugar paradoxically betoken in Makavejev's sensuous political discourse the destructive ideologies of capitalism and Soviet Communism. Another critic whose name I have for the moment forgotten has written that the film is about the insidious 'sweetness of ideology' and I think that 'sweetness' is here meant to represent the alluring strategies used by ultimately negative political systems to entice their adherents  whether these strategies be the luxuries of consumer capitalism bathing in a vat of chocolate is at first sight obviously preferable to its radical counterpart smearing oneself with excrement or Soviet 'revolutionary' rhetoric. Hence the film's key image of a mound of sugar mixed with the blood of Pierre Clementi's murdered Kronstadt sailor. Admittedly the film's symbolism is somewhat confused in its rendering of Anna Planeta who is both admirably Reichian and progressive in her liberationist stance and a personification of homicidal Sovietstyle tyranny. In general if Pasolini showed the horror of Fascism in ways that Stanley Kramer or Spielberg would never have dreamt of 'Sweet Movie' can be seen as a robust corrective to the pallid confused hippiedrippie manifestos embodied by such films as 'Easy Rider'. It is as much an audiovisual assault as a work of aesthetic delectation and demonstrates the courage of its extraordinary convictions like few other films.";

The film's title is ambiguous referring to the sugar and candy stocked on board Anna's boat bait which she uses to lure her prey and to the sweetness of Miss Monde's virginity.  The title is also ironic in its reference to the bitterness of harsh reality.  The potential meaning of the film can be squeezed out of the brief somewhat disjointed conversation between Anna and the Potemkin mariner Pierre Clementi near the film's end Mariner Are you afraid of the past? Anna I brought a lot of sugar but I can't get rid of the bitter taste. Mariner Anyway it leaves a trace. Anna And the witnesses must disappear.This mostly depressing film does have its moments  a few comical scenes involving lovely actress Carole Laure.  Anna Prucnal's striptease performed in front of a group of young boys is equally fascinating but anticlimactic.

But something about this unfolding picture made me resist the eject button. One factor was I think that the Tim Robbins character was magnetically unpredictable. It was hard to predict what kind of a person he would ultimately turn out to be. Secondly and maybe I missed something at the outset or went in with imperfect knowledge of the circumstances of the film but only quite late in the picture did I realize that this was a biographical flashback of a national hero. That was refreshing to me. Heroic biopics generally seem to be trying too hard to lionize their subject. And finally from all aspects of cinematography that a casual user like me can address the picture was not that badly done. So if you haven't seen many Apartheidthemed movies and would like to see a decent one this would be a respectable choice. As a political aside I found myself hoping that at least a few Americans would watch this picture and say Hey that's what we do to suspected terrorists too! and consider whether right and wrong are not all that easy to distinguish.".

	schema:reviewBody "With Rabbit Proof Fence The Quiet American and now Catch A Fire to his credit in succession Phillip Noyce appears to be leaving the blockbuster action movies behind and moving into the realm of serious but still mainstream cinema. These are all very proficient films with interesting stories that contain relevant social and political messages. It is noteworthy that the three are all based on historical facts.This style of filmmaking is much more interesting than films like Syriana or especially The Constant Gardener. In those the director appears to make a show of promoting a worthy world view but doesn't really seem committed to the political cause. It felt gratuitous the director simply exploiting our interest in political conspiracies without necessarily sharing that interest. Whatever it takes to get bums on seats.It is a difficult balance for a director. You want to do a story that you know is going to be hard to sell. So you need a big name or two to get the studio on board. But then you're stuck with a highly recognisable face that everyone knows is American but has to use an Afrikaaner accent.I was pleasantly surprised to find that Tim Robbins was completely believable as the South African police interrogator. His accent seemed flawless and with his excellent acting I was able to buyin to his character immediately. And I assumed that Derek Luke who played the protagonist Patrick Chamusso was African. In fact he's from LA and has appeared in Spartan and Antwone Fisher in the title role.Apartheid like say Nazism or socalled terrorism is an easy target. It doesn't take much effort to totally demonise even minor participants even though they may be ordinary people. Noyce skilfully avoided such caricatures. Using effective cinematic devices he was able to portray that both the protagonist and the antagonist had much in common. They both had two daughters and both loved their families and their country. But one became a torturer and one became the tortured.Noyce's portrayal of Apartheid was very balanced. Robbin's character Vos was a family man with a job. His family loved him but at work he was a man to be feared. Torture is a method that has been shown to not work. Both Michael Winterbottom's The Road to Guantanamo and Noyce's Catch A Fire illustrate this by depicting false confessions that were actually made by innocents. According to Noyce at the QA session that proceeded the film the confessions made by Chamusso after he joined the ANC were deliberately sparse on detail and designed to appease but ultimately frustrate his interrogators.I asked Noyce if the film was making a statement about current world events and he acknowledged that it was. It is very relevant to the war on terror and the West's turning to inhumane methods. One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter he quoted. Patrick Chamusso was a hero he said not because he took up arms but because he renounced them. The ANC had a policy of not harming innocents but this wasn't always the case. Chamusso was unsuccessful and was jailed because he was careful to follow this policy.Phillip Noyce is showing himself to be a deft master of quietly subversive films with commercial appeal but ultimately they are sociopolitical commentaries with a strong humanitarian element. This film should have wide appeal among both casual moviegoers and the more serious cinephiles.".

	schema:reviewBody "The remarkable thing about Australian director Phillip Noyce's engaging political thriller which is set in the South Africa's apartheid era is that he has succeeded in making a thoughtful film in a genre strewn with pitfalls.Derek Luke plays Patrick Chamusso a real life black African who becomes radicalised as a result of his wrongful detention and torture by South Africa's ruling white party. Conscious of his duty to support a family Patrick keeps his head down having nothing to do with terrorists and 'troublemakers' who want to attack the massive oilrefinery where he works as a foreman. Patrick doesn't even let his aging inlaw listen to the 'Radio Freedom' channel. But after a false arrest and incarceration  during which time he is not charged and so has no right to a lawyer  Patrick is beaten senseless and then sees the same treatment meted out to his wife. The experience convert him to the cause as soon as he gets out and he's off to Mozambique to train as an ANC freedom fighter.Patrick's opponent is Tim Robbins who plays Nic Vos the Colonel in an antiterrorist squad. In a poignant montage we see Vos receiving a medal intercut with another shot showing the burial of murdered ANC fighters who receive a gunsalute.The average movie would already have made simplistic references to Guantanamo or any other political hot topic reduced Chamusso and Vos to mere ciphers moralised to the point of being patronising or wallowed in sentimentality. But Noyce is no average director. He has produced sterling thrillers such as The Bone Collector but more importantly has shown himself to have a firm grasp of human rights seen in both his treatment of The Quiet American and Rabbit Proof Fence. This film is about the making of a terrorist but within a specific historical context and makes no judgement beyond South Africa.The hybridisation of South African society is competently developed. Our story is told primarily from the viewpoint of blacks. This is in contrast to the usual Hollywood formula which would show whites mistreating them and then whites eventually and heroically developing more enlightened views. We get to know Patrick his family his shortcomings his daily life and his love of football. Yet focussing too narrowly on him could have turned Catch a Fire into mere polemic. Instead Robbins is also allowed to develop the character of Vos who we see as a man doing what he believes is best rather than someone who is an outandout monster. The Colonel also has a family he loves and teaches his daughters that his job is to make the country a safe place for them to live in. He can calmly oversee torture one minute and play good cop the next yet conveying sincerity to both attitudes.South Africa today is neither the country that it was under apartheid nor the country that it was before outside nations established control. Crucial insights paved the way for South Africa's 'freedom'  rather than a victory of one race over another. Concepts like universal sharing and passive resistance. This is epitomised in the film when a saying of Nelson Mandela is recalled  'we can never be free until we learn to forgive'.The real life Patrick who makes a brief appearance in the film now lives with Conney a woman he married after his release. They have children of their own and have fostered over 70 AIDS orphans at their Two Sisters charity httpwww.twosisters.org.za  which appears in the endcredits. The addition of documentary details may annoy some audiences who wanted to leave the cinema purely after a thriller but for this viewer the cut to reallife seemed an excellent anchor without giving way to sermonising.Catch a Fire is a complex political thriller based on at least one historical character. It documents an important chapter of history. The degree to which there are parallels or lessons for other situations in the present day is left entirely for the viewer. What is clear is that Noyce has once again handled a multifaceted and challenging story with skill and evenhandedness.".

	schema:reviewBody "Catch a Fire is surprisingly powerful and emotional. This emotion is assisted by a very moving soundtrack of South African music. The emotion is also feed by a brutal force of antiterrorists with some of their interrogation techniques being very hard to watch for a PG13 rated film. Though most violence is implied the film still does a very good job of portraying the brutality of the treatment that suspected terrorists in South Africa received. This film also does a great job of showing the terrorists side of the fight and offers insight into their motivation. The film focuses on people and their motivations and anyone can identify with almost every character. Despite being based on a true story and being a fairly realistic portrayal of the actual events this film somehow manages to have enough action and suspense to have a fairly high entertainment value. A must see for anyone who enjoys historical films or dramathrillers. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Apartheidera South Africa was a time of abuse and persecution by the white minority onto the black majority. The black South Africans were looked down upon and segregated at every turn. Any instance of fighting back was a sign of terrorism and treason. This film Catch a Fire is based on the truelife story of Patrick Chamusso whose life was turned upside. A man who was apolitical and loving to his family Chamusso was unaccounted for during a span of time in which the oil refinery he worked at was bombed. As a top suspect he was arrested and tortured along with his wife to try and make him comply before finally being released. Patrick did nothing wrongat least as far as arson goes the missing time was due to infidelityand as a result of being accused and beaten decided to do something his people could be proud of and try to stop the persecution.Director Phillip Noyce has brought to the table a tale that not only shows a sympathetic side to the black people of South Africa but also a side of moral ambiguity to the whites. Playing the head of antiterrorism is Tim Robbins in a subdued and nuanced performance. He is a man that feels what he is doing is right and necessary for the protection of all South Africans. The bombings and killings need to be stopped for all to live in harmony. Unfortunately though he doesn't seem to really see the consequences of his actions in finding out exactly who the leaders of the resistance are. By seeing people as guilty until proved innocent his compassion to let the nonguilty go rather than be strung up as a symbol like those around him would like does little when the innocent turn from the atrocities and become the enemy as a result. Beating those that have not wronged for events they had no part in will eventually eat away at their souls until they realize that something truly is broken with the system and instead of having one's family hurt for nothing let the pain and suffering mean something. The mentality soon becomes that if I am tortured for keeping to myself I might as well fight back to slowly chip away slowly accomplish something for my trouble.These are the thoughts that come to Patrick Chamusso after his wife is beaten while he sits and tells the truth about where he had been during the bombing. Played wonderfully by Derek Luke Patrick is portrayed early on as a loving husband and father sticking up for friends in a way to amiably keep trouble far away. He helps the local children stay off the streets by coaching them at soccer and he feels pride for the job status he holds at the mine making a good enough living to support his family but also understanding his limits and not being greedy to want more than the love of those close to him. The transformation he goes through after being released from wrongful imprisonment is subtle and heartbreaking. He leaves his family behind so as to help his people in a guerilla war he must leave in order to come back without the guilt or embarrassment the Afrikaners have instilled in him. All the scenes in the terrorist camp are intriguing and wellmade good people doing the only thing left that they can do in a world closing in on them.Emotions run high during the course of the film. Faces of anguish and pain are always cropped close in to see the souls screaming behind dampened eyes. Everyone is played against each other through lies and deceit with each turn adding to the powder keg that you know has to eventually let loose. The addition of many African tribal songs helps create mood as well as the back and forth between English and the South African native tongue. All the supporting roles also add depth to the proceedings especially Bonnie Mbuli as Chamusso's wife Precious and those playing Robbins' character's children and wife. Noyce show us both sides of the equation in his film and asks us the question of how far we'd be willing to go to do what's right no matter what side we are on.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie takes place in South Africa during the Apertheidera where the white minority is controlling the nation's natural resources and the black majority is trying to break free from the chains of this oppressive regime. Some black groups are organizing terrorist activities against the regime blowing up factories railroads etc. Of course the question is if you are fighting against an oppressive regime that is controlling your country should your fighting be considered an act of terror? I really liked the angle the movie takes in this very important question. Our hero Patrick Derek Luke is actually an innocent man but subjected to terror of torture in the hands of the chief of antiterror squad Nic Vos Tim Robbins. The movie does a good way of showing that government officials are just as capable of committing terror as the people it accuses of being a terrorist. Once Patrick's life is shattered he has nothing to lose so he joins the resistance forces. After that it is a chase and run between Patrick and Nic. The movie nicely connects the story of Patrick to the end of the Apertheid regime when blacks finally take control of their country. This is a must see movie for everyone who is interested in political conflicts and terrorism. I give it a 7 out of 10.".

A national vote was held 1992 in South Africa  the referendum  and the majority of the white people voted for the abolishment of Apartheid so in the end black AND white South Africans made the peaceful transition in South Africa possible. So the end of the movie  which is hastily tacked on  seems bitter and resentful but historically it all turned out well after all. All in all the movie is good for people who have not heard about Apartheid before  or even about South Africa. But Americans can certainly learn from this story to achieve a better social cohesion between white and coloured people in the US.".

Superb cast with fine all round performances particularly from Derek Luke he does a very good job he's surprisingly good in the role of dad turned terrorist and excellent Tim Robbins as sadistic torturer.The remainder of the casting was also competent enough and did splendid acting.Evocative cinematography by Garry Phillips and Ron Fortunato.

	schema:reviewBody "Catch a Fire is excruciatingly and liberatingly rooted in the realities of Apartheid South Africa. Shawn Slovo the scriptwriter is the daughter of white antiapartheid activists for whom the struggle ultimately cost their lives. Her closing dedication to her father Joe is touching and real. The film tells the true story of Patrick Chamusso a Mozambican who like many residents of southern Africa came to South Africa for work. He found it serving as a foreman at a huge oilfromcoal refinery in Transvaal. He also found a good life with his wife and children. Unfortunately for everyone his good life also included a mistress and another child. The legitimate wife Precious suspects her happygolucky husband and the results of her suspicion are tragic for everyone. One night while Patrick is trysting the oil refinery is attacked by Umkhonto we Sizwe or Spear of the Nation the paramilitary branch of the African National Congress. Because Patrick is unwilling to reveal his whereabouts he becomes a prime suspect for Colonel Nic Vos of the Special Branch of the South African Security Police. To ramp up the pressure Vos tortures Precious too. Finally convinced of Patrick's innocence Vos releases him. The damage is done and Patrick joins UwS. Betrayed by his wife he is captured after being wounded in an attempt to blow up the refinery again. I'll not reveal the ending except to say that it reflects the kind of response to the excesses of apartheid to which Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu called the nation.This is a mustsee for anyone who followed those years. In fact that helps because some of the language and references are not explained. No matter because the context carries the meaning. I gave the film only eight stars for two reasons. First the leading roles are played by Americans almost as if the studio in charge of its release didn't believe South African actors could carry the story as they do in Tsotsi. Second the appearance of Joe Slovo appears gratuitous for the character has little to do. Perhaps Shawn included him as a gesture toward her father's memory. Or perhaps she did it to remind us that the struggle involved white people as well. Certainly everyone suffered even Nic Vos. Don't miss this one. One final comment The obvious question is With the frequent use of terrorist to describe the members of UwS is Catch a Fire commenting on the current atmosphere in the US? Possibly but if it is it is doing so subtly. South Africa's suffering belongs to South Africa and it continues in the AIDS epidemic but the effort to fight terrorism exacts a terrible price on everyone involved. The first casualty is often the freedom we take for granted. A telling scene occurs when Precious having been released speculates about hiring a lawyer to defend her husband. A friend comments that there is nothing for a lawyer to do until Patrick is charged and the Special Branch can hold him without charges for as long as it likes. Recent legislation suspending habeas corpus for those suspected of being contemporary terrorists sounds familiar to those of us who watched and prayed for South Africa throughout the State of Emergency of the 1980's. For all of this Catch a Fire stands on its own as a faithful account of how apartheid touched the lives of everyone in the country. For that reason alone it is an important film.".

	schema:headline " Joseph Campbell in Africa";
	schema:reviewBody "Catch a Fire is overly formulaic and doesn't have anything new to say about the apartheid. But it does look good and it's well acted and slickly directed. The film shares many plot similarities to other Joseph Campbell influenced narratives like the Star Wars movies or Braveheart. The film is set in South Africa in 1980. The film's reluctant hero is Patrick Chamusso who works as a foreman at the Secunda oil refinery. Patrick has a good life he owns a car has a beautiful wife and in his spare time he coaches a local boys soccer team.The freedom fighters  terrorists of the African National Congress ANC are fighting to overthrow South Africa's whiteled government. As a black man Patrick suffers the occasional humiliation at the hands of the country's police but he doesn't complain or get involved in politics. The film doesn't dwell on the fact that Patrick is a refugee from the Mozambique civil war which ended in 1992 with over 900000 dying from fighting and starvation.In many Hollywood films white South Africans are often portrayed as evil and sadistic. Tim Robbins plays Nic Vos  Darth Vader a colonel in the country's antiterrorism police. Vos is shown as a devoted husband and father but his job is to capture terrorists. After the ANC plants a bomb at the refinery Patrick comes under suspicion and is arrested. Patrick is a womanizer and his initial alibi is exposed as a lie. He is beatenup but when his wife is tortured he becomes angry and seeks revenge. Although found to be innocent and released Patrick travels to Mozambique and joins an ANC terrorism school. He returns to South Africa and blows up the refinery. Patrick plays an unenthusiastic warrior who helps overthrow an evil regime. He is arrested again and spends over ten years at the Robben Island prison with Nelson Mandela. Most recent films about Africa paint it in a negative light. They show corrupt genocidal hellholes child soldiers widescale barbarism anarchy and starvation. What happened in South Africa now seems relatively low key by comparison. The film also fails to shock because TV shows like 24 seem to condone torture in terrorist interrogations. With the present day reality of prisons like Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo the actions of Vos and his men seem almost tame. Overall it's a wellmade movie.".

There are more than 16 regions within India where terrorist insurgency and naxal movements are flourishing to fight the evil of state government.The director Philip Noyce Clear and Present Danger Patriot Games has always made political statements and movies that show the ugly side of white supremacy. He has been hated by many for showing it throughout his career.A special mention should be made of cinematographer Ron Fortunato and Garry Phillips for beautifully capturing the beauty of South Africa. There is no background musical score in the movie but the Sound Department team has mixed the African folk songs and dance as integrated part of the narrative.Derek and Bonnie  look a perfect pair and both are very good looking. Derek matches his previous award winning performance of Antwone Fisher he chooses true story characters for his roles and excels in them. Tim Robbin plays the Colonel he has this next door looking guy  but gives cold shivers with his controlled performance.The beautiful closeup shots depict every emotion of the characters and I was in the movie since its beginning. There are a few slack holes in the script and even though the movie is very good  one feels that something is missing.All in all a sensitive movie to see for everyone especially all white communities  who invaded different nations and ruled them as their own land. I end with a quote from the movie  What will your children say about you? Stars 7.75 out of 10".

Though the plant is under investigation for terrorist acts Chamusso remains adamantely a pacificist. Yet when the conflicted Boer policeman Nic Vos Tim Robbins begins to bear down on Chamusso as suspect in a fire explosion at his plant Chamusso's alibi conceals the fact that while away coaching the plant's boys' soccer team he steals away to see his illegitimate son and exgirlfriend and this bit of secrecy to protect his wife's feelings causes the explosion with Vos that confines him to jail.Chamusso joins the military branch of the ANC trains with them is captured abused imprisoned and finally released with the rise of Nelson Mandela. How all of the progress of the story takes place is the pleasure of the fine script by Shawn Slovo and the direction of Phillip Noyce The Quiet American RabbitProof Fence The Bone Collector Clear and Present Danger Patriot Games etc who knows how to move these movies along. The cast is excellent the sense of place the film was filmed entirely on location and the production aspects are all superb. The only problem with the film is the 'sellout' at the end when suddenly we are watching bits and pieces of filmed history and voice over content that seems to diminish the emotional impact of the film. Still for another opportunity to understand Apartheid and the great country of South Africa this film is very much worth watching. And Derek Luke Bonnie Henna and Tim Robbins offer excellent acting skills. Grady Harp".

It was pretty violent at times and often depressing. You definitely have to be in a certain mood to see it. The way it was filmed reminded me of Syriana. I think the opening scene was a little long. It is based on a true story and I like how they incorporated that in the end. It was a good history lesson on a period I did not have a lot of knowledge on. It was hard to imagine the life he had to lead. This movie will impress you and make you think about what apartheid meant to people living it. I recommend seeing this movie but as is should be rated R.".

Nothing is left to the viewer or to the art of storytelling. Nothing is subtle except possibly Robbins' character. Many films about South African issues have been made  it's a pohotogenic place  and almost every one I've seen is more effective  like Tsotsi  because they respect the paradoxical isolation and global reach of politics there not because they assumes the viewer wants to feel comfortable. This can be seen as a typical liberal's movie as smugly presented as the apatheid it condemns. Even the most violent and emotionally wrenching scenes here are poorly prepared or are beautified or are mired in coincidence and scripted convenience. What a shame for the 3 lead actors do a fine job. Once again political epic is influenced by MTV.".

I'm a huge fan of Josh Radnor best known for his role as Ted Mosby on the CBS series How I Met Your Mother but remained a little skeptical going in since this is a firsttime film for him. I was pleasantly surprised! This movie is so charming I couldn't help falling in love with all of the characters. I was especially impressed by Tony Hale's endearing performance as Sam 2 who tries to win the affection of Annie Malin Akerman a woman with Alopecia who struggles with the idea of someone being so smitten with her. Mary Catherine Zoe Kazan and Charlie Pablo Schreiber are absolutely adorable together and have an unbeatable on screen chemistry. They are at a crossroads in their relationship as Charlie tries to sell Mary Catherine on the idea of leaving their home in New York to move to L.A.Sam Josh Radnor Mississippi Kate Mara and Rasheen Michael Algieri round out the cast of characters. Mississippi is a cabaret singer who catches the eye of Sam early in the film and while their hesitation to throw caution to the wind and go for each other is annoying at times it brings a muchneeded realism over romance approach to their relationship.Rasheen was an audience favorite and his role adds a unique piece to this puzzle playing a foster boy separated from his family on the subway who is rescued and looked after by Sam. It is truly an enjoyable highlight of the film to watch their interactions as they grow from perfect strangers to close friends. An amazing dynamic is brought to the script through their friendship but not without Rasheen's life before Sam looming in the distance.If this movie is any indication of Josh's talent as a writer I can't wait to see more of his work. It contains all of the elements of a romantic comedy yet manages to completely avoid the clichs and predictability that are typically found in this genre. It is clever heartwarming hopeful and hilarious. I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes the big hit of Sundance 2010. Congratulations to Josh and everyone behind this film!".

The direction was steered by a steady hand that knew when to back off and when to tone things down when to intensify and how close and to and at what angle the camera should be to the actors. The direction never condescends to its audience as the direction of most romantic comedies do. Nor does this movie smother us with too much wit or too much symbolism. The movie was practically perfect in that it balanced what I think we ask of our comedic dramas a fresh look at love and humor believability and poignancy. It felt so richly human that when it was over I felt that I had watched a new hot play instead of a movie that's how vivid it was that's how roughly hewn and real it was.For those who desperately need some kind of plotframe before seeing it I'll give you a jumping off point. It starts with a New York late 20searly 30s struggling novelist who decides to help a lost boy find his way back home.".

The film is a trio of intertwined stories involving six New Yorkers  dealing with the complexities of love friendship and identity.

The main story focuses on Sam Wexler a struggling writer Radnor   who during a particularly bad day when he encounters a young boy  played by the adorable Michael Algieri who's been separated from his  family. When the boy reveals that he is unhappy in foster care Sam  decides to bring the boy back to his apartment and a unique friendship  begins to develop between the two.

	schema:reviewBody "As someone who enjoys shameless chick flicks and Josh Radnor but is also a Sundance enthusiast I really wanted to like this film. The storyline was fine the music by Jaymay was awesome the actors are all decent. That being said it was totally apparent that Radnor is still an amateur at writing and directing. You know how in high school when your friend asked you to read their angsty poetry and it took all of you not to roll your eyes? That's what watching this movie was kind of like. There was so much contrived drama that it would have been better suited to a soap opera or comedy. Instead the actors had to take a superficially dramatic script and try to wring some drama out of it. For instance the movie starts off with a onenightstand leaving Radnor's apartment just as he wakes up and realizes he is late for an interview. Conveniently his best friend leaves a voicemail as he's getting ready as if she would know he were there listening perfectly timed to tell him to tuck his shirt in right as he finishes dressing. But it's not a comedy! It's just trying to be clever. He ends up speaking with her on the phone and says something like Why did I oversleep? Why am I so afraid of success? This sounds exactly like what some screen writing student would think that a selfpitying artist would say. The rest of the movie moves conveniently along these lines things a screen writing student THINKS his characters would say. Unfortunately film enthusiasts will be unsurprised by every line fed to them from here on out.Rasheen's character was great and would have made this a promising movie if only his presence in the plot was not based on some ridiculous presence. I'm curious to see what Radnor will do next but he'd probably be wise to work on short films and practice the art of delighting the audience in as little time as possible before attempting a longer format again.".

	onyx:emotionText "As someone who enjoys shameless chick flicks and Josh Radnor but is also a Sundance enthusiast I really wanted to like this film. The storyline was fine the music by Jaymay was awesome the actors are all decent. That being said it was totally apparent that Radnor is still an amateur at writing and directing. You know how in high school when your friend asked you to read their angsty poetry and it took all of you not to roll your eyes? That's what watching this movie was kind of like. There was so much contrived drama that it would have been better suited to a soap opera or comedy. Instead the actors had to take a superficially dramatic script and try to wring some drama out of it.

Sam's best friend Annie sleeps with her exboyfriend and is hurt by him again when clearly he is a total loser and she knows it and does it anyway. Then she goes and cries to Sam about how she only dates 29 year old men who act like 12 year olds. Similarly stupid Mississippi stays with Sam after meeting him 2 days ago in a bar and realizing that while out of good intentions he has kidnapped a child. Yet she caves still not being done with him after he misses not one but two of the shows he says he will come watch her sing at the second time's excuse because he was in jail. That being said the movie as a whole just isn't that good. The acting is mediocre lines are corny sadness be gone! we deserve to be loved. barf and frankly the plot is pretty random. For example Sam's childhood friend Mary Catherine and her boyfriend Charlie keep appearing throughout the movie despite no interaction with Sam in the first 23 of the movie besides a quick hello at a party. The most painful scene was definitely at the end when Mississippi sings a song about being happy that makes it sound like she's a Disney princess on Broadwayin a bar no less. Yeah it was that bad. I will say that Rasheen is very cute and I like the idea of the movie just not well executed.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was a wellfed middleclass kid who came from good parents I've got no material. Those words spoken by Sam the writer are just one example of how Josh Radnor blurs the lines between writer and character in his debut film happythankyoumoreplease.In it we follow the lives of a few late20searly30s bachelors and bachelorettes in New York City a place Radnor portrays endearingly. Sam played by Radnor is a cynical writer desperately trying to sell one of his short stories. His best friend Anne Malin Akerman can't seem to stop dating the wrong guys. His cousin Mary Zoe Kazan is pressured by her boyfriend to go to Los Angeles a city she loathes and leave New York the city she calls home. Along the way we meet all sorts of characters including Rasheen a young black child who after shuffling through several foster families has no home.Sam takes Rasheen in for awhile at least until he can figure out what to do with him. Anne accuses him of using the boy for material but it's more complicated than that. Although we've seen the littlekidsidekick device before it's so lightheartedly entertaining here that we really don't care. Michael Algieri's debut as Rasheen will steal your heart.I have yet to mention Mississippi a bartendercabaret singer played by the lovely Kate Mara who serves as Sam's romantic conflict. They hit it off quickly possibly too quickly and we wonder if they've met at the wrong time. Regardless their interactions are the most cringeworthy of the film see let's clean each other up and you write short stories I'm ready for the novel.On the other hand great music from Jaymay kept me in tune with the film's title. It serves as a narrative soundtrack for happythankyoumoreplease and gives it an indie feel the film won the Audience Award for Best Drama at Sundance.Although at times cheesy and clichd Radnor's debut tells an epigrammatic story about characters we genuinely care about. Sam's not delivering a profound revelation when he says every five years I realize what an asshole I was five years ago. Yet the inherent modesty in that statement says a lot about Radnor's work.".

Having heard all the buzz surrounding this film and usually enjoying most of the bigger films that come out of Sundance I was very intrigued to see the film. Did the movie live up to the buzz or was it just overkill continue reading to read my opinion on the film.Happythankyoumoreplease features a talented and fresh cast of people. The basic premise of the film features the current generation of 20 somethings who live in NY. The story focuses on several characters and their battles with growing up understanding how the world works and ultimately what it means to fall in love with the right person for them. This interesting and feel good film was told by Josh Radnor who not only directed but wrote the film.The best way to describe Happythankyoumoreplease is a mainstream film with an independent budget. While the movie itself didn't really have an independent feel to it I would say it did have some elements that made it feel indie so to speak. The well established actors and actresses in the film a storyline that was very crowd pleasing and overall pretty typical characters made it feel mainstream. However the amount of character development along with some of the characters such as Malin Akerman's character Annie are the elements that gave it a more independent feel.Like most good independent films the well written characters and the actors who played them were the highlight of this film. Having never seen a single episode of How I Met Your Mother I was totally unaware of who Josh Radnor was and I was totally honest with him about it when I met him later in the evening. What he did with this film was good especially for a first time director and writer plus I give him even more kudos points for starring in the film as well.The script which as noted above was written by Radnor is actually decent especially with mixing independent elements with mainstream elements. Some of the characters were rather typical such as Mississippi played by the talented Kate Mara and Sam 2 played by Tony Hale. These two characters felt like they were directly out of every movie you have seen in the past. Mississippi is the beautiful and talented singer who keeps falling for the wrong guy and then Tony Hale is the dork with the heart of gold. These characters aren't as deep as say Radnor's character Sam or Alkerman's Emma because these characters are just well written characters with a lot of depth. I will also have to point out that little Michael Algieri is a total scene stealer. Guarantee almost every woman who sees this film will fall in love with the kid. He is just adorable and his storyline although it was not really fleshed out as much as I would like was fairly interesting. All in all I felt everyone in the film played their roles well I just felt certain characters had more depth and others were too clichd so to speak.The overall message the film as I said was a feel good one. You knew where this film was going within the first 10 minutes and you knew exactly what was going to happen. The simplistic storyline was really the main thing that urked me about it. You had so many great lead actors and actresses and I felt the direction it took was just the typical one. I expected some stunners here and there but didn't get them despite in the beginning feeling like it was going to be a tad out of the ordinary. I cant really knock it too much though because I enjoyed it and really didn't feel it dragged at all. I guess I was just expecting more. I guess what I was expecting was the next 500 Days of Summer but this film wasn't it.In conclusion Happythankyoumoreplease won the audience award at the Gen Art film festival and the reason it won was because it was a crowd pleaser. This isn't an original work of art but its a fun little film with a talented cast and a simplistic overall story. The actors and the character development make it more worthy then most multiple character films similar to it but I still expected more from it than what I got. I guess for a first time writer and director its a good start and I think this film will do fairly well when it hits the local multiplexes later in the year.MovieManMenzel's final rating for Happythankyoumoreplease is a 7 out of 10.".

This courageous autocritic of the author is a warning about what is about to follow.This film is constructed with 3 parallel stories with little to tie them together. There is a friendship between the characters but it feels like a glue more than something that helps to develop the plot. Then there is about 6 irritating music montage that try to smooth the angles between scenes. It feels more like the writer struggled to put the story together so he filled it up with some cool music and images.As much as I wanted to care about the characters I couldn't do it because they keep doing stupid choice about their life Rosh should just go prison for abducting a child. The bald girl shouldn't hook up with stupid ex or go out with the obsessive stalker the movie ends before she get sacrificed in a weird satanic ritual and the couple should just break up because they are annoying.On the positive side there is a few good shots a few interesting dialogs. But it will not save you from boredom.".

There is even a clear reference to Mr. Allen who must be one of Radnor's idols. Of course similar ideas and approaches happen frequently in movies so really what we have is a snapshot in time of what it's like to be a young late 20's to early 30's New Yorker trying to figure out life.Radnor is one of the stars of How I Met Your Mother and this is his filmmaking debut. He does show some promise despite some weakness in the script and too dang many closeups  talking heads as I call them. His goal was to take an intimate look at relationships and the road to maturity which is often filled with potholes. This seems especially true for those artistic types who are convinced New York is the only land of opportunity in existence.There are 4 stories going on Sam Josh Radnor is a struggling writer who meets Mississippi Kate Mara a cabaret singerwaitress Mary Catherine Zoe Kazan and Charlie Pablo Schreiber have their relationship tested by a proposed move to L.A. Annie Malin Akerman suffers from a selfimage problem and faces off against a true romantic in Sam 2 Tony Hale and an ongoing interwoven story line involves Sam's character making an asinine decision when a young boy gets separated from his family on the subway.The best of the stories is Annie's. Suffering from an autoimmune disease which leaves her hairless she has a real selfimage problem in thinking that she is not worthy of love. On the ironic other hand she is put off by the advances of nice guy Sam 2 because he isn't the physical specimen she had dreamed of. Akerman and Hale make these characters believable and we actually pull for them to figure it out.Kazan's Mary Catherine just had me hoping Charlie would slap her and take off to LA on his own. Kazan granddaughter of the great director Elia Kazan actually does a nice job capturing the suffering that so many females put themselves through. Kate Mara's Mississippi is the perky on the outside defensive on the inside type who should probably never get mixed up with the selfcentered mess that is Sam Radnor. Still Mara's talent is on full display she first leaped off the screen in Brokeback Mountain as Heath Ledger's 19 yr old daughter.One thing the script reminds us is that this generation still believes the world revolves around their every decision. They have been a bit slow on the uptake here but it makes for easy pickings in script writing. There are some terrific individual scenes but some of the larger plot lines are not treated fairly or completely. Maybe Radnor tackled a bit too much for his first outing. Still a decent effort and I look forward to more from him.".

I wanted to feel like I'd just seen something comparable to Garden State or Beautiful Girls...a well made well written characterdriven story. But no matter how hard I tried to make this movie good it just didn't happen. And that's a shame because there was definitely potential here. And there were even some scenes that worked pretty well...on their own. And therein lies the problem. Even though there were some shining moments they were tucked into scenes that seemed to be sealed off to themselves. There was little coherency and that in part had much to do with some very poor editing that didn't allow smooth transitioning between scenes. There was also some dialogue here that was just plain bad. It almost seems as if Josh Radnor when writing the screenplay wanted to make sure he gave every character lead or supporting enough dialogue so he wouldn't make anyone angry. As a result much of that dialogue is found within monologues that try their darnedest to sound slick and culturally relevant and cool but really come off as disingenuous and false. And there was one story line in particular that not only didn't seem realistic but was somewhat disturbing. I know when Radnor's character sort of takes Rasheen under his wing and becomes close to him while taking the boy back to his apartment the audience was supposed to get that warm fuzzy feeling inside as was indicated by the Sam...you're my best friend line. I didn't get that warm and fuzzy feeling inside mainly because I was too preoccupied with how illegal Sam's actions were. Touching as that relationship might have been it was still kidnapping of a minor. And instead of taking this film down a more realistic avenue with that felonious crime in mind that no doubt would have inevitably darkened the film's mood Radnor completely evades confronting that issue in favor of Sam going to jail in the same way someone driving on a revoked license would. And he gets bailed out? Are you fricking kidding me? This as others have pointed out rings the most false out of many unrealistic moments. One last point regarding dialogue and I don't usually complain about profanity in movies. But when it appears that characters are uttering Fwords just for the sake of uttering Fwords it doesn't make a film more slick and edgy. It just makes it seem desperate to want to be taken seriously as a movie for adults. Hopefully what we have here with HTMP is a first time directorscreenwriter who is learning as he goes and ironing out the kinks. If that is the case then perhaps it has done some good for Radnor as he sharpens up his skills as a movie maker. If that's not the case here then Radnor better not quit his day job anytime soon.".

I feel like Sam Nr.1 trying to squeeze a story out. i thought about deleting my useless comment but i only come here when i liked a movie very much so i decided to stay and finish these lines!";

A writer who sees a small boy drawing magnificently and only thinks about how 'big' and 'succesful' and 'rich' this kid could become? That's the least inspiring take on such a thing.

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Koji Wakamatsu Caterpillar takes a clear and hard antiwar stance with its explicit warnings vivid images of brutality and questioning of just what war means and will result in. Complete with archived documentary film reels that come from both news and propaganda it tells the story of the effects of war through a husband and wife where the former has returned from his tour of duty serving in the Emperor's Asia Pacific mission complete with 3 highly decorated medals a major tribute printed in the newspaper but with the price of having lost all limbs now left with just a torso and a head.The film poses a few questions very early on about war itself. What good are commendations and medals when one is left limbless and at the mercy of others to feed clothe bathe you and just about every other basic human function requires care given as part of karmic retribution for having to survive a battle when countless of others get killed under one's hands. It's the ultimate torture for someone who once dish out punishment against helpless civilian victims now unable to function normally not even speak to express desires.How can someone be hailed as a war hero when being a hero in this sense meant the killing of others like the twist in the adage that states not to die for your country but to make the other poor bastard die for his instead. And if put under the context of the Japanese invasion of Asia as the film portrayed how does rampaging pillaging raping and killing bring one honour or glory especially in the senselessness of war that cannot be justified what more being hailed as a god by many others balanced by the ultimate mockery of sorts by being put on a pedestal like a caged animal in a zoo since Tadashi Kurokawa Keigo Kasuya becomes the poster boy for his dedication and sacrifice in the name of the throne.Tadashi aside the film also takes on another more important and engrossing perspective through that of Tadashi's wife Shigeko Shinobu Terajima who got the Silver Bear for Best Actress at last month's Berlin Film Festival initially shocked by the image of a husband who's more than a cripple being maimed both physically and emotionally and to balance that expectation set by society of the dutiful wife who will stand by her husband no matter the costs and live the vows of being there for better or for worse. Keigo Kasuya may have the more technically challenging role of expressing himself through his eyes only but Shinobu Terajima brings forth her character's development superbly as one initially very reluctant and fearful of other's perception to one who learns how to capitalize the turning of tables to dish out revenge long overdue especially when she holds the upper hand in rewarding good behaviour brownie points to a sexaddicted husband yeah he can still function below the waist. In many ways it's a close examination of the live of the Japanese woman during war and societal pressures put on them at the time.Like the insect Tadashi spends much of his life eating sleeping and requesting for plenty of sex that it becomes nothing more than a routine cycle to feel alive until guilt pours over him when given a chance to reflect and us as the audience as well the atrocities committed by troops. The other interesting aspect of the film is how Wakamatsu includes elements of how simple living Japanese folk practise for that eventuality of an air strike and invasion of enemies troops on their soil with civil defense type drills like bayonet fighting and fire fighting being pretty much the standard lessons learnt by the villagers. Bookend by archive footage and the telling of stark statistics of WWII Caterpillar will stick to you long after the credits roll and it certainly doesn't detract from its intended hard messages and fluff into a narrative butterfly.".

Director Wakamatsu walks the viewer through the war with newsreel footage and announcements from the Daihonei Imperial Headquarters which duped the public into thinking their forces were winning victory after victory. There is also the text of the article prohibiting capture or surrender from the Senjinkun Combatants' Code which was distributed to all soldiers in early 1941 under the name of Hideki Tojo and was a key factor behind the suicidal attacks and just plain suicides voluntary or compelled by Japanese soldiers throughout the war. Kurokawa the husband comes back limbless and mute but there is nothing wrong with him downstairs as his hapless wife soon discovers. There ensues a kind of sexual warfare between the two portraits of the emperor and empress solemnly gazing down at the lurid scenes all the while that lasts as long as the war. I took Kurokawa's attempted suicide as an attempt to end his personal torment not as a sign of repentance for his own crimes per se. No one saves or is saved in this flick.After the intense fixation on the couple and the rural home front the Ablasts and war's end seem to break the spell and the film embraces a more general antiwar sentiment. I felt this diluted the impact but audiences especially those in Japan will do well to ponder the figure of 20 million on the screen at the film's end for the estimated WWII death toll in Asia alone.Shinobu Terajima turns in a bravura performance as the wife though she looked laughably incongruous standing in a rice paddy farming implement in unaccustomed hand her fair and flawless complexion shining under the sun  far cry from a sunbeaten peasant woman! and Shin Onishi a creditable one in a difficult role.Wakamatsu again showed courage in making this film as he did with United Red Army. I guess this is why mention of his name often elicits groans in Japan. He must be doing something right.".

This film transports the story to the WWII era. Keigo Kasuya returns home from the Second SinoJapanese War in 1940 a quadruple amputee  no arms no legs  without the ability to speak. His wife Shinobu Terajima is reviled but soon falls back into her position as loyal spouse. The film examines the patriotic fervor of the times  Kasuya is declared a war god and is worshiped by the locals. Privately the couple's life is Hell. A power struggle arises between them and Terajima  who before the war was a victim of abuse by her husband  realizes she has power that she didn't have before. The political aspects of the film are the most interesting part. The focus on sex  which was the main focus of Rampo's story  gets a tad boring after a while. Both leads are fantastic particularly Terajima who obviously has a lot more to do. The film could stand to look better  it was filmed digitally and transferred to film and is very murky. All in all it's quite good.".

The movie doesn't need sentimentalism or any bloody reflections of the war  except for the repetitive showing of the soldier's crime. In fact most of the acting is set in the house of the couple. The film conveys its message very subtle but thus even more mind shattering I remember the scene where the body stump of the man is seated in typical Japanese tradition in the middle of the room slightly lifted on a pillow and circumvented by war insignia and a newspaper article about the lord of the war. Sitting in this honorable position you couldn't think of a better picture to show the absurdity and pitifulness of his existence as  god of war. I strongly recommend this movie. The acting is great.

The horror of this person's existence is amplified by the contrast with the patriotic and disconnected propaganda from the Japanese government and media that the village folk all seem to swallow without question. He is proclaimed a living War God with medals and a framed laudatory news article that hang on the wall. The village people line the streets to welcome home the living War God cheering and marching in copy of military march and the living War God is delivered to his unbelieving wife. Taking care of this lump of flesh will be her task from here on. She tries. She puts the food in one end sometimes sacrificing her own food to meet her husband's demands and wipes up the other end. He eats sleeps eliminates and demands sex. This goes on and on and one can imagine the wife's life of drudgery in an endless cycle stretching into the distant future. Her husband has never been a nice person. He beat her on a daily basis before marching off to do his patriotic duty in war and now that he is back he continues to demand from her. At first food and sex which he demands through grunts and facial expressions are gratifying to him but as time goes on these lose all their appeal. As a soldier he had raped a woman in China and the memory of this comes back to haunt him and interfere with any pleasure from sex. His wife puts him in a cart and parades him around the village the limbless living War God on display. The wife is dutiful but increasingly angry and despairing and the tour of the village with her husband in the cart becomes a kind of revenge for her. Eventually in private she is mashing raw eggs into his mouth and slapping him. All the while she is looked up to in the village for her patriotic sacrifice. This movie is a grim commentary on the discrepancy between patriotic imaginings of war and the actual brutality of war and its tragic consequences. The movie ponders the consequences of societal pressure to do one's duty on the battlefield and in marriage.".

The ultrapatriotic Mr Bridger a splendidly aristocratic Noel Coward his cell walls pasted with pictures of royalty sees the job as much a matter of national pride a means to demonstrate the efficiency of the British system of work than a route to amass loot.

Most obviously the robbery is planned for the time of an EnglandItaly match maximising confusion and evenas Bridger suggests at one point possible help from their compatriots. Croker's men at one point assume the identity of a van full of fans while the impromptu beer celebration in the back of the coach after ditching the minis is the team's victory drink. It is clear that the Italians whether the police or the Mafia are as much their opponents as the national team playing in the stadium. Back in prison upon news of the triumph by his team' Bridger descends the stairs like a penal Alf Ramsey acknowledging the chants of England!' by celebrating fans.Caine's cockney player is very much the main character of the film a role apparently  and amazingly  originally offered to Robert Redford. The actor who had earlier played the soliliquising womaniser Alfie in the 1966 film of the same name reprises some elements of that character's optimism and assumptiveness. In the present film he is less of cynical loner studiously subservient to his criminal employer though still on the look out for a good thing both professionally and sexually. Like his more famous compatriot James Bond he drives an Aston Martin although quickly reduced to a bicycle and then a mini. The Mafia's cliffside warning dents some of his self assurance presumably also shaken by the roughing up from Bridger's men although interestingly the beating is never referred to again and leaves no physical marks. Away from his boss he remains very much his own man although his loyalty is never in doubt From now on we work as a team. Which means you all listen to me.' Crocker is always in control never sentimental being content to pack his girlfriend off with the minimum of ceremony at the airport. Emotion will slowly filter through Caine's screen persona. His watching of Beckermann's footage early on to explain the big idea anticipates Jack Carter's less dispassionate viewing of celluloid in Hodges' gangster film two years later.Before the long final chase ensues the gang's Aston and two Jags are ceremoniously wasted by the Mafia. While making a simple point about the threat and power of the Italian underworld the removal of competing' vehicles also reaffirms the status of the remaining minis. Ironically if the film has a weakness it lies in the mini's prominence which reduces tension during the last part of the film. The stunts remain eyecatching today the notable roof top jump being filmed on the roof of the Fiat factory but very often one is aware of watching a demonstration of the vehicle's versatility rather than any dramatic bid for freedom. In one scene filmed later deleted from the release print the minis and their Italian pursuers performed gracefully together on an ice rink choreographed to a waltz slowing the action even further. That such a scene was considered and filmed gives an indication of how taken the makers had been with the car and with the means rather than the process of urgent escape.Another less satisfactory element of the plot is the disappearing Mafia. Initially presented as a formidable organised force as in their synchronised appearance on the hill side for instance the Italian hoods are sidelined as events unfold criminal impotents. Their absence from the finale seems odd. With or without the Cosa Nostra's malign shadow the existing conclusion of the film has excited much comment. With its famous shot of the coach balanced out over the precipice the gold sliding towards its back end and Croker's closing I've got a great idea..' it is a literal cliff hanger. The original script tailed off with the escape and another twist in the tail was clearly needed. After some debate a studio executive added the existing close which could easily have appeared lame but in the event proves a satisfying conclusion. By leaving the coach  and the viewer  hanging the film has it both ways the crooks get away with it and yet they don't a group of white British lads triumph in their cool minis only to have their plans derailed by a careless black driver of their coach. If the film has been about the state of Britishness' at the time then the uncertainty of its conclusion anticipates perhaps the doubts and strife of the ensuing decades.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Italian Job is one of the bestloved British classics ever made. Most people in my home country of Britain have seen the film many times most of those times spent drinking tea and speaking like the queen of course but there's more than enough for audiences from other countries to like about this delightful thriller as well. As you almost certainly already know The Italian Job stars Michael Caine as the criminal at the centre of the job dubbed 'The Italian Job' would you believe. Caine is iconic in this film his voice and mannerisms are often imitated and it is this film that is probably most responsible for that. The plot follows Charlie Croker Caine a freshly released crook that with a tip off from a deceased friend decides to steal 4 million from Italy. However it's not an easy job and there are many risks involved so the job must be astutely planned and flawlessly executed for it to work right  and it is there that the film really takes off.The Italian Job is well remembered for two things the first of which is the Mini's. This is the film that made Mini's cool so as you might expect there is a fair amount of stunt work involving the Mini a lot of which is truly spectacular  these little cars can be seen driving up stairs onto and across roofs through shopping centres flying over various chasms etc and it's all very exciting. The second thing that it is remembered for is of course the line  you were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off! which is one of the most quoted of all time. The film's impact on popular culture has been immense and that line's impact in particular is legendary people that don't know the film know that line and I dare say that a lot of them quote it even. It's up there with 'I'll be back' or 'that' line from Dirty Harry. The film also highlights a lot of British culture most notably the reaction to something going right. English patriotism is a little different to the American version  while in America the whole country may be united under the stars and stripes very apple pielike England is much more content to chant a little inside of a prison. I know which version I prefer.I could waffle on all day about this film but we've both got better things to do I'm sure so I'll finish by commenting on the ending which is simply sublime and a perfect way to end the film funny well executed and absolutely genius. Well played.".

In it a thief recently released from prison Michael Caine organizes a scheme to steal a shipment of gold bars by creating a massive traffic jam and using a trio of Mini Coopers to escape with the loot.The cast is pretty decent with the always dependable Caine perfectly cast as charismatic thief Charlie Croker Noel Coward as the incarcerated backer of the titular job and Benny Hill in a small role as a computer expert obsessed with plump women. Besides that there's noone worth remarking on and not much acting that isn't up to snuff.The script is bold and inventive with much of the humour being understated and unpredictable. The heist itself is clever but the staging of the getaway is a real work of art. Again there is an inventiveness that is quite refreshing. Nevertheless I was starting to get a little tired of waiting for the heist to be set in motion. Finally the ending caps the proceedings in memorable fashion.The direction by Peter Collinson is solid and above average for an actioncomedy. The music handled by Quincy Jones is memorable but also characteristic of the era meaning that it is unlikely to appeal to all tastes.If you're looking for a lighthearted crime caper this is just the ticket. I particularly recommend the film since it includes what is in my opinion the best car chase ever filmed.".

This movie was released during my freshman year in college but I certainly don't remember it ever being in any local theaters. From a 35year hindsight perspective it has an Austin Powers feel to it primarily because of the sound track and the periodattire worn by the players. The 2003 remake has a more imaginative yet believable plot while this original has a sly tongueincheek undertone of humor to it. Benny Hill as the computergeek obsessed with largeboned women is a real hoot! I think that subplot could have been played out further in the form of it creating more complications for master planner Michael Caine. Although I like Marky Mark Wahlberg and most of his movies Michael Caine imbued the Charlie Croker role with more personality. The miniCoopers are still the centerpiece of both movies though good chase scenes! This movie has merits that the remake does not and vice versa. It's hard not to compare the two but try watching both again as individual movies.".

The plan involves explosives a traffic jam a football match and a load of mini coopers.I watched this recently on TV  it was shown the night before England played Argentina in World Cup 2002 10 Argentina then dropped put in the first round!.  The reason it was shown was simply that it's strength is that it's a good caper movie where the Brits go over there and put one over on the Italians!  It may smack of zenophobia but that's what it is!The criminals even go so far as to use Mini's for the job  in the most famous scene of the film making them cool for decades!  The reason it was shown before the game was just to feed on the fact that national pride was high.  Even if you ignore the British element the song self preservation society' is now even a football anthem then it's still quite fun to watch. The build up to the job is breezy and funny with good lines while the job itself is fanciful but great fun.The ending must be known to everyone  but it's still good no matter how many times you see it!  The cast are all good  with a range of British TV faces in there bringing a distinct British comedy.  Caine is great as are Coward and Hill but the real stars are the Mini's and the daring comedic race across Turin.Overall this is not a great film  but it is a classic caper movie.  It's made even better by the fact that it makes you proud to be British in a weird way!  Say it with me my friends  hang on lads I've got an idea..'".

Even if you ignore the British element the song self preservation society' is now even a football anthem then it's still quite fun to watch. The build up to the job is breezy and funny with good lines while the job itself is fanciful but great fun.The ending must be known to everyone  but it's still good no matter how many times you see it!  The cast are all good  with a range of British TV faces in there bringing a distinct British comedy.  Caine is great as are Coward and Hill but the real stars are the Mini's and the daring comedic race across Turin.Overall this is not a great film  but it is a classic caper movie.  It's made even better by the fact that it makes you proud to be British in a weird way!  Say it with me my friends  hang on lads I've got an idea..'";

	schema:reviewBody "Charlie Croker Michael Caine has been out of prison for less than five minutes when he begins planning his next heist. This one involves robbing an armored car filled with gold in the streets of Turin Italy. But it's not just the police that Croker and Crew must contend with. The Mafia doesn't want some outsider to come into their country and steal gold out from under their noses either. The job becomes similar to the football match the Crew uses as a cover  it's about national pride.It's amazing that I had never seen this movie before. I understand that in Britain it's considered nothing short of a national treasure. After watching I can certainly see why. Everything about The Italian Job just screams Britannia  the Minis the song with lyrics that are indecipherable to most Americans Michael Caine sensibilities etc. I don't think that the colors selected for the Minis was an accident. About half way through I felt like stopping the movie to make tea.The actual theft of the gold is fairly unremarkable. But the chase afterwards is where a lot of the fun in this movies lays. The Minis are characters in their own right. The final third of the movie is the most amazing commercial for an automobile I've ever seen. We see the Minis go down stairs jump through the air race across the roofs of buildings splash through water swoosh through tunnels and if you watch the deleted scenes on the Region 1 DVD waltz on ice. Sometimes these extended car chase scenes can go on too long for their own good. Not here. I was never bored of watching the Minis race around Turin.I loved the ending. It is left wide open for you the viewer to decide just what happens next. Too many newer movies seem to feel the need to explain everything in the most minute detail. It's nice to use your imagination for a change.Finally the music is another highlight of the movie. It seems a little odd that a movie I have described being very British should have the very American Quincy Jones responsible for the score. I defy anyone to watch The Italian Job and not have Getta Bloomin' Move On! stuck in your head for days.".

The film instructs Croker to take the accumulated plans get a financial backer and pull off what Beckerman describes as a 4000000 gold robbery through a traffic jam. The minor problems are explained but easily overcome by Bekerman's meticulous plans. However the main obstacles to the bank heist are no trivial matter. Croker will be up against the highly sophisticated armored convoy with its armed guards the 'special security' system of the bank and an entire city in Chaos. Additionally the shipment will be protected by the biggest obstacle of all The Mafia Raf Vallone. They warn Charlie if he attempts to steal the gold he will be sent back to England in a pine box. To his credit Charlie wins over the confidence of England's version of the Godfather Mr. Bridger Noel Coward who is superb. To further aid Croker he assembles an odd assortment of characters such as Professor Simon Peach. Benny Hill who is wonderful and Stanley Cain as Coco. The entire film is dedicated to the fact that even the most secure treasures can be stolen. However hanging onto them crossing the Alps and getting back home is subject to the Law of Gravity.

Already well known in the UK from previous films such as Zulu  Alfie and it particular for his portrayal of Harry Palmer in a succession of spy movies Ipcress File and Funeral In Berlin Caine was still largely an unknown on the internation circuit particularly in Hollywood.The Italian Job offered Caine the opportunity to shine across the world and move him into super stardom as the cheeky Cockney with a heart of gold and roguish character. Caine has a very interesting presence on screen a kind of British version of Robert Redford. He looks very self assured perhaps a touch arrogant but he has the capabilities of either lifting a poor film into a competent one or dragging a goood film down to an average one based purely on his own strengths  weaknesses.The Italian Job therefore is very much an average film even if one includes the stunts  chases. But Caine's marvellous character lifts the movies to a more pleasing one because his character is so large  rounded that even though we know he is very much a dodgy criminal by nature he isn't really a nasty evil man and so we can relate to him and cheer him on all the way through the movie.I didn't really like Noel Coward's role at all as the Mr Bridger the highly respected prisonercriminal overlord that even the prison Governor has to respect. To me it was an embarressment and only served to distract the viewer and slow the pace of the film right down. Coward is far too pompous  boorish and added nothing to the movie at all.Some of the supporting characters Benny Hill Robert Powell Irene Handl  John Le Measurier are quite familiar to the great majority of UK tv viewers but don't really do themselves much justice in this film with the possible exception of Hill and his passion for large ladies which would in future years develop into his own TV show Benny Hill Show.Although the story is ok it soon becomes bogged down with too many distractions  seems to take for ever to get moving. And of course because this is primarily a British made film with a lot of UK actors the largely Cockney accent from most of the cast does irritate even to other UK ears.But again Caine's presence makes us forget about these little faults and all of a sudden the film becomes interesting again. But really this film is far too dependent on those car chases and that ending to really make for an enjoyable experience.What the 2003 version of this film will look like I have no idea but I suspect it will fall flat on its face very much in the same way the Hollywood remake of another British classic Get Carter died a quiet death two years ago.The Italian Job is ok for a boring Sunday afternoon viewing but take away Caine and you don't have much to think about.".

I think this is the most overrated film I have ever seen. With one or two exceptions Raf Vallone and Michael Caine though far from his best the acting was disgraceful. The dialogue was laughable and not very funny. Difficult to believe that Troy Kennedy Martin was seriously trying to be funny! Those silly scenes with the dolllike girls who were probably considered the height of sexiness in the 1960's and the whole business of Noel Coward's 'Mr. Big' was ludicrous to the extreme. It was a truly awful film with a waste of not much talent and a whole gaggle of supporting actors who were incapable of rising above the rubbishy lines they were given. I laughed not once I winced continually. Altogether a pretty poor show! I know that you should not take these plots seriously but this was impossible to even accept as a joke.

	schema:reviewBody "Having commented on the 2003 remake of this movie I thought I should also review the original  after watching it again. I noted that the 2003 version is good as well but it is all crime without the comedy and it's almost all high tech. The plot of this original does rely on technology  a switched computer tape that runs the city of Turin's traffic system. But that's taken care of in a few minutes of the film. The rest is a plot of planning maneuvering and action with interludes of miscues. This is among the earliest films to use a hightech device in its plot. Before this time the most commonly used plots with technical devices were security alarm systems in museums and cameras in banks. Humor is interspersed in all this. It's a British movie filmed in Ireland England the city of Turin Italy and the Italian Alps. Michael Caine is Charlie Croker a local bad boy who has just finished two years in the slammer. Noel Coward is Mr. Bridger the imprisoned king of corruption in Great Britain. Croker has to get Bridger's organization to back the biggest heist of all time  4 million in gold. Raf Vallone is Altabani the Italian mafia leader who's out to stop the British heist. Besides being a very good comedy caper film The Italian Job 1969 is one heck of a satire of the British penal system. Every scene back at the prison with Mr. Bridger is hilarious. This is the funniest and best mockery portrayal of a big time criminal living the life of royalty in a prison. The film has a large cast of men involved in the heist but the vast bulk of dialog scene time and humor is with the three main characters. The cinematography is excellent and the filming and scripting of the car chase scenes is among the best of that type of action ever filmed. Mr. Bridger's loyalty to Great Britain and the royal family is the cause of some good laughs a few times. Croker saves the lives of his crew when Altabani and his Mafia men intercept them coming into Italy over the Alps. He tells Altabani that if the Mafia kills him and his men Bridge's organization would come down on the thousands of Italian restaurants and other businesses in Great Britain.The Mafia is protective of Italy's economy while Bridger also is interested in bolstering England's lagging economy by causing the hit on Italy's economy through the heist. It's all quite funny. There are some instances of innuendo about Croker and his love life and a few otherwise clean jokes in places that only the older children are likely to get. So this is a film that the whole family should enjoy. I think one of the very best scenes is the ending. It's the perfect unending to leave an audience to wonder if the old adage is true  that crime does not pay.".

Charlie has just got out of Wormwood Scrubs but finds himself breaking back in to get permission from Mr Bridger a suave and patriotic crime boss to go ahead with the job. Once he has is permission he assembles a team and heads to Italy where they will have to evade the local police and the Mafia create gridlock in the City of Turin hold up an armoured car full of gold then drive out of the city along a carefully planned route in three Mini Coopers.This is one of the great caper movies the plot may be fairly simple but the execution is a delight. After Beckerman's fatal prologue the film shows its true comedy colours as Croker is picked up from outside The Scrubs in the Pakistani Ambassador's car which his girlfriend had stolen. From then on the film is packed with laugh out loud moments that never seem forced. Once the robbery starts things get fairly exciting and the chase involving the crooks in their three Minis being chased by the Italian Police is one of the all time classic chase scenes they drive through a shopping arcade down some church steps across a weir and even through a sewer. Once they are out of the city and transferred the gold to the bus it looks like they are home and dry but the famous ending is literally a cliffhanger that leaves it up to the viewer to decide whether or not they got away with it.The cast do a fine job I can't imagine anybody but Michael Caine in the role of Charlie and the supporting cast which featured some very well known names including Noel Coward John Le Mesurier and Benny Hill did a fine job too. Obviously if you think about what happens too much you'll spot plot holes but that doesn't matter as it is meant to be a fun caper not a serious drama and without some plot holes it wouldn't work as well as a comedy. The car chase is one of the best I've ever seen featuring some great stunts that looked genuinely dangerous. If you want a good laugh you could do a lot worse than this it still feels fresh after over forty years and there is little to offend so it can be enjoyed by all the family... so long as you don't object to having heroes who are crooks!".

I preferred the remake which wasn't the best film in the word but its a better film than this the action scene's are better executed maybe because it was made 30 odd years after its predecessor and the way action sequence's are more doable with CGI and other advances in film making. maybe seeing the remake first clouded my judgement a little even so its still crap over all my rating is 1 out 10 and that is purely cause there is no Zero score.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film has been one of my favorites for years. While it's not overly absorbing or even that well acted the CAR CHASE towards the end is the absolute BEST I've ever seen and that INCLUDES Bullitt!. The yarn is about a thief planning to do a heist by creating a massive traffic jam and escaping using small cars able to navigate through alternative routes. The job is pulled off and the car chase is on. The thieves use MiniCoopers and lead the Police on one of the greatest car chases ever filmed. They utilize sewers and other very tight places to elude the police. The car chase alone is worth the film but the rest of it is also pretty fair. Look for Michael Caine doing a fine job in this film. Again this is one of my alltime favorites!".

	schema:reviewBody "this comment does contain spoilers that shouldn't but might spoil the filmCriticisms of the writing and screenplay aside this is a thoroughly engaging film on the surface. I loved it even though I didn't get it. The creative camera angles the mostly graygreen color palette accentuating a sense of disease or decay the original music and sound design and the beauty of the actors add up to a sensuous ninety minute delight. At times the film seemed adrift on a sea of music carried along by the score instead of leading it while at other times the conspicuous absence of any sound almost embarrasses the viewer in moments of voyeuristic character study. Having said that there isn't much depth or background to the characters in Diary but the focus on their moments of here and now is sharp and clear.Charlene Choi is magnificent as the schizophrenic sad and lonely Winnie. Her face has a beauty suited to smoldering evil or desperate sadness inside and she presents this facade so convincingly that in her very few very brief moments of happiness the shy and hopeful smile that accompanies the change evokes the poetic innocence of a rescued child. It's captivating and magnetic. It draws the viewer into a collaborative dream of promise that when quickly and sadly broken the feeling of empathy is profound. That's good acting and directing.The ending very clearly presents a major twist. However as someone writes in the message board here I know it was the same person but why had two different faces? The cast credits list only three people so one must conclude that the 'real' instigator was Winnie's neighbor but it sure didn't look like the same person to me. Her character was presented as a likely ne'er do well but I'm not sure if it was her or if it was some alter ego some schizophrenic other personality of Winnie. I think the ending twist was unnecessary and even though I didn't grasp the director's intent it didn't bother me remotely enough to spoil the film.Another aspect of the sensuousness of this film concerns the language and subtitles. This is a Hong Kong film the language is Cantonese. I understand about three words of Cantonese but find the language wonderfully lyrical. Even in the few instances where the characters scream at one another there is a musicality to it. Most of the film drifts along like the melody of a bedtime lullaby perhaps a byproduct of Charlene Choi's other profession as a rather famous in Hong Kong cantopop singer.Concerning the English subtitlesat least the set that accompanied the film I watched. Subtitles are often a spongey issue. I imagine that one of two things are usually expected that they are translationally accurate or that they convey more accurately the mood and intent of the speaker. One phrase uttered several times in this film by Winnie is I like to make puppets as I always think they are able to share with me. I don't know what that means because it could mean so many thing. I can only hope the native language meaning is also as wonderfully ambiguous.Anyone familiar with someone learning English as a second language has experienced moments of questionable grammar that are crystal clear in meaning and intent. I'm glad the subtitles appear to have been done by someone whose English was a second language. There are many examples but a few gems for me were I like to make puppets and write my diary Do you have an affair? for Are you having an affair? She instigated me! and my favorite Seth often complained of my cookery. You'll have to see the movie to enjoy the full impact of that last one.".

What makes DIARY so extraordinary is how the Pang Brothers ably create a disorienting nightmare we experience along with Leong. The twist at the end throws you for a loop because we come to a realization as to just how devastated Leong's state of mental well being really is.

The characters of her life are Shawn Yue..as both Seth her long lost love who left her and Ray who looks identical to himand Charlene Choi..as Leong's influential pal and the one who may've took Seth away from her. The Pang Brothers highlight examples of Leong's schizophrenia such as the moment a thundercloud moves through her window into the living room a chair moves on it's own when Leong and Yue are eating supper and how the whole house trembles as the floor cracks open. Reliving certain situations which truly never cease to remind her of the separation Leong is incredible at conveying the confusion sadness loss and fear confronting her conflicted and sick character. It's a kind of disturbing poetry performance and direction deftly portraying a character in turmoil. Shades of REPULSION as this woman often isolates herself from the world participating in a delusion she considers real. The Pang Brothers really throw some curveballs our direction as well as we often relive situations two three times in certain ways challenging us to figure out what is real and what is a fictitious creation of a disturbed mind.

	schema:reviewBody "Charlene Choi is a schizophrenic woman obsessed with another man played by Shawn Yue in this film by director Oxide Pang. The condition of schizophrenia is given ample attention and the script is exceedingly wellwritten and complex. The visuals are dark with limited yet effective use of CGI to communicate important elements to the viewer. There are a lot of twists and turns within this originally structured storyline but in the end they are all logical extensions when the film is studied and understood properly. This is one of the best horror films I've ever had the pleasure of watching. If Gillian Chung had her breakthrough performance in Beyond Our Ken 2004 then Charlene Choi has now officially had her breakthrough performance in Diary 2006. She's practically unrecognizable from her previous roles. She's psychologically fragile obsessive desperate subtle and very unstable. In other words she's fantastic.The cinematography and settings are gorgeous using a variety of techniques to create a dim murky atmosphere. Some scenes are in blackandwhite while others are shot with restricted colors. The overall feel of the film reminded me of Kiyoshi Kurosawa's work absent the ambient soundtrack  Oxide uses his trademark horror beats to great effect here. The limited CGI is very fantasylike which is interesting considering the fact that it occurs within an apartment. Basically Diary is eye candy from minute one.It is ironic that all of the great storytelling that was lacking from ReCycle 2006 has miraculously appeared in Diary. It's almost as if the Pangs decided to sacrifice the former for the latter because Diary simply could not be written more effectively. It acts like a mystery that slowly reveals itself until the very last frame. There is a significant focus on character perspective and subjectivity that ultimately provides the driving force.Most of the reviews I've read have been positive. However some have taken issue with the structure that Oxide chose to use. Needless to say it's wacked out and totally different than most movies. I don't want to get too specific but all I will say is that I thought the movie had ended a number of times before it actually did. Fortunately all of those extra scenes were the best parts. I personally think that the critics are misguided since the weird format works very well.Let's put it this way. I've seen over 200 East Asian horror films and Diary ranks among the top 5. Rating A magnificent 5 out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "Man. What a mindboggling movie! And what horror. The horror... well the movie does fall under the horrormovie genre... but the horror comes not from just the audiovisual effects of the movie but the realisation of what a mind is capable of! The movie revolves the troubled mind of a talented but secluded girl Winnie who can't get over the loss of her boyfriend through break up car accident cancer or...?. Her hobbies are making wooden puppetsdolls and writing in her diary. She confides and seeks comfort with a friend Yvonne who gives her advice like getting even with her boyfriend who dumps her or getting a new boyfriend to get over the ex one... Soon Winnie runs into a guy Ray who resembles her exboyfriend Seth.Things seem to go well for a while... at least so it records in Winnie's diary... Ray and Winnie live and eat together. But then Ray starts to change and Winnie still feels that Seth is in the house with them. Confusion and suspicion arise. Winnie starts to accuse Ray of change of heart. In an effort to confront Ray of calling her a liar because she is unable to maintain consistency in her own storytelling she shows Ray the diary. But only ends up confronting her own ghosts of the past. Sudden realisation overwhelms her and she remembers everything in a flash. In her sheer anger she kills Ray. Yvonne appears in the nick of time to advise Winnie on how to dispose the body...Spoiler starts here Police is called in when the neighbours smell something fishy in the corridor. Winnie claims that Yvonne is the mastermind who instigates her on the killing. She even leads the police into believing that she may have murdered a guy called Seth 2 years ago. When Yvonne is hauled in to ID Winnie only then the truth is revealed.... The whole time when Winnie lives in her world she takes on the appearance image and persona of Yvonne. And Ray though remotely resembles Seth is seen as Seth in her own world. She sees and hears nothing and no one else. She writes in her diary only to reinforce the world she has created in her mind and to script everything that is going to happen because her diary dates as far ahead as in 2007. Meanwhile the Yvonne that keeps appearing in her house is no one but a lifesize wooden doll that she has carved. And all the conversations she has with Yvonne and SethRay are just pure imaginary dialogues. And the real Yvonne and Seth have been her schoolmate and exboyfriend respectively. Both end up as husband and wife. Audience by now realise that the very thing that drives Winnie to depression and madness is the betrayal of friendship and lovetrust.".

After the disappointing Recycle set the prolific siblings back a bit it's pleasant to see them back in moderately satisfying form with a short yet titillating release timed nicely for the Halloween season.On the surface The Diary seems like it's bound for alsoran perdition hinting just a slight too much at working that tired old The Eye magic one time too many. Even its main star Charlene Choi puts on a spectacular Angelica Lee imitation to the point where at the onset of proceedings wary viewers will be tempted to give up and call it a write off.Do not perseverance here is a bona fide virtue and The Diary has going for it more than meets well the eye. Ironically those very fears of this effort descending into a realm of ripoff fiascoes save it from a fate worse than celluloid death. As soon as one thinks they've seen it before which they have in many ways The Diary comes charging through to twist those wellworn elements and throw our own jaded sights right back at us.Choi dabbles in some of her best acting yet as disturbed Winnie Leung Wing Ni we believe in the original Cantonese a lone young woman trapped in a bizarrely oldfashioned dwelling full of marionettes and assorted memories. She has a diary going on although it's not as imperative to events as the title suggests. Instead this film revolves around perceptions memories and knowing what's real. The prime horror here aren't ghosts devils or monsters but the worst enemy a person could ever have their own mind.Winnie struggles with sadness and guilt over the parting of her boyfriend Seth until meeting another man whom she believes to look remarkably like the flame lost. However this entanglement soon also takes on sinister undertones. The man Ray offers scant solace and never truly feels to Winnie the way a significant other should. Wonder why. Ray's done by Shawn Yue an excellent performer in his own right and worthy successor to sensitivemanly icons a la Chow Yun Fat and Di Long. Yue deploys his full range of downtoearth but superlative tricks to help immerse us in the story making up for The Diary's obvious genre associations and further highlighting serious acting going on here.Another boon comes from Isabella Leung accidentally credited as Isabbela doing Winnie's friend and sounding board although much like Ray she too never really behaves the way you'd expect from someone who cares.The trio move around The Diary's reality or lack thereof with a pervasive sense of malaise affecting the movie's delectable mood of diseased uncertainty. We must again mention their surprising and impressive work as seen here something to write about home or otherwise. They're not usually considered part of the annual awards posse and so it's quite gratifying to behold the potent characterizations rendered so eloquently for the benefit of audiences willing to look past popstar prejudices.Coupled with dozens of genuinely puzzling moments and several startling devices they add up to a promising product that's by far the best Pang Bros outing since The Eye itself wowed us over four years ago.Despite its reasonable IIB rating The Diary fields some gore and more than that beckons with the suggestion of things terrible lurking in the background. Its staunch refusal to commit to specifics such as time and place defy the desire to put it in neat brackets. There's dated entries from the diary Winnie keeps but those eventually turn out to mean next to nothing in themselves. As for geography the closecropped cinematography denies the broad vistas needed for reassurances as visuals deny audiences the comfort of knowing where and why anecdotes unfold. All we see are basically glimpses or brief vignettes of apartments markets and office buildings. There's very little context an important tool in establishing surrealism. However this could conceivably have something to do with the Pangs maybe trying to pass the mainland off for HK due to cost cutting. Another mystery apparently.Its short runtime alludes to The Diary's potential as a chapter in a Three Extremesesquire project as does Winnie with her penchant for cookery. But just when it could have bowed out on a note of unresolved malice its makers run away and close with extra scenes consisting of resolution we could have done better without.Even so and despite lacking the brute force of a mind blower The Diary has enough pseudohorror intelligence and winding twists to be enjoyable. It likely won't stand the test of time in the long run but nonetheless does something to inject more life into a thread of moviemaking beset with settling for average and using one pastyfaced protagonist too many.For those on the prowl and looking to sink gnashing teeth into something fun and dark at the same time The Diary comes recommended.".

The part where she kills the man with the crazy look on her face scared me a lot more than audition. The story is very well developed. There are no plot holes. This movie is a very sad one with twists and turns. One major flaw in this movie that audition does not have is the ending of this film. The main character tries so hard to find her husband but what happened in the end. The ending for this filmis extremely aggravating. One of the most aggravating ending any film would have. Hence I prefer audition. This film is recommended for fans of mystery and a movie with a good storyline. However I hated the ending. If you like a phsycological horror with a satisfying ending go watch Koma and Audition. This movie is still great despite its flaws. 8100.5 points deducted for terrible ending.".

Tobey Maguire is the perfect voice for him and Sean Hayes is hysterically funny as Mr. Tinkles' voice!  The writers should have gotten several awards for the script!  Jeff Goldblum is always good so it's no surprise that his character Professor Brody suits him to a tee.  Everyone plays off each other very well and the storyline is original and appealing. I love the fact that Charlton Heston plays the voice of the mastiff at Headquarters!  Very well cast!I hope they do a sequel with all the original actors  voices!  Oh yeah did I mention how great Susan Sarandon was as Ivy ???Bravo to all these actors and to the director the writers and the producer!".

Despite the film's short length it goes along at a swift pace and the characters are at least likable. I have to say Louvoiced with earnest conviction by Tobey Maguire is adorable for a dog and while you certainly don't want to mess with villainous feline Mr Tinkles Sean Hayes seems to having a whale of a time here though he is cute to look at. I have to say I think the best lines came from Mr Tinkles they were often hysterical. As I said the voice cast do a commendable job with the material they are given and Jeff Goldblum and Elizabeth Perkins turn in decent human performances as well. The technical aspects are very well done indeed and the music is good. Laurence Guterman does well directing better than he did in the dreadful Son of the Mask four years later. All in all not perfect but it is cute and has a great concept. Kids will love it adults might. 710 Bethany Cox".

There are several plot holes in this film and a little more explanation wouldn't have done harm. But this film didn't try to be intelligent or gripping  it's basically the Cold War with pets for most of the film but with a climactic finish in which everything is suddenly resolved and all the baddies are ruined. Even if it is not a corkingly intelligent piece of cinema it sure is an amusing one and it isn't badly done either. In fact the climactic finish is brilliantly done and very amusing  machine guns are replaced by spraying machines and bombs are replaced by spraying machines too you'll see what I mean. It stays funny throughout and it is amusing to see how all of the espionage happens behind all the humans' backs. Even if it does make human beings out to be a bunch of idiots who could quite easily be invaded by animals this is still a great film which will tickle anyone's funnybone unless you're a cruel heartless critic of course... 710".

That's a pretty weak concept for a bidbudget special effects action film especially when the production features the best technology has to offer. The movie uses more than 800 visual effects and 200 animators designers compositors sculptors and technicians. With so much going for it Cats  Dogs should have utilized these tools to bring a great story to life. It does breathe life into a plot filled with energy and gusto but it sure isn't great. Unbeknownst to humans cats and dogs have always fought for world domination. A powerhungry Persian cat Mr. Tinkles wonderfully voiced by Sean Hayes has broken a truce between the species. He plans to lead an attack against man's best friend. Jeff Goldblum stars as Professor Brody a scientist allergic to dogs. He conducts experiments in the basement of his house hoping to invent a cure for man's allergic reaction to dogs. Mr. Tinkles designates the Brody home as ground zero for his global battle plan.Initially the folks at Warner Bros. considered doing the film as an animated feature but they finally decided on a combination of live action cuttingedge technology complicated puppetry and computer animation.The results are splendid. Each animal has their own vivid personality complete with facial expressions and physical gestures. The special effects do not overwhelm the film. Lawrence Guterman the film's director doesn't exploit the amazing special effects but focuses on creating believable animal characters. Sadly however the sight of a talking cat eventually wears off and that leaves Cats  Dogs with little interest. It might entertain children with high energy action and talking animals but a movie cannot run on those things alone. Perhaps the film could have worked as a comedy but it lacks any form of wit or impulse. Cats  Dogs thinks its concepts are funny and entertaining enough which is probably why it puts so little thought into the story.".

Perhaps the film could have worked as a comedy but it lacks any form of wit or impulse. Cats  Dogs thinks its concepts are funny and entertaining enough which is probably why it puts so little thought into the story.";

Unaware of his neglect young Scotty as too his parents is completely oblivious to the fact that the parallel world that revolves around them is in great danger of crossing the divide of talking animals and dumb humans.Cats and Dogs is more than puppets meet Muppets it is more than that even though just as entertaining it has progressed to greater levels.

There are several hilarious moments in this picture. The action scenes are done very well. Goldblum and the other actors were. The castle scenes were really cool. The music by John Debney is very good. The movie is totally funny. I thought it was something else seeing all those different types of dogs and cats. So if you who like Jeff Goldblum and the rest of the cast mentioned and comedies with animals then I strongly recommend this film!".

But I'm glad I did so anyway.Admittedly a spy film about talking cats and dogs is likely not going to be the best in cinematography since Casablanca but for its intended audience it's a very funny and wellmade film.The star of the film is Mr. Tinkles a beautiful and megalomaniac white Persian cat who wants to take over the world. Not coincidently it's exactly the same cat that Blofeld from the Bond movies had on his lap. And there are more clever hints at Bond movies.Mr. Tinkles is hilarious as an arrogant and aristocratic feline. A comment I've read is that the film is anticat biased because of the way how cats are portrayed. As a matter of fact the only real Bad Cat is Mr. Tinkles whereas the others are merely his henchcats. I'm a cat lover and quite frankly I'm inclined support the opinion that from a cat's point of view we're merely there to serve them. In my daytoday contact with our two cats I've found that they can be badtempered and even outright vile.The only real letdown of this film is the subplot of the father doesn't pay enough attention to his son kind which we've seen too often before. Because of this and the sentimentality surrounding the puppy it balances somewhere between a children's film and a more regular one.If you want to see a nobrainer film which is still funny and cute and too which you can take your children I would definitely recommend this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "This expose is for people who have seen the movie and can't quite put their finger on why they have come away feeling so dirty. Well people following are a few reasons why The Core poops all over science along with having the worst plot characters and premise of all time. Firstly that little speech the physicist gave to the class about sound traveling through rocks? He says something about the wavelength increasing ding right and then says the frequency will decrease bzzz wrong. Frequency stays the same regardless of the medium it is traveling through. It is the wavelength that will in fact decrease.Secondly what's with the explanation of how the Earth is going to end? Burning a peach with a deodorant can? Come on I know military people are considered nobrainers but he was demonstrating this to the people that lead a high tech organization. This patronises any military personnel as well as the audience. Thirdly The premise of the film is based around the effects that occur because the core of the Earth stops rotating. Let me just first note that there are geological records to say that the magnetic field has changed direction many times in the past with evidence to support that each time it has been reduced close to 0. To the best of my knowledge and that of every history book out there this happens without any of us combusting like the peach.Fourthly the scene with the golden gate bridge heating up because of a hole in the magnetic field? I think someone got magnetic field and ozone layer mixed up. The idea of punching a hole in a field is absurd. The field may be weakened but the atmosphere would still protect our little bridges from cosmic radiation.Fifthly there is a force field magnetic around the Earth not much of one but there is one not an electromagnetic energy field. An energy field would do sweet fck all to deflect radiation. The same radiation that is supposed to wipe out humans like the peach... Sixthly 5 200megaton nukes? Come on those would weigh about 250 tons together. Let's try transport that on the dildo shaped 'virgil'. And the computer simulations of how they would be set off? All in 1 spot? That wouldn't create the required rotational force since there would be no rotational force due to symmetry. He finally gets it right in the end to place them apart from each other. How they initially overlooked this one I have no idea.Seventhly the material used to withstand all the pressure and temperature on 'virgil' was called 'unobtainium'. nuff said.Eighthly assuming we just spent the entirety of the world's budget on developing paradoxically copious amounts of unobtanium it would take another 10 budgets over to have the resources to control the internet.Ninthly when 'virgil' was tunneling downwards why could the people walk around inside as if it was horizontal? They mentioned the rotating bridge but didn't mention anything about rotating hallways or the rip in the spacetime continuum needed to walk straight between the bridge and the subsequent hallways. The compartments would need to rotate individually which would put them out of alignment with each of the other compartments. Logically they would be aligned parallel for everyone to be walking horizontal and not fall to the front of the ship as the front is pointing towards the centre of the Earth. If only they could pretend virgil was round and the entire inside could rotate as one. A pity every shot shows a long cylindrical ship incapable of this.Tenthly the giant geode that they crash into? All that pressure all that temperature? But if that wasn't enough they get out and walk around. I know those space suits they had on looked cool but they couldn't withstand the 1000 degrees of temperature and a few thousand kPa of pressure that is needed to keep the geode from collapsing under the weight of the world. Eleventhly when the ship springs a leak? It would have been like a nuke going off in the ship but instead it took a few minutes for the compartment to crush. Twelfthly the unlucky guy that has to walk through 9000 degrees temperature in a suit only designed to withstand 5000 degrees. He makes it to the duct and switches the lever? 9000 degrees is about 23 times the temperature of a nuclear bomb going off. I think the walls and floor of the corridor would have been glowing white with heat. Our man would have been vaporised but lucky for him only his converse pumps melted to get to the lever. Thirteenthly the guy that pulls out the plutonium rods undergoing fission? He didn't even have a helmet on. 10 says his kids will have 5 noses 3 mouths and a foot coming out of their heads. I guess it's a good thing though that the DNA of such a twit is wiped from our society in these industrial accidents.Fourteenthly when the power cut out from the lack of reactor rods they hook up the power cables to the inner hull. Where do they put the ground? There needs to be a potential drop for power to be gained and if there was a ground then anyone that touched the hull would have been electrocuted. Fifteenthly the arming code for the nukes was the first four prime numbers... 1 2 3 5... Pretty sure 1 is not a prime number. Well thats about all and thats not even going into the fact about how the core could stop spinning in the first place. Thanks for your time.".

If you are not pretentious and take this film for what it is you are more likely than not to enjoy it as I did.All in all this is a classic disaster flick and for a disaster flick this is above average.".

It's a sciencefiction movie that emphasizes fiction over all that is the physics of the film don't hold up to snuff. If you're an engineer or physicist you should be smart enough not to watch it  you'll just spend most of your time secondguessing the inane psuedoscience.It seems the inner core of the Earth has stopped spinning for some reason and this has caused the electromagnetic  field that surrounds and protects the planet to begin to decompose. This is evidenced by among other things pigeons in Tralfagar Square in London suddenly veering at plateglass windows and sundry people who wish they were extras in a lessviolent movie like Daddy Daycare or maybe Finding Nemo. At any rate the world's leading scientists commissioned by the military it wouldn't be a Save the Planet from Imminent Destruction without our pals in the movie military figure out that the core's stopped rotating and that Something Must Be Done to get it going again.Ah but what? We've only drilled down about 8 miles and according to my calculations the distance from the surface to the core is .... a bit further. We must drill down sayeth the sage scientists and lo and behold through the magic of movies there's this guy in the desert who's been working on a laser rocket thingy that'll help them blast all the way down. This handy little thing is just the cure so a crew is hastily assembled Commander Iverson Bruce Greenwood Major Beck Childs Hilary Swank Dr. Josh Keyes Aaron Eckhart Dr. Serge Leveque Tcheky Karyo Dr. Conrad Zimsky Stanley Tucci and Dr. Ed Brazzelton.Like such doomsday movies as Armageddon what The Core has going for it are likeable characters and a lot of nifty FX. It also has the unknown working for it we don't know what lies beneath the thin crust of the Earth because we haven't drilled beyond it. That allows filmmakers a lot of free reign to depict whatever the heck they want in terms of What's Down There.What The Core has going against it however is a predictable plot and some howlingly awful dialog. Now it's not giving anything away to mention that at least one person doesn't make it back from this mission. It's also not giving anything away to note that there's at least one knockdown dragout hissy fit of a scene in which Keyes admonishes Childs for something she didn't do. It's hysterical to watch although I suspect the emotion the director was attempting to convey was more like empathy not euphoria. Or ennui which is unfortunately how some of the movie felt.The Core is cheesy. No not the actual inner core  although come to think of it maybe it is since we don't know for sure what it's made of. And wouldn't that be fitting? A cheesy core for a cheesy film made by cheesy people in a cheesy society? Who's up for some Muenster?".

	schema:reviewBody " out of The Core is the lowbudget answer to Armageddon meaning it was made on less than half the cost but desires to be its equal in delivering thrills and big buckets of popcorn fun.  Now whether or not you liked Armageddon is a good determinant of whether or not you should even bother watching The Core in the first place.  I myself haven't seen that Michael BayJerry Bruckheimer production in a while and memory serves that it was an unbelievably preposterous but enjoyable thrill ride that had a great sense of humor.  How does The Core compare?Well if I hadn't seen Armageddon I might have liked this film more which is not to say that it's a weaker movie just that the disaster formula plays out in much the same way so there's a sense of deja vu hanging over the proceedings.  There are a lot of people out there who hated Armageddon perhaps for its absurd science or for its quickcut action sequences so for those who didn't like the latter The Core would be more up their alley though the science here is even sillier.The premise is the antiDeep ImpactArmageddon.  A group of expert individuals have to go to the center of the Earth to jumpstart the core which has stopped spinning for some unknown reason.  Heading this mission is professor Josh Keys Aaron Eckhart who's leading a sixman team with a woman playing a key role of course as the pilot played by Hilary Swank. Recognizable faces Delroy Lindo Tcheky Karyo Stanely Tucci and Bruce Greenwood round out the rest of this very expendable team.Already we realize the plot is fundamentally impossible.  The only people who wouldn't recognize this are those still in grade school so they'll probably get a kick out of the movie while thinking they're getting some kind of education out of this because of all the scientific mumbojumbo and technobabble.  More discriminatory viewers will scoff at all the sudden new inventions that aid our intrepid group of heroes particularly the hull Delroy Lindo devises that's actually strengthened by heat.  For me scientific flaws are acceptable so long as it's not so blatantly obvious but this movie's stretching my suspension of disbelief.But those who don't care for any scientific inaccuracies will wonder is the action any good?  The answer's a mixed bag.  Almost all the action is entirely CGIrelated so the question of whether or not you find it exciting to see an earthcraft named Virgil get banged around quite a few times is crucial to your enjoyment.  The action aboveground is all given away in the trailers and none of it's particularly exciting thanks to the weak special effects.  The space shuttle crash the destruction of the Roman Colosseum and the Golden Gate bridge are not examples of CGIwork at its best to put it kindly.  A 60 million dollar budget isn't quite enough to pull a movie of this sort off and it sometimes shows.Surprisingly enough the scenes set below ground do somewhat make up for the slack.  A crisis is introduced every five to ten minutes to keep the characters working so what we get is a briskly paced and often enjoyable second half.  The effects work is still spotty but I found the characters relatively engaging the situations fairly compelling and the Mcgyverishsolutions amusing.  Still marring this outing on a consistent basis however are the film's predictability the occasionally really bad dialogue the lack of solid intentional humor and the stilted finale. The Core is not an unenjoyable timewaster but it's not exactly a great night at the movies either.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am watching The Core after having read several other comments about the movie. The sentiments expressed go from being Fine Movie to Worst Movie ever the last obviously coming from someone who rated Starship Troopers as the greatest Sci Fi movie ever made. There are parts of this movie that are actually very good. The first thing to give credit for was the cast that they had. It is a very good cast. Let me repeat a very good cast. Alfrie Woodard has never given a bad performance and although her role was relatively small she brought moral gravity to the role that the movie needed. Delroy Lindo showed a range that I have never seen him do. Obviously better recognized as a man in control he was nigh on perfect as the forgotten but brilliant scientist who still stings over Stanley Tucci's Conrad Zimsky having stole his discoveries from a generation earlier. Tucci a fine actor did take it over the top a bit too much. DJ Qualls gives an underrated performance. He is 6'2 but makes us believe he is a 5'7 geek. He gave a touching performance as he tried to slow down the big bad that caused the problem in the first place. Aaron Eckhart normally a baddie did a believable performance with Hillary Swank a two time Oscar winner bringing her easily recognized skills to the screen. I originally wanted to blame Director Jon Amiel for the faults of the movie but when I went back and considered individual roles and scenes I realized that he did the job he was paid to do. The visual effects were more than adequate constrained by the need not for realism but by the need to show things that would further the story.So where did it go wrong? First the problem I believe was with the writing. The script was very uneven. Part of it came from what appears to be last minute changes in the story line. Early trailers suggest a very different story  and rumors from Hollywood at the time indicated this was true.Too much of the story telling was quick and dirty trying to just get it done. Had they not been locked in to a predetermined release date they could have gotten the script right. Second it seems there was a problem with editing. There were times when the film just went clunk. Was it poor editing in and of itself? Or was it editing that had to serve the problems with the script. Far from a perfect movie but one with some very good elements. Give credit where credit is due.".

Not since Mission to Mars have I hated a movie so much. This movies few supporters try to say relax and enjoy a mindless disaster flick.The question is exactly how mindless are we supposed to be? Should we completely remove our brain first by smashing our head on a rock until it falls out because if so I'll do it. It would surely be a hell of a lot less painful than watching this rancid mass of decay again. And I love mindless action flicks. The problem is even for a pure fx only movie it sucks. All the special as in short school bus special effects look like they were done by some failing college students using their pirated and hacked version of 3D studio. During the space shuttle crash sequence I was half expecting to see little strings attached as it bounced around like it was in a freaking puppet show.The acting a very loose term was below sub par and everyone seemed like they hated the very movie they were acting in. Hilary Swank's character couldn't be any more plastic annoying and clichd if she tried and as for the rest of the cast yuck. Delroy Lindo was okay as Dr. Ed Brazzleton. I wish I could have skin that could withstand 4500 degree heat for 5 minutes. It was 9000 degree in the core but the suit could 'only' handle 4500 degrees and naturally someone has to go outside. Then again it might have been lucky for him so he didn't have to suffer the humiliation of being 'saved' by whales.All in all this movie was an abomination a freak of nature that could have only been devised by the most twisted and sadomasochistic of minds. Maybe in about 10 years or so they'll do a Mystery Science Theater 3000 for it.".

Hilary Swank and Aaron Eckhart will definitely have Oscars someday and most of the other actors who make it on the ship are of similar caliber. The comic relief generally works I'm going to need Xena tapes and lots of Hot Pockets and the plot is no more ridiculous than say The Day After Tomorrow though it is slightly LESS ridiculous at least this movie attempts to offer a cause for the problem however unlikely.I remember watching Entrapment another John Amiel film and thinking it was in a word awful. The editing was off the plot lumbered ahead only through the will of Sean Connery's accent and Catherine ZetaJones spandexclad anatomy. Watching The Core Amiel has decided his mistake was pacing and turns up the volume to eleven and full speed ahead hoping the charisma of his actors covers his butt. In the second half of the film this works fine. In the first half it just shows his limitations as a director... poor special effects during the space shuttle landing that could easily have been fixed with model work or different camera angles birds going crazy and smacking into buildings look exactly like someone tossed a dummy against a building then the editor cut it as close as possible. Truly this is a man at the helm who doesn't know what a good film is supposed to look like. I wonder what an Ed Wood movie would have looked like if someone had given THAT guy 50 million?Characters die with clockwork predictability and my only problem with the resolution was the actors were TOO good. They play geniuses the absolute best in their fields so when the movie ends I wanted to spend more time with them see what incredible problems discoveries adventures they had next. The movie itself is barely a D thanks to the actors occasionally adequate special effects which we will call simply effects and a really great score to hold it all together. I'd buy the score not the pop songs over the credits before I'd watch the movie again but it's a thumbs up effort for everyone who isn't Amiel. Worth a dollar if you have two hours to kill.".

Instead I think expectations have changed.Yes The Core requires a massive amount of suspension of disbelief. And personally I'm willing to suspend it. Would the Earth's core stop spinning? Unlikely. Would we be able to restart it if we did? Improbable. Do I care? Not one bit. The Core is a movie I never tire of and I think it is one of the better natural disaster movies.

Hence any SF flick about humans doing one to rectify the other is likely to be as fanciful as The Wizard of Oz so a big caveat emptor is attached to this movie. I figured that anyone audacious enough to cook up an ecofable like this would have checked his science so as to make the movie more believable but apparently I was wrong according to the legion of IMDb reviewers who have savaged this film.This film reminded me a bit of the 1966 film Fantastic Voyage in which a group of scientists and their craft are shrunk to the size of a microbe and injected into the body of a scientist or was it a diplomat? who has been wounded in an assassination attempt in a race against time to save his life. The Core resembles Fantastic Voyage in several ways First the technological premise that makes possible travel to this inaccessible realm is so farfetched as to be more magical than scientific. Second in all but a few places the inside of the body is naturally quite dark and so one would think is the interior of the Earth but in both movies these unseen realms are aglow with light. Third the sex ratio is similar Four men one woman who of course is played by Raquel Welch. Fourth none of the characters rises much above stereotype since the story is driven by situation not characters. Fifth come to think of it Hilary Swank while not as voluptuous as the young Raquel Welch who could be? does slightly resemble her. Sixth the events of the film are kept secret from the public and Edmund O'Brien's General Carter is very similar to General Purcell who is played by that excellent and serviceable character actor Richard Jenkins. Unfortunately every time I saw Jenkins I was distracted by memories of his hilarious performance as Walter Wingfield in Say It Isn't So. I will say one thing in this film's defense As absurd as it may be and as uninspired in terms of plot characterization visual effects and believability it did keep me watching to find out what would happen next all the way to the end.".

The movie hit rock bottom when the characters got out of their ship into a geode that couldn't possibly exist. The temperature was about 9000 degrees and they're walking around in aluminum foil suitswitch conduct heat and energy. The only good part of the movie is when the guy who made DESTINY dies.

There was something fishy about the trailers  there were two distinct trailers one which played on the whole journey to the core of the earth fiasco and one which was much more interesting touting the whole government weapon conspiracy which wrecked the world angle. I was more partial to the second one and there wasn't really much of this in the film. It was mostly about putting together enough duct tape logic to get a machine that could travel inside the Earth. Unfortunately the film played a little rough and tumble with the science using it only when it suited them and sweeping it under the carpet in other circumstances hoping no one would notice.   Case in point they go through great lengths to explain how this gadget will destroy all rock and metal which gets in its way then come up with a fantastic new element which resists this laser drilling mechanism. Later they find out that this drill can't get through diamonds or for that matter amethysts. Why not just build a ship out of diamonds? We can mass produce these now  why not just take the existing science a step further.   Case number two this miracle metal unobtainium has the fantastic capability to absorb heat and convert it into energy somehow. So later while swimming in 9000 degree molton nickel they use a blowtorch ! to solder copper cables to it. There's obviously two things wrong here. 1 shouldn't this guy get electrocuted by standing so close to the bulkhead? 2 how could a blowtorch make the bulkhead hot enough to take the solder? This thing is holding back 9000 degree metal on the outside. Every calorie of heat from the blowtorch would be converted into energy. I won't even go into the whole idea that heat IS ENERGY! This drove me nuts every time they mentioned it.   There's dozens of these bad science examples running throughout the film. But really I don't care what kind of science you use as long as you at least keep it consistent throughout.   What was even funnier about this film was the fact that they took the greatest minds in the world of geophysics and simply dropped them into the molten mantle of the planet. Why would you do this? I'm surprised none of them dies during training... what if they were all to die instantly? Wouldn't it be a better idea since they had a RADIO UPLINK TO THE SURFACE to have some NavyAir ForceSpace program pilots drive the vessel?   As much as I hate to say it I liked Armageddon better than this film. And I absolutely hated Armageddon. But at least it had a little star power a little campy humour and some personality to the characters.".

It's above average oldfashioned entertainment.The soundtrack alone is a standout. Sweeping and powerful it serves the plotline well and it's a joy to listen to on its own. Although the characters aren't among the most complex and well defined in movie history they work with a couple of exceptions among them Maury Chaykin as John Reed whose acting just doesn't match the tone of the film. And then there's the beautifully reconstructed pirate ships well choreographed action sequences and terrific special effects.In short this is a film that has an unfair rep and it is really worth your time. A great warmup for Pirates of the Caribbean which hasn't opened yet in this neck of the woods.".

It's above average oldfashioned entertainment.The soundtrack alone is a standout. Sweeping and powerful it serves the plotline well and it's a joy to listen to on its own. Although the characters aren't among the most complex and well defined in movie history they work with a couple of exceptions among them Maury Chaykin as John Reed whose acting just doesn't match the tone of the film. And then there's the beautifully reconstructed pirate ships well choreographed action sequences and terrific special effects.In short this is a film that has an unfair rep and it is really worth your time. A great warmup for Pirates of the Caribbean which hasn't opened yet in this neck of the woods.";

Geena Davis was a great actress in comedy and drama genres in the 80s and 90s but was only reasonable in the role of the female pirate Morgan Adams. Another problem was to find an actor for Morgans slave William Shaw since Matthew Modine was the last choice in a long list of actors that refused the role. It seems that this notorious film was also the responsible for the bankruptcy of Carolco Pictures since the box office was frustrating.Said that Cutthroat Island is indeed an entertaining modern in 1995 pirate movie with a good story. The successful franchize Pirates of the Caribbean is an improvement of Cutthroat Island with better technology budget and cast. But the stories are equaly entertaining and funny. In the end forget the bad ratings of professional critics and have a goodtime watching this film. My vote is seven.Title Brazil A Ilha da Garganta Cortada The Cutthroat Island".

One of the most expensive flops ever made this overlong but endearing and even occasionally exciting film deserved much better than what it got in the summer of the mid90s. Not quite as funny as Pirates of the Caribbean but still fun. Already a cardboard cutout role to begin with Geena Davis struggles to overcome her natural aura of motherly warmth to play the roughish Morgan but she plays the part well enough she really does come across as somebody's mother albeit the kind of mother neighborhood boys fantasize about. It's easy to imagine her in the ring with Keira Knightley  who played Elizabeth Swann in Pirates of the Caribbean  and to have Geena walloping Keira's waif like frame. Matthew Modine has his moments as Shaw and Frank DraculaSkeletor Langella is enjoyably hammy as Dawg.If nothing else rent it for the expensive sets fancy costumes and elaborate over the top stunts  many of which Davis and Modine did themselves.".

Therefore since only the box office blockbusters seem to make it over here I did not have a chance to see this in the theater. Somehow I seemed to have missed it when it came out in California. Nonetheless I have seen it here on TV a couple times. The first time I saw it was just after I had seen The Pirates of the Caribbean POTC and I thought it was made afterwards in an effort to be as good or better than POTC. Then I came to IMDb and I was surprised to find that it was actually done so many years ago and I hadn't known about it. I do not think it was better than POTC but it is certainly every bit as good and Geena Davis does an excellent job of portraying what Anne Bonny must have been like as a pirate. If you are a Geena Davis fan I would say that this is a MUST SEE. I personally thought she did a much much better job on this movie than she did as the lamebrained Larry in Fletch or the saccharinesweet mommy in the Stewart Little movies.I have noticed that most of the people posting on the message board about Geena Davis have said that they think the role should have gone to someone else a male because 1 she is a woman 2 she was the ship's captain and 3 she had pearly white teeth.Being a woman pirate IS historical but most people do not know about it. There WAS a general rule that there were to be no women aboard because it was considered bad luck and it was often considered such a grievous sin that any man disobeying the rule would be immediately put to death. Nonetheless there WERE a few women pirates who were smuggled aboard dressed in men's clothing. However they had to know how to pull it off by fighting like a man. Two women of notoriety were Anne Bonny and Mary Read who were both smuggled aboard by the captain himself Calico Jack Rackham. You can find biographies about all three of these pirates among others at several websites under the keyword pirates.So far as Geena Davis not being convincing because she was a woman playing a pirate  a Captain at that in the Trivia for Cutthroat Island IMDb tell us the following The flag flown by Morgan Adams was in reality the flag flown by Calico Jack Rackham one of the only Caribbean Pirates to have women on his crew Anne Bonny and Mary Read. He later turned his ship over to the two women. With that in mind wouldn't it be more than safe to assume that this must have been the catalyst in writing this movie and therefore the movie would most likely have been written as a fantasy of what it would be like to have a woman pirate as the ship's captain?The pearly white teeth thing is also believable because after all women pirates were few and far between and when they were aboard it was in their teenaged years and because they were smuggled on in men's clothing and they were bound to be caught soon I would imagine that they would have had pearly white teeth. By the way where did the idea come from that all pirates had rotten teeth?I wonder if the reason that this movie did not make it in the box office is because of the woman pirate concept. If that is the case why don't the critics bother to get out their history books or surf the web to find out if there WERE any women pirates in the annals of history?I wonder if they would have begun the movie with a written history of women pirates and if they would have stated that the flag that Geena Davis flew in the movie was the authentic flag that was flown by the woman pirate Anne Bonny if that would have added creditability to the movieespecially if it were read by some famous celebrity. On the other hand the name of the movie is everything so I wonder if the name Cutthroat Island was to its demise. Perhaps if this movie were called Pirates of the Caribbean and backed by Disney Studios it would have been a smash hit. Too bad it wasn't.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cutthroat Island is directed by Renny Harlin and written by Robert King and Marc Norman. It stars Geena Davis Matthew Modine Frank Langella Maury Chaykin Patrick Malahide Stan Shaw and Rex Linn. Music is scored by John Debney and cinematography by Peter Levy.A film of many flaws with a reputation akin to it being the devil of big budget failures it is however a wonderful piece of piratical entertainment if you are prepared to see past the monetary excess. Famously cited as the film that bankrupted Caroloco Pictures the truth is that Carolco was going under anyway the studio had filed for bankruptcy before Cutthroat Island had even been released the box office performance was irrelevant it wouldn't have made a bit of difference. And while no amount of hard sell marketing could have gotten the film to make back the 98 million spent making it it received no support from distributor MGM who were in the process of being sold so finances for marketing were not available.Harlin's movie has all the pirate movie ingredients crammed in to the plot though it is a standard plot that sees Davis as female pirate Morgan Adams who leads her charges on a quest to find the ultimate treasure hoard. Problem is that the map is in three parts each part held by separate people one of which is Morgan's vicious Uncle Dawg Langella. The hunt and race is on and Harlin doesn't pause for breath he's a kid in a sweet shop armed with wads of cash but the money as gargantuan as it is is there on the screen well except for the hiring of better actors that is. Two magnificent ships were built for the production and they are magnificent the costumes the sets pyrotechnics exotic locations Malta and Thailand standing in for 1668 Jamaica stunning sound editing and visual thrills all high on value and all cloaked by a tremendously robust score from Debney.Action junkies are well served here with wild horse drawn carriage chases sword fights aplenty ships in side by side explosive battle mucho perilous situations bodies falling from heights or thrown in the sea and we even get a comic relief simian! Who as it turns out is one of the best actors on show. It's hard to believe that a pirate action film such as this would not be better appreciated had it been released in the last ten years and I say that not just because of the success of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise but more so that the blunderbuss popcorn movie has greater support these days. There's a good portion of the movie loving faithful who just want to be entertained where rapid thrills are a requisite not well drawn characterisations and thespian class. Judged on those terms then Cutthroat Island is a winner for sure.Main problems are the clunky script and the three pronged miscast errors in the lead roles. Davis erm wife of Harlin is full of guts really attacking the material with gusto but she never convinces it always feels like a caricature and she's uncomfortable delivering key lines. She would prove herself a fine action actress a year later with The Long Kiss Goodnight also with Harlin directing but she's woefully out of place here. With Davis demanding more and more screen time for her character the role of Shaw began to thin out which was too much to bear for Michael Douglas who bowed out late in the day. In came Matthew Modine zero chemistry with Davis a bland acting style and as far removed from the period setting as you could get. Langella just isn't menacing as the main villain of the piece a very good actor in the right role but not here and some of his attempts at nastiness feel like panto season has started early.Problems for sure but wade through some of the misconceptions and poisonous press and you will find a film desperately aiming to please you with much on offer for the pirate movie fan to savour. 710".

Either peole were NOT interested or the very first viewers told all their friends to avoid at all costs. While it's not a terrible film in the end Cutthroat Island amounts to little more that a string of clichs which attempts to take us back to the days of Errol Flynn but instead becomes a ripoff.Scene one introduces us to Morgan Adams a cunning young lady and a tough pirate. Shortly after the opening credits end her father dies but before he does he makes Morgan captain of his ship and gives her a piece of a map. It is a map to Cutthroat Island where a massive treasure is supposedly buried. The map piece she has however is in Latin and no one aboard speaks or reads it. They sail to Port Royal in hopes of finding a slave who speaks it. They find and purchase one Dr. William Shaw arrested for thievery. The next step is to find the other two pieces of the map and one of them is in the hands of Morgan's evil uncle 'Dog' who also wants the treasure. It now becomes a race for the gold and glitter. Meanwhile the Royal navy has set out to catch Morgan.Cutthroat Island offers everything you might expect. There is sword play gun play jailbreaks storms at sea ship battles and booty. All of this however is presented in a mediocre way. Most of the action scenes are unconvincing badly choreographed and too much is in slowmo especially during the climax.Next there is the problem of acting and characterization. What Geena Davis does is not acting it is play acting. Her character amounts to little more than a girl who can wield a sword and command a crew. Matthew Modine as Shaw is equally twodimensional although he is occasionally quirky. Frank Langella as a villain does nothing but growl and sneer. He doesn't even look like a pirate. His haircut for instance is too short and would not be possible without a modern electric razor.On the positive side at least it's watchable. Seeing as the film is mostly one action scene after another you keep watching just to see what happens next but it never gets better. I doubt it will be long before Cutthroat Island fades into oblivion considering it is the biggest financial loss to this day. While it is not the worst movie oblivion is probably where it belongs.".

Another third of the map is held by her Uncle Dawg BrownFrank Langellawho would rather fight or even kill his niece for sole possession of the riches. William ShawMatthew Modineis an odd sort of swashbuckler that reinforces the winsome female pirate in her search for the other third of the map as well as the fog swallowed Cutthroat Island.It is evident Davis worked hard in this stunt filled flick. However there seems to be no chemistry between the pairing of Davis with Modine. Modine was given the job when Michael Douglas bowed out due to Davis' beefier role. Langella seems at times trying for a laugh than be the menacing villain he is expected to be. Davis at most times is 99 eye candy. There is good support acting from Stan Shaw Rex Linn and Angus Wright.  The movie offers some breathtaking visuals the best being the explosion of Dawg Brown's ship. I also liked the brief scene of a crew member getting his foot tangled in the anchor chain and going overboard. The London Symphony Orchestra provides a rousing score but all of the energetic action could not save this movie...it bankrupted Carolco Pictures.".

It's not that I can't appreciate a good comedyromance I just need to be in a certain kind of mood to watch those kinds of movies. But you know that Geena Davis is a brilliant actress and I loved her in The Long Kiss Goodnight with Samuel Jackson so I was glad I saw it. I wasn't disappointed as the swash buckling Morgan Adams and Matthew Modine steal my heart early on and I started rooting for the pirates on the edge of my seat. They were trying to piece together 3 pieces of a map to find an uncharted island that holds a rich pirate treasure hidden in it. The story is engaging the action is good great sound and outstanding performances from the cast.".

But after seeing her in the movie 'Long kiss goodnight' I don't understand that these films don't get a 10' from people. Maybe its because shes a female hero ? Shes occupying the male scenario and this never makes people feel at home. But that its the charm of it. None of the people I recommended the film to were disappointed.

	schema:reviewBody "I watched it tonight for the first time  I've listened to Debeny's score before and in my book a good score usually meant a good movie. So I thought I'd take out the DVD and watch the movie. Here where I knew that my book would have to be rewritten. I can definitely see why this sank the Carolco ship. 1 Everyone is miscast. I have never seen a movie with worse casting than this  Davis doesn't looksoundact like a pirate. The scene where she climbs over the rock after the jump is fantastic for obvious reasons but she still doesn't cut it as a pirate. The question of believability is not that of can a woman be a pirate captain but rather how can this woman be a pirate captain? And there could have been many answers she is like a mother to them or they are all in love with her or she is a btch from hell and they are scared of her or a combination of the above. Unfortunately the movie gives us no credible answer and neither does Davis' performance. Modine is trying to be what Matthew McConaughey would have become a few years later. Problem is  he is no McConaughey although he is trying really hard. Langella doesn't look or act like a pirate  he seems to be more of an army major at a boot camp. At some stage I almost expected him to check his wrist for a watch and shout You have 40 seconds now move it soldiers! Stan Shaw's role is probably supposed to be comic relief. Otherwise I can't understand the idea with the ridiculous Jamaican accent. Unfortunately there is nothing funny about his role or his delivery so the joke becomes on him. Even the extras are miscast! During a flyover scene of the ship you can clearly see the actors struggling to climb down the Jacob's ladders  was it really that hard to find actors who could manage it a bit better?2 The dialogue and realism. This is a PIRATE movie. They are supposed to use naval terms. Their speech is supposed to be peppered with swearing. It doesn't have to be Rrated because there are ways to stylise speech without degrading it with Fwords but the dialogue in CTI was not stylised at all  it just sounded like a bunch of people talking on a morning train on the way to work. This however is a minor problem compared to the overall level of dialogue interactions and humour in this film. From the balls jokes to wash your mouth to the final I want to see you in my quarters it was just cringeworthy. 3 Action sequences. Could someone in this crew do a bit of research? What canon balls were used for battles how enemy ships were boarded what a sailing ship looks like in battle for heaven's sake? Why is a ship intact after a broadsidetobroadside battle? Why are the masts still standing? Honestly I am not a navy historian but for anyone who read C.S.Forrester as a child these scenes are mind boggling. And don't get me started with the Why's? on the final duel  that scene is just below criticism. Then there is the lack of blood. For some reason the director decided that it's OK to have blood and injuries that the protagonists suffer but there should be no blood in battles. That's fine but then the battles should be choreographed in a way that doesn't require blood. Instead we see closeups of people getting stabbed through with sabers only to see a perfect clean blade when it is pulled out. In some instances the movie doesn't even try to make the impression  you see people getting killed by getting slapped on their backs with sabers. Production values anyone?Finally I feel sorry for John Debney. He composed a wonderful score for a movie bad beyond salvation. If only this score would have been used for Pirates of the Caribbean instead of that awful stuff by Trevor Rabin it would have been so much more fitting a good score and a good movie. And I wouldn't have had to rewrite the rules in my book.Bottom line  310. 1 for the score 1 for the Geena Davis scene after the jump and 1 for the monkey.".

Watched about an hour of it and found it very hard to drag myself off to bed had to work next day so I video taped the remainder.The excellence of this movie can not be understated. Outstanding acting by all which is evident by the fact I liked greatly or disliked intensely the relatively small cast.  It is also a realistic slice I think of a battling small business in a big city.Crux of the story is an outwardly happy married couple who own a fish store take in a down to earth homeless young man Nick.  From a hearty meal at their home Nick ingratiates himself with both Joe  Betty and ends up staying with them in their only childs Danny a Hollywood hopeful room. Nick works with Joe at the fish store and gradually becomes like the son taking over the family business.Everything goes fine until a number of linked incidents take place.  Firstly there is a possibility of Joe  Betty getting out of their day to day existence when a developer is interested in their shops location for a sizeable amount of money.  Next is the gradual interest of Nick and Betty in each other which ultimately leads to a torrid affair.  Finally there is the return of the prodigal son Danny with his wife and young child.From here the movie will glue you to your seat.  So sit back and take it all in I have no intention of stating 'enjoy'.If you get a chance to see this underrated movie invest the time required to view it.".

They feed and bring him home to work with Joe in the fish market. They also offer lodging for a period in the room of their son Danny Steven Schub who moved to Hollywood looking for success as a performer and actor.

The cuckold Joe trusts in Nick and cannot imagine the affair between Betty and Nick. Betty asks Nick to convince Joe to sell the fish market to improve their lives and Joe decides to accept the offer of US 750000.00. The relationship of Joe's family changes when Danny returns home with his wife and son. The selfish Danny full of jealousy and greed begins a game of intriguing ending in a very tragic way. This film is the proof that a lowbudget movie may work since supported by a good screenplay and excellent casting. A very credible and cruel story with an amoral and realistic end not indicated for romantic viewers. My vote is seven.".

If a stray is cute enough a family member will fall in love with it enough to keep it at home. Joe is much the business traditionalist by his rebuffing of corporate takeover requests pressured on him but this hurts his marriage giving his newest and prospective employee a new perspective. He's the son they always wanted to replace the son they wanted to replace Danny. Betty still gazes at Danny's video past to expect a good future much as she does for Joe's pastime despite his heart condition.

The reality of the new living arrangements Nick in Danny's old room pushes Danny to the realization of his replacement. Now a thorn has been added to the side of Nick Betty and Joe. It takes a good deed by Nick against Danny as well as the knowledge of Nick's affair that causes Danny to spiral down even with part of the money Betty gave to help Danny which is used against her when Joe gets the news broken to him. By the end all four never see their futures.

Edward James Olmos and Maria Conchita Alonso husband and wife team give young hunk Arie Verveen the sense of family he never had and soon Alonso and Verveen find a way to consummate their subtle but growing passion for each other right under Olmos' unsuspecting nose. An unannounced visit by Hollywood wannabe comic son Steven Schub kicks the drama into higher gear but an unsatisfying ending ruins what was up to that point an interesting movie with its myriad and complex threads of family life. Music score is nice and the end credits are highlighted by a jazzy moody trumpet solo.".

Edward James Olmos and Maria Conchita Alonso husband and wife team give young hunk Arie Verveen the sense of family he never had and soon Alonso and Verveen find a way to consummate their subtle but growing passion for each other right under Olmos' unsuspecting nose. An unannounced visit by Hollywood wannabe comic son Steven Schub kicks the drama into higher gear but an unsatisfying ending ruins what was up to that point an interesting movie with its myriad and complex threads of family life. Music score is nice and the end credits are highlighted by a jazzy moody trumpet solo.";

The title Ultimate Avengers fits because it's just that a perfect meshing together of two separate universe of characters. The edge that made the Ultimates popular is still present but the characters that made the Ultimates possible in the first place still shine through. Captain America is perfect.

This movie does a good job of adapting the comic to movie form. The transition isn't perfect but it's still an outstanding film.The movie has taken liberties with the comic story in order to suit it into movie form. Most people like myself won't mind but a few diehard Ultimates readers might be irked. In the movie many of the characters are influenced more by their 616 versions than their Ultimate counterparts. The greatest liberty was taken with Iron Man. In the Ultimates he willingly joined the Ultimates and his identity is public knowledge. In Ultimate Avengers he is much more like 616 Iron Man.Story wise this movie combines the first and second arcs of the comic and does so in the perfect manner.As far as voice acting goes it's topnotch. All the characters sound as they should although I still would've liked Sam Jackson to have voiced Fury. The best voice by far is Black Widow. She sounds excellent and is probably the best voiced of all the characters.Overall this movie does a great job of blending two major comic arcs into one story. The story will throw off people that were expecting a perfect comictofilm transition but people with an open mind will enjoy and appreciate the changes. Animation wise this movie is like a cross between anime and cartoon. I can honestly say that the animation looks as close as Brian Hitch's work as you're gonna get which is a very good thing.Final Verdict I'm just gonna say it this is a very good animated movie. It does the comic justice without straying too far from the source material. Fans and nonfans alike will find something to love with this movie. The animation is spot on and readers of the comic will find many scenes to be almost ripped from the comic. All the characters are likable and the voice acting is excellent. Unfortunately fans of the comic will be unhappy with the more 616 than Ultimate aspects of the film. Nevertheless it's a solid film and a very good sign of things to come by Marvel.Score 910".

	schema:headline " Ultimate Avengers  Near Perfection ... GREAT Animated Film";
	schema:reviewBody "I like the fact that jealous DC fans are trying their frustrated best to find flaws and bash this instant classic. It's a sure fire sign that Marvel did their job and gave us one quality animated feature.I do agree that the movie wasn't as complex as the Ultimates in that it did not have the heroes intermingled with politics like the comics did. That's a good thing however. Infusing politics is going to divide your audience because not all of them are going to agree. Quite frankly I get tired of movies that preach politics to me and would prefer sometimes to be transported into another world that doesn't lecture to me. Most moviegoers seem to agree as the highest grossing movies of 2005 were STAR WARS NARNIA HARRY POTTER FANTASTIC FOUR etc. All fantasy films.Some fools are trying to complain about this masterful animation? What are they talking about? Did they want a CGI movie on par with FINAL FANTASY from a few years ago? That's very unrealistic and that movie bombed bigtime. Personally I thought the animation was excellent. I loved the way Cap's shield seem to glimmer in almost every scene. The battle sequences were phenomenal. I watched the movie with those factoid bubbles activated and they mentioned some interesting items about the complexity of the animation. The characters looked great. Iron Man looked ten times better then he does in the Ultimates book. Attempted bashers of this film should move on to another item. The animation is anything but a weakness.I thought Ultimate Avengers was near perfect and really couldn't have expected more. Keeping the Ultimate BS to a minimum was a SEVERE improvement in my opinion.A very good effort all around here and I hope they don't change one thing for Avengers 2.".

It's a sure fire sign that Marvel did their job and gave us one quality animated feature.I do agree that the movie wasn't as complex as the Ultimates in that it did not have the heroes intermingled with politics like the comics did. That's a good thing however. Infusing politics is going to divide your audience because not all of them are going to agree. Quite frankly I get tired of movies that preach politics to me and would prefer sometimes to be transported into another world that doesn't lecture to me. Most moviegoers seem to agree as the highest grossing movies of 2005 were STAR WARS NARNIA HARRY POTTER FANTASTIC FOUR etc. All fantasy films.Some fools are trying to complain about this masterful animation? What are they talking about? Did they want a CGI movie on par with FINAL FANTASY from a few years ago? That's very unrealistic and that movie bombed bigtime. Personally I thought the animation was excellent. I loved the way Cap's shield seem to glimmer in almost every scene. The battle sequences were phenomenal. I watched the movie with those factoid bubbles activated and they mentioned some interesting items about the complexity of the animation. The characters looked great. Iron Man looked ten times better then he does in the Ultimates book. Attempted bashers of this film should move on to another item. The animation is anything but a weakness.I thought Ultimate Avengers was near perfect and really couldn't have expected more. Keeping the Ultimate BS to a minimum was a SEVERE improvement in my opinion.A very good effort all around here and I hope they don't change one thing for Avengers 2.";

Some want to compare it to these TV series and their entire run but that's apples and oranges. If Ultimate Avengers spins off in to a series then there can be discussion.As it stands now Marvel's first animation effort set the bar quite high not only for its future endeavors but for other companies and other studios. Ultimate Avengers proves that animated features don't have to talk down to a presumably child audience. You can set up characters and develop a story just like a live action film. The bonus being that once it's time for action animation offers no limits. Ultimate Avengers proved this in spades. The alien battle and Hulk brawl were intense and spectacular. Setting them up though was what elevates this film past the other movies mentioned above. Marvel's live action movie experience bringing the likes of SpiderMan XMen and even Daredevil to the screen must have given them the edge. They've brought a remarkable animated world to life with Ultimate Avengers.".

	schema:headline " A good start for Marvel";
	schema:reviewBody "Overall I have to say that Ultimate Avengers represents a good start in Marvel's planned series of films. While the animation isn't the best I've seen the art and animation style does allow for some genuinely exciting action scenes particularly in the climactic battle at the end of the film. The only problem is that much of the art comes off as flat and uninteresting during the quieter exposition scenes. The Ultimates is a comic book that was praised for it's incredibly detailed artwork and while there is no way for it to be recreated on film without a gigantic budget it's still a shame that the movie didn't live up to those expectations. Still the artwork is far from horrible and it did grow on me as I watched the film.Although I don't think the movie quite earns its PG13 rating like a literal adaptation of The Ultimates would it's still nice to see an animated movie that is aimed at an older audience. The story is smarter than your typical animated fare although it isn't as interesting as the original comics themselves and the main characters have more depth than one would expect from an animated film. This is particularly true about the characters of Captain America and Bruce Banner. Captain America has to come to terms with the fact that he has been frozen for the last sixty years and that everyone and everything he knew and believed in has drastically changed or has been lost forever. Meanwhile Bruce Banner is portrayed here as an unstable man dangerously obsessed with ridding himself of the dangerous monster that he becomes when he gets too stressed fans of the Hulk will love this movie. He is not a very likable character and it somehow makes him and the Hulk much more frightening.The only major complaint I have with this movie is its running time. At only 71 minutes it's just too short. There are lots of interesting things happening in this movie in terms of character development but there are many more that remain unexplored simply due to the film's length. Only Captain America and Bruce Banner really get the treatment that these characters deserve and while the others are indeed interesting we don't know all that much about them in the end. The running time also can be blamed for the somewhat rushed and anticlimactic ending although the final fight scene is truly exciting. This is all very unfortunate because all Marvel had to do was add about anther halfhour to make this movie truly memorable.In the end while it isn't perfect Ultimate Avengers does represent a good start in Marvel's planned series of animated films. I'd love to see more of this stuff especially if Marvel really pulls out all the stops and turns out some movies that really live up to the comics.".

The film is basically the first Season comprising of I believe 13 comics of The Ultimates which was the Ultimate Marvel version of Marvel's original Avengers comic. All the characters bar unfortunately Hawkeye for unknown reasons appear in this comic and not only do they bear as close a resemblance as a cartoonfilm can to carefully drawn captions of a graphic novel but the also wear the costumes found in the Ultimates comics. Too often do you find details missing in film adaptations but despite the changes that were made to compress 13 comics into an hour and ten minutes of film time I noticed nothing significant to annoy me.So as I said earlier if you are one of the Ultimate Marvel fans you have nothing to lose from watching this  if you find it too different from the original then who cares? There are so many different versions of all the Marvel comics around these days what's one more to the total on the offchance some don't like it? I give it eight out of ten merely because the animation was good but just not the best  there are some better quality cartoons out there but there always will be. It is certainly better quality than the Saturday morning cartoons that we have all come to love and if we can watch them we sure can watch this! So I hope my opinions have helped you.

This was well worth the 14.00 price tag and my 6 year old even got into it and wanted to watch it again immediately after seeing it. I thought this was a fair reflection on the quality of the work as she cannot sit through Justice League or Spiderman cartoons she finds them boring. But this one held her attention probably because the artwork was good the story was complex with a lot of nods thrown to us old comic book fuddies and readers of the original Ultimate books while still being able to convey the story effectively and be very enjoyable to those who never got into the characters in other formats. It's rare for a project dealing with characters who have such a long history with many to be so well received by hardcore fans and people introduced to the Marvel Universe for the first time as well. It isn't an exact reproduction of the first Ultimate Avengers line the story is very similar but the scenes actions and character interactions are almost all different. I say that so you won't worry that you are watching the same panelsactionslines of the comics but rather a new take on the same story of origin in the Ultimates books. I am already looking forward to the next installment and I'm pretty sure that this is going to start at least a dozen or so animated movies with the Ultimates themes. If the quality of the first stays consistent for all of the future installments this will be a very successful line. Go ahead and pick it up for 14 bucks it's worth it.".

Marvel probably wanted the movie to be a family feature but I still hope to get a more adult version... maybe a live movie?The plot starts really nicely with the disapearence of Cap America during the War. I wish Red Skull would have made an appearance. The Alien story was not the best way to go but it is just an excuse to throw a twist we all were waiting for... The most dangerous ennemy was inside the group. The characters are all interesting except from Thor I never liked him anyway but he is just a guest as a Beer drinker lol. Cap America is lost in this new world he discovers. Nostalgia and flashback He is the most interesting hero in this story.Watch closely for some character's habits. Tony Stark is still running after women and still dinking. The armor looks good.  Giant man is a smart ass and still jealous.  Nick Fury still looks like Samuel Jackson too bad Samuel didn't play the voice.  Black Widow doesn't do much but She is still very Sexy.  Thor is useless...  HulkBanner is very interesting as He is very ambiguous in his motives. We never know what he truly looks for...Well not bad for a first one What's next?

	schema:reviewBody "Being that I've read the ultimates beforehand and heard rumors that they were working on this movie at least 2 yrs ago I was surprised when i actually got to see it.The story revolves around Captain America not entirely how he was made but during his times in World War II and his frozen Demise. suddenly waking up in the 21st century with everything changing around him and an old alien threat looming in the mist an old school hero must call upon help from a new school team with the help of Nick fury which i felt the person playing the voice of him was a bit bland but good all together. call upon Iron man Wasp Giant man Thor and Black widow to take down the opposing forces and from within as well.The animation is evolved but not enough to satisfy most people but i will give them credit for bringing the team that did the ultimates to come in to work with the animation. the voice overs aren't up to standards but they will suffice to make the pace of the movie fast and furious right up to the climax...the story alone is taken out of the Ultimates and Ultimate Nightmare which is a side comic of the Ultimates during the time of an alien threat just bits and pieces though so don't expect too much. All in all the movie is good to match wits with a typical Saturday morning cartoon and I wouldn't be surprised if they do continue it to Saturday mornings but the movie is fast at times the fights are pretty damn good but its not just a kids movie there are some scenes of violence that even i thought either can make or break this movie trust me someone will be bloodied up or broken...the story is typically straight from the ultimate series and the voice acting could be better but this still a movie to watch...check it out!".

	onyx:emotionText "Being that I've read the ultimates beforehand and heard rumors that they were working on this movie at least 2 yrs ago I was surprised when i actually got to see it.The story revolves around Captain America not entirely how he was made but during his times in World War II and his frozen Demise. suddenly waking up in the 21st century with everything changing around him and an old alien threat looming in the mist an old school hero must call upon help from a new school team with the help of Nick fury which i felt the person playing the voice of him was a bit bland but good all together. call upon Iron man Wasp Giant man Thor and Black widow to take down the opposing forces and from within as well.The animation is evolved but not enough to satisfy most people but i will give them credit for bringing the team that did the ultimates to come in to work with the animation. the voice overs aren't up to standards but they will suffice to make the pace of the movie fast and furious right up to the climax...the story alone is taken out of the Ultimates and Ultimate Nightmare which is a side comic of the Ultimates during the time of an alien threat just bits and pieces though so don't expect too much. All in all the movie is good to match wits with a typical Saturday morning cartoon and I wouldn't be surprised if they do continue it to Saturday mornings but the movie is fast at times the fights are pretty damn good but its not just a kids movie there are some scenes of violence that even i thought either can make or break this movie trust me someone will be bloodied up or broken...the story is typically straight from the ultimate series and the voice acting could be better but this still a movie to watch...check it out!";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a big fan of the whole Ultimate Marvel thing and especially The Ultimates. So I was really looking forward to this movie. I wasn't disappointed but I wasn't all excited after watching it either. First off the animation. It's pretty sweet. After seeing a trailer I was kinda worried because that trailer wasn't too fluid. But it was probably either the trailer or my computer because the movie itself is really fluid. Voice acting is also good. My only two gripes are that Black Widow has a ridiculously overthetop Russian accent and that Nick Fury doesn't really have a lot of emotion in his voice except after the first teammission.Next the story. The Ultimates V1 the comic is basically 2 stories the 1st is about the Ultimates forming  finally fighting the Hulk and the 2nd is about the alien invasion. The story of the movie is basically those two rolled into one. Understandeable because it would be way too long if they did it like in the comic. Still the movie is only about 70 minutes long right now so I'm sure they could've done it a bit better. Anyway the story itself SHIELD set up a new SuperSoldier program but it's going nowhere so they set out to look for WW2 hero Captain America frozen in ice. They find him but too late to create an army of supersoldiers to counter the coming alien thread. So SHIELD jump starts Project Avengers which pretty much means they'll recruit Wasp  Giant Man Iron Man  Thor.A few things I didn't like  The WW2 part in the beginning. Captain America encounters the aliens. In the comics they tie to that to form a huge conspiracy. But in the movie they just don't. It seems like WW2 and the invasion now are two completely separate events.  Thor declines at first like in the comics. In the comics he comes around during the fight VS the Hulk which is about halfway in the series. Here the fight VS the Hulk takes place during the last 10 minutes of the movie so Thor hardly appears in the movie. Also Thor has lost the beard for some reason...  Maybe this just bothers me because I'm not American but it focused on Captain America a bit too much IMO. This is especially clear during the battle VS the Hulk. Hulk makes short work of Giant Man Iron Man  Thor and literally fights them off within the minute. But Captain America with no superpowers actually holds his own against the Hulk. In the comic he at least has a tank...Anyway the movie was pretty good but not as good as I hoped it to be. 7.5 out of 10 but I voted a 7".

I realize the characters involved were created 40 to 50 years ago but this story does an excellent job of making these characters appeal to a newer generation. The animation is up to par with what is being produced in Japan and opens up the world of Marvel to a global audience. Any fan of AnimeManga or AnimationComics would be very entertained by this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having only basic knowledge of a few of these characters Thor and The Hulk I watched this movie on a whim. I enjoyed it more than I expected although I was a bit confused at first trying to figure out who's that and what's their motivationability?  but I understand there wasn't enough time to go into every character's history. Plus the target audience is probably familiar with it all and impatient to get on with the action. Still Black Widow Giant Man and The Wasp especially needed more screen time and fleshing out.Much of the time and development is devoted to Captain America and I just fell in love with this character! First the movie grabbed me with an audio excerpt from Command Performance radio show and an awesome WWII opening sequence  I'm a big fan of this era and immediately perked up. I was impressed by the battle scenes which reminded me of many liveaction war films from the 1940s. It felt authentic... well until we find out that the Nazis were in cahoots with...aliens! Anyway Captain America's character is very sympathetic and I really felt for him  the storyline of an oldfashioned hero a decent guy from the past who has to adjust to modern times just resonated with me. I'm sure part of that is because I can relate a bit due to my own feeling of not belonging in this time period  but part of it is the truly good writing and voice acting. Not only does Cap have to deal with culture shock but the fact that many of his friends are dead and other loved ones have aged and moved on with their lives without him. This is really only touched on in a few minutes but manages to be very moving nonetheless.The majority of the film deals with Captain America becoming the reluctant leader of the Avengers a group of superheroes who aren't used to working as a team and whose personalities of course clash. They must combine their powers to deal with a major threat to the world ... those pesky aliens again! This basic idea reminds me of the Justice League animated series' pilot  but I enjoyed the execution of Ultimate Avengers much more! I bought the JL DVD containing those first few episodes packaged as a minimovie and I remember finding it...boring. Dull characterization and just not emotionally engaging. It did not make me interested in watching the rest of the series. But if Ultimate Avengers was the pilot for a TV series...Another sympathetic character here is Bruce Banner who is desperate to find a way to control The Hulk and harness his violent strength for good. I liked the fact that he turned out to be the real threat at the movie's climax rather than those paperthin aliens. I sometimes get annoyed by tragic backstories and inner demons and so on  sometimes you just want a black and white clearcut good vs. evil story like I said I belong in the good old days with the Nazis! Well not with them exactly but youknowwhatImean  but Ultimate Avengers' treatment of The Hulk was a great exception. Just enough angst to give him depth. I didn't find him too whiny like some people apparently did.I'm not sure I like this treatment of Thor though. Seemed like the writers just weren't respecting him enough  what with the other characters thinking he was delusional and not a real God... and calling him a chick and all. And doesn't he have anything better to do than hang around wharfs threatening fishermen?! Although the female characters were underused and underdeveloped it was nice to see Black Widow and Betty Ross make significant moves to help end the final fight.Last but not least the animation. I don't know why some reviewers found it lacking. At no time did I think to myself oh it's okay...for directtovideo. Seems to me it would be more than good enough for a theatrical release. I actually assumed it was until I came online and read otherwise. Cool character designs some great background art nice effects and just the right blend of traditional handdrawn animation and CGI. I hate the overuse of CGI these days preferring subtle enhancements that aren't too distracting.Mainly though the story is the thing. And despite the flaw of having too many characters to develop in such a short running time I found Ultimate Avengers a lot of fun. Not perfect but better than the average actionadventuresuperhero movie. Better than most animated OR liveaction films in general from this disappointing decade.".

It is nice to see cartoons get back to the animation I was used to as a kid watching Saturday morning cartoons. The cartoons of today are terrible. This was definitely a plus for this animated film. However the story did not do too much for me. I was hoping for a lot more of Iron Man but the film mostly centers around Captain America. Again I have never read the comic so I can't tell if this is true to the original story. Also the film was laughably short. Only 70 minutes. But I guess that is to expect from an animated film.Overall a fun timewaster. Fans will definitely love the film. I unfortunately was never really a fan of most of the heroes in this film so I guess I just didn't get it.".

One could argue the style was just different than say good animation but the key problem was that the actual film animation was just vastly different than the animation promised to me in the teaser trailer. The teaser had things framed like the comic book but the actual movie had none of those moments in them. What the hell happened to the good animation? Where is my scene of Iron Man crashing the Hulk through Grand Central Station? Let's move away from the animation for a moment though. Let's go to a far more pressing argument of story itself. As a comic book fan and a movie fan and someone who somewhat understands the way Hollywood works I will not gripe that the comic wasn't 100 accurate to the comic book. I won't even gripe that the comic wasn't 50 accurate to the comic book. In fact I will even ignore that the movie was only accurate in that the names of the characters were the same. My complaint toward the story was that the movie completely left out any sort of feelings for the characters.Let's take a film that is considered to be the Citizen Kane of animated features. Batman Mask of the Phantasm. This was a fantastic film that gets better with age. As a child I found it somewhat boring but still entertaining. As an older child I have learned to look for the subtext listen to the fantastic dialog and I have learned to appreciate the motifs used in this film. That movie makes you genuinely feel for the characters. It makes you wonder why Batman does what he does. It makes you cry out in anguish as you realize that Bruce and Andrea lost something they can never hope to get back. In summary Batman made you feel for the characters.Avengers doesn't come close. It is a Jerry Bruckheimer film but because of poor animation it doesn't even make the action look good. Bruce Banner was a somewhat interesting character but he wasn't painted as a man tormented by the fact he is a monster but a man who is addicted to being a monster. he searches for a way to control the monster. It takes away from his tragic figure and makes him more of a mad scientist type.Finally let's look at voice acting and writing. the dialog was trite and painful to listen to. Cap's voice sounded like a 17 year old asking his dad for the car keys. Geh. It was just terrible all around.I understand that Avengers was a movie for all audiences but so was batman . . . and look how beautiful that film turned out.".

As the Hulk isn't worthy he should not have been able to pick it up regardless of his strength! really bugged me that bit This film is basically just setting the scene for future Avengers movies. Its the gathering of the heroes and how they learn the need for leadership and teamwork when initially they are all one act loners. They learn this the hard way by failing in their first mission with devastating consequences because they didn't follow orders or the plan. The Star of this film is definitely Captain America. I give it 10 because of the cap's character and growth and because I know this is just setting up the next movie which I can hardly wait for.Still I wish they had done the new avengers film with spiderman and wolverine as well.".

The animation quality is subpar making the movie an over hyped Saturday morning cartoon especially if one considers the teaser trailer that was featured on the DVD's website. The writing is simply a let down. It has gone from a book that was dark witty and emotional to a film that is basically two damns and a burp joke. The funny thing is that they had half the movie already produced when you look at the graphic novel which should have been used for the storyboard and the script with a little tweaking to expand it into a hour and a half long movie.

	schema:headline " A big bug rubber dinosaurs and Ringo. In my book that's funny!";
	schema:reviewBody "I just had a look at the new DVD of one of my alltime favorite comedies and I don't watch a lot of comedies Caveman.'  It's one of the VERY few comedies that I can watch more than once.  The rudimentary nature of much of the humor doesn't in my opinion make it a kid's film although I think lots of kids would enjoy it.  Bumping your head or falling on your arse has been funny since the Jurassic period.  That's one of the great constants of human culture.  Mix in some stopmotion rubber dinosaurs and a huge bug and I think you'd have to have a stick permanently implanted up the bum not to at least get some laughs.After reading some of the other comments I'd like to make a point or two about this film Yes the stopmotion dinosaurs are not realistic.  It's a comedy duh! and they're supposed to be funny not realistically frightening a la Jurassic Park.  The language spoken isn't Swedish are you putting us on dude from Toronto? but a prehistoric language fabricated for this film.  Caveman flicks have been doing that at least since the 1940 version of One Million B.C.' and these madeup caveman languages always sound to me a bit like Esperanto another fabricated language.  The language in Caveman' may have been intended to parody that old film clich.The menu of the new DVD offers multiple soundtracks in English French and Spanish.  Be sure to check them out suckers.  There's really no extras on the DVD some commentary from Ringo might have been fun but it has an excellent anamorphic picture which is enough for me.  It never looked quite as good as it does here.  It's just a goodnatured comedy that's executed with style and artistry.  It looks great has some superb comedic actors that hit just the right note and gets maximum effect from the simple gags it presents without in the least belaboring them Mel Brooks fanatics take note.".

	schema:headline " Truly one of the greatest films of the 80s";
	schema:reviewBody "Very few films have the capacity to change the way we think and feel about the world around us. This is one of them.This touching film is about daring caveman Atouk and his brave companion Lar who are expelled from their tribes journey through exotic precambrian lands learning about the people and world around them. Ultimately they form their own tribe and more importantly learn cameraderie the heart of what it means to be human and to have love. Caught up in the chaos of a savage ancient world Atouk and Lar eventually have to struggle just to stay alive.This movie lost the Best Picture Oscar in 1981 but history will likely remember Caveman for much longer. And with more fondness. The cinematography is excellent. Alan Hume's prehistoric world is photographed as a mystical paradise. Then we see the horror of human greed lust and cruelty also stunningly photographed. There is also a nice scene with a bunch of people thrashing about in a large pile of dung. It looked so realistic that for a moment I felt like it wasn't a movie but a documentary.The acting is top notch especially early performances from Dennis Quaid who exposes his buttocks and Barbara Bach who should have. In one scene Dennis Quaid makes impressive use of method acting urinating against a glacier. And Ringo Starr deserved the Oscar he unfairly lost to Dudley Moore that year.Everyone needs to see this movie at least once. Although it might be a little disturbing the violence is not gratuitous the love affairs wistful and heartbreaking. Despite the tragic elements however the movie is inspirational. One of the best films to come out of the 80s!It's underrated films like this that don't get any publicity and the overrated pointless films do. I guess that's just the way Hollywood operates. This is one of the saddest most touching most unsettling most moving films I've ever seen. It's one of the best. It nakedly shows the rudimentary nature of humanity by showing our primal origins when a fire meat and the warmth of a lover and support of friends was all that kept us from the brink of death. Caveman captures and horrifies the viewer. There is something classical about the plot of Caveman. If Aeschylus was alive today and making films he would have made Caveman.The vivid imagery and music is outstanding but the acting and intensity shown is very realistic. This is one of the most harrowing gripping films I've ever seen reminding me of so many other films of the era. Quest for Fire being one but The Killing Fields being another. The Killing Fields is a movie about people who weren't exactly on the front lines nor are they exceptional warriors. They're everyday people like you or me who do what they can to help one another out. Caveman is like this.I can't put my finger on exactly what it is about this film that gets to me so much but it is THE most haunting emotional film experience one could hope for.Excellent performances from the cast. A brilliant score by Lalo Schifrin. Scenes of high emotion tension drama horror and even one or two pieces of light relief usually involving Shelly Long.An excellent film. Certainly one of the best foreign films in recent memory Caveman is ripe for a new Director's Cut edition or perhaps a modern Englishversion remake featuring John Malkovich. I have only ever seen the original undubbed and notsubtitled version I never figured out what language it was  probably Swedish and had difficulty with some of the more elaborate dialogues.".

Soon the smart Atouk becomes the leader of the misfit tribe and dispute the leadership of the whole clan and Lana with Tonda.

The movie has its own language that is very easy to translate and understand the meaning of the words. Shelley Long is very beautiful and this movie introduced Ringo Starr to Barbara Bach that married each other in the end of the release year 1981.

They're all animated by stopmotion and have the most ridiculously bulging golfball eyes. They also have been given a certain amount of anthropomorphism which makes them characters not merely decorations.This movie is also almost entirely dialogued in Cavemanish Apart from one scene there's no English spoken at all. However it takes almost no time to pick up the entire caveman vocabulary and you'll find caveman words creeping into your everyday life when you least expect it. Words like Tonda Zugzug and Macha all have their place and you'll find yourself using them amongst your friends if you watch the movie together with a few beers.It seems incredible though that when the film was released theatrically they handed out flyers explaining the language and what the words meant. How stupid did they think the average moviegoer was? It's far more fun and entertaining to figure it out yourself and to be honest it's not at all hard.It's also surprising that this flick doesn't turn up on TV more often.

It's far more fun and entertaining to figure it out yourself and to be honest it's not at all hard.It's also surprising that this flick doesn't turn up on TV more often. It's harmless fun and enjoyable enough to watch every so often.";

	schema:reviewBody "Deliberate nobrainer comedy stars none other than Ringo Starr. Ringo plays Atouk a caveman in one zillion b.c. who is considered inferior by the bigger and stronger men of his tribe including the leader Tonda John Matuszak. Cast out for attempting to get with Tondas' mate Lana Barbara Bach whom Atouk lusts after Atouk forms his own tribe with misfits such as his good buddy Lar Dennis Quaid friendly stranger Tala Shelley Long and her blind father Gog Jack Gilford.The movie is cowritten by Rudy De Luca and Carl Gottlieb the latter recognizable for having contributed to the script for Jaws and having played Meadows in that classic. It's often silly and childish sometimes a little tiresome but it's not attempting to be anything more than a goofy good time for comedy fans.The dialect spoken by our heroes and antagonists is most amusing aloonda means love macha means monster ool means food etc. Zugzug means...well I think you can figure that out. It's not really that necessary to have a translation handy. The gags aren't always that successful but the ones that work are pretty funny. One has to love the cartoon physics every time that Tonda tries to throw something heavy.The cast is lively and engaging. Ringos' hangdog looks are perfect for his hard luck character and Dennis Quaid is a total hoot as another guy who often can't seem to catch a break. Both the stunning Bach and the sexy Long look good in skimpy cavewomen clothes. The real highlight of Caveman is the fantastic effects work of Jim Danforth and David Allen those dopey dinosaurs are just hilarious and endearing. Note that the critters are credited as playing themselves with the exception of the Abominable Snowman who's played by Richard Moll of 'Night Court' fame.Lalo Schifrin's music score is most amusing  the main theme is insidiously catchy  and there's plenty of fine location shooting in Mexico.Incidentally this is where reallife married couple Bach and Ringo met.If you attempted to play a drinking game for every time a character name is uttered  especially Tonda  you'd be drunk before long.Seven out of 10.".

No dialogue is necessary anyway the endless sight gags and slapstick bits tell you what little you need to know about the plot. The plot goes something like this Ringo goofs up and is banished from his tribe. He and Dennis Quaid Fred to Starr's Barneywander around encountering odd Jurassic adventures. Look for Tickle Me Elmo's prehistoric ancestors bug eyes screeching high pitched noises short arms and all they are definitely a highlight. The cast all seem to having a blast doing the movie and the fun comes through on the screen. Shelly Long John Matuszak Jack Gilford and all the rest make for a good comedic time. There's all the usual dino dung and other similar type jokes but they work in this movie. An exuberant cast a clever script and some outrageous sight gags make for cool some modern stone aged entertainment.

Sidesplitting comic highlights include the discovery of fire the invention of music a predatory tyrannosaurus rex getting stoned after eating marijuana a gutbusting appearance by a shaggy and shambling Abominable Snowman towering Richard Moll in gnarly makeup designed by Chris Walas and Lana's ultimate comeuppance. The screwball humor remains endearingly goofy from start to finish it never becomes too mean or vulgar. The delightfully ridiculous stopmotion animation dinosaurs by David Allen are especially hilarious. In addition the enthusiastic cast have a ball with the broad material with standout work by Dennis Quaid as Atouk's loyal friend Lar Jack Gilford as blind old man Gog Cork Hubbert as dwarf Ta and Evan Kim as articulate Asian dude Nook. Alan Hume's slick cinematography makes nifty frequent use of wipes. Lalo Schifrin's robust bouncy funky score likewise hits the nutty spot. A cool and amusing romp.".

These days it would probably be considered a family film. I was 9 or 10 when I saw it on cable at the baby sitter's house and it tickled me to no end. Watching it again recently it's a ghastly enterprise that would barely make the cut on Comedy Central but it does have its charms chief among them Ringo Starr as the hapless hero. He's a great physical comedian using only his face body and a vocabulary of grunts to express himself. The dinosaurs that seem to be around every corner are goofily rendered in stop motion animation yet they have twice the personality of any modern CG monster. It's all harmless fun and I wouldn't be horrified to show it to my 10 year old nephew.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was one of the top films of my childhood and I still enjoy it today. It's basically One Million BC as made by Mel Brooks with sight gags funny moments and good characters but it is also a misfit tale with a hero finding medicine fire music cooking tools and friendship as he tries to get the attention of the woman he loves. The characters have simple phonetic oneword names and the special effects anachronistic as they arebring to life a bloated fat tyrannosaurs an anorexic pteranodon and a generic ambiguous lizard among cavemen with Afros. Barbera Bach emotes a kittenish cave girl named Lana Ringo Starr plays the hero Atuk using sounds gestures grunts and faces to emote his character and John Matuzsak plays the oafish and bullying Tonda who dominates the cave. Shelley Long long before Cheers plays the other ladylove with virginal grace and the late character actor Jack Milford is given a few jokes as the suffering blind father to Shelley. Richard Moll long before Night Court is even on hand as the comically lonesome Abominable Snowman. It's a great movie with very little dialogue funny situations interesting character development and a great message for the child in all of us. It would really be interesting to see a sequel or update of the movie with the advanced special effects of today.".

	schema:reviewBody "After his last holidaythemed boxoffice smash Valentine's Day in 2010 director Garry Marshall has carboncopied the exact same formula for his latest film New Year's Eve which uses its gigantic ensemble cast to document various different relationships and states of emotions over the course of a single day and night in New York City.The story lines include a couple awaiting the birth of their child two people who become trapped together in an elevator and a gentleman who is trying to enjoy his last New Year's Eve on earth as he sadly lays on his deathbed.Much like Valentine's Day Marshall's latest film seems to forget the importance of character development and indeed surefooted narrative these films feel like the audience are watching Ashton Kutcher flirt with Lea Michele or Zac Efron helping Michelle Pfeiffer which  in all honesty  they are. Never are viewers able to break away from the celebrities portraying these supposed characters which cause great issues when trying to build and present emotion.The film also has some bizarre cast members including the incredibly pointless Jon Bon Jovi who slinks about and may as well be promoting a new Greatest Hits album when he enters the frame. Stars like Halle Berry and Robert De Niro are incredibly redundant here even though they do benefit from moderate screentime. Performers like De Niro are worthy of a solid script and something more important to do rather than just stand around holding a theoretical sign saying 'And Robert De Niro'.Contrary to the opinion of the majority of critics or males 'Valentine's Day' was yes fluffy gooey and forgettable two hours but also entertaining. It did try very slightly to be different  with a gay romance amongst other things  and whilst this was all still Hollywood there were far worse movies released in 2010.To be fair to 'New Year's Eve' it is not amongst the worst of the year. This might be due to the fact that most of the audience had or have extremely low expectations upon arrival. Expecting a film to be bad makes it all the less painful if the final product is indeed poor and consequently makes it seem much better than it truly is if a viewer is not disappointed.'New Year's Eve' felt mechanical and forced a project merely designed for profit  there is no love nor compassion no credibility nor realism. This is rather a 118 minute tourist video about how wonderful The Big Apple is and how beautiful the people who reside in it are. Throw in disgusting amounts of product placement and an old rock star and hey you've got a 100 million motion picture! Spend your 8 at the cinema this Christmas on a film that gives like 'Hugo' rather than this and save the holiday romances for 'Love Actually' on DVD with the family or partner.Verdict  It is better if Marshall does not attempt to make another movie about a commercial holiday again. If we see a trailer with Kutcher dressed as the Easter Bunny for love next year run for your life.For more The Upcoming reviews httpwww.theupcoming.co.ukcategoryculturecinema".

The film is incredibly low on laughs of any variety and despite  or perhaps because of  its huge star cast it never feels like its going anywhere much like the Times Square ball which gets as much screen time as anybody. The characterisation is incredibly lazy Ashton Kutcher plays a pyjamawearing stoner cartoonist Zac Efron is the plucky young gogetter De Niro who will sign up for anything these days is the grumpy old coot. These typecasts are bad enough before Lea Michele appears essentially playing Rachel Berry from Glee replete with the screeching vocal performances. The cherry on top of the cake however is Michelle Pfeiffer who reenacts her performance in Batman Returns as kooky wallflower Selina Kyle to my immense disappointment she never became Catwoman and proceeded to whip up any sense of excitement. The one positive thing I could say about this film is that it isn't offensively bad except I cant because three of the precious few nonwhite nonAmerican characters are horrendously bad racial stereotypes. I'll leave you to spot them should you have the misfortune of having to endure this vapid exercise in futility.".

During a viewing of this excruciatingly painful melodramedy one will find absolutely no artistic value underlying message or actual creative backbone. This film is just an excuse to slap a couple of famous face in front of the same camera within the same period of time. You know what that's called on the set of a good movie? Bad casting.I can't believe someone made the same mistakes that were made just a year or two ago! When I first saw the poster I thought Is this a parody?. But then I saw who was directing this prick of a film.Garry Marshall Probably the single most desperate man in America. I am convinced that his last and final wish let's be honest he's not exactly in his twenties is to meet as many famous people as he can and what does that leave the helpless moviegoers with? The atrocities that were and still are Valentine's Day and New Years Eve.Looking for a fun holiday film to put a spring in your step and a sparkle in your smile? Then spend your ten bucks elsewhere because this movie is not worth the dough.The whole thing is a jumbled mess of popular actresses of today and a few familiar faces that we all know. Then of course your Ashton Kutcher and your Jessica Biel who insist upon us that Yes look we're still famous! We promise!Well I don't need it. I don't need it and I encourage everyone to stray far away from this badly written farfetched soap cushion of a love story that sincerely wants to be literally everything that it's not. It's a drama for people who don't like dramas a comedy for people who don't like comedies and a romance for people who don't like romance. Not worth a second of your time.".

I am convinced that his last and final wish let's be honest he's not exactly in his twenties is to meet as many famous people as he can and what does that leave the helpless moviegoers with? The atrocities that were and still are Valentine's Day and New Years Eve.Looking for a fun holiday film to put a spring in your step and a sparkle in your smile? Then spend your ten bucks elsewhere because this movie is not worth the dough.The whole thing is a jumbled mess of popular actresses of today and a few familiar faces that we all know. Then of course your Ashton Kutcher and your Jessica Biel who insist upon us that Yes look we're still famous! We promise!Well I don't need it. I don't need it and I encourage everyone to stray far away from this badly written farfetched soap cushion of a love story that sincerely wants to be literally everything that it's not. It's a drama for people who don't like dramas a comedy for people who don't like comedies and a romance for people who don't like romance. Not worth a second of your time.";

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review New Year's Eve";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm speculating that one of the reasons why New Year's Eve got pushed up so early in the month is because come that time of the season everyone will be out there merry making rather than to head to the cinemas and probably revel in whatever festivities the welcoming of the new year will bring instead of watching something that failed to capture the mood and spirit of leaving behind the old and being hopeful for what the new year would hold. Yes for all its celebratory mood seen in the trailer the actual product is nothing more than a really boring affair culminating in the New York Times Square ball drop at the stroke of midnight.Garry Marshall continues from his festival theme film Valentine's Day with yet another ensemble that rounds up some of the hottest folks in Hollywood playing caricatures in 8 short stories that you know will link up one way or another either through characters or through events. There's Ingrid Michelle Pfeiffer the mousy secretary of a music executive John Lithgow who quit her job to fulfill her New Year's resolution with the help of a courier boy Zac Efron. Then we have Robert De Niro as a patient on his death bed persuading his doctor Cary Elwes and his nurse Halle Berry to let him see the countdown from the rooftop of the hospital. Jessica Biel and Seth Meyers play a couple who are expecting their child and are in competition with another couple played by Sarah Paulson and Til Schweiger to produce the first New Year's baby to walk away with 25 thousand engaging the help of Carla Gugino's spiritual doctor.Leaving the hospital and into the hottest party in town there's food caterer Laura Katherine Heigl who has to contend with rock star Jensen Jon Bon Jovi who is trying his utmost to win her back after walking out on her a year ago with tired comedy contributed by her chefs played by Sofia Vergara and Russell Peters. Jensen's backup singer Elise Lea Michele finds herself stuck in a lift with the indifferent Randy Ashton Kutcher while en route to the performance. Sarah Jessica Parker and Abigail Breslin play a protective mother and daughter pair where the latter is trying to seek permission to spend the night out with her friends. Hillary Swank plays the executive of the ball drop event which has hit a snag with Ludicrous as her police confidante and rounding it all up is Josh Duhamel as a music mogul apprehensive whether he'll meet the woman of his dreams once more.And throw in a couple more big names from Ryan Seacrest to cameos like Matthew Broderick and even Michael Bloomberg himself against the backdrop of Times Square and the stage's all set for one heck of a party not. Most of the stories here written by Katherine Fugate seemed more like an exercise to pack as many characters as possible without digging deeper in to the emotions on why such a day on the calendar is such a big deal. While Valentine's Day may have it easier since any romantic tale will fit the bill how do you do one for New Year's and to do so successfully and convincingly? If not for the bevy of stars this film would have fallen flat on its face because there's nothing absolutely compelling in the stories that you'd root for anyone to succeed in fulfilling their objectives before the new year kicks in.It's dull and uninspiring with no real emotion on display despite the wealth of talent at its disposal. The one I really wanted to laugh out loud at is that of the Josh Duhamel arc involving a guy pining for a woman whom he had described a magical meeting that got etched permanently in his mind. This served as the hook to engage until the end but what an anticlimatic let down when the identity got revealed because throughout the film every other female character was of a lot more positive in attitude that the final chosen one and worse seemed to be forced into it because her character arc was simply the most atrocious of the lot. I never understood her appeal and when she appeared in the end to close the loop I'd swear I'd rather shoot myself if that was something that can happen in real life.New Year's Eve was a tad too long in dragging out its scenes so that each arc has about an equal amount of time without one upstaging another but all in all this film has one purpose and one purpose only  to serve as product placement in almost every shot you'd see a brand name sticking out. You'd get a lot more cheer in actually getting outside and making merry with strangers than to be stuck in a cinema hall watching this depressingly bad film. Pick something else instead if you crave for ensemble films.".

Sure it was as predictable as the UK Christmas No. 1 but it was cute and cheesy and sweet and your typical fluffy Valentine's Day movie. But first of all. What is a New Year's Eve movie? Seriously who came up with the idea of a movie about New Year's Eve? New Year's Eve is pretty much a night where teenagers and young adults go to parties and make out families go to awkward parties at Aunt Pamela's there's a big countdown but it's not that big a deal. New Year's Eve is a celebration of the upcoming year and apart from a speech by Hilary Swank's character they don't even touch on that. So the story is about ten or fifteen people who are somehow linked together. We don't know how or why and by half way I just wanted it to end. They all play the most ridiculous underdeveloped bland characters who lead into a story but then stop to make room for another halfhearted character. The actors most of them past their sellby date like Kutcher Biel Heigl just prove why they're in this attentionseeking made purely for money movie instead of something with depth. To be honest I'm disappointed in Abigail Breslin and Jake T. Austin who actually show promise. They're also incredibly annoying especially Sarah Jessica Parker's character. I don't even know her name do they even mention it? And Heigl's character manages another scene stuffing her face you just want to punch Bon Jovi for being so annoying and Sofia Vegara who is hilarious in Modern Family seems to be the only humour there and even those jokes are straight out of her Modern Family character Gloria. It's an hour and a half of awkward kisses guys getting off with fifty year old women stories being abandoned half way and celebrities who have now hit rock bottom. This probably was the worst movie I have ever watched.".

This movie is entertaining enough I suppose but it's also lacking any real great laugh out loud moments the only time I laughed was when Jessica Biel was in labour she could do some great comedy if given the chance.Lea Michele manages to bring her great screen charisma to the big screen she is very fun to watch and her rendition of Aude Lang Syne was lovely and a nice way to end the movie.If this movie had about four or five less stories happening this movie would have been much better it's not horrible by any standards but it's not excellent either also this may sound mean but Sofia Vergara is possibly the most annoying actress alive at least they didn't put a decent actress in the most annoying role in the film.

	schema:reviewBody "There were so many stars in this film that it felt like a Hollywood casting office. This film was a jumble of story lines that somehow crashes together in the end. I really like all the actors in the film but the film itself lacked substance. I think that director Garry Marshall took it a little too far when he got Matthew Broderick to make a cameo appearance as Mr. Buellerton. Really Garry? This film reminds me of the other slapped together film that Garry directed Valentine's Day. What happened to the brilliance that Garry displayed in films like Pretty Women and Beaches? There were a lot of Oscarwinning actors in this film such as Hillary Swank Claire Morgan Robert De Niro Stan Harris Halle Berry Nurse Aimee and Michelle Pfeiffer Ingrid. I know that these people did not need a paycheck so why would they want to add this film to their resume? Ashton Kutcher Randy is a man who hates New Year's Eve as we can tell from the trailer. I think he hates New Year's Eve because he read the script. And another thing. Why was Ashton wondering around New York City in his pajamas? I've been to New York City in the winter and this is not even close to being believable. I do have to make a comment about Sarah Jessica Parker's character Kim. I can understand her having a teenage daughter but what I cannot understand is the inappropriate love interest she ends up with. He is much too young for her but who am I to talk  smile. I love SJP from way back from her Sex In The City days but come on!!! The only character that was slightly believable was Hailey Abigail Breslin who acted pretty much like a typical teenager. The rest of the story lines were just pure nonsense. Emma's daughterinlaw brought her baby to the film and he slept through the whole thing. I felt like I could have done the same thing. I hate to say it not really but the best parts of this film were the outtakes at the end of the movie. If you feel like you need to see this film I recommend that you wait until it comes out on DVD and rent it. I am not celebrating and I refuse to do a countdown for this film and am giving it a red light.".

	onyx:emotionText "There were so many stars in this film that it felt like a Hollywood casting office. This film was a jumble of story lines that somehow crashes together in the end. I really like all the actors in the film but the film itself lacked substance. I think that director Garry Marshall took it a little too far when he got Matthew Broderick to make a cameo appearance as Mr. Buellerton. Really Garry? This film reminds me of the other slapped together film that Garry directed Valentine's Day. What happened to the brilliance that Garry displayed in films like Pretty Women and Beaches? There were a lot of Oscarwinning actors in this film such as Hillary Swank Claire Morgan Robert De Niro Stan Harris Halle Berry Nurse Aimee and Michelle Pfeiffer Ingrid. I know that these people did not need a paycheck so why would they want to add this film to their resume? Ashton Kutcher Randy is a man who hates New Year's Eve as we can tell from the trailer.

That's the way I felt during the entire twohour running time of Garry Marshall's New Year Eve his superior sequel to 2010's Valentine's Day though that isn't saying very much.I don't know maybe this longwinded and convoluted tale of the loves and lives of 20plus individuals on the last day of 2011 was hilarious at its core but being the Philistine that I am maybe I just did not get the humor.As it was New Year's Eve as a starpacked film is nowhere near as funny as say Grand Canyon Bobby or Magnolia but was certainly a better comedy than The Hangover 2 but then again most memorial services rate in that department.Film stars  in no particular order of talent or popularity  Michelle Pfeiffer Zac Efron Halle Berry Alyssa Milano Cary Elwes Ashton Kutcher Seth Meyers Jessica Beal Chris Ludicris Bridges Common Hilary Swank Jon Bon Jovi Katherine Heigl Til Schweiger James Belushi Ryan Seacrest Hector Elizondo Josh Duhamel John Lithgow Abigail Breslin Yeardly Smith Larry Miller Leah Michele Sarah Paulson Sofia Vergara Penny Marshall Matthew Broderick and unfortunately Robert De Niro.Oh and before you think that's the end of the pain the film also features Sarah Jessica Parker fresh off of three straight failures Sex and the City parts 1 and 2 as well as How Does She Do It? The socalled plot is wrapped around the lowering of the ball in New York's Times Square and has Claire Swank in charge of the proceedings with NYPD officer Brendon Bridges as her personal bodyguard.Other confusing story lines include super chef Laura Heigl hooking up with rock star Jensen Bon Jovi  while Vergara does an embarrassing Latina stereotype record executive Sam Duhamel trapped with a backwoods family in an RV Kim Parker fighting with teen daughter Hailey Breslin Stan Harris De Niro dying in a hospital and being cared for by Aimee Berry New Year's Evehating Randy Kutcher stuck in an elevator with Jensen's backup singer Elise Michele while couples Griffin and Tess Byrne Meyers and Biel and James and Grace Schwab Schweiger and Paulson battle to see who will have the first New Year's baby in New York.And hovering above all of this is bicycle messenger Paul Efron trying to fulfill all the ridiculous wishes of wallflower Ingrid Pfeiffer think The Bucket List without the laughs most of which seem impossible to achieve including a trip to Bali saving a life and performing at Radio City Music Hall. Not bad for a bicycle messenger that's Hollywood for you.Alas whereas unlike Bobby there is no Sirhan Sirhan to show up and herald the end of the misery. Here we get resolutions made broken and then realized loose ends neatly tied and lost love regained. It's a valiant effort by Marshall who helmed Happy Days and went on to direct such feature films as Pretty Woman Princess Diaries and Runaway Bride among others but with little or no character development the confusion is so thick here and plot lines are crossing backandforth so much it seems more like a train wreck.A sad but more than adequate description of this motion picture.".

It wasn't cut away with a 'meanwhile' feel to it suddenly we would just see someone again I noticed how badly it was done when it cut from Phieffer and Efron goes to someone else then falls back to Phieffer and Efron then off again.Catch a twopart Love Boat episode and see how well it goes from story to story.And are these all the jobs for women? Swank is oveseeing the New Year's celebration definitely straining to channel Maureen O'Hara from Miracle on 34th St this woman Hiegl was it the caterer and then Sarah JP as some flashlighted dress designer. Looked more like a seamstress to me. They all seemed to be channeling the same 'Im a professional woman' image.I think the funniest bit was that all of America no the WORLD is going to be watching NYC on New Year's Eve.Uh hello? Never heard of time zones? It was probably what? Nine or ten in the morning where Halle Berry's man was stationed. Who watches celebrations in NY? NY is probably the fourthtothelast time zone to celebrate the new year towards the end. So why would the WORLD be watching what is going on in NY? And Swank's speech sucked.Sometimes it felt like I was watching a Happy Days or Laverne  Shirley marathon with pregnant women and trapped in elevators.One bit I did notice Seth Meyers' wife pushed on the belly a bit too much clearly displaying it wasn't a baby.And is this New York? A race to see who has the first baby of the year? As I said check out a couple of eps of Love Boat or better yet still look for a TV movie called Last American Traffic Jame retitled on IMDb as Gridlock for an idea of how overlapping intertwining stories can be sorted out and placed with characters interacting. It can be done.Unfortunately New Years Eve wasn't it.".

Swank is oveseeing the New Year's celebration definitely straining to channel Maureen O'Hara from Miracle on 34th St this woman Hiegl was it the caterer and then Sarah JP as some flashlighted dress designer. Looked more like a seamstress to me. They all seemed to be channeling the same 'Im a professional woman' image.I think the funniest bit was that all of America no the WORLD is going to be watching NYC on New Year's Eve.Uh hello? Never heard of time zones? It was probably what? Nine or ten in the morning where Halle Berry's man was stationed. Who watches celebrations in NY? NY is probably the fourthtothelast time zone to celebrate the new year towards the end. So why would the WORLD be watching what is going on in NY? And Swank's speech sucked.Sometimes it felt like I was watching a Happy Days or Laverne  Shirley marathon with pregnant women and trapped in elevators.One bit I did notice Seth Meyers' wife pushed on the belly a bit too much clearly displaying it wasn't a baby.And is this New York? A race to see who has the first baby of the year? As I said check out a couple of eps of Love Boat or better yet still look for a TV movie called Last American Traffic Jame retitled on IMDb as Gridlock for an idea of how overlapping intertwining stories can be sorted out and placed with characters interacting. It can be done.Unfortunately New Years Eve wasn't it.";

The king decides to exile Medea as she is a danger for his daughter happiness but Medea asks from him just a day before she goes outside the borders. That day Medea gets her revenge.. That day we see how Jason is demystified driven by his lust for a young princess becomes a tragic character. Jason is a man driven by women's strength and willing he reached the levels of heroism because of a woman he seeks to get more strength with the help of another woman who guides him with her sexual power. We see the tragic abandoned woman taking revenge sacrificing her own children in the name of proving that she still has the power to drive his husband emotions. Is it that also true in our societies? How many times children are the mean for adults' revenge?Medea's story shown through an epic atmosphere. It is a film perfectly directed. Trier used so nicely light and nature in order to transfer to us the whole atmosphere of tragedy. A tragedy that is created by humans and not Gods. A story that can be met in our civilized neighbourhood a story that has for sure heard in the news. As about the actors a fabulous cast makes this film a work of art.

Trier has flitted between the two notions his Dogme entirely devoted to the latter mixing and matching in a variety of projects down to his recent Melancholia. But there are really few makers who can consistently furnish the sunsets and link between them that reveal something of planets in their orbits. Tarkovsky is king of that close vision from faraway. Watching this makes me lament Trier because he could have been our current Tarkovsky much more than either Tarr or Kusturica who both flirted with carrying the mantle of that cosmogonic art.This one lacks that orbital vision in different narrative planes we only have one thread and is mostly rapturously devoted to tone poetry of elemental intimacy. It was very early in Trier's career anyway but it's still a better and more visual third film than most directors ever managed. It's beautiful but not in the clean sense of a David Lean epic. I prefer it this way.That is partly because he's working from a barebones story that is ancient myth as interpreted by Euripides and written into a script by Carl Dreyer Medea has fled to Corinth promised marriage by the Argonaut Jason who reneges on that promise when offered the hand of the daughter of the local king.

	schema:reviewBody "As every arthouse director knows for mood and atmosphere you only need cut out the dialogue  that's easy. Every line of dialogue makes the action more human more trivial  which may be the main reason why Shakespeare's plays have little emotional value no matter how rich the poetry and how high the body count. I mention Shakespeare because the visual presentation here kept reminding me of Hamlet and no doubt Trier could do a good one because he adds plenty of artistry to the most paredback ideas. It's not rich but sparse and fragmentary like a tattered cloth buffeted by the wind like patches of memory. The characters merge with the natural elements on several occasions the sea the windblown grass.Medea is very much trapped in an imposed psychology as are we all. The gods are pulling all the strings or so it seems. She is not callous not mechanical in killing her children but tortured as she does fate's bidding. The children are part of the same system and must play their role in honouring their mother's agony. The tragedy is in the passive resignation. Trier communicates this far better than Pasolini who communicated next to nothing in his version. We're watching someone plumb the very abyss of misery on account of simple vanity.

	onyx:emotionText "As every arthouse director knows for mood and atmosphere you only need cut out the dialogue  that's easy. Every line of dialogue makes the action more human more trivial  which may be the main reason why Shakespeare's plays have little emotional value no matter how rich the poetry and how high the body count. I mention Shakespeare because the visual presentation here kept reminding me of Hamlet and no doubt Trier could do a good one because he adds plenty of artistry to the most paredback ideas. It's not rich but sparse and fragmentary like a tattered cloth buffeted by the wind like patches of memory. The characters merge with the natural elements on several occasions the sea the windblown grass.Medea is very much trapped in an imposed psychology as are we all. The gods are pulling all the strings or so it seems. She is not callous not mechanical in killing her children but tortured as she does fate's bidding. The children are part of the same system and must play their role in honouring their mother's agony. The tragedy is in the passive resignation. Trier communicates this far better than Pasolini who communicated next to nothing in his version. We're watching someone plumb the very abyss of misery on account of simple vanity. That has always been worth some reflection.";

	schema:reviewBody "It's very clear that Lars von Trier has a penchant for digging his nails into the festering wounds of the human psyche which is almost invariably grist for the psychopathological mill. An asset of this film is that in disarming the legend of Medea of its fantasticmythical qualities and thus reducing it to a story about a rejected woman who seeks revenge for the slight committed against her it resonate a lot more with everyday experience allowing it to shape itself according to our notion of reality. This can be terrifying especially with the subject matter at hand. Some authors have argues that there is an infanticidal urge in all mothers whether conscious or not usually the latter. Those who act on it are usually portrayed as demonic andor insane. This is a massive denial of the murderous tendencies present in all living creatures a denial which seems necessary since it allows people to have some semblance of control over their minds and actions. But given the right circumstances the illusion is shattered and a new balance needs to be reached. In the case of Medea her narcissistic wound is too great to bear yet the perpetrator cannot be attacked directly for whatever reason. Her sexuality is rejected thus she proceeds to destroy any evidence of his. She murders his bridetobe as well as some of her family members. The epitome of her acts is the killing of her 2 children which happens in a very matteroffact manner. The intruder complex can be felt in the mind of the eldest son who gladly assists in killing the younger brother pulling him down as he hangs helplessly from the tree. He thus fulfills his own unconscious wish of destroying his uterine rival. Her psychogenic sterility is accomplished and she can depart. Again the more realistic tones to the film are a huge asset.. she sits on a ship waiting for the tide to carry them away... had the golden chariot of Helios pulled by winged dragons flown her away holding her dead sons with her perhaps the impact wouldn't have stuck... score one for the director.".

	schema:headline " Believe it or not Medea is a heroin!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an adaptation of Euripides' play. It starts with Jason and his new wife but on a very political tone Creon is yielding power to Jason and to make it more powerful and official in this Greece moving towards hereditary kingship he gives him his daughter Glauce. But Creon requires  and orders  the banishment of Medea and her two sons. We all know what comes after that. Medea begging Creon for one day's suspension of his decision. Then the hypocritical change of mind with Jason that she seduces again but he reacts violently after yielding to the desire and yet accepts to convince Glauce to ask her father to keep the two children. He goes with them to give her a present Medea's bridal crown. Glauce will die poisoned and Creon too. Then Medea will have to kill the two sons and go away. Told like that this fable is as simple as a cold draft in a heating deprived house in winter when it is snowing outside.Lars von Trier in 1988 only had the very low definition of the television of these days in Denmark to make his film but he already had his brilliant both lethal and murderous imagination rooted in the war and the German defeat which is also the allies' victory. But Lars von Trier could never decide which was good and which was bad and he only saw the bad side of things.In this film he modifies some elements to adapt them to this low definition television. The killing of the children is not spectacular with blood. He wants to have them there dead hanging in front of our shocked eyes in a long lasting full screen frame. So he has them hanged to the two branches of a totally dead tree. You can imagine the silhouette of these cadavers these hanging bodies against the sky. That's more spectacular than some blood on a nightshirt. But that's too static dead in a way. He wants life in his vision of death.So Lars von Trier has to add something a lot more odious repulsive. The younger boy runs away. The older boy gets him and brings him back and pulls on his leg to help him die faster on the rope that his mother had tied to the tree branch. On the following morning he asks his mother to help him. He ties the rope to the second tree branch he puts the noose around his neck and she only has to let him go and pull slightly. The final embrace of the mother letting the child die hanged by that mutual desire shared in this final act is more than frightening. It is blood curdling and yet who is at fault who is wrong somewhere? And during that time Jason is getting crazy.Medea goes to a ship waits for the tide. The sail is rolled down and she unties her hair and she goes away. No god no divine intervention no Deus ex Machina just a plain ship going away from Greece probably to some distant country. Maybe Colchis after all. But where is Euripides in all that? In the final caption on the screen A human life is a journey into the darkness where only a God can find the way for what no man dares believe God can bring about. Finally a reference to God but this final caption means nothing and yet so much. That's in fact the vision of Lars von Trier about humanity. He cannot bring man out of this darkness of the cataclysmic war and the ruined Europe and the viciously hypocritical people from both sides who have to save what they can in order to get some kind of revenge not to speak of vengeance. Lars von Trier has a totally morbid and deathbound understanding of life though understanding is not the proper word. It should be ignorance and yet he knows too much so what? Errant banishment from any overlording understating understanding! That might be it. He sure wants us to somewhere believe we understand Medea in her suffering but in fact he probably just wants us to wonder where can she find any haven refuge sanctuary with a condescending and understanding God. And if it were a Goddess? Hecate for example? But that's beyond Lars von Trier. A Godless world is his final affiliation and conviction  and the sentence will be unsuspended.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU".

Told like that this fable is as simple as a cold draft in a heating deprived house in winter when it is snowing outside.Lars von Trier in 1988 only had the very low definition of the television of these days in Denmark to make his film but he already had his brilliant both lethal and murderous imagination rooted in the war and the German defeat which is also the allies' victory. But Lars von Trier could never decide which was good and which was bad and he only saw the bad side of things.In this film he modifies some elements to adapt them to this low definition television. The killing of the children is not spectacular with blood. He wants to have them there dead hanging in front of our shocked eyes in a long lasting full screen frame. So he has them hanged to the two branches of a totally dead tree. You can imagine the silhouette of these cadavers these hanging bodies against the sky. That's more spectacular than some blood on a nightshirt. But that's too static dead in a way. He wants life in his vision of death.So Lars von Trier has to add something a lot more odious repulsive. The younger boy runs away. The older boy gets him and brings him back and pulls on his leg to help him die faster on the rope that his mother had tied to the tree branch. On the following morning he asks his mother to help him. He ties the rope to the second tree branch he puts the noose around his neck and she only has to let him go and pull slightly. The final embrace of the mother letting the child die hanged by that mutual desire shared in this final act is more than frightening. It is blood curdling and yet who is at fault who is wrong somewhere? And during that time Jason is getting crazy.Medea goes to a ship waits for the tide. The sail is rolled down and she unties her hair and she goes away. No god no divine intervention no Deus ex Machina just a plain ship going away from Greece probably to some distant country. Maybe Colchis after all. But where is Euripides in all that? In the final caption on the screen A human life is a journey into the darkness where only a God can find the way for what no man dares believe God can bring about. Finally a reference to God but this final caption means nothing and yet so much. That's in fact the vision of Lars von Trier about humanity. He cannot bring man out of this darkness of the cataclysmic war and the ruined Europe and the viciously hypocritical people from both sides who have to save what they can in order to get some kind of revenge not to speak of vengeance. Lars von Trier has a totally morbid and deathbound understanding of life though understanding is not the proper word. It should be ignorance and yet he knows too much so what? Errant banishment from any overlording understating understanding! That might be it. He sure wants us to somewhere believe we understand Medea in her suffering but in fact he probably just wants us to wonder where can she find any haven refuge sanctuary with a condescending and understanding God. And if it were a Goddess? Hecate for example? But that's beyond Lars von Trier. A Godless world is his final affiliation and conviction  and the sentence will be unsuspended.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU";

She is facing a tough situation at home where her parents are battling each other something that causes anxiety as well as fear in the young Pippi. Arturo has reasons to believe there is much more to what is causing Pippi's malady. He decides to go on a hunch to wean the girl from the medicine she has been prescribed by other physicians.The film concentrates on the hospital life and the way Pippi responds to the other young patients. Sergio Castellitto has a good opportunity as the doctor with a heart. Anna Galiena is seen as Pippi's mother Cinthya a woman who obviously does not understand what is happening to her daughter. Alessia Fugardi who was making her screen debut shows quite an intensity as she approaches the way to pay her character. She surprises because she must have been around twelve at the time the production was made. Ms. Fugardi held her own against veteran actors.".

	schema:headline " a complex western that's unusual and great";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is unusual even by spaghetti western standards. It's not strange in an obvious overthetop sort of way like El Topo. Tepepa is more subtle in the way that it plays with your head.One of the more common traits of Italian westerns in general is the lack of the oldfashioned good guy type of character and Tepepa is certainly no exception to the rule but this movie takes it a step further than most. In most Eurowesterns even though there is no good guy per se there still exists a hero that is someone the viewer will root for. This hero can range from the likable kindhearted outlaw like Blondie from The Good the Bad and the Ugly to the leader of a ruthless murdering gang of thieves like Black Jack from the movie Black Jack. Usually this hero or antihero ends up getting his revenge on the other scoundrel or scoundrels who have done him wrong and the viewer of the film ends up very satisfied at the end. This movie turns that whole spaghetti western scenario insideout in the same way that the traditional spaghetti western turns the traditional Hollywood western on its head.In the beginning Tomas Milian as Tepepa becomes the hero we instinctively root for. He is a killer but it's in the name of revolution. He is trying to free his people from the tyranny of the greedy landowners and we see the English doctor that wants to kill him as being just a misguided man who will eventually do what's right and join forces with Tepepa and the revolution. But soon we begin to discover the reason why the Englishman wants to kill Tepepa and after that the movie begins to slowly destroy all of our preconceptions about and attachments to the characters in the story. The film ends up being very unsettling because we are left with no protagonist and just feel kind of weird about everyone and everything in the film. To top it all off the innocent tenyearold boy when one appears in a spaghetti western he almost always ends up being killed in this movie is the most coldhearted person in the film and he is the only main character that survives! Tepepa is a very wellmade film. The acting is excellent. Tomas Milian is great as usual. This is a very serious western as opposed to some of his others which have funny moments but he plays this type of character very well whether being humorous or not. I strongly disagree with some of the other reviewers who are critical of Orson Welles' performance in this movie. He is incredible in this film as Colonel Cascorro the drunken swaggering yet softspoken strongarm of the oppressive Mexican government who is out to destroy Tepepa and the revolution. Yes he mumbles at times but that adds so much to the personality of the character and makes him more believable. There are only a few words here and there that are hard to understand and it doesn't interfere with ones ability to understand what's going on in the film. He plays the part with brilliant subtlety. He's like the antithesis of the usual overthetop spaghetti western thug. Then there is Luciano Casamonica as Paquito the aforementioned tenyearold approximately boy. We start to get the hint that he's no ordinary spaghetti western child when he fails to shed a tear when his father is killed then rides home with Tepepa who has just killed him. Later on we learn that Paquito is capable of killing without much of a reason and showing absolutely no remorse yet he still has this aura of innocence about him. Casamonica pulls this off quite convincingly for an actor of his age. The music score is great as is to be expected since it is by the master Ennio Morricone. The cinematography is also topnotch. This was definitely meant to be a quality production.Other reviewers have commented that the US video version is drastically cut which may account for the poor scores this movie has gotten. I don't know because I haven't seen that version. This review is based on a widescreen version that seems to be complete.For those that love spaghetti westerns this is a mustsee film that is well worth seeking out.".

Later on  starring duo  MilianSteiner  undergo a strange relation of friendship and hatred . But someone prepares a relentless vendetta on a surprising final .It's a magnificent western film with dazzling shootouts between the protagonists and the contenders . This film belongs to the numerous group that are set during the Mexican revolution  called Zapata Western subgenre  like are the Italian ones   Duck you sucker Compaeros  The mercenary  and the Americans  The wild bunch and The professionals. Tepepa results to be the swansong of this subgenre . The picture blends violence  western action  plot twists and shoot'em up with high bodycount . Tepepa is fast movement and that's why it is entertaining  besides  there is thoughtful dialog with an intelligent writing by Franco Solinas  an author of communist ideology who wrote political screenplays such classics as The battle of Argel and I'm the Revolution  the latter bears remarkable resemblance on some issues to Tepepa . The Cuban Tomas Milian  as usual  puts faces  grimaces  crying and overacting  but he plays splendidly in a similar character to Cuchillo from the trilogy directed by Sergio Sollima . Tomas created his own image and propelled himself to stardom in likewise fashion with such important Spaghetti movies as The Bounty Killer 1966  The Big Gundown 1967 with Lee Van Cleef  Face to Face 1967  Django Kill! 1967 and Run Man Run 1968. Enjoyable score by the great maestro composer Ennio Morricone who composed lots of Spaghetti Western scores  it contains a sensitive musical leitmotif . There are many fine technicians and nice assistants as the splendid cameraman Francisco Marin who makes an atmospheric photography  including barren outdoors  dirty landscapes under a glimmer sun  being shot  of course  on location in Almeria  Spain . However  being necessary and perfect remastering because of the original copy is wornout . The motion picture was well directed by Giulio Petroni who filmed another classic Italian western as Death rides a horse  though also shot other inferior but acceptable Spaghettis as Night of serpent and A sky full of stars for a roof. Rating  Above average S.W.  worthwhile seeing .".

	schema:reviewBody "The American version of Death Rides A Horse director Guilio Petroni's Tepepa qualifies as utterly egregious. Something is missing because everything seems truncated and the European cut runs about twenty minutes longer. Mind you this realistic but adventurous Italian Spaghetti western about the Mexican revolution resembles later westerns such as Sergio Corbucci's The Mercenary Sergio Corbucci's Companeros Damiano Damiani's A Bullet for the General and Sergio Leone's Duck You Sucker. Unfortunately watching the VHS copy is like looking through a keyhole at life because this was filmed in Techniscope at 2.35.1 so each shot looks spectacular. During the letterboxed opening credits sequence the visual compositions of The Texican lenser Francisco Marn are breathtaking endowing this mangled Spaghetti with great look. Nevertheless despite its being mutilated Tepepa looks like it might be a good movie. The peasant army ambush of the Mexican Army is nothing short of brilliant. Orson Welles makes a genuinely menacing villain who is proved better off dead than alive. Not surprisingly Tomas Milian of The Big Gundown makes a charismatic as well as introspective revolutionary leader. We watch the bandit change during the trajectory of the action. The English doctor is the ultimate villain because he never wavers from his vow to kill the Milian revolutionary figure. The theme that recurs through the Franco Silanos screenplay is revenge. Interestingly Silanos wrote both The Mercenary and A Bullet for the General so this is familiar turf for him. Everybody seems like they are after revenge from the outsider British doctor who renounces his oath as a doctor to kill an enemy to the messiah but flawed bandit Tepepa who resumes the revolution when he sees how the Army controls the president. Petroni and Solinas dwell on the injustices wrought by the revolution in the ongoing clash of the haves and the havenots. The ending and the unsavory quality of the British doctor and the Mexican revolutionary may alienate some audiences. This is not a cheerful but rather a serious Spaghetti western about the disillusion that came with the end of the revolution and the realization that hundreds of good men had died to put a good man into the presidency who was later manipulated by the evil men.Although it ostensibly resembles a western this Spaghetti belongs to the Mexican Revolution subgenre of political Italian westerns. The third act when Tepepa and his revolutionaries ambush the Mexican Army is is model of economy and violence. Petroni develops tension and suspense in this scene and stages the ambush with flair right down to explosives soaring into our faces. Moreover however are the levels of sophisication that flow within the contours of this terrific scene. As the Army approaches the pass everybody grows tense and suspicious. Suddenly everything seem tranquil now because the army column has relaxed itself. The Mexican Colonel thinks about this aloud as relief sweeps over the column when several women driving goats approach from the north. The seasoned officer sees danger where his men now see no danger and he orders them to shoot the women tending the flock. The soldiers shoot them women down but the goats have had time to infiltrate the column and they are wearing sticks of dynamite. BOOM!Ennio Morricone is a musical sensation. Since he worked with Sergio Leone on Fistful of Dollars he created the signature musical sound of the Spaghetti western. The soundtracks that he produced often enhanced an inferior western. The distinctive sound of Morricone is something that nobody could or should imitate. Don't get me wrong other outstanding composers like Gianni Ferroi Luis Enrquez Bacalov Riz Ortolani Angelo Francesco Lavagnino Nico Fidenco Francesco De Masi and Benedetto Ghiglia thrived during the Spaghetti western years. The Ennio Morricone orchestral soundtrack is above the maestro's towering standards. The piano rift and the marching music is memorable.".

	schema:headline " An astounding lead performance by a handicapped actor takes your breath away";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is remarkable for doing what I would have considered completely impossible namely featuring a young boy who is severely handicapped as the lead actor and succeeding brilliantly. The boy is Andrea Rossi and his performance is one of the great cinema performances of the decade. I don't know how this was possible. Even allowing for the obvious fact that the director Gianni Amelio is a man of unique sensitivity and even of genius I do not know how such a handicapped boy could be such a superstar. It is totally astounding. Those of us who have known handicapped people realize how charming they can be in private. But the idea that a boy so seriously handicapped could totally dominate an entire feature film and be so upfront and project his personality so powerfully is absolutely incredible. This is some kind of magic hitherto unknown! Andrea Rossi is not only honest and direct he is a communicator at a major level. He proves what fantastic talents lie buried deep within people suffering from certain handicaps and which never emerge because no opportunity ever presents itself. Really there are no words to express the astonishment and delight with which any honest person would greet the experience of this screen performance by a boy who can barely walk can barely write and is handicapped in so many ways I have no idea of what his illness really is that he could easily be dismissed by the thoughtless as being unable to participate in normal human society or indeed to have any worth or importance as an individual human being. Andrea Rossi has struck a blow for all handicapped people everywhere by proving beyond any doubt that appearances can be deceptive and that someone who looks hopelessly handicapped and barely able to communicate can in actuality be highly alert intelligent witty sensitive creative innovative selfdeprecating amusing and loving. What an amazing fellow Andrea Rossi is! And he was only twelve years old when he made this film! As for the others in the film there are spectacular performances also by Kim Rossi Stuart as the boy's father and Charlotte Rampling as the mother of a more severely handicapped girl. The film is so emotional so powerful that you will rarely see anything more moving in your lifetime. The direction is perfect. Everything is perfectly judged and perfectly executed. The interviews with Rampling and Rossi Stuart on the DVD are important and should be watched. I had no idea what a profound thinker and intellectual Rampling is until I saw her talking to the camera about the meaning and significance of this film. She should write books on the philosophy of the cinema. But probably her performances are her philosophy expressed directly and aimed straight for the gut. How amazing this film is in every way!".

	schema:headline " The Keys to the House Open the Heart";
	schema:reviewBody "LE CHIAVI DI CASA THE KEYS TO THE HOUSE is a brave humble simple eloquent work of art. Director and writer with Sandro Petraglia Gianni Amelio has the courage to address a subject that is difficult for most viewers and has created one of the more tender love stories on film. Aided by an incomparably fine cast and a fine cinematographer Luca Bigazzi and composer Franco Piersanti he has found a means to touch everyone with a story that BECAUSE of its subject matter gives more insight into the human condition than almost any other film to date.Amelio begins his story quietly and progresses slowly allowing the viewer to cope with the realities of the tale in a manner of comfort. In the opening scene Gianni Kim Rossi Stuart is meeting with Alberto Pierfrancesco Favino in a frank discussion about the status of Paolo Andrea Rossi the son of Gianni whom he has never seen the child being born as his girlfriend dies in childbirth. Alberto and his wife have been caring for Paolo for fifteen years loving him admiring him working with the fact that Paolo has cerebral palsy with he concomitant handicaps of distorted limbs but with a mind and heart completely normal. Paolo's doctor has informed Alberto that perhaps having Paolo connect with his birth father may aid his progress in walking normally and increasing his selfcare. So at this meeting Alberto regrettably turns Paolo over to the hesitant Gianni an appliances worker who is now married and has a new child.Gianni and Paolo meet for the first time board a train to Berlin for the best Children's Orthopedic Hospital available. Very gradually the two begin to learn about each other Paolo wants to prove he is selfreliant Gianni wants to prove he is an adequate caregiver. In Berlin Gianni observes Paolo's intensive physical training finding the boy's strengths and qualities and need for love. While Paolo is hospitalized Gianni meets Nicole the brilliant Charlotte Rampling whose 20yearold daughter Nadine Alla Faerovich is severely physically challenged Nicole has devoted her life to being at the bedside of Nadine and shares with Gianni the truths about parenting challenged children. Their conversations are sage and realistic and enormously touching.Gianni and Paolo begin to bond to share their lives to explain the fifteen year gap in their relationship and Gianni agrees to fulfill Paolo's dream of going to Norway to meet Paolo's pen pal love Kristine. Along this 'road trip' the two ultimately face the idiosyncrasies life has offered each they grow from each other and .... well the ending is far too beautifully formed to spoil.Obviously the easy way to make this film would have been to hire actors to 'mimic' challenged characters but it is to Amelio's credit and for our good fortune that he has cast unknown physically challenged youths in the pivotal roles. Andrea Rossi as Paolo is a revelation he gives the kind of performance that is at once honest and yet delicately nuanced. Both Kip Rossi Stuart and Charlotte Rampling are extraordinary each playing their roles without a trace of bathos. This film does not stab for emotional response it simply allows connection with a story about the importance of human love and compassion and family commitment. I cannot recommend a film more highly. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "'Le chiavi di casa'Home's keys is an Italian movie about a father and his 15year old disabled child. The boy can't walk properly his arms seem permanently bent in a 90 degree angle his upper back is slightly hunched forwards. The movie is tough unsentimental and all the more moving for that.The father Gianni has never seen Paolo his child. The reason will be unveiled in the second half of the movie and it enables the viewer to identify with the father we get to know Paolo at the same pace his father does. They are on a trip to a Berlin hospital dedicated to rehabilitative therapies and treatment for the disabled. It's a journey back to a lost fatherhood for Gianni and it's shown through the physical rapport between father and son. The first time Gianni meets Paolo he doesn't so much as touch him. The boy is asleep in his train compartment. The camera doesn't show us his face. Gianni is hesitant about his role as a father and they're still strangers.In the next 'phase' Gianni tends to Paolo he helps him to walk to go to the bathroom he washes him.... Then a crucial scene comes Gianni witnesses a therapy session. Paolo walks back and forth aided by a kind of cane on small wheels. The process is painful and Paolo suffers. It is at this moment that Gianni acknowledges his son's body as one not to be aided or 'corrected' but as one capable of suffering and therefore of affection too. This realization culminates in a beautiful scene in which Gianni starts by arranging Paolo's hair and then kisses him and caresses him every other second as if the boy were a 'cagnolino' a little pet dog. But this is not a rosy postcard.At the Berlin hospital Gianni meets a French lady Charlotte Rampling who has a severely disabled daughter she's been tending to her every need for over 20 years. This lady has a tendency to be brutally honest without ever really being impolite but in one of their encounters she tries to put a brave face on things when Gianni asks her how she can look so serene after all she's been through. She doesn't tell all the truth and that's a crime that an actress as talented as Rampling cannot leave unpunished and I guess that's why Amelio wanted her for the part. The next scene is formally simple and elegantly executed and we see in Rampling's face and hear in her lines what her character has been through during all those years how her body has also suffered.The three main actors are great Kim Rossi Rampling and the kid Andrea. Kudos to Amelio the director.".

The camera scans slowly the lost faces of the actors without pity or shame. There is no plastic no trinkets no nudging at the spectator. We are there watching and not it's not really as straightforward as we'd want it.As in Stolen Children or Lamerica the main character ambles on scene uncertain of his role in the life of others or just very mistaken. It learnsmaybe the hard way one feeling at the time. Kim Rossi Stuart takes the place of Enrico Lo Verso with a similar style eyes lost and the silence prevailing over revelatory dialog but the star is his son in the movie Andrea Rossi There are no cheap shot. There is no need to. Piety compassion come from something deeper and Amelio definitely gets to the grittier level of human emotion. Charlotte Rampling has an amazing role as the mother of young handicapped woman and the symbolic chorus for the interior dialog of the protagonist. And the dialog is pure and scary as it can be.It's refreshing to see such moving work that skillfully avoids all the traps of classic Hollywood tearjerkers. The movie reminded me rather of Kenzaburo Oe's Teach Us to Outgrow our Madness but it's actually inspired to Giuseppe Pontiggia's Nati due Volte Born Twice and Amelio pays homage both to the writer and the book in the course of the movie.".

It was the son's choice. It was the father's effort.

Well that's long before Brandon Routh came up with his superman. however they are of different categories in which they reign respectively in my opinion. Let alone the height Kim's face is judging from every angle perfectly shaped and it has the magic to draw you instantly into the picture wherever your mind is wondering. That's been proved when years later I watched Antonioni's Beyond the Clouds in which a younger Kim with long hair was already capable of imprisoning my attention.I think one can easily understand the awkwardness you get when confronting with a handicapped child who always wears the same seeming smile whenever he's angry or sad not to mention he's your once abandoned son.He's immature not knowing where his hand should put to support a handicapped child or even a healthy one he's delicate bursting to tears when Paolo angrily wished to be sent to his uncle he's withdrawn never showing too many expressions on his face except Paolo did to him something quite silly...He gave this paternal character life.The film is elaborately made in every possible aspect. However without obvious climax and twists and turns this story took me floating on the calm development of the plot and yet kept me consciously touched.Surely this is not the first film about father and son or handicapped children but the difference this film makes is that instead of forcing you into the emotion with dramatic acting and moving episodes it unfolds the feelings and daily interaction of characters as subtly as possible making the story real and exquisite like a documentary.That's why no tear of mine drops during watching. However I was overwhelmed and introduced into living in the story.Usually I will write a review of exactly the same feeling as the movie conveys but this time I didn't.

	schema:reviewBody "This as an exceptionally wellacted and presented film about how parents deal with disabled children. It is not an easy subject to show without overemotionalizing something. Unlike 'Rain Man' this film showed that there is nothing fun about living with a disabled person. Any positive sign warms the heart the negatives are soul crushing coming to terms with the limitations of your child. The father of the disabled boy goes to see him with the intention of committing him to a hospital. During the days of testing that happen prior to the commitment they form a bond. I don't agree that the boy shows signs of getting better or communicating above what he had been doing at the beginning of the movie. He is significantly disabled and will remain so regardless of the love and support from his newly found father. At the end of the movie the father begins to understand  his son who he thought was connecting with him and seemed to communicate fairly normally  is irritating and still very disabled. The sadness is well done as he realizes this. The woman he meets in the hospital who has a severely disabled daughter has done nothing since her daughter was born except care for her daughter. Disability consumes caregivers. The father likens them to 'puppies giving unconditional love'. The disabled have a genuine innocence and trust that normal children grow out of by the time they are 5 years old. It's like each day is a new lifetime for them  the memory of frustration of anger  are forgotten. It's a film that those living with a disabled person will see as pretty true to reallife.".

I don't agree that the boy shows signs of getting better or communicating above what he had been doing at the beginning of the movie. He is significantly disabled and will remain so regardless of the love and support from his newly found father. At the end of the movie the father begins to understand  his son who he thought was connecting with him and seemed to communicate fairly normally  is irritating and still very disabled. The sadness is well done as he realizes this. The woman he meets in the hospital who has a severely disabled daughter has done nothing since her daughter was born except care for her daughter. Disability consumes caregivers. The father likens them to 'puppies giving unconditional love'. The disabled have a genuine innocence and trust that normal children grow out of by the time they are 5 years old. It's like each day is a new lifetime for them  the memory of frustration of anger  are forgotten. It's a film that those living with a disabled person will see as pretty true to reallife.";

We are suspicious of his motives in suddenly coming into the boy's life after 15 years although he is not the person to initiate contact. The boy's doctors have suggested that meeting his birth father may help speed effectiveness of the boy's developmental therapy so he is literally cornered into it by the uncle who against his wife's wishes arranges to have the father escort the boy to specialized therapy in Germany. It is clear that the uncle does this out of love for the boy but why does the father agree to do it? In subtle ways we see he is not without feeling for the boy  he is hesitant to touch him yet devours him with his eyes as the story progresses his contact becomes increasingly tactile  as one reviewer said stroking him almost as if he were a pet.The choice of actors is brilliant for the same reasons another reviewer found unpalatable  in real life disabled people can come from the most physically perfect human specimens  in this case the child's disability was as a result of birth trauma. The father is as emotionally damaged as the son is physically  they both seem to need each other on an almost primal level. It minimizes the intelligence of both the actor Andrea Rossiand his character Paolo the son not to recognize this. Mood swings and repetition do not negate a functioning heart or mind in Paolo he is aware of more than we think. The actor Andrea Rossi is he related to Kim Rossi Stuart? is brilliant as Paolo that he is also afflicted with muscular dystrophy makes his performance even more affecting. I reject the review that suggests this disability as the reason we should cheer his acting however MUSCULAR dystrophy does not affect the mind Steven Hawking? even if the director supposedly fed him lines offcamera his innate ability I thought he was ACTING the physical part is what actually made Paolo believable as a character.As always Charlotte Rampling is excellent as the mother of another patient in Paolo's hospital. She has taken on her daughter's disability as her life'swork. Yet even she is human and has wished to run away. The difference between the parents is that she continues to do despite the occasional lapse. Paolo's father has to grow up and come to terms with the reality of the disability as well as his newfound love for his son as a person before they can move on as father and son. That he is willing to continue to try after failing several times is his most redeeming factor in the movie.".

Raising a child with special needs requires even more of those attributes plus an infinite capacity to endure the pain of seeing your child suffer. Winner of the Best Picture Award at the 2004 Venice Film Festival Keys to the House explores the path of a young father who abandoned his disabled son fifteen years ago and now seeks to redeem their relationship without fully comprehending what is expected of him. Loosely based on Giuseppe Pontiggia's 2000 novel Born Twice Keys to the House is the latest film by Italian director Gianni Amelio L'America Stolen Children who is known for his deeply humane portraits of conflicting relationships between generations.Gianni Kim Rossi Stuart an appliance worker in his midthirties lives with his wife and young son in Milan Italy. Fifteen years ago he fathered a handicapped boy named Paolo Andrea Rossi with a teenage girlfriend who died during childbirth. At the request of the boy's uncle Pierfrancesco Favino who raised Paolo Gianni meets his son for the first time en route to a Berlin hospital where the boy is scheduled to undergo a new round of testing at a hospital for handicapped children. Paolo now a teenager has physical and mental challenges resulting from childbirth trauma and walks with the aid of a cane. The fatherson reunion is fraught with difficulties and many awkward moments. In spite of his difficulties Paolo is bright fun loving and full of charm but has mood swings and erratic mental patterns. Gianni is hesitant at first uncertain how to react to his unpredictable behavior and stumbles when trying to help him dress or assist him in going to the bathroom.Paolo though trusting views Gianni with some embarrassment and asks him to leave during some invasive hospital testing. At the hospital Gianni meets another parent Charlotte Rampling as Nicole whose daughter Nadine Alla Faerovich is severely handicapped with Cerebral Palsy. Her empathy and wisdom help him come to terms with the guilt he feels for having abandoned his son and increases his awareness of the difficulties involved in raising a handicapped child. When the hospital therapists push Paolo to the point of exhaustion with their exacting regimen Gianni instinctively removes him and takes him on a road trip to Norway in hopes of meeting a young girl Paolo knows only through an exchange of photos. On the journey back Gianni comes face to face with the true requirements of his commitment to Paolo and the result is deeply moving.Keys to the House is an involving drama about the difficulties involved in taking responsibility for past mistakes and developing the inner strength to cope with the results. The acting is uniformly outstanding especially that of Andrea Rossi a young Italian actor with Muscular Dystrophy who brings Paolo fully to life. Though some elements of the plot are puzzling Keys to the House is not about plot but about feelings and relationships. It is a courageous film that sparkles with authenticity and tenderness. It avoids easy consolations and trite solutions challenging us to confront our limitations particularly our inability to always be the person our children need us to be. While Keys to the House may not be Amelio's best film it is his most emotionally compelling and fully establishes him as being in the very front rank of contemporary directors.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a masterpiece of human emotion thought and relationships. For me the best moment of the movie was when the Father looked down on his sleeping child on the train to Berlin. At that moment his heart was lost to the boy whether he wanted it to be or not. The Dad showed much love for his boy throughout the film and made sure the boy knew it. He gave him many treats and acts of love such as hugs and kisses on his cheeks. A truly moving scene was when he wiped his Sons face and hands with the towel after the boy made a run for it in the hallway. The Father made sure his Son knew who was boss when the remote control scene took place. All police tell parents to stay put when their child is missing so updates can be given to them. Trying to find anybody in a big city one is not familiar with is not the best idea. He showed his Son great compassion when he took him to see his love interest knowing the boy might be made fun of or rebuffed in an unkind way. This shows a wonderful understanding of being a parent letting your children get hurt emotionally so they can grow emotionally in their lives. Throwing the cane into the sea was a profound act of love and understanding that this one thing to protect his Son from ridicule was all he could do for him on his journey to meet the girl of his dreams without embarrassment. My thoughts on the boy going to live with his Father it was never going to happen. It was a fantasy of the Father wanting to make everything OK between him and his Son. When the Father broke down and cried he knew when the boy acted up that this trip together was all they would have maybe for a long time. The Father understood his wife could not and probably would not be able to meet the demands of the boys needs and take care of their baby. The Father had to work so this was the way it had to be. When the boy said I am here with you and you cry the Father knew when they were together that is all that counted at that time. There was great love shown by the Father throughout the movie and it was was a perfect showing of his affection for his Son. Wonderful wonderful film.".

It sure isn't the fault of funny charming young Andrea Rossi who plays the disabled Paolo Rossi is utterly inspiring as he must certainly be in real life and full of joy. But the script is filled with annoying idiosyncrasies  they make you go naah! when you should be swept up in the story. How can the father not go looking for his missing disabled son in a foreign city and choose instead to tell his life story to a woman he's barely met? And what about him throwing the boy's walker at sea? Or leaving the boy alone at the hotel? Or stealing him away from physical therapy? Or not even asking his wife about his newborn baby back home? Was there EVER a more inept father?These inconsistencies are enhanced by Kim Rossi Stuart's frustrating uncharismatic performance he's like a top model lost in a gritty drama  handsome but shallow bordering on moronic. Anyway the point of this review is to praise Charlotte Rampling what an actress she has become over the years! Film after film she graces us with memorable performances from Sous le Sable and Swimming Pool to Lemming and the otherwise insufferable Vers le Sud and now Le Chiave.... She has reached this age when her naturally aged face is so rich and lived in that she can build a fleshandblood character with one look and one halfsmile. In her very first scene we feel at once we KNOW that lifebeaten mother. Her big scene where she reveals her tormented thoughts about her severely disabled daughter is the most heartwrenching thing in the whole movie  you can totally sympathize with her obvious but controlled grief and her living daybyday philosophy. You see a woman who's cried every single tear out of her body through the long years of devotion to her daughter her youth and hopes lost along the way. You can understand her envy of mothers whose children have had better results from therapy than her own daughter and even understand her mixed feelings about her daughter's attachment to life Perch non muore?. Her performance is so good it makes her lines sound better  even if her Italian is less than fluent  than anything else in the script.My vote 6 stars out of 10. If you happen to have a disabled relative or friend that you take care of or care about that rating certainly goes up.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Gianni Amelio coaxed a wonderful performance from Andrea Rossi in this film  his lines were fed to him by the director allowing this young nonactor to appear spontaneous. His charm and his stubbornness were powerful and endearing and it would seem that it was the boy's real character and personality that were being very gently and cleverly allowed to shine.Apart from Andrea Rossi the strength of the film lay with Charlotte Rampling  although her part was a supporting role her intelligence and dignity made a strong impact and you wished that she would be there to counsel and guide Gianni through future events that he would perhaps not handle too well. She has matured into a very fine actress indeed and one hopes that she will get the kind of roles she deserves in the future.My first thought was that Kim RossiStuart wasn't a good choice for the lead  goodlooking certainly but way too wooden an actor to carry a role as demanding as that of Gianni. On reflection however I wondered if casting an actor who appeared to have very little to give his role emotionally was deliberate because it wasn't hard to believe that this was a man who deserted his son at his birth. Even when he slowly began to warm to his son and we knew he desperately wanted to help he was still awkward as he tried to compensate for his instinctive emotional detachment.When he took his son from the hospital  clearly before his round of treatment was completed this would certainly have to be an ongoing routine for Paolo  this was not the action of a responsible loving father but an act of rebellion from an immature man who couldn't or wouldn't see that the painful procedures were the only hope for some small improvement in Paolo's condition and something that the boy himself accepted and participated in however much he hated it.Taking Paolo to Norway to visit his girlfriend Kristine was not an act of kindness but one of insensitivity  in earlier scenes although Paolo spoke of one day marrying her he also had all sorts of excuses for not being able to meet her. Clearly he was able to understand what his father could not  that she may reject him when she realised that he was not like other boys yet he trusted his father enough to take the chance. It was when Gianni threw away his walking stick that I felt he had made very little progress from the boy who couldn't face up to his responsibilities to his motherless son  he was acting less from a desire to help Paolo walk on his own than he was trying to pretend that the boy's disabilities could be cured by an act of will and that he would one day be more like a normal son. This was explored further during the driving scene  having told Nicole earlier that Paolo didn't know how to construct boundaries he encouraged him to think that he could drive and was then shattered when he realised the extent to which his son could at times fail to recognise the limitations that would always confront him. Was Paolo himself unconsciously trying to teach his father a lesson by behaving in the same irresponsible way that Gianni had been?The ending of the film therefore presented us with two possibilities  Gianni's newlyawakened love might lead him to a new sense of maturity and responsibility if he could accept that love was not going to be a miracle cure or he just might once again abandon his child to others. For Paolo's sake and his father's too I'd like to think that Gianni would have developed a new perspective on his physical and emotional journey with his difficult and beautiful son.".

Gianni the man at the center of this story has done that when he saw his lover die during the delivery of the child but the baby survived. The baby is born with cerebral palsy that leaves him physically handicapped. After fifteen years Gianni suddenly comes around to take his son Paolo to a German hospital so he can undergo some rehabilitation.Thus begins a journey in which director Gianni Amelio takes us along to witness how the father and the son get acquainted after all those years. Paolo the son realizes Gianni is the missing father. He is quite an extraordinary boy in spite of the fact that he can't walk without the help of a cane. Gianni at the beginning is cautious of what he does because this is obvious a situation he didn't look for but fell on him as part of having been absent all those years from his son's life.As Paolo is being tested at the hospital Gianni meets Nicole who is at the hospital because her daughter is also being treated there. Nicole asks questions and Gianni is reluctant to answer but she guesses what the nature of the relationship is like. Gianni who doesn't have any experience with his son's problems wonders how Nicole has been able to cope all those years. When the final revelation is bared little prepares us for what she has to say yet it's only a human reaction.Paolo and Gianni end up bonding in more ways than either one expected. Gianni surprises his son by taking him to Norway where Kristine a young pen pal of Paolo lives. Although they never get to see the girl the trip serves for them to find a common ground and for Gianni to accept his responsibility. The last scene is a revelation as Gianni breaks down after realizing what a monster he has been to this son that he just have met.Gianni Amelio's genius lies in the way he tells his story in which there is no recriminations or cheap hysterics which would have derailed the picture. Mr. Amelio is also to be commended for the way he has presented the story and for the interesting cast he put together to portray the people on the story. Kim Rossi Stuart makes a good Gianni the father. Andrea Rossi seems to be a natural for the camera as young Paolo he shows more common sense and acceptance than his father. The great Charlotte Rampling plays the pivotal role of Nicole. It's her example and stoicism that makes Gianni think about the monstrosity of his actions and learns to love his son.It's a shame more films by Mr. Amelio don't reach us. He is a man with a conscience who wants to raise our awareness.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a special parent of and active in the community of special aka mentally handicapped children this story hit close to home. Especially the way in which it illuminated two very subtle yet extraordinarily important aspects of the behavior and psychology of this child as well as a parent.In the movie the biological father Gianni is shown to have given up the child Paolo to another couple. I would interpret this not so much in a literal way but more in an allegorical way since even in real life due to the trauma and complexity of parenting a special child parents may lose touch with the child even if the child is in house. It is a huge challenge especially balancing the child's care with other aspects of life including social career health other siblings of the child etc. All too often the special child itself becomes only a tiny part of the whole system and mind numbing details of providing care.The film also brilliantly portrays the resolution potential spoiler of the above dilemma thats all too common in special parents' lives. Initially Gianni tries to deal with Paolo in a loving yet ultimately paternalistic way. But this doesn't get him anywhere near his goal of bonding with Paolo. In the end only when Gianni literally breaks down and becomes as helpless as a child himself and lets Paolo comfort him as a father would does the real bonding between father and son occur on a level playing field.This is an incredibly insightful object lesson and is so true in the often dark challenging yet ultimately fulfilling lives of special parents.This movie is a veritable ode to the divine relationship that exists between such parents and their special children.I rate this movie 1010 due to its authenticity and humanism.PS Another movie on the same topic but from a siblings perspective is A Time For Drunken Horses by Bahman Ghobadi.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've got to say that this film had touched me so much in both simple and extraordinary ways. There are lots of drama movies out there whose theme seems to rust off compared to this one and I proclaim to be hearttouched. Le Chiavi di Casa or also known as The keys to the house had made the most authentic impact to our modern lives. The story runs with to main characters of Gianni Kim Rossi Stuart and Paolo Andrea Rossi whose relationship are embraced by new encounter of a father and son relationship.

His mother Giulia died in the delivery and his father Gianni Kim Rossi Stuart left the boy in the hospital and has never seen him. Alberto calls Gianni and tells him that he should travel with Paolo to Berlin for a medical treatment in a specialized hospital. Gianni has his first contact with his son and during the trip her feels connected to Paolo. In Berlin he befriends Nicole Charlotte Rampling the mother of a disable woman who tells him how much he would suffer if he decides to stay close to his son.Le Chiavi di Casa should be emotionally gripping because of the theme associated to the performances of the Andrea Rossi who is disabled indeed and the wonderful and always elegant and beautiful Charlotte Rampling. However the melodramatic and weird story about missed fatherhood is corny implausible and annoying in many moments. How could the contact between a father that despised his own son be good for the boy? How could the biological father take the decision to invite his abandoned son to live with his family without deeply discussing the subject with the boy's parents Alberto and Livia and also with his wife? The boy travels to a hospital to be submitted to a battery of tests for a specialized treatment and the father simply spoils the test disrespects the doctor and does not bring the boy back to the hospital? Further why irresponsibly throwing the walker off to the sea? The plot had a great potential but unfortunately the inconsistent screenplay is not good. The best and most honest moment of this overrated movie is the confession of Nicole to Gianni about her innermost feelings. My vote is six.Title Brazil As Chaves de Casa The Keys of the House".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on Giuseppe Pontiggia's novel and Gianni Amelio's screenplay this film won several awards at the 2004 Venice Film Festival. As with most great films this one deserves several viewings since new and subtle nuances are revealed each time that one sees it. As the film opens two men are meeting in a coffee shop and talking about a boy named Paolo. Gianni Kim Rossi Stuart asks Alberto Pierfrancesco Favino if Paolo looks like him now. Alberto tells him that according to his wife he only looks like his mother her sister. Gianni says 'Your wife must hate me.' Alberto then explains that for her he Gianni died with her sister.As the two continue their conversation Alberto tells how they learned that Paolo was failing to develop properly as he grew up. In spite of 'filling the house' with footballs he crawled on the floor like a puppy never learning to walk until after he was six. Gianni asks him why the decision was made to have him meet Paolo now. Alberto explains that it was the doctor's idea sometimes when physicallychallenged people meet their fathers for the first time a miracle happens. Gianni then asks Alberto if Paolo knows who he is and he says 'of course.' 'You don't deserve him'...there is a pregnant pause as if Alberto made the statement in a judgmental way...The two sleep together in the same train compartment but when Gianni wakes up the next morning he finds Paolo's bed empty. Searching the train he finds Paolo Andrea Rossi in the dinning car playing with his game boy. After Gianni and Paolo eat breakfast together and getting to know each other a bit they return to their compartment. As they return Gianni sees Paolo's physical disability for the first time. Paolo has muscular dystrophy he walks with a cane for balance his upper torso is bent forward his arms and hands are stiffly bent and his gait is awkward as he moves from side to side rather than in a straight line. Gianni's first tendency is to assist Paolo back to their compartment. However the teenager's natural tendency is to be independent and NOT to be helped. For example even though Paolo can walk he can't dress and undress himself because of his rigidly bent arms and hands Gianni has to learn which shirtsleeveleft or rightto put on first and which to put on second when undressing him the left right procedure is reversed.The train trip takes the two from Milan to Berlin. In Berlin Paolo is taken to a very good children's orthopedic center. Here Paolo will undergo a battery of tests. Once in Berlin Gianni must deal with Paolo's strange behavior which includes bothering strangers without compunction. When Paolo talks to the taxi driver and takes off his hat the driver is understanding and patient. However it still embarrasses Gianni. There is also a language barrier with the cab driverand later with the clinicians at the hospitalonly being able to speak German and Gianni and Paolo only knowing Italian.After the two check into the hotel Paolo begins his battery of clinical tests. Gianni feels that he has to be with Paolo during the tests. But the 15yearold first asks him to leave and then finally has to order him to leave while he spends the night in his hospital hooked up to electrodes and wires for an EEG. The next day Paolo goes into Nadine's room down the hall. Nadine Alla Faerovich is a severely retarded 20 year old woman. Her mother Nicole Charlotte Rampling greets him warmly as he curiously looks at Nadine. It is through this overture that Nicole gets to know Gianni they are fellow parents of challenged youngsters. Nicole and Nadine are from Lyon France but Nicole had once studied in Italy and knows fluent Italian. The next day Gianni looks on as Paolo is being clinically observed while walking back and fourth along a line covered with sensing electrodes and a boxlike device attached to his hip to monitor the kinetic movements of his hip joints muscles and ligaments. As Paolo is ordered to march back and fourth almost to exhaustion Gianni can take no more of it and runs to him stopping the test. When Giannia and Nichole later see each other she tells him that he has caused a problem. She says that the doctor is very angry with him 'The problem with some children isn't the disease. It's the parents.' Gianni and Nicole later see each other at a hospital wheelchair basketball game As Nicole is talking to Gianni Paolo watches the game alone from the sideline and then disappears into the city. Nicole helps Gianni find Paolo and then assists him at the police station. Throughout the film Gianni and Nicole share their real feelings about their roles as parents of challenged children. Nicole's experience had lasted 20 years and Gianni's had lasted only three days. As the two open up to each other their roles gradually evolve from judge and accused. In the last scene of the film with Nichole we hear her truthfully telling Gianni that she is jealous of other parents when she hears that their children get better. She warns him not to get too close to Paolo and to be prepared to be hurt in the future...".

Maybe that is strange to compare it with his other films simply happens.In 'Celebrity' we follow Kenneth Branagh who plays Woody Allen although he is named Lee Simon. A movie without Woody Allen himself is nice but with a character that basically is Allen why not play it yourself? On the other hand Branagh does a terrific job. We see how Branagh divorces his wife and after that we have single episodes of his life where he meets women tries to make them his fails or succeeds only to enter the next episode. At the same time we follow his exwife Robin Judy Davis who meets a new man Tony Joe Mantegna and does settle.Branagh is a writer. He writes a novel has written two novels with bad reviews and now he finished a screenplay. In the episodes he tries to offer his script or new novel to people who can change it into a movie or book. We have Melanie Griffith and Leonardo DiCaprio as spoiled actors Famke Janssen as a girl who really likes him and could help get his story into a book Winona Ryder as the girl he has some real chemistry with and Charlize Theron as a supermodel.The problem is that every episode feels like an episode instead of everything combined as a movie. The Theron and DiCaprio episodes are great the Winona Ryder episode is sweet the others are pretty standard. The intercuts of the exwife's life are pretty good as well but still feel as single episodes.Although the film as a whole is not that great there are enough moments to enjoy it. You will not be bored. The black and white photography looks terrific and that is something that makes the movie more pleasant. It is well acted and of course directed but for a Woody Allen comedy it is not my first choice.".

	schema:reviewBody "As Woody Allen is too old for the lead Kenneth Branagh literally steps into his shoes and does such an effective job at playing Woody that he must have watched every Allen movie at least six times. The film is hilarious but deeplike his best films. It explores our obsession with celebrities and the media's obsession with them and I wonder how much acting Leonardo DiCaprio did for this film. But the more I thought about it afterwards the more I realized how sad the movie is at its corethe word help being written in the sky may be what Allen is thinkingis this what we have become? So obsessed with fortune and fame that we literally prostitute ourselves and become someone we aren't i.e. Judy Davis' character?The movie seems more timely now than in 1998.  Americans seem to be more interested in what Paris Hilton does on TV or what JLo and Affleck are up to than what's going on in the world.  Celebrity nails it and like Deconstructing Harry does it in a rather vulgar manner.  But you have to wonder how much of this is based on real events again I cite Di Caprio. This was the second movie after 2 Days in the Valley that made me aware of the statuesque beauty of Charlize Theron.  I didn't think she could act worth a hoot that opinion recently changed but she sure looked like a rich runway model to me. This movie is one of my favorite Woody films of the '90s and one of his most underrated.  It's also visually beautiful in black  white that recalls the photography of Manhattan.".

The film is hilarious but deeplike his best films. It explores our obsession with celebrities and the media's obsession with them and I wonder how much acting Leonardo DiCaprio did for this film. But the more I thought about it afterwards the more I realized how sad the movie is at its corethe word help being written in the sky may be what Allen is thinkingis this what we have become?

It's much more subtle but every bit as scathing as Deconstructing Harry. Everyone says Woody's films just aggrandize himself but I feel that his latest few have been exercises in selfloathing.Certain people in these very pages have felt that one is supposed to sympathize with the Branagh character. Certain people we must remember are on crack. Branagh plays a lowlife louse who gives the word narcissim a whole new meaning. He is looking to revitalize his life by entering the world of celebrities. He is contrasted with his exwife the always amazing Judy Davis... who doesn't she do more films? who is also looking to change her life but not necessarily by becoming famous. She does become famous and near the end she says what I think is the key line I've become the kind of person I've always detested but I'm happier. My friend and I had an argument later about what the film was saying a that Judy has given up on seriousness and meaning by becoming a celebrity but now she's happier or b that the entertainment products that these people turn out don't matter at all and that if one can find personal happiness Judy eventually becomes much more social and comfortable with people by doing them then that's great. I don't know but this is a far more interesting treatise on finding happiness than the dreary Happiness was.This is also the funniest Allen film in years with two total laughoutloud lines which I won't spoil here.Overall I felt the celebrity part and all the walkons we not at all the focus of this movie it just uses that world as a backdrop. This film is also very sweet and real with the scene in which Judy Davis visits a psychic being one of the most intimate and touching I've seen.One last thing it's fun to see a Woody Allen film in New York City because you can watch the audience trying to identify all the places where the scenes are set.

The Allen theme of womanizer gets his comeuppance is by now quite predictable and this film does not deviate from it one bit.  Some of the social satire is clever as usual but Celebrity ends up dying on the vine because of its wildly improbable insistence that nymphomaniac supermodels and barelylegal literary beauties cannot keep their hands off of a male protagonist who neither exhibits any sort of charisma nor has any kind of achievements to his credit.

Maybe the critics are tired of Woody Allen maybe they just didn't get his point. The truth is that CELEBRITY is no ANNIE HALL MANHATTAN HANNAH AND HER SISTERS or CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS but is a great film overall.The story is about a divorced couple Lee and Robin Simon Kenneth Branagh and Judy Davis who try to find their position in the society. Lee is a journalist who starts to write about art so he gets closer to celebrities. He gets involved with lots of women the futile actress Nicole Oliver Melanie Griffith who belongs to her husband only down the neck a supermodel Charlize Theron with an erotic failure a cold woman Famke Janssen who wants to live with him and a second rate actress Winona Ryder who is not his obscure object of desire as he thinks. He is between finish writing his novel after the bad reviews for his first novel and trying to sell a script when he meets another futile star Leonardo DiCaprio. In resume his life is a mess with no wayback. In the meantime his exwife Robin an English teacher ironically gets more luck than him she meets a TV producer Joe Mantegna who thinks she has a future as a TV presenter. With a good story in hands Allen turns it into an acid funny film. But you know the laughs in his films aren't gratuitous they come naturally or depending on the way you get into the scene. And they are also bitter remember the subtitles scene in ANNIE HALL this taste of humor is not for everyone. The funniest best scene is when the prostitute teaches Davis' character how to do a blowjob using a banana. As usual Allen takes great performances from the whole cast. Kenneth Branagh has been criticized for imitating Woody Allen too much but I think he did a great job. We already know Judy Davis especially Joe Mantegna and Winona Ryder are terrific but it is a miracle what Allen can do with Melanie Griffith Leonardo Di Caprio and Charlize Theron usually bland performers. Charlize is the most peculiar character and delivers a great and funny performance.The main detail of the film is the use of blackandwhite. This is not the first time Allen uses that MANHATTAN STARDUST MEMORIES SHADOWS AND FOG but it is almost a character in this picture it shows a world that is even more sufocating than ours. With that he makes an acid critic about our society that turns superficial futile people into instant celebrities. This is not new of course but here these people are also victims of the sufocating society. If a society can be interpreted by who it chooses to celebrate it is worse than it seems to be. Allen commits some mistakes here and there with his critic but you don't find many films like this out there clever funny bitter and realistic. Remember the HELP sign on the air...".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film in 1998 on the big screen  again Feb 20 2010. Lee Simon unsuccessful journalist  wannabe novelist tries to get a foot into the door with celebrities. After divorcing his wife Robin Lee gets to meet a lot folks of the rich   or beautiful partly through journalism partly because he has a script to offer. But life among those from outofthisworld is hard  his putative success always results in defeat. Meanwhile Robin meets a very desirable TVproducer  takes the first steps in the world of celebrities herself. This film is really a marriage midlife crisis type movie about luck. Who has luck  who does not have luck actually they have rotten luck. The film is done in black  white. Kenneth Branagh plays the Woody Allen role. The film has a huge roster of celebrities in big roles  many big parts with this all star cast. If you were a famous somebody actor in 1998 YOU WERE IN THIS MOVIE!! HAHAH. Branagh does a terrific jobhe is fantastic in this role. Kenneth Branagh does a wicked Woody Allen imitation and what's most fun about it is that Allen wrote and directed the picture. Is Allen lampooning himself? Was it Branagh's idea? Who decided how far to take it? And what does this all mean in Allen's ongoing dialogue with his viewers. Branagh gives us the quintessence of Woodyism. This goes a good deal beyond the average nightclub comic's Allen shtick. What Branagh offers is a finesse job of skewering homing in precisely on his target's speech patterns and mannerisms. I disagree with many in that I do not feel like this is just another Woody Allen movie  he is just doing all the stuff over again. Boy is that wrong. This is his best film since Deconstructing Harry  Husbands  Wives. The film is hilarious but deeplike his best films. It explores our obsession with celebrities  the media's obsession with them. He embarks on a string of neoFelliniesque encounters with the rogue's gallery of celebrity actors who bring out the best in Allen's barbed dialogue. The movie seems timelier now than in 1998. This movie is one of my favorite Woody films of the '90s  one of his most underrated. It's also visually beautiful in black  white with that nice the photography of Manhattan. Cast wise there is great ensemble work here with both witty  intelligent writing from Allen  amusing setpieces  excellent cinematographyphotography. Allen's carefully crafted anticelebrity image  the shunning of interviews and so on  is just as much a celebrity image as anything he makes fun of here. But Allen remains a very potent fantasy figure for critics and moviegoers who want to see him as something like America's resident European filmmaker untouched by the vagaries and vulgarities of the industry he works in. His familiar formalized artfilm aesthetic reinforces that perception. It's impressive that in the age of blockbusters Allen has managed to keep making movies his way. Here he captures that vapid empty malaise of celebrity life in a hysterical way. Five stars WAY better today than when I saw it on the big screen in 1998".

	schema:reviewBody "Woody Allen is certainly a celebrity if attention from the tabloids is any judge and well qualified to write a film about Celebrity.He lives openly in Manhattan amongst the rich yuppies he loves to write about and has attracted plenty of tabloid attention to do with his private life. Whether he has succeeded in presenting a film about the concept of celebrity is debatable though because this film throws itself in probably a dozen directions not really leaving familiar Allen territory.His films usually feature himself playing a character very like himself or a character who is recognisably Woody Allen. He's portrayed as a dithering well meaning but self serving sophisticate who's friends and lovers spar their way through self induced minor crises of the heart.Allen's films usually contain a myriad of set pieces often centered about religious guilt and a fear of commitment and they're nearly always very funny.In Celebrity the English master actor Kenneth Branagh has taken the Woody Allen part playing a journalist Lee Simon with terrific energy and authenticity.Lee is facing a mid life crisis. He confesses infidelities to his wife Robin Australia's Judy Davis  in another wonderful performance and then bounces from one disappointment with women and with his career to the next. He wants to write a novel but can't get together the courage. He no doubt fears he lacks the talent.Robin on the other hand has a classic female Woody Allen female break down but then haltingly blossoms when Tony Joe Mantegna falls unreservedly in love with her. But can she cope even with this? In fact Woody Allen films are so much about lack of confidence and are seemingly so autobiographical that it's a wonder Allen hasn't lost his nerve in real life and ended up not being able to face Central Park or a movie studio at all. It's a wonder he's not permanently in therapy perhaps he is!The secret must lie with the generosity and concern he feels for the rich cocaine and diamond social set he  shares. His humor is warm and never cruel although women may take issue with this.There are some particularly demeaning but not nasty scenes for the women in Celebrity although humiliation isn't confined to the women. The men are often equally lost and at the mercy of their uncertainties and lack of clear direction in life.Oh to be so spoilt! Woody Allen films are often about the nearly idle rich and more importantly about the selfish generation. Love affairs always seem to be temporary affairs even if they last years ready to make way for a new model.Viewers as often happens in a Woody Allen film can play the star spotting game. As well as Kenneth Branagh and Judy Davis and Joe Mantegna there's Leonardo DiCaprio Gretchen Mol Famke Jansen Winona Ryder Bebe Neuwirth and Charlize Theron to recognise.The wit is often sharp and very funny with solid stabs being made at Catholic idolatry the media supercilious film directors and spoilt brat stars. There's a fine moment of two some hilarious some touching.The Woody Allen moaning becomes a bit of a whine once or twice but Celebrity wins hands down with plenty of fine fun dialogue and beautifully realised photography and a final meekly despairing plea from the scared to be committed.".

There's a fine moment of two some hilarious some touching.The Woody Allen moaning becomes a bit of a whine once or twice but Celebrity wins hands down with plenty of fine fun dialogue and beautifully realised photography and a final meekly despairing plea from the scared to be committed.";

	schema:reviewBody "Sporadically throughout his career Woody Allen has tried to capture the stylistic essence of the filmmakers he idolizes one of them being Federico Fellini. With Celebrity he finally nails it. It's a beautifully Felliniesque film not only in its structure but in Allen's affectionate use of black and white cinematography. In a Fellini film every scene involves a large ensemble of people and infinitely busy goingson. Hardly any more than one shot in the entire film has only one person in it. Allen whether he likes it or not is different. If Fellini is too dry to make the audience feel truly attached to his characters Allen probes his own the way his own nebbishy characters probe themselves. This gives Celebrity a very effective and intriguing structure as the film has about five million main characters but gives them pockets of significantly focal screen time. Leonardo DiCaprio's time on screen here is told in an agitating fastpaced vignette where we drop in smack dab in the middle of his character's personal life watch how it spills without any selfcontrol into his public life and watch his oddly unpredictable and brilliantly drawn character as what can loosely be called the protagonist Kenneth Branagh's journalist tries to pitch his script to him and is taken aback by the overwhelming amount of distraction.Basically Allen pinpoints the style he wished to emulated by creating a movie that is a story that could only ever truly be impacting as a movie. Like any Fellini film there could never even be a worthy attempt made to adapt it as a play or a novel. It's too innately cinematic. Also this particular time when Allen cannot help but seek to mold his own out of an homage to Bergman Fellini or Antonioni it really truly works because he built upon it by injecting his own voice into the work. Interiors and Stardust Memories were like Bermgna and Fellini carbon copies.The cast works well for the most part as DiCaprio plays his said role very acutely Theron takes on a similar role with interesting reflective flair and Judy Davis is a wonder of dramatic energy as always. Kenneth Branagh is a little awkward though and perhaps that's not entirely his fault. He is cast in a role that is clearly a screen personality of Woody Allen himself but likely because Allen is too old to play such a specific role he chose another actor a personologically similar one but a lesser one nonetheless not because Branagh is at all a bad or unaffecting actor but because Woody's screen persona is too much of a signature of his own. We don't want anyone else to play that role. But as one would probably imagine an actor trying to act like Woody Allen would Branagh is smart enough to approach the neurotic selfcentrally worrisome part from his own perspective.Celebrity is much underappreciated and is on par with the vast majority of Woody's filmography.".

	schema:reviewBody "I honestly don't know why this film has been so critically destroyed. It was very well done and it is very culturally relevant. It also utilizes an allstar cast but Woody doesn't emphasize on the star power.Kenneth Branagh and Judy Davis play Lee and Robin Simon a divorced New York couple heading in separate directions after his midlife crisis divorce. The film then explores and critiques their adventures and lives after.Lee divorced Robin because he had married too soon and wanted to explore what was out in the world. A travel writer he tries to insert himself in the inner circles and this is expressed through clever and witty anecdotes. He tries to seduce an actress he's interviewing Nicole Oliver Melanie Griffith only to be rejected because she is married. Then he almost gets his chance to have all of his sexual fantasies fulfilled by a Supermodel in an erotically charged performance by Charlize Theron only to crash his car and watch her walk away. Lee commits to Bonnie his elegant editor girlfriend in a charged performance by the reliable Famke Janssen only to dump her for rising starlet Nola a typically neurotic performance by Winona Ryder. Lee also has a wild time with the hoteltrashing druggie actor Brandon Darrow in a funny performance by Leonardo DiCaprioand his wild entourage. He ends up alone however although he had experienced what he wanted to.Robin meanwhile nearly suffers a breakdown after the divorce and stays at a Catholic retreat with her friend. She tries to make herself over at a prestigious plastic surgeon only to get a date with charming Tony Gardella a news reporter. Joe Mantegna plays the supposed perfect person for Robin with grace. After an uncomfortable encounter at a movie premiere with Lee Robin indulges herself into Tony's world. She gets her own TV series a trashy talk show. In a quirky scene she tries to get help on fellatio from a neurotic hooker in a toobrief performance by Bebe Neuwirth. She is about to get married to Tony when she instead runs off unable to bear how perfect it all is. After help from a psychic she tries to find him.As the story winds down Robin becomes a gossip talk show host mingling with celebrities and married to Tony. She's also pregnant. Lee is alone having dumped Bonnie for Nola and having watched his novel float away. His relationship with the neurotic mess Nola also dies out. Their meeting is bittersweet as is the ending as they watch the movie that is being filmed when the movie started.The film has a plethora of short but sweet performances. Dylan Baker plays a charming priest who befriends Robin at her retreat. Isaac Mizrahi plays a trendy artist a friend of the Supermodel's. Anthony Mason plays himself as a suitor of the Supermodel's at a nightclub. Michael Lerner plays the prestigious Dr. Lerner while Debra Messing plays the quirky reporter doing a story on him. Larry Pine a Woody Allen regular plays an editor. Gretchen Mol has a minor role as Vicky Brandon's companion in a thoroughly funny scene. Hank Azaria plays David Nola's boyfriend in a scene set at Elaine's. Allison Janney plays a real estate agent that is interviewed by Lee while Donald Trump plays himself in an amusing cameo. Aida Turturro and Tony Sirico both have small roles. Aida plays a psychic Robin visits while Tony plays a Mafiosi guest on Robin's talk show. Jeffery Wright also has a small role in the last segment of the film as Nola's pretentious director in a play.The film for the most part is quirky funny and not as perverse as say Deconstructing Harry. The only complaint that I can make is that while Woody Allen satirizes the current celebrity society he goes for the easy targets when possible. He is refreshingly selfreferential and in a nice surprise he references the New York art scene the models and movies of New York along with cultural references to current celebrities and references to people like Andy Warhol. The soundtrack is elegant and sophisticated. Despite my small complaints the movie is refreshing and at times hilarious. A welldone picture.".

She never did quite get it that she couldn't keep drinking and kept trying to weasel a way to not give up the sauce.So not surprisingly she had to fall back on porn to make a buck. That in itself is a little sad but I could live with it. One of my favorite porn stars Christy Canyon has just returned from her 6th or 7th retirement. What really distresses me is that Mary decided to make a porn parity of her treatment. Had she no respect at all for the effort that was made on her behalf or no concern for legal risk this might put her in? I should know better she's an addict of course not.Now all of that aside the sex with the exception of one scene was fairly dull. Mary herself stuck to girlgirl which I could care less about. Penny Flame later a much more successful Patient in Celebrity Sex Rehab wins the prize for most ironic performance. The only scene that got a rise out of me was a MMF threesome ruined in the end by the actors pretending to pass a coke vial during the sex.I guess I'm getting old I don't go for porn just for the sheer taboobreaking nastiness anymore if I ever did. I like to watch people have sex that they seem to enjoy I don't need to see anybody spit on hurt or verbally abused. If a performer finds that porn is bad for them I support their decision to stop no matter how much I may have enjoyed their performances.For another view on leaving porn check out Penny Flame's blog Becoming Jennie.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie likens that of a gemstone raw real unique crafty and incomparable. I watched this movie my first Spanish movie in cinema with English subtitles and frankly i was impressed. Though now the only regret i have is not mastering the language before the show. If only i could pay more attention to the movie instead of the translated words running at the bottom.This is a story of a prison guard Juan Oliver played by Alberto A who decided to go to work one day before he actually begins to 'make an impression'. What awaits him later is a riot which forced him to be locked in Cell 211 after suffering an injury to his head. He knows the only way to live is to be one of them and so he acted as an inmate. But until when can he keep it to himself? He has to make peace with the rest of the inmates and gain the trust of their 'leader' Malamadre played by Luis Tosar as they take hostage of high profile terroristprisoners. He later learns an ugly news of his pregnant wife outside prison and his life is never the same again.This movie plays around the humanity of man and how corruption and distrust can affect a man's freedom and ultimately his life. There were moments in the show. Obviously the prison riot. The police riot scene later was well delivered straight to its core which led to the falling domino pieces in the movie. The turning point of Juan's character was when he received the news about his wife. Fine acting by all the cast with amazing characterization awesome cinematography and directing at every scene!The development of the plot is great at points where it creates suspense left me on the edge of my seat. The blossoming relationship between Juan and Malamadre is well crafted and believable that i don't see in many other movies these days. It felt like Caesar in Rise of the Planet of the Apes.Walking out the cinema i was left to ponder at many questions with respect to the show. Why was Juan left in Cell 211 at the first place? As if a curse is cast to the cell. It will be interesting to watch the Hollywood remake of the movie in two years time and i hope it does remain to its authenticity. Definitely awardworthy it accentuates prison drama at its best pulling heartstrings despite its violence and vulgar language.My cinematic experience has truly broadened. And i am sure yours will too after watching this movie.".

Yet the last thing Cell 211 is is generic. It has some refreshingly genuine left field unexpected twists and developments that keep you pretty much hooked from its attention grabbing opening scene to its blistering conclusion. It also does a great job of keeping you in suspense as to whether or not our protagonist will be discovered with the viewer left under no illusions what will happen to him if he is.It's also got some very decent production values and mercifully refrains from that awful jump cut editing during the more chaotic prison scenes.But best of all is its sheer unpredictability as trust me after the hour mark you really won't be sure how things are gonna turn out and will be hooked all the more.Overall a great film and highly highly recommended.

He lies about his real identity and soon becomes best friends with the prisons tough guy. The movie is full with clichs and is often too far fetched. Juan seems to know everything and says all the right things at the right time which becomes really annoying at one point. His girlfriend is pregnant extra drama and her parts in the movie are just horrible. Why the F does a pregnant girl attend a demonstration? And of course she gets hit and of course it's one of the guards that beats her and of course this gets taped with his face clearly shown and of course one of the prisoners gets this video on a mobile phone and shows this to Juan. I mean jeez... I could go on there are many other situation which are so bad so I was really surprised to see that this movie got a 76 rating at the time of writing this. Oke it's not all bad Juan's acting was pretty good and some parts were really suspenseful. I liked the first part were it was dubious if the prisoners would believe Juan's story  which was a turning point in the movie.Although I like prison movies this is a very forgettable one and I would not recommend it to my friends. Too bad I went in with high expectations maybe this was the problem.".

I highly doubt it. Gripping is not a word I would use to describe this film. It just isn't a strong or bold enough word. Enthralling may do a better job. With the script as strong as it was obviously being well adapted from the novel mixed in with some very intelligent performances this film has me questioning my choice of cinema visits over the last 2 years. As with most good films the director has done a fantastic job of allowing the film to flow seamlessly throughout. A breath of fresh air such as this will get your film sinuses flowing freely once more and your mind blown wide open for genre selection. Also a great big thank you to my local cinema showing this film well after it's release.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tense and intriguing Spanish thriller mostly located into a prison with exception some flashbacks about private life of protagonist Alberto Ammann along with his wife Marta Etura . Good film that shows realism and truth without falling into the clichs of the genre . This powerful and very well directed prison movie contains thoughtprovoking drama  thrills  chills  suspenseful and lots of violence . With an excellent cast  including sensational acting from the magnificent starring Alberto Ammann as a prisoner in a desperate attempt to survive the ordeal  suffering an emotional brutalization who causes an explosion of violence and of course a perfect Luis Tosar who steals the show as tough and violent Malamadre . The tale of two men on different sides of a prison riot  the prisoner nicknamed Malamadre Luis Tosar leading the rebellion and the young warden caught in the revolt named Juan Oliver Ammann who poses as an inmate in a desperate attempt to survive the violent events . The first day when Juan begins working on his new job as a prison warden  is caught in a prison riot . He then decides to impersonate another prisoner to save his life and to end the revolt . Later on  terrible deeds happen and fury and revenge emerge . As Juan trapped in a world that does not belong and forgotten his fateful fate  erupts into an explosion of selfdefensive violence showed on some breathtaking scenes .This exciting picture results to be an intense thriller that packs tension  straightforward intrigue  sober drama and lots of violence . The film contains thrills and chills and is quite entertaining because being a laborious and intriguing suspense tale full of twists and turns . In the picture there are violence  drama  tension and a little bit of action in the final confrontation . The story contains a statement about inmate's mistreating  despair  betrayal and a strong criticism of the ruling class unable to control a dangerous situation . Most part of the movie takes place into four walls of the jail involving and executing the preparatives of strict conditions demanded by the inmates . Highlighting the newcomer actor Alberto Ammann  giving a lesson in how he is able to withstand the weight of the flick and stand up to a great actor like Luis Tosar  making a memorable work as dreaded Malamadre  without falling into the prison movie clichs . Furthermore  an excellent support cast as the nasty informer Carlos Bardem Juan Bardem's brother and Antonio Resines as sadist and corrupt warden who uses unthinkable brutality . This is a perfectly realized and superbly crafted film . Interesting and thrilling screenplay by Jorge Guerricaechevarria Eloy De Iglesia's usual screenwriter though full of offensive stereotypes and not faithful to deeds . Appropriate cinematography by Carlos Gusi Torrente Box 507 who photographs splendidly the cold interiors from Zamora prison . Adequate and atmospheric musical score by Roque Baos Fragiles Machinist Sexy beast 800 bullets. The motion picture was stunningly directed by Daniel Monzon  a former cinema reviewer  he undertakes a skill and fascinating filmmaking with some sensationalist touch though is also intensely manipulative against prison guards  this is his main big success . He previously directed fantasy Heart of warrior  comedy Biggest robbery never told and suspense The Kovak box. Rating  Good  better than average. The film will appeal to prison genre buffs and Luis Tosar fans.".

Superb direction extraordinary acting rock solid script impeccable camerawork. Cell 211 had all the makings of a Blockbuster.The direction by Daniel Monzon is flawless. The way he built the story from the beginning kept me involved from scene 1 where the first inmate of cell 211 cuts himself. Mr.Monzon has to be a visionary to shoot the scene the way he did. The script is really2 honest  no time was wasted with anything else. The movie came straight to the point  new guard riot Calzone inside  buckle up Dorothy coz this is going to be one hell of a ride! The thrill and action was nicely mixed up with the bedroom scenes of Calzone with his wife. It made me experience the passionate side of Calzone and source of his motivation to get out. Later this also became the source of his anger and madness when he cuts up the guard who killed his wife. The build up had to be perfect to make me feel the sadness and anger which Calzone was feeling. I could almost feel myself cutting up that guard as I was so angry  how could he kill a harmless pregnant women? I really liked the fact that Mr.Monzon kept the script honest to what he wanted to convey  no distractions. He had only a handful of characters who he wanted to focus on and only they formed the primary part of the script  shows the vision of the screenplay writers  in this case the director as well Mr.Monzon did both.The sets consumed me into the movie from the moment the riot broke out  the whole place trashed rioting outside whole movie shot within the prison. Its a unique style of direction when a movie is shot within a closed compoundroom. I feel the whole intent is to make the viewer experience the movie as if he is himself there. The feeling is made real with handheld camerawork and not standard industry cranework all the time. Cell 211 had this quality. As I said the movie stuck to the director's vision.The actors gave it all. The two protagonists Luis Tosar  Alberto Ammann were outstanding. Luis is an accomplished Spanish actor and won many awards for his performances in Spanish films acted in Miami Vice 2006. The support actors did their part to perfection  I think Mr.Monzon extracted exactly what he wanted from his acting crew.All in all Cell 211 is an amazing thriller and a great work of Spanish cinema. Definitely a keeper. I rate this 9 out of 10.".

The film has some very good performances and like many gritty prison dramas come excessive violence that'll have you wincing away. The early themes of the film revolve around loyalty and earning respect bit deeper into the film it becomes more about survival. Juan is put into situations where it appears noone is on his side and taking matters into his own hands seems to be the only way out. There were times during the film when i thought i could predict exactly how Cell 211 was going to play out. Having seen my share of prison themed dramas over the years it's all to easy to see where a film might lead in the final third. I'm happy to say that Cell 211 set itself up in what i thought was a predictable way but that in the end and to it's credit i was surprised by how it played out.

	schema:headline " Great movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "Awesome movie which brings us into the life of normal average policeman with pregnant wife. This movie amazingly shows us how can our life change in just one second. He lost everything in that moment when his new coleague has left without him. But he was smart. He didn't give up and he tried his best. He was so brave that he could look right into Malamadres eyes and tell him whatever he wanted to. He thought that staying stuck in prison was the biggest trouble he had. But it was only the beginning of that nightmare. Excellent movie with strong story and exciting plot. Viewer is hoping during the whole movie but this is not expectable end. As I said in that moment Juan Oliver looses everything he had. Life of his wife his child and at the end his very own life. And the worst is that he couldn't do a single thing to change it. He had to watch how his life is shipwrecked in front of his eyesAnother masterpiece by Jorge Guerricaechevarra. Just amazing.".

He lost everything in that moment when his new coleague has left without him. But he was smart. He didn't give up and he tried his best. He was so brave that he could look right into Malamadres eyes and tell him whatever he wanted to. He thought that staying stuck in prison was the biggest trouble he had.

Original plot and some Spanish spirit spices up this movie and makes you look at a screen expecting what would occur in the next frame. IMHO this film is not typical jailfilm shooted before at least I did not see one and thus it is worth watching for everybody. It is a very good variant of a pastime you will not regret  Also As I read somewhere a American version of Cell211 is going to be shooted.. So... IMHO I am sure now that American version will not gain as much pluses rating and positive reviews. Hope I am mistaken.. Good luck!  Happy viewing!".

When Juan discovers what had happened with his wife he becomes closer to Malamadre and changes his behavior taking the side of the inmates.

The dramatic screenplay is realistic with a story of friendship and pain using the background of the environment of a prison and ETA in Spain and the tight direction is supported by topnotch performances.

The do not believe in '68 ideals anymore and do not find other inspiration and passions so what they do is simply living. But Moretti's very sarcastic and cruel style easily leads to laugh to smile to think. The dialogs are very funny and the characters are so hilarious. Moretti filmed his first movie in 16mm. This movie costed 180 millions of Italian Liras about 90000 Dollars but it earned 2 billions of Liras about 1 million Dollars. Not bad if you think that it was the first movie of a notknown director. In conclusion a great cultmovie..".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the story of two young Japanese brothers who live apart following the breakup of their parents' relationship. The older boy dreams of his family reuniting and prays for a miraculous intervention in the form of a volcanic eruption hoping this might lead to his evacuation from his grandparents' region and a return home. Then when he discovers that the passing of the speeding Bullet trains approaching from opposite directions creates a 'cosmic' moment during which wishes are granted he sets out with a few friends to meet his brother at the meeting point on the railway line. There they make their wishes  with varying results.The two brothers are forced to deal with the consequences of their parents' choices ones they have had no part in making. Their belief to varying degrees in the power of 'faith' believing that wishes can come true then leads them to have to face the consequences of their own choices. Given their youthful immaturity there is real poignancy in witnessing their confrontation with some harsh realities. The movie features brilliant performances from the young actors and an excellent supporting cast of adults. There is also gorgeous and evocative cinematography scenes of the Japanese countryside and its urban impositions not least the Bullet line itself elevated on its concrete trackbed.It takes some time too long perhaps for the story to gain momentum. But once the youngsters embark on their journey to meet the trains the story moves at a brisker more engaging pace. The climax yes there is a climax contrary to the view of another reviewer brings moments of intense beauty and sharp sadness regret for the loss of childish innocence of as well as optimism in the hope for a better future. So this is a slowburner but persistence brings rewards. Recommended.Viewed at The Cornerhouse Manchester UK 21.02.13".

Not only is Koreeda's depiction of children subtler and more intuitive no fart jokes here but he coaxes wonderfully naturalistic performances from his child actors. Is there a director alive who does better work with kids than Koreeda? The movie really takes flight once the kids hit the road on their quest and I loved the Ozuish part where they meet an elderly couple that takes in all the children for a night.

	schema:headline " A charming and lighthearted film";
	schema:reviewBody "As a result of their parent's separation 12yearold Koichi Koki Maeda lives in Kagoshima with his mother Nene Ohtsuka and grandparents Kirin Kiki and Isao Hashizume while his younger brother Ryunosuke Oshiro Maeda lives with his intermittently employed musician father Jo Adigiri in Fukuoka. Both talk to each other daily on their cell phone but have not seen each other in six months. Acclaimed Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda's I Wish is a comedydrama about the consequences of a split family and of the children's longing to reunite them. In contrast to Nobody Knows an earlier Koreeda film about children I Wish will not break your heart. The brothers brothers in real life as well are very different in personality but both seem happy and well adjusted in spite of the difficult circumstances of their life. Ryu is fun loving and his toothless smile will warm your heart. Koichi is more serious and thoughtful but very engaging. He becomes elated when he hears that a bullet train is coming that will connect his city to his brother's. Even more exciting are the rumors that are floating around that when two trains pass each other in opposite directions your wishes will come true out of the energy the trains create. Koichi's wish is for the nearby volcano to explode so that his family will have to move and he will be reunited with his brother.The plan is to meet his brother halfway and do some serious wishing. The fun starts when they have to find creative ways to raise the money. There's also the pesky part about Koichi and his two friends leaving school in the middle of the day. For this he recruits his grandfather to provide an excuse to the school authorities and includes the school librarian who once had a similar experience of wanting to escape from school to attend a concert.The group of friends of both brothers adds a lot to the film as well. Tasuku Ryoga Hayashi wants to marry his teacher a bit of magic realism there. Makoto Seinosuke Nagayoshi wants his dog to come back to life. Megumi Kyara Uchida much to her mother's indifference wants very much to go to Tokyo and become an actress. Kanna Kanna Hashimoto wants to be a better painter and Rento Rento Isobe wants to be a faster runner. While the focus of the film are the wishes of the group of children and their trip to the trains' midpoint the film also provides a rounded portrait of all of its characters without syrup or other sweeteners though it certainly views children through a somewhat rosecolored lens.I Wish is a charming and lighthearted film though its over two hour's length can makes the goingson a bit tedious. Although the children arrive at the point of realizing that accepting what is can produce happiness the growth in reaching that point is what the film is about. Ultimately however though hoping wishing and yearning are all part of childhood some adults come to realize that a step beyond wishing and hoping and praying for something to happen is our ability to create to make things happen. Unfortunately most people have not gotten past the hoping stage.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been impressed with Koreeda's work in the past. Maborosi and After Life are two excellent deeply philosophical and moving films. Maybe based on those I had unrealistically high expectations further inflated by the DVD box boasting a dozen rave reviews  awards but I Wish failed to deliver.One hour into this 2hour movie I had to shut it off. Since I didn't watch the whole thing I can't fairly rate it but I wanted to share my unpleasant experience because I wish someone had warned me the same way. This was the first time in my life I've ever shut off a movie from sheer boredom. No boredom isn't the word. It was more a feeling of total disconnection. The scenes perhaps attempting to recreate the disconnected ADDtype thought process of little kids were so unrelated and random that I became irritated.Like my title suggests if you want to see a truly magical film about youth innocence and the notsoinnocent hunt down a film called Kikujiro 1999. More about that later. First let's talk about I Wish.Here is a breakdown of the first hour. Each scene lasts 25 minutes. At any time if you become bored skip to the last paragraph of my review.Scene 1 a boy grabs a washcloth and cleans his desk. Scene 2 The boy's mother is talking about meaningless things while the grandmother makes random gestures in the air saying I'm the wind. I'm a ghost. Etc... Scene 3 The boys walk to school and complain about the hill. Scene 4 Kids are scolded by a teacher for not doing their homework properly. Scene 5 Kids are in the hall complaining about the teacher. Scene 6 Back to the mother and grandparents talking about vegetable gardens. Scene 7 Jump to some other kids at a swimming pool. Scene 8 The boy stares blankly at his homework assignment. Scene 9 A bunch of old men talk about baking a cake for the festival. Scene 10 The boys are back in school ogling the librarian's legs. Scene 11 The boy's father wakes up strums a guitar and goes back to sleep. Scene 12 The kids gather and talk about acting.While I hesitate to call the movie bad because I didn't watch it all the way through I can definitely conclude that the first hour didn't provide enough substance to convince me to keep watching. And trust me I like slow movies 2001 Werckmeister Harmonies Hitchcock's Rope. Instead of watching I Wish I HIGHLY recommend a Japanese film called Kikujiro which this movie seemed to be imitating. However even though it is slow paced Kikujiro wastes no scenes. They all relate to each other build upon each other and eventually lead you to a powerful message by the time the film ends. The music in Kikujiro composed by the Japanese master Joe Hisaishi is also leagues above the mediocre soundtrack of I Wish another turnoff. Maybe one day I'll go back  finish the last hour of this film and revise this review if I feel differently. But all the same I'd rather spend my time watching something else.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this at the Hong Kong International Film Festival. It was so good that I watched it again when it was publicly released.What was your dream when you were small? To be a dancer? To be an actor? To marry your teacher? To run faster? To reunite with your family after your parents' separation? For 12yearold Koichi Koki Maeda his dream was for the volcano in Kagoshima to explode so he could go back to Osaka with his mom and live with his dad and younger brother Ryunosuke Oshirou Maeda. Koichi accidentally heard that miracles happened when the first north and south bound bulletin trains passed each other in Kyushu. Elated he called his younger brother in Osaka to plan for this secret rendezvous. What is appealing of the film is that it is totally carried by the children cast. Even grandpa mama teachers and strangers on the road were on their side  everyone was kind and everyone had their own dream. Grandpa was determined to try making his exclusive desert karukan. Mama missed his younger son but was too proud to get back with her husband. The teachers were all so kind to go along with the kids' kind lies. What I admire is how autonomous the children were in this movie. Not only did they have a dream but they also actually developed a plan to realize their dream Koichi and his friends looked for changes under the vending machines. When they found out it was not enough they sold their toys and comic books and even gave up their swimming tuition. Then they made a detailed itinerary complete with train schedule and maps. The important point was their parents gave them a lot of freedom to do what they want.It did not come to my mind that the two brothers are real brothers behind the screen until I saw their old pictures in the later part of the movie. No wonder there were such strong resonance between them. All the characters were lovable in the film even if they lie even if they were too trusty  because they all have dreams and they believe in them. The message is also very positive when there is dream there will be miracles and things will fall into places. Even if miracles did not happen we would be glad that we tried. A feelgood movie at the highest level. And it is exactly what Japan needs to rebuild itself from the ruins after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.".

I Wish is a bland mainstream movie that would've been unnoticed without the marketing power of Koreeda Hirokazu and its Alist actors as the supporting cast.I Wish Japanese title Kiseki Miracle is sort of a road movie about a bunch of kids going to see the new Kyuushuu Bullet Trains crossing. Majority of the film follows the lives of the two brothers One in Kagoshima the other in Fukuoka. They reunite after their parents broke up 6 months ago. One day the older brother Kouki hears the urban legend that witnesses of the new bullet trains crossing will have their wishes granted much like seeing shooting stars. The brothers and their friends begin collecting money for the trip to have their wishes granted.I did like how the bullet trains connecting to the Southwestern Japan marks a new era in the region. Perhaps that is the reason kids the next generation were the main focus of the story. It was also interesting that Tower of the Sun the symbol of Osaka Expo '70 was torn down in Kouki's dream to further signify coming of a new era.However over threequarters of the film was about getting ready for the trip and the ending seemed very rushed despite the movie spending so much time with the plot getting nowhere. While process is more important than result is a common theme in Japanese films and certainly present in this film the actual process the trip to the destination was cut too short as a series of convenient events and the preparation stage was simply introduction of each kids and their problems in the most obvious ways imaginable. Furthermore I Wish completely fails to build up for the climax didn't have a climax? making it an extremely bland movie... and this is NOT because it's one of those subtlety Japanese film in any way. Koko ni Irukoto 2001 is a subtle film Tennen Kokekko 2007 is a subtle film yet both of them and many other Japanese films of its type managed to be far more heartwarming than this generic road movie.The leading actors dubbed MaedaMaeda by the marketing team for being real brothers with the last name Maeda also happens to be homophone with forward in Japanese delivered very underwhelming performances. In fact none of the child actors' acting can be truly called acting. While this kind of performance works for the documentary style of Koreeda it is a total disaster for a movie with such tightly written script also making it feel extremely uneven with the supporting adult actors.I Wish has THE biggest waste of acting talent I have ever seen. Odagiri Joe had about 10minute screen time. Abe Hiroshi Nagasawa Masami and Natsukawa Yui... all of whom capable of leading in their own films in addition to many veteran supporting actors were reduced to cameolike 3minute appearances in this movie. Nagasawa Masami in particular was not even recognizable. With exception of Ootsuka Nene none of the cast had to be the bignames since they had nothing to work with. They were there solely for marketing purposes.Unlike Miike Takashi who also sold out to the mainstream in last year's TIFF participant 13 Assassins 2010 Koreeda Hirokazu failed to create something extraordinary for the general audience and failed to draw out the best out of his talented cast. This film had nothing that hundreds of other Japanese directors couldn't have made.I Wish is an average quality Japanese film made to glorify the new Kyuushuu Bullet Train and PR for the local businesses. Like in the movie miracle didn't happen here.".

	schema:headline " Koreeda in cruise control";
	schema:reviewBody "Preteen brothers Ryunosuke and Koichi played by reallife brothers Ohshir and Koki Maeda are forced to live apart when their separated parents end up residing in opposite ends of Kyushu. Ryunosuke broods on this while Koichi seems more at ease with the arrangements. Together the brothers hatch a plan to meet at the point where the new shinkansen trains pass each other after hearing an urban legend that the vortex created by the speed of the trains has the power to grant wishes. Meanwhile granddad tries out a new sponge cake recipe a friend of Koichi's has acting ambitions and Dad is writing a new song.The usual Koreeda themes of fractured families and kids finding magic in a flawed universe are present but by the director's own standards this is a much lighter almost sugarcoated engagement with those themes. There is the signature naturalistic engrossing performances from the child actors with Ohshir as Ryunosuke especially impressive in his conflicted caring attempts to be reunited with his brother. Koki is more of a onenote outing required to be relentlessly upbeat which he does superbly. The scene where he moves his mother to tears on the phone plays on this astutely. Forcing two young brothers to live apart for their own selfish ends could be represented in darker tones even as abuse but Koreeda keeps it all light and humorous through the simple trope of having the children be sensible and downtoearth and the adults especially the bickering parents petty and immature. The subplots involving sponge cake and acting ambitions are so removed from the main story strand that they give the film an episodic slightly meandering feel when they pop up. Ultimately they are distracting making the story busier than it needs to be. They also stretch the running time to over two hours. While some will delight in spending time with such engaging children the film felt flabby to me after the 90minute mark. The ending while admirably avoiding sentimentality takes too long to come around. Such is Koreeda's stature that a host of Alisters pack the minor roles giving them more gravitas than normal. J Odagiri as the musician father Kirin Kiki as the grandmother and Hiroshi Abe as a disciplinarian teacher ply their dayshifts admirably. There is a lot to enjoy in I Wish but lacking the damning social critique of Nobody Knows and the acerbic scalpel on family life of Still Walking this is Koreeda choosing to crowd please rather than stretch himself.".

Ryunosuke broods on this while Koichi seems more at ease with the arrangements. Together the brothers hatch a plan to meet at the point where the new shinkansen trains pass each other after hearing an urban legend that the vortex created by the speed of the trains has the power to grant wishes. Meanwhile granddad tries out a new sponge cake recipe a friend of Koichi's has acting ambitions and Dad is writing a new song.The usual Koreeda themes of fractured families and kids finding magic in a flawed universe are present but by the director's own standards this is a much lighter almost sugarcoated engagement with those themes.

The film has taken quite a while to reach this point. In a rather meandering exposition the elder of two brothers separated geographically by a family split comes to realise that his greatest wish is for them to be reunited again. He even wonders whether the smouldering volcano that dominates the town might one day burst causing the mass exodus that could end in physical relocation and reconciliation. He paints a picture of the eruption places it on a high point of his wall and gazes up at it from his bed. During the development that follows be excitedly learns that the passing of the two bullet trains on a newly constructed line joining his town and his brother's generates at their point of passing a force so powerful that anyone standing beside the track will have their wish come true  the very stuff of fairy tale here translated into a realistic contemporary setting. When both brothers gather together a few friends to make their collective wishes come true what has until then been a rather slow footed film cluttered with nonessentials suddenly springs to life. The two groups travelling from their two towns towards each other on their local line meet up at a country station. From this point there is magic in the storytelling. What I admire most about Koreeda is his honesty. In real life not every wish can come true but every so often there can come about a coincidence that can in itself be something of a miracle. Here it takes the form of the children's chance encounter with very human good fairies. the elderly couple who see in one of the girls a resemblance to a daughter whose company they no longer enjoy. This is just enough to get the children to the one place where they can be close enough to the bullet trains to scream their wishes. The rest of the films is the quietest of codas as the children return home with perhaps a wiser view of the world than when they set out.".

The main problem as also noted by another IMDb reviewer is that the film takes a very very long time to set up the plot of the kids going to see the bullet trains intersect and then when it goes into motion everything feels superrushed. At more than 2 hours in length the pacing was completely off. This film could easily have had a half hour chopped off and it wouldn't have mattered.This Japanese comingofage film reminded me a lot of Rob Reiner's Stand By Me.

The young cast were excellent and carried the story throughout leaving me envious at times and nostalgic with memories of my own childhood. The cinematography offered beautiful views of modern and rural Japan and the effect modernisation has had on the countryside an underlying theme throughout. The music was very good and at times really gives you something extra the musical sequences offer up some of the most enjoyable parts of the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Sangil Lee's Akunin Villain is a sobering look at human relationships and manages to challenge audience perceptions of good and evil. The true villain are the ones that we think.Shimizu Ryuichi portrayed by the wonderful Tsumabuki Satoshi is a shy and lonely day laborer looking for love. He aimlessly spends time corresponding with girls via telephone dating services and going on random encounters with girls looking for spending cash.His world is shattered one day when he is involved in the murder of one of his former encounters the sweetfaced Ishibashi Yoshino pretty Mistushima Hikariwho after being jilted by playboy Masuo Keijo Okada Masuo playing against typeberates and mocks the troubled loner.Yoshino's family is devastated by the death and Yoshino's father Yoshio portrayed by the brilliant Eimoto Akirain particular takes the death particularly hard vowing to find those responsible for her death.Fleeing his hometown of Nagasaki Ryuichi encounters a kindredspirit in fellow loner and plainjane Magome Mitsuyo the beautiful Fukatsu Eri who is works as a sales clerk in the neighboring town of Saga. Falling in love the couple decide to hideout in a local lighthouse but Ryuichi's increasing emotional instability and guilt soon overcomes him and endangers his newfound happiness with Mitsuyo.From the opening Psycholike sequence to Hisaichi Jo's Vertigo like music rifts it is clear that Lee wanted to make a thriller with Hitchcockian overtones. Lee's deliberate pacing of the film and story plot twists also invoke those of the master the end result is a bit too familiar to other stories about convicts on the run.While the screenplay based on Yoshida Jyuichi's popular novel is faithful to the source material the film tries a bit too hard to be social commentary and a mirror to the prejudices and bias of audiences.The true villain of the film is not Ryuichi but rather other subplot characters whose are the stereotyped heartless scum we love to despise like Masuo Keijo a selfabsorbed pretty whose vanity is vomit inducing Tsutsumishita Masuo Suzuki a smoothtalking conman and Yakuza affiliate who specializes in manipulating elderly woman out of their money Shimizu Yoriko Yo Kimiko Ryuichi's negligent mother who leaves Ryuichi in the care of his kind but elderly grandmother portrayed by the always outstanding Kiki Kirin and the Japanese Tabloid Media whose relentless coverage of the murder destroys the lives of three families. It's overly familiar territory.Yet Akunin still succeeds on the strength of Lees masterful direction and presentation. While Hula Girls is definitely the better film Lee does bring the same type of energy and human drama to this film. Cinematographer Kasamatsu Norimichi's beautifully captures the rough landscape of the South with wonderful backdrops of Nagasaki Saga and Fukoka.With his good looks and powerful presence Tsumabuki Satoshi delivers another energetic performance and portrayal of the emotionally fragile Ryuichi. The chemistry between his character and Fukamatsu Eri's Mitsyo is very convincing and the two make a wonderful odd couple. Kiki Kirin is the other standout as Ryuichi's kindly grandmother who befalls financial tragedy as the victim of a cruel conman. Eimoto Akira is also another highlight of the film. His tearful portrayal of a grieving father is very effective and tugs at the heartstrings. Okada Masuo's Keijo makes a great villain although he certainly is not one for subtle performances. His Keijo screams out douchebag.Lee's film is a very conventional film and is not overly ambitious or original but it does what it set out to do and make audience think.".

	schema:reviewBody "Villain lost out at the 2011 Japan Academy Awards on the big prizes to Confessions. While Directing Script and Best Picture went the way of the bleak hyperstylised Takako Matsu flick all four acting awards were scooped by Villain. The reason for that split is abundantly clear.Villain centres on lonely Yuichi who drives through the night and occasionally meets women through online dating sites. The forum for their meeting suggests each is as flawed as the other. When one assignation goes very badly indeed something dark in Yuichi is unleashed. He then gets a message from another female via the site and so two lifechanging events take place within seconds of each other.Villain explores complex questions of moral responsibility the hypocrisy of social condemnation and the extent of individual responsibility. The direction is workmanlike and the framing rarely gets beyond a TV aesthetic. But the script is naturalistic and offers genuine insight peaking in the father of the victim Akira Emoto revealing that hateful people are the way they are because they are too cowardly to risk caring for someone. Emoto and Kirin Kiki excel as the elder generation struggling to come to terms with the ugly turn the world has taken. Krini Kiki faced with extortion goes from bewilderment to fear to resignation all by changes of expression and never a word spoken. But it is the two young leads Eri Fukatsu and Satoshi Tsumabuki who truly excel here. Fukatsu especially shows a young woman capable of living with the emptiness inside her until meeting someone who can fill it proves too much to bear. The cathartic peak of the film is her scene of selfawareness. Tsumabaki also gets to test his range at the end but in a much more chilling and wonderfully ambiguous direction.There are good guys and bad guys here as you'd expect given the content but they are not where you expect to find them. There is a murderer but we are less convinced of our stance towards him than we are to the presspack parasites conman doctor selfabsorbed mother and shallow and narcissistic university undergrad. A bus driver strangely earns our cheers and is perhaps the only unambiguous 'good' character in the film. In a time where heinous crimes have become everyday and our ability to relate with one another seems fragmented and brutalised the causes may not always be where the lazy selfappointed moral guardians in the media and corridors of power suggest they lie. Villain is a slow build to its message a slightly meandering survey of its theme and the pacing can frustrate over the flabby 139 minutes. But it is worth sticking with for the questions it forces you to reflect on at the end and the consummate acting. One of the best films to come out of Japan this century.".

	schema:reviewBody "God I wanted to rave about this film. 'Villain' billed as a gritty thriller from Japan tells us in its plot synopsis that this is about the murder of a young woman and the search for the killer. I disagree completely. Even the genre in which its advertisers have pigeon holed it is incorrect. This is not a thriller  please don't enter the cinema expecting nerve jangling suspense. What we have here is the potential for a great film  and for the most part what we are shown is excellent.So I'll start with the positives for when 'Villain' is good it's incredible! 'Villain' does not follow the search for the killer at all  it largely follows the killer himself. There are a lot of characters in this movie and a myriad of sub plots which incidentally isn't beneficial  but more of that later. It is as I saw it a very slow patient observant film which instead of reaching for cheap thrills and jump moments is actually brave enough to step back and do something which very few films of this kind ever take the time to do it peers into the misery and loneliness of its central characters and their disillusionment concerning the immorality of the people around them. There is much cruelty in this film and sharp prickles of nervousness and fear  but it is not a nasty story.Undoubtedly the most successful plot line running through the film is luckily the one given the most attention this is the relationship that is formed between Yuichi our young murderer and Mitsuyo a lonely woman who works long hours selling suits and lodges with her sister and her sister's boyfriend. Their first meeting is embarrassing and ends horrifically  Yuichi still consumed by guilt and anger makes assumptions about Mitsuyo which he will later regret. Mitsuyo is desperate and understanding and as the film goes on we begin to understand just how much these two need each other.Intercut with this is the storyline following the family of the murdered girl. This also is incredibly successful in the way in which it shows the grief of her parents  how they must come to terms with who their daughter really was how they fight and turn on each other and finally come to sad realisations not only about themselves and their child but about the people around her and them and the corrosive cynicism and immorality of a new generation. Fair enough on paper that might sound a little pretentious but unlike the majority of trashy whodunits that Hollywood churn out on an almost weekly basis this is a film with much to say. It is deeply sad and in many scenes you can almost feel the director's sorrow and anger.Less successful are plots involving Yuichi's grandmother and how she is cruelly scammed by her 'doctor' this seems like a touch too far on the 'oh look at what a terrible society we live in' front and the ending although well meaning is miscalculated. The way in which the director chooses to bring the relationship between Yuichi and Mitsuyo to a close seems like a strange choice  it might have worked but nothing we have seen has led us to expect it and as it comes so out of the blue it is hard to believe in. It is quite frankly a bit of a cheat  a wrong footing that casts a somewhat distorted light on all the searing emotional honesty we have seen previous to that.The film however good some of the individual parts that make it up may be is ultimately flawed. Clocking in at 2 hours and 20 minutes it's about half an hour too long and although the cinematography generally is exceptional there's an inspired shot in which a flashback begins as the camera zooms into the pupil of a fish eye that will take the breath away from any film buff the editing can sometimes be a little choppy. If only they had stuck with the love story at the movie's centre and the storyline involving the family of the dead girl keeping the scenes with her father and the immoral young man that his daughter was smitten with this would undoubtedly be one of the best films of the year. As it stands 'Villain' is a good film  and despite its flaws it's definitely worth the watch. I for one liked it very much.".

It is deeply sad and in many scenes you can almost feel the director's sorrow and anger.Less successful are plots involving Yuichi's grandmother and how she is cruelly scammed by her 'doctor' this seems like a touch too far on the 'oh look at what a terrible society we live in' front and the ending although well meaning is miscalculated. The way in which the director chooses to bring the relationship between Yuichi and Mitsuyo to a close seems like a strange choice  it might have worked but nothing we have seen has led us to expect it and as it comes so out of the blue it is hard to believe in. It is quite frankly a bit of a cheat  a wrong footing that casts a somewhat distorted light on all the searing emotional honesty we have seen previous to that.The film however good some of the individual parts that make it up may be is ultimately flawed. Clocking in at 2 hours and 20 minutes it's about half an hour too long and although the cinematography generally is exceptional there's an inspired shot in which a flashback begins as the camera zooms into the pupil of a fish eye that will take the breath away from any film buff the editing can sometimes be a little choppy. If only they had stuck with the love story at the movie's centre and the storyline involving the family of the dead girl keeping the scenes with her father and the immoral young man that his daughter was smitten with this would undoubtedly be one of the best films of the year. As it stands 'Villain' is a good film  and despite its flaws it's definitely worth the watch. I for one liked it very much.";

	schema:reviewBody "There is no right or wrong. People are just driftwood. The currents decide where we go who we meet. What we do have is our choice though. It's basically yes or no that we decide. But mostly we don't choose at all. How many people take fate in there own hands? Create their own world? In Akunin the main characters live their lives until cumulated anger takes it all apart. Hurt remains. Love seems to be the healing factor but love is under a permanent siege. Then time is the healing factor.Akunin is a film that looks at the state of mind of several people connected to the murder of a girl. At first it isn't clear who murdered the girl and that makes out the suspense in the first half of the story. Then when the murderer is known the love story between the murderer and a very lonely girl begins. Even when he tells her that he killed someone she won't let go of her one glimmer of hope to get out of her dreary existence. This love story leads to catharsis for the killer. The girl is left with regrets though... and an experience. The family of the murderer and the victim is also an important part of the story. The father of the victim is trying to find out more to take revenge. He will ultimately confront the person who mistreated her before the murder took place. This is not the one who killed her but has provided the opportunity to have her killed. He's an elite and a coward with a gutter mentality. It's gratifying to see him suffer but troubling to think that he will be in a position of power. The grandmother of the killer takes all the blame and tries to survive this horrible situation. She raised the kid and finds it hard to understand why he would kill someone. She is innocent but gets most of the burden. She is just an easy person to put the blame on... because she takes the responsibility. The story is well told and beautifully shot. The actors are the creme de la creme of Japanese cinema Tsumabuki Satoshi Fukatsu Eri Emoto Akira Mitsushima Hikari and Kirin Kiki! as the granny.".

That's how engaging it was. It is one of those well directed realistic sliceoflife movies that depict flawed human beings and how their desires ambitions and inner demons combine with the forces around them to create a fateful drama that is tragic ironic or otherwise very moving. For me this kind of real life stories if done right have so much greater impact than the fantasy movies. You are indirectly but in a very powerful way experiencing a fundamental facet of this life while peeking into the souls of your fellow humans. Villain deals with the concept of good and evil love and all the intricate workings in peoples' fate it entails and the flaws and limitations in all of us. Blown away by the film I also read the book. My conclusion is that the movie is better than the book. Sang Il Lee created a wonderful work out of a novel that is good but not earthshattering.I was a bit disappointed with the final turn of events toward the end but it's still a quiet heavy impact story. And the final scene of the two protagonists gazing at the rising sun with tears in their eyes is one of the best scenes I've seen all my life. All in all it's a great experience. I recommend it to anyone especially those who love realistic moving films.".

	schema:headline " Claudia Cardinale is the soul of the film.";
	schema:reviewBody "The film starts in 1944 when the American Troops make their triumphal entry in a little Italian town during the last stages of World War II. Mara Claudia Cardinale is the belle of the town and she is tired of living between the ravages of the war but she is very strongwilled and she dreams of finding the right man to leave her one horse town. One day she meets Bebo George Chakiris a young ex partisan with a fame of a courageous killer and now a comrade of her father in the ranks of the Italian communist party. She ends up engaged to the young man who is exasperatingly spartan with words and totally lacking the social skills to courting Mara. And to make things worse the day that he is at last talking to Mara he tells her candidly that in a fit of rage after a friend of his is murdered by a sergeant he killed first the sergeant and then the sergeant's son that has nothing to do with the first killing but that he has been a witness to the violent death of his father. Bebo is very confused and his comrades organize his escape to Yugoslavia until the matter of the killings be forgotten. Mara and Bebo make love the last night before his departure to exile and she promises him to be loyal to the compromise and wait for his return. But the time is a very powerful enemy. Mara leaves her village and goes to a bigger city where she is employed as a laundry girl. He meets Stefano a worker in a printing shop and her resolve of not breaking her engagement to Bebo falters. Stefano is kind articulated helpful romantic. All the things that Bevo is not. She is now working in the printing shop with Stefano and she thinks that she deserves this opportunity to be really happy. But one fine day her father tells her that Bevo has been detained in the frontier and that the police will bring him to a court charged with double assassination. Reluctantly she agrees to meet Bevo in jail and suddenly the past rushes over her. He is not the man he used to be. He needs desperately of her and he tells her so. This is a decisive moment in the story and is very well played by the two leading actors. The film is an excellent showcase for the talented and gorgeous Claudia Cardinale. She is the very soul of this movie and if you are a fan of hers you'll not be disappointed. The movie was directed by Luigi Comencini generally associated with the comedy Italian style. In this case a post war romantic drama he was successful in capturing the mood of that time and the poignant sentimental conflict in the soul of her leading lady Claudia Cardinale.".

Dora has seen better days. She is retired now but in order to make ends meet she sets a letter writing desk at Rio's train station where she writes letters dictated to her by the illiterate and eager people who can't do the job as they want to communicate with distant family and friends through Dona Dora. In many cases as it's the case with the letter she has written for Ana she has no intention of ever sending those missives dictated to her by the unsuspecting people.Josue the small boy who witness the death of his mother is wiser for his younger years than one might suspect. He sees right through Dora as a charlatan and a con woman. When Dora takes the boy home she has no intentions of ever helping him much more than a few days. Later upon learning about the adoption agency she sells the boy to the unscrupulous people involved in the traffic of children for a thousand dollars without any problems. It's only when her friend Irene tells her the fate that Josue will encounter that Dora leaps into action.Since she can't stay home without having to return her money she takes Josue on the road. This odd couple begins the journey as complete strangers but this voyage will make them appreciate one another and even move Dora into becoming a better woman for having the courage to do the right thing. Josue also realizes that Dora in her own way has been for however short the mother he lost in the tragic accident.Fernanda Montenegro perhaps Brazil's best actress is amazing as Dona Dora. She is the whole reason for seeing the movie. Her Dora is one of the best creations in her film career. This intense performer shows an actress who fully understand who Dora is and the way she would behave in the situation. Young Vinicius Oliveira is a sweet Josue and Marilia Pera is the kind Irene who makes Dora see the monstrosity of what she was about to do.The music by Jacques Morelembaum and Antonio Pinto is an asset as it adds an atmosphere to the long journey of Dora and Josue. The interesting cinematography by Walter Carvalho shows the immensity of Brazil's interior as the odd couple go to find the little boy's father.This film is a triumph for both Walter Salles and Fernanda Montenegro.".

	schema:reviewBody "In reality there are a finite amount of interesting story lines to tell. What makes one movie telling the same storyline more worthwhile to see is a combination of creative expression in depth character development superb acting exquisite photography and believability or the ability to persuade the moviegoer to suspend disbelief.How many times have we been exposed to a retelling of Shirley Temple's Heidi where a young nonrelated child falls into the life of an old curmudgeon and teaches that curmudgeon to enjoy life andor develop morals and values? Too many times for me so I was reluctant to see this film. It would have been a shame had I not.There are many creative twists and turns along the way to keep the suspense level up in this film. The photography in Rio is OK but once out in the Brazilian countryside it is fantastic. At the end of the film there is little doubt but that the way this story turns out is how it would have had to turn out. The character development of Josue is a little weak but that of Dora is superb. And you will see a lot of films before you will see an acting performance like Fernanda Montenegro's as Dora again.This movie thankfully is not overly sentimental that would get in the way of the story it is just a great film to watch and enjoy. 9 of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "In reality there are a finite amount of interesting story lines to tell. What makes one movie telling the same storyline more worthwhile to see is a combination of creative expression in depth character development superb acting exquisite photography and believability or the ability to persuade the moviegoer to suspend disbelief.How many times have we been exposed to a retelling of Shirley Temple's Heidi where a young nonrelated child falls into the life of an old curmudgeon and teaches that curmudgeon to enjoy life andor develop morals and values? Too many times for me so I was reluctant to see this film. It would have been a shame had I not.There are many creative twists and turns along the way to keep the suspense level up in this film. The photography in Rio is OK but once out in the Brazilian countryside it is fantastic. At the end of the film there is little doubt but that the way this story turns out is how it would have had to turn out. The character development of Josue is a little weak but that of Dora is superb. And you will see a lot of films before you will see an acting performance like Fernanda Montenegro's as Dora again.This movie thankfully is not overly sentimental that would get in the way of the story it is just a great film to watch and enjoy. 9 of 10.";

	schema:headline " Masterful Montenegro Dominates Salles' CareerDefining Road Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Like Gena Rowlands in this country who ironically did a similar film 1996's Unhook the Stars Brazil's Fernanda Montenegro is a masterful actress who inhabits her characters wholly with a minimum of fuss and a maximum of personal depth. In this beautifully filmed 1998 film directed by Walter Salles she offers a superbly realistic portrayal of an aging embittered spinster named Dora who earns money by writing letters for illiterate passersby at Rio de Janeiro's Central Station. At the outset she is a petty thief who takes the letters and decides with her friend Irene which ones to post if at all. Her dull world changes when Josu the nine yearold son of a woman for whom Dora has written a letter suddenly becomes orphaned when the woman is killed by a speeding bus. The letter was to be sent to Josu's father to reunite the family. Now his plight gradually becomes Dora's concern and over the course of the film her destiny.What Salles does with great dexterity is show the gradual closeness between Dora and Josu without resorting to any obvious sentimental plot devices as neither is particularly sympathetic at the beginning and use their surly obstinate personalities as protective shells. Even though this story has an overly familiar structure Salles and screenwriters Joo Emanuel Carneiro and Marcos Bernstein bring a heavy dose of neorealism within the unfamiliar nontourist locales used. It's all reminiscent of Vittorio de Sica's and Roberto Rosellini's classic postWWII work in Italy like The Bicycle Thief and Open City. With his later film 2004's wonderful The Motorcycle Diaries and now slated to film Jack Keroauc's seminal On the Road Salles is obviously becoming known as a master of the road movie and it is easy to see why with this work. Helping considerably is the stunning cinematography of Walter Carvalho who presents vividly inhabited tableaux with each new phase of the journey from the bustle of innercity Rio to the open roads to the religious pilgrimage to the new shoeboxstyle settlement.But it is Montenegro who dominates the proceedings as she gradually develops a character who earns our sympathy economically and honestly as she makes every moment count. For example as she senses herself becoming attracted to Cesar the religious truck driver she applies a stranger's lipstick with a quivering hesitation that is almost as heartbreaking as the realization she faces moments later that he has left for good. A real shoeshine boy picked by Salles Vincius de Oliveira plays Josu with equal economy and responds to Dora's actions with realism that alternates between touching and frustrating. Smaller roles are filled expertly with Marlia Pra amusingly ebullient as Irene and Othon Bastos compellingly conflicted as Cesar. The climax comes a bit out of left field with the introduction of new characters that provide some amount of closure to Josu's fate and wrap up many of the open plot threads but the somewhat pat turn does not undermine the genuine strength of the film.The DVD provides a nice extra with Montenegro Salles and producer Arthur Cohn contributing invaluable audio commentary in English. Salles and Cohn talk about the sources of inspiration for the movie as well as the more technical aspects including the rigors of location shooting with masses of amateur actors and a minimum of art direction and constructed sets. Montenegro speaks less but like her performance makes all her comments resonate. It's interesting how variations of the film's basic plot have come up in recent years  for instance Jan Sverk's 1996 Kolya from the Czech Republic and Takeshi Kitano's 2000 Kikujiro from Japan  and this one certainly holds up well as a prototype.".

The acting the camera work the soundtrack and the beautifully written story all come together to produce just an amazing movie well worth watching that may just jerk a tear from your eye.";

Hearing the various stories and letters that the travelers dictate to Dora are touching and set the tone for the movie. In fact it is the letters that bring Josu and Dora together and initiate the journey that they embark on together to find Josu's father who he has never met. While traveling through the countryside the audience gets to enjoy shot after shot of breathtaking scenery and is really able to appreciate the beauty of Brazil. There is a subtle religious symbolism that is most noticeable in the biblical names of the characters. Young Josu is searching for and continually waiting for Jesus to come back. He has put his faith in something unseen but has no doubts about its existence. It's his childlike faith that ultimately inspires Dora to believe as well that Jesus will one day return. Although Josu is the one searching for something it is Dora who discovers more than she ever expected.".

But the old lade takes Josue home on the superficial disguise that she will help him only to later sell him to the illegal adoption racketeers for money. After being paid for her sale her friend Irene Marilia Pera informs her of what likely will be Josue's fate and knowing that she cannot right her wrong without returning the trafficker's fee she escapes her home taking Josue on the road to find his father. The 'road trip' results in a mutual respect and love between the two  Doa Dora softens having made a kind change in her life and Josue gains the feeling of love for the mother he has lost. Walter Salles understands emotion when to allow the tragedies to emerge and subside and also how to credibly introduce the change of philosophy of his actors. The cinematography by Walter Carvalho captures both the claustrophobia of Rio de Janeiro as well as the desolation of the raw uninhabited lands outside the city where the strange couple go.

Poverty reaches throughout this world and the consequences of that poverty touch everything and everyone here. Tragedy affects everyone in some way and the occasional good fortune often is temporary. The rare friendships found here are usually of the tough love variety. The primary relationship here Dora's friendship with young Josu is a tenuous one initially based on some sense of mutual obligation but rarely on genuine affection until later in the film. Other relationships both temporary and permanent seem largely based on convenience or circumstance.The environment is quite contradictory. The viewer is presented with noisy urban scenes of dirty overcrowded trains and images of cramped villages rife with poverty and desperation. Close shots and numerous indoor scenes create an overall claustrophobic feel while adding focus to the characters themselves. Wide shots of the gorgeous Brazilian countryside are also occasionally included showing the viewer that all is not dust grime and desperation. Sadly these beautiful vistas are ignored by the characters they have more urgent matters to attend to.Numerous Christian symbols pervade the movie. It is easy to see the symbolism in Josu's quest to find Jesus his father guided by a single mother figure who could potentially represent Mary. However the roles are often turned upside down as this mother is far from saintly. All the same the bitter Dora who often comes across as downright evil ultimately does the right thing which is more than can be said for many of the ostensible Christians seen in the film who eat in front of the obviously hungry ignore the sick and abandon those in desperate need. There's a lot that can be read from this movie from a religious standpoint regardless of one's beliefs.While Montenegro is perfect in her role as Dora the acting throughout is topnotch. The ending while heartbreaking makes perfect sense in context of the characters and situations. This is definitely one worth watching.".

The result is an extremely powerful drama delivered by an astonishing cast. Simon Yam and Zhang Jingchu are simply BRILLIANT...I can't even describe their performance with words. If you are a genuine cinema verite fan this cannot be missed it will be a great pity if this film is avoided because of the subject matter as it is a lot more.

	schema:headline " The unusual Derek Yee film that's a witty and entertaining comedy packed with action and romance and two irresistible leads in Tony Leung and Lau Ching Wan";
	schema:reviewBody "Derek Yee's name may be synonymous with sociallyaware crime thrillers like 'One Nite in Mongkok' 'Protg' and 'Shinjuku Incident' but the veteran writerdirector's latest work adapted from the novel by Zhang Haifan shows that the man has quite the sense of humour too. Defying expectations as well by reuniting two heavyweight dramatic actors in Tony Leung and Lau Ching Wan Yee's 'The Great Magician' plays less like the historical drama you would expect it to and more like a witty comedy packed with trickery shifting alliances and of course sleightofhands.Just with its tone alone Yee differentiates his film from Hollywood's criticallyacclaimed 'The Illusionist' to which it has been compared to never mind that both movies deal with the return of a powerful magician and his attempt to win the heart of a woman he has loved before. Leung plays that very magician Zhang Xian who comes back to 1920s Beijing to reclaim the love he left behind three years ago and rescue his mentor imprisoned by an arrogant warlord General Bully Lei Lau Ching Wan. Coincidentally his lover Liu Yin Zhou Xun has also been taken by Lei as his seventh wife though despite Lei's best efforts he has not been able to make her fall in love with him.The story is as much Zhang Xian's as it is General Lei's and the equal emphasis that Yee gives to each character affords his audience distinct but equally delightful pleasures. There is campy fun to be had with General Lei's scenes whether his six wives including an especially hardworking Third Wife played by Mainland actress Yan Ni fighting for his attention or his futile attempts at trying to win Liu Yin's heart or his condescension towards his secondincommand Butler Liu Wu Gang and Yee deliberately plays them for broad laughs. Nowhere is this more obvious than in a classic scene where General Lei is discussing power plays with fellow bickering warlords featuring cameos by director Tsui Hark and Vincent Kok the squabbling and wrangling among them simply a riotous hoot.On the other hand the scenes with Zhang Xian crackle with riveting intensity. Yee successfully keeps his audience rapt with Zhang's elaborate prestidigitation as well as his and that of his magic troupe's plot to kidnap General Lei for the release of the political prisoners Lei has kept imprisoned since assuming power. Zhang's ostensible enmity with Lei at least in the first half of the movie also makes for an equally fascinating watch as the former tries to overcome the latter's inherent suspicion for someone who has literally always something up his sleeve. And of course in the hands of two of the best male actors in Hong Kong both Zhang and Lei truly come alive.Last paired on the Johnnie Toproduced crime thriller 'The Longest Nite' for which both Leung and Lau received Best Actor nominations at the year's Hong Kong Film Awards both actors seem to be having a great time playing against their usual serious dramatic type roles. Lau gleefully hams it up in an overthetop performance that is surprisingly endearing especially for his wellmeaning but unsuccessful attempts at trying to impress Liu Yin. On the other hand Leung is charismatic as ever as the titular 'great magician' performing with poise and confidence his array of dazzling tricks. Though a trifle compared to his previous roles in 'In the Mood for Love' '2046' or 'Lust Caution' Leung is still as alluring playing the pining lover and his scenes with Zhou Xun have an understated chemistry.Yee engineers a number of twists and turns in the script he cowrote with his regular collaborators Chun TinNam and Lau HoLeung but the most rewarding one is that which changes the dynamic between Zhang and Lei and allows them to share the screen as allies. The quickwitted Zhang and the brusquer Lei makes for an oddball but eccentrically appealing combination and the second half of the film works like a charm thanks to the rapport and repartee between the two actors. Their engaging performances also anchor an otherwise frenetic final halfhour where Yee and his writers try to pack a lot of plot development into too little time which admittedly also causes the tone of the film to veer quite dangerously into farce.Mostly though Yee treads the fine line between wit and farce deftly and even if certain scenes especially those with Lau Ching Wan and Yan Ni end up in slapstick the movie is almost always smarter than what it appears to be. Yee may have been considerably influenced by the runaway success of Jiang Wen's 'Let the Bullets Fly' so while it doesn't possess the latter's ingenuity and social acuity there are similarities in the 'winkwink' comic tone of both films. Much as it draws from historical events the turbulent period after the fall of Yuan Shikai and his cronies trying to reestablish the Chinese monarchy there is little to be taken seriously here especially not when you have General Lei telling his guards to drive a tank backwards down the dustbeaten streets of Beijing because the other end of the vehicle looks nicer. It's a departure from the usual Derek Yee films for sure but one that's lighthearted witty and entertaining fun all around besides how often do you get both Tony Leung and Sean Lau at the same party? www.moviexclusive.com".

	schema:reviewBody "The anniversary of the Chinese 1911 Revolution being just behind us doesn't mean that period films of that era have come to a full stop. Writerdirector Derek Yee throws in his hat to conjure a thriller with magic at the forefront following in the footsteps of films such as The Prestige The Illusionist and Death Defying Acts which weaved mystery romance and in this case political intrigue at a time when China was dominated by warlords with foreign powers ala Imperial Japan at bay eager to gain a foothold in the Middle Kingdom through veiled diplomacy involving arms trading with selected warlords.Teaming with cowriters Chun Tin Nam and Lau Ho Leung who between them have written some of the largest Chinese blockbusters from Painted Skin to Bodyguards and Assassins The Great Magician centres around a scholar turned magician trained in Europe Chang Hsien Tony Leung Chiu Wai returning to China to score multiple goals having to rescue his mentor Liu Wanyao Paul Chunand reclaim the affections of his one time fiance Yin Zhou Xun both of whom are now under the clutches of the warlord Bully Lei Lau Ching Wan and his evil bootlicking minion Kunshan Wu Gang. Allying with revolutionaries hell bent on capturing Bully Lei Chang Hsien anchors the magic show at a newly acquired theatre and the troupe patiently waits for their bait to bite with an elaborate kidnapping scheme in place to barter and demand terms for the return of a major player in town.But things hardly ever go according to plan and here's where The Great Magician shines when both Tony Leung and Lau Ching Wan get to grace the screen together god knows when was the last time with their characters trading barbs suspicion and turning from would be adversaries to unsuspecting friends especially when the topic of true love comes up with the generalissimo seeking the magician's help to turn on the charms in order to woo his 7th wife . There's comedy romance and plenty of magical tricks on display here when the stories shifts downgear to allow Lau Chingwan to work his acting chops from going over the top in his ridiculously decorated army uniform and playing the fool as the ruthless warlord in what would be a very sly attempt at downplaying his threat to his other 7 warlord allies made up of cameos like vincent Kok and Tsui Hark to being the puppy dog desperate to win the heart of Yin.In fact his story arc is the more entertaining of the lot especially since Tony Leung's character got bogged down by politicking with his comrades whether to take down Bully Lei or otherwise compromised by Chang Hsien's growing admiration for a man who is definitely more than meets the eye. This constant guessing of intentions from all sides involving all the major multifaceted characters require steep attention to keep track of who's with whom with Survivorisque styled plotting doublecrossing and double meanings in words spoken all keeping the intrigue to the final moments of the story with both the macro sociopolitical level involving different political factions from the Japanese Manchus and current warlords and the micro personalromantic level in the love triangle centering around Yin while casting doubts as to who of the two suitors would be best for her with each showing their relative shades of grey.Eventually this focus led to subplots being unceremoniously dumped such as the much talked about 7 magical wonders that were not properly developed and copped out at the end with a relatively lengthy through effectively preachy moment in a talk about superstition and ambition. And one thing about the magic in a film  there's almost always that degree of CG thrown in that would leave even believers skeptic about how the illusions got pulled off although Tony Leung did have enough charm and charisma to make a believable Chang Hsien with enough tricks up his sleeve for street magic or elaborate illusions done on stage with the painting manipulation trick being one of my favourites through which Derek Yee effectively told the background of all the lead characters in one fall swoop of a plot device.The Great Magician is made up of moments that seemed more of an all boys club with both Lau Ching Wan and Tony Leung owning the best bits of the film through their characters. Zhou Xun's Yin had far too little to do other than to gatecrash as the object of both their affections with an acrobatic introduction that wowed and the rest of her scenes belonging more to supporting cast levels. She's capable of a lot more if only the story had an equally expanded and important role for her to play other than to be held captive and unwilling to leave until the whereabouts of her father is known and accounted for as safe.Derek Yee helmed a film that had all the ingredients to be great with an effective setup wonderful performances all round plenty of twists and turns but alas that took longer than expected to develop and rubbed some shine off its prestige not forgetting a little bit of a rip off from a comical trick already seen in The ATeam. Still the casting alone should guarantee a stellar response to it and it's recommended for its Let The Bullets Flyish liteversion feel to its plotting.".

Kisaragi is a hilarious comedy about a 1year anniversary memorial party for a deceased Dlist idol Kisaragi attended by five men from an online message board. The idol is said to have commit suicide but one of the attendees suspect someone in this group is the murderer and finger pointing begins!The entire movie consists of arguments between these five men in the same room with couple of imaginary reenactments scenes. It almost feels like watching a stage play. I don't want to spoil but this movie has one twist followed by another and the ending is pretty deep though there was an Otakudance that was really stupid. What surprises me most though is that the scriptwriter actually came up with a story as unique as this one. The setting for this movie is so crazy and so are the characters yet completely feasible in real life and their arguments are constructive. The characters' gradual developments were really entertaining for me and their love toward this Dlist idol was beautiful. All five actors played their parts flawlessly.This movie does feel like a tribute to '12 Angry Men' 1957 at first with the entire story set in a room and the men trying to solve a case using logical deduction with limited evidence and coming up with a conclusion that cannot be verified. However this movie is completely different in that every single character is somehow involved with the person in question and provides new evidence that completely changes the whole picture.This is an unique movie that really delivered. This film explores the power of the human imagination ambitions and desires. The story was so wellorganized and gives us a conclusion that makes perfect sense with the information given. I hope to see another surprising movie like this in the future.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a pretty good Japanese comedy although it doesn't put much emphasis on the humor aspect. For those that understand Japanese humor will be right at home with this one and chuckle or even laugh few times through this movie. Some Japanese people are known for really liking their idols and even collect a lot of the idols products and visit their idols fan sites a lot. But in this case the plot shows 5 fans with different personalities of a idol named Kisaragi Miki getting together for a memorial meeting. After the suicide of their idol a year later and most of this film takes place in a room with imaginations floating around suck as speculations if their idol really committed suicide and such for the 5 characters in the room. This movie wouldn't have been all that good but the way it's set up makes the film entertaining to watch and because it's crafted very well. Despite the characters hardly having any proof with their conclusions it was interesting to watch the pieces connect in a strange and yet in a way where it grabs the attention. And how those ideas fit the characters personality. This movie starts off a bit slow with the introduction of the characters and their personality. But when it the entertaining and intriguing parts kick in it's that way most of the way through. I also found it funny how the 5 characters are all dressed in suits most of the way through and it slightly reminded me of Reservoir Dogs because of the way they act amongst each other well sort of. Overall despite not having a lot of set pieces most of the way through or a lot of stuff going on this is still a intriguing movie for the most part...Especially the way it reveals the characters ideas bit by bit and as the story unfolds.7.910".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm fairly certain I saw this film in its original theatrical release in the '80smemory is dim and recently found it on DVD with considerable difficulty. The transfer to DVD is rather basic  no letterbox a bit dark and very little in the way of special features  but despite disgust at the fact that the film hasn't been digitally remastered and given more than a bargainbasement DVD presentation I love the film itself every bit as much as I did the first time I saw it.Philosophically i.e. in terms of ethical theme A Taxing Woman is one of those stories in which identifying a hero is difficult  no clear black and white only greys. Ryoko Miyamoto Nobuko and Gondo Yamazaki Tsutomu are of course the dueling protagonists but each is antiheroic something I ordinarily can't stand Gondo is the operator of a chain of Japan's ubiquitous Love Hotels where lovers go to find shortterm lodgings for their trysts who's got a complex system in place to evade Japan's horrific taxation Ryoko is a tax auditor later promoted to investigator who though admirable in her relentless dedication and competence is party to some of the most horrendous legal assaults on businesspeople imaginable. The film's moral doesn't crystallize until the final scene  Gondo states a defense of his right to pursue his own happiness via an oblique reference to kids happily playing in a park below then makes a dramatic and symbolic statement about the root meaning of outrageous taxation by slicing his finger and revealing to Ryoko his longsought hidden bank account  via an account number scrawled in his very blood. After he walks away the camera lingers on the back of Ryoko's head signifying her sudden crisis of conscience over her chosen profession.In terms of style alone A Taxing Woman is an absolute masterpiece. The mood throughout is of a delightful farce in the mold of one of Blake Edwards' Pink Panther films albeit far more subtle obviously. The music contrary to some claims here is truly unique memorable and nothing short of outstanding much like Mancini's  fleshing out the farcical catandmouse mood perfectly via two brief repeating oboe clarinet? melodies laid over a bouncy 54 time signature that reappear at key points throughout the story. The outrageous lengths to which the tax auditors and inspectors go to ferret out tax evaders is exaggerated one would hope  I've never lived in Japan for great comedic effect. This isn't a rollingintheaisles slapstick comedy and isn't intended as one but the bureaucrats' combination of ruthlessness and obsessive yet oddly endearing personal dedication to their task balanced by the businesspeople's often intricate and similarly humorous schemes to hang onto their property in the onslaught is the exaggerated core conflict that pulls you into the plot and makes the film irresistibly charming.The fairly simple plot setup in A Taxing Woman derives its incredible depth by the fact that it's almost entirely characterdriven  Miyamoto and Yamazaki are such vivid personalities and the opposing chemistry between them so potent that you will find yourself thinking about them for weeks after the fact as though they were your close personal friends. That is my psychological litmus test for a great film Do the characters stay with me long after I've seen it? A Taxing Woman succeeds in spades.A dose of gritty realism  though with a patina of humor as well  is added to the mix in the character of the violent Yakuza boss Ninagawa played by Ashida Shinsuke. That element is underscored in the real world by the fact that director Itami was attacked on the street and had his face slashed by five Yakuza in 1992 after the release of his film Minbo no Onna a.k.a. Minbo  or the Gentle Art of Japanese Extortion. He was subsequently killed when he fell from a hotel balcony an apparent but suspicious suicide that was treated by the police as a possible homicide. The world lost a great artist and A Taxing Woman remains a timeless masterpiece. We can only hope that whoever owns the rights to it will finally give it the digital translation and wide release it deserves.".

She has a face like a China doll all grown up with freckles around her eyes and a mat of thick dark hair on her head as though cut with the aid of a vegetable bowl. She is Nobuko Miyamoto wife of the late and lamented director Juzo Itami and a comedic star worthy of 'Saturday Night Live' in its better days. She plays Ryoke Hakura tireless tax inspector hot on the trail of shady tax dodger Hideki Gondo played with rakish selfindulgence by Tsutomi Yamazaki. Itami blends situation comedy with some soap opera angst Japanese and American to which he adds some ersatz actionadventure shtick the chase scene near the end with Hakura legging it after Gondo's teenage son comes to mind seasoned with a touch of the traditional theater and a little zesty porn well mixed.The result is interesting and a little jarring.I was most affected by the atmosphere of this strange and original comedy. I found myself looking at the backdrops and the sets and into the faces of all those very neat Japanese bureaucrats as I followed Ryoko Hakura's tireless pursuit of the missing yen. All that paper work and all those numbers! Interesting were the attitudes and presumptions of the characters in terms of sexuality and social status. We can see that in the modern Japan a woman must navigate her way carefully through the sea of men while a man must achieve financial success to command respect. And yet there lingers still the flavor and the swagger of the samurai as seen in the scene where Gondo cuts his finger to write a bank account number in blood.Aside from getting a little soapy at the end this is fine flick sly and amusing.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

	schema:reviewBody "This film from director Juzo Itami who also directed the excellent The Funeral is about Ryoko Itakura a cute freckle faced bowl haircut style tax investigator. She tries innovative ways to separate people from their hidden earnings which is after all her job. Nobuko Miyamoto who plays Ryoko is great always looking like the only important thing is the job. When she gets promoted to Tax Inspector her job with her new colleagues is to investigate developer Hideko Gondo played extremely well by Tsutomu Yamazaki to find out how he is cheating on his taxes. Gondo is of course shrewd about hiding his money so you're left to wonder whether they will succeed. This is essentially a comedy with a little drama and a bit of erotica not involving Ms. Miyamoto's character and it does have some heart. It falls short of The Funeral in that the character development aside from Ryoko and Gondo is a little weaker. But for its subject it is never boring and it is entertaining. I'm sure these people in Japan are as zealous as they seem in this film. Enjoy its well worth your time.".

Aside from potential confusion in that area I must say that I enjoyed the movie. Yes there is sex suspense and the mafia but don't expect it to flow like a mindless crime thriller read it isn't mindless and it isn't nonstop action. It is about a tax woman after allthe only woman amongst her coworkers. The characters are interesting and the story keeps you thinking. A smart movie with a few things to say along the way.

The film lacks the playful freeform structure of his earlier 'Tampopo' but compensates with more of the same inflated deadpan humor diluted here by a cruel but not incompatible streak of anger no doubt reflecting the director's own relationship with the Japanese IRS. Itami's heroine is a plucky incorruptible Internal Revenue agent played by his own offscreen wife involved in a hightech fastpaced game of catandmouse with a ruthless lecherous businessman trying to protect his illicit income by any means possible. Her singleminded pursuit of the Almighty Yen in the service of her government is no less compulsive than the creative taxdodges of her moneyhungry target and the exaggerated methods of detection and evasion give the film an irresistible comic energy. The tempo doesn't really take off until the second hour when the entire team of tax agents joins the chase and their obsessive devotion to duty carries the film beyond the level of absurdity transforming a colorless world of glorified accountants into an exciting romantic adventure and showing just how sharklike the lure of money can be on both sides of the law.".

Yamazaki plays the owner of a chain of love hotels and he hides his income. Miymato plays a recentlypromoted tax auditor and she is given the job of ferreting out his hidden income so that the proper tax is collected. The cat and mouse game begins.The opposing actors have a real chemistry between them and their blossoming love comes as no surprise. Since the plot involves love hotels we get some nudity and because the cops and crooks are involved there's a chase scene too. Miyamoto is shown as a tired woman with bags under her eyes but she's an attractive and worthy opponent to our tax cheat. That the crook is a complex man capable of  and worthy of  love takes the movie out of the ordinary comedy genre.If you like this comedy there's an even lighter farce with the two lead actors you might enjoy Tampopo which preceded A Taxing Woman. Tampopo involves setting up the perfect raman restaurant with chefs closely guarding their noodle recipes and other such nonsense. An amusing movie with food eroticism.A Taxing Woman was so popular they did a sequel but I liked the original so much I didn't see the sequel.".

The title Marusa became common word in Japanese culture after the release of this film. Very rare that a husband and wife team succeeds so much in the film business for so many years. The story is about government tax investigators investigating a love hotel magnate's flow of money. Both sides are ingenious in the way they hide the money and how they investigate into the trail of those money. Yakuza concubine wife and even the bank are all in it.In Japan where both corporate and personal taxes are astronomical tax avoidance is topic of most successful people. One such notable individual was Konosuke Matsushita who was the founder of Panasonic. He quoted If this was in the feudal era such tax system as Japan would have caused a massive revolt by the farmers.. People can be taxed up to 97 in Japan which makes us wonder if the people in this movie had the right to do what they were doing. Taking 97 of your income is stealing of your income and that should be deemed a crime not the ones who are protecting their share of their wealth. People in this movie no doubt were in this tax bracket.To put this in perspective in the US many high income salaried workers working in IT and other higher paying jobs are only facing around 57 tax. Even at this rate your high wages becomes only a so so income after IRS and local government gets their share Did you know that IRS is not part of the Federal Government just as the Federal Reserve ?. Much of these taxes are used or managed in incompetent ways. Taking all this into consideration I think it's perfectly justifiable for people to try and shelter their wealth.So the movie is somewhat gray in who were the real bad guys. If I were in Gondo's shoes I might have opted for novel ways to avoid tax too. The movie then turns into the real bad guys picking on the weak.".

One such notable individual was Konosuke Matsushita who was the founder of Panasonic. He quoted If this was in the feudal era such tax system as Japan would have caused a massive revolt by the farmers.. People can be taxed up to 97 in Japan which makes us wonder if the people in this movie had the right to do what they were doing. Taking 97 of your income is stealing of your income and that should be deemed a crime not the ones who are protecting their share of their wealth. People in this movie no doubt were in this tax bracket.To put this in perspective in the US many high income salaried workers working in IT and other higher paying jobs are only facing around 57 tax. Even at this rate your high wages becomes only a so so income after IRS and local government gets their share Did you know that IRS is not part of the Federal Government just as the Federal Reserve ?. Much of these taxes are used or managed in incompetent ways. Taking all this into consideration I think it's perfectly justifiable for people to try and shelter their wealth.So the movie is somewhat gray in who were the real bad guys. If I were in Gondo's shoes I might have opted for novel ways to avoid tax too. The movie then turns into the real bad guys picking on the weak.";

Maybe not but we are as close as hell...Anyway superbly directed by Monicelli once again excellent job done in Cinecitt Studios recreating the early 19th century Rome Sordi impersonates eccentric Marchese del Grillo who actually lived although not in the same period the movie depicts. Monicelli uses Del Grillo's myth and his plethora of jokes to expose the hypocrisy of Vatican and noble Romans while ideas such as freedom equality and brotherhood were slowly penetrating in the conservative Vatican State. Marchese del Grillo is surely a lifelover and an intellectual in his own way and does not feel satisfied in narrowminded 1815 Rome despite or maybe because of his wealth. He befriends frenchmen enjoys spending time with common people and doesn't mind to corrupt a whole jury just to show that justice is dead. While the first part of the movie may be just biographical and extremely funny and full of unforgettable punchlines the movie has its pivotal point when Marchese discovers he has an exact lookalike who works as a coal seller also played by Sordi outstanding in his double role in popular Rome. By trading places with the coal seller often drunk thus not really understanding what's going on Marchese gets the chance to get rid of his family the Pope Rome to join the cradle of European intellectual life Paris. Sure Alberto Sordi is by himself worth watching the movie but nevertheless Monicelli manages to show us an unusual side of History we often see or read. And by doing this he also throws in the movie an handful of unforgettable characters both fictional the coal seller Don Bastiano Ricciotto and actual Pope Pius VII a noble family such as the Del Grillos. Well in the end a must see a movie with a double value an outstanding comedy and a valid historical film.".

Many do not like these films but have to give it to the rest of us that these films are at least a break from the ordinary and in this case quite masterful. Let me freely admit that as a man the power of those legs breasts long hair and hiked skirt sex makes me excited but Cold Fish is just a cut above.";

Once again it was at FantAsia Film Festival. And once again it is a Japanese movie. On a Japanese art side note if you want to see something as deranged in the traditional theatre please see Daisuke Miura's wordless and sexmore modern society social commentary play Yume no shiro which I had the chance to see this year to a sold out crowd of 18.If you thought Shion Sono's Suicide Club was strange you are in for a big surprise. This time Sono goes deep like sonar. After having seen Cold Fish aka Tsumetai nettaigyo I was literally high on naturally occurring chemicals hormones and neurotransmitters in my body. I was happy I had laughed a lot in a very dark humour type of way and I had had my limits pushed and pushed constantly during the movie. It was a kind of a delightful posttraumatic film syndrome. I talked about it extensively with my film buff friend Serena who enjoyed it as much as me and also happened to have lived in Asia for 18 months. It was amazing to have been able to share the experience with her thought talked laughed slackjawed awed disbelieved the odd etc. and discuss it engagingly afterwards in all film and cultural aspects. After that night I have been thinking about it for almost a week. I am still not sure I have completely digested it but I am sure I have thoroughly enjoyed it and it is time I share a bit of my thoughts on it without giving too much away.Firstly this story is a rather simple and straightforward story. A normal family with normal family problems meets an eccentric and friendly couple. Everything happens realistically and we embark in this world readily. A world of exotic fish and astronomy of new hot wives and estranged daughter of averageness and contemplative rain. We find a few things strange but not much stranger than our own lives. We also enjoy the quick bonds formed between strangers the charisma and the enigma.Then things start to happen very fast and before you know it you have been there bewildered for two hours and a half. Yet everything is methodically paced all the elements are expertly placed nothing is gratuitously in your face. The movie follows a spiraling down into chaos with grace. The music suits every scene and noticeably shine on many occasions. The cinematography encompasses our imagination. The director plays with our thoughts and emotions. The actors immerse themselves in their characters while been in impossible situations. Everything is believable. This is based on a true story but this is undoubtedly truer realer suspense thriller. Michael Jackson has nothing on this. And yes some people do die in this movie. The who how and why is the question and especially the way it is deliberately delivered.The movie has depth with many metaphors and metamorphoses. It is very psychological in its vision. It cuts through the crap like a colon incision. In the end nothing is missing. Perfectionism. Perfection.Closeminded people please abstain. This movie leaves you with a beautiful ineffaceable stain.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cold Fish was a film I was really itching to see not necessarily because of its story but because of its genre Asian Extreme. After spending the last couple months dredging through the likes of Burst City Death Powder and 964 Pinocchio I was really eager to see how this type of storytelling has progressed. Also as I'm am taking part in my cities international film festival I wanted something a little dangerous in amongst the documentaries and dramas just to spice it up a bit. Needless to say I got what I wanted and perhaps a bit more than I cared to witness. Though I am a film viewer who can appreciate gore and guts and depravity this film still managed to test my boundaries of personal taste and I came out of it with mixed emotions some stuff I truly liked while others pushed the line I've drawn for myself as to what I can handle in a film. I'm thankful to find a film that challenges me thusly but now it's over I can say this too far! Cold Fish is about a recently remarried father named Shamoto who enters into business with an exuberant and strange tropical fish salesman named Murata. It isn't long before business turns sour as we find out this salesman has a penchant for killing those that defy him and enlists our protagonist as an accomplice through fear and shock. As Murata begins offing more and more people Shamoto finds himself getting pulled deeper and deeper into the crimes trapped by this crazed killers with his career and families lives at stake should he show signs of betrayal. Can Shamoto find a sensible way out of this predicament or will end up a stone cold killer like the man who claims to have found his apprentice. To watch you'll have to dive into the bloody water of Cold Fish and see what bites.OK whoa! Hey! Whoa! This movie was wild and raw and crazy. There is a lot of depravity and violence throughout the film much of it pushing the boundaries of tastefulness to the point that several audience members left half way through several other during the final act. It's not a easy film to stomach as almost immediately we're treated to a lengthy sudorape scene that is all together unsettling strange and sinister. From here things just get more insane as we're high jacked and handcuffed to the loud and brash personality of Murata. This is a great performance and a performance that could only work in this type of film and culture. Murata is wacky over the top and down right evil at times but it's so perfect the film needed a vivid and crazy character to give it a necessary black comedy element and it got that and much more. In a perfect world this guy would be nominated for a best supporting actor award sadly performances like this get lost in translation even still Murata commands and controls the film throughout it's also helpful that our lead actor isn't fleshed out or acted nearly as well. Our protagonist is missing a major component of admission of his feelings on his situation to himself or someone he trusts. It's hard to tell what goes on in the mind of Shamoto which makes all his actions quite puzzling Shamotot is too quiet for too long to find any reasoning in his actions. The other female counterparts are badly written I tried to chalk it up to a culture of docile women but that doesn't cover how objectified and stupid all of the female characters are portrayed they live for and are abused brutally by the men they claim to love. Not a single redeeming quality exists on any of these characters and even our hero is reluctant to be one which becomes even more apparent in the final gruesome act.The final act of this film had my heart racing with a hand covering my mouth to stifle the shock of one of the bloodiest and goriest endings to a film I have seen in a film. That said I loved the direction it took towards the end switching over to a gory thriller that had me wincing from its scenes. Still there are certain things I feel inclined to draw a line at. As far as cinematic depictions of rape go I can tell myself it's just a film but even still Cold Fish subjects the viewer to a brutal rape scenes that go on to long and to far into perverse and wrongful territories that it became hard to take or even justify as valid entertainment. I'm not saying don't do it but I am saying don't glorify it and I felt that may have happened here. Story and ensemble aside the film has some pretty sophisticated direction a perfectly used score and great editing the film transitions from creepy to criminal and feels so right in doing so a film that builds to a cataclysmic event seamlessly. I like the film overall but take issue with some of the content or at least the duration of it that takes place within.So while I can sit back and say wow that was a film that pushed and tested my as a viewer I think other just might not want to bother while others may run for the bathroom. The film is for hardcore horror fans and fans of extreme cinema. People who prefer their plots on the tamer side please steer clear this is the bloodiest goriest film I've seen this year or maybe even in the past few years. All I know is that by the end of it I was shocked and in awe of what I had witnessed. Truly an offensive and macabre piece of work crafted with skill yet lacking in sensibility. See it if you like your blood by the gallon.".

There is a lot of depravity and violence throughout the film much of it pushing the boundaries of tastefulness to the point that several audience members left half way through several other during the final act. It's not a easy film to stomach as almost immediately we're treated to a lengthy sudorape scene that is all together unsettling strange and sinister. From here things just get more insane as we're high jacked and handcuffed to the loud and brash personality of Murata. This is a great performance and a performance that could only work in this type of film and culture. Murata is wacky over the top and down right evil at times but it's so perfect the film needed a vivid and crazy character to give it a necessary black comedy element and it got that and much more. In a perfect world this guy would be nominated for a best supporting actor award sadly performances like this get lost in translation even still Murata commands and controls the film throughout it's also helpful that our lead actor isn't fleshed out or acted nearly as well. Our protagonist is missing a major component of admission of his feelings on his situation to himself or someone he trusts. It's hard to tell what goes on in the mind of Shamoto which makes all his actions quite puzzling Shamotot is too quiet for too long to find any reasoning in his actions. The other female counterparts are badly written I tried to chalk it up to a culture of docile women but that doesn't cover how objectified and stupid all of the female characters are portrayed they live for and are abused brutally by the men they claim to love. Not a single redeeming quality exists on any of these characters and even our hero is reluctant to be one which becomes even more apparent in the final gruesome act.The final act of this film had my heart racing with a hand covering my mouth to stifle the shock of one of the bloodiest and goriest endings to a film I have seen in a film. That said I loved the direction it took towards the end switching over to a gory thriller that had me wincing from its scenes. Still there are certain things I feel inclined to draw a line at. As far as cinematic depictions of rape go I can tell myself it's just a film but even still Cold Fish subjects the viewer to a brutal rape scenes that go on to long and to far into perverse and wrongful territories that it became hard to take or even justify as valid entertainment. I'm not saying don't do it but I am saying don't glorify it and I felt that may have happened here. Story and ensemble aside the film has some pretty sophisticated direction a perfectly used score and great editing the film transitions from creepy to criminal and feels so right in doing so a film that builds to a cataclysmic event seamlessly. I like the film overall but take issue with some of the content or at least the duration of it that takes place within.So while I can sit back and say wow that was a film that pushed and tested my as a viewer I think other just might not want to bother while others may run for the bathroom. The film is for hardcore horror fans and fans of extreme cinema. People who prefer their plots on the tamer side please steer clear this is the bloodiest goriest film I've seen this year or maybe even in the past few years. All I know is that by the end of it I was shocked and in awe of what I had witnessed. Truly an offensive and macabre piece of work crafted with skill yet lacking in sensibility. See it if you like your blood by the gallon.";

Though the movie was undeniably entertaining it entertains because of its shock factor and not exactly because it has a good plot. This is the story about two owners of aquarium shops who meet for banal circumstances. The eldest of them seems to be a nice generous man but ends up showing that he's a serial killer. The movie explores themes like rape very shocking scenes which were a little unwarranted IMO murder domination humiliation and authority. I could accept better the scenes filled with gore if gore there wasn't so gratuitous. Yet many of its bloody scenes are unnecessary to the plot to the point of making the viewer bored of seeing so much blood in one movie with no point at all. Not only that the movie is filled with plot holes. Many aspects of the movie remain unexplained at the end of it  when a certain character disappears and his family starts searching for him the family quickly gives up searching and pressuring the last man who saw him to tell them where the character is. The police in the movie has completely unrealistic behavior as well  fortunately Japanese policemen are much more prepared in real life than they are depicted in this movie!The ending which is supposed to show the moral degradation of a man who used to be dignified did not convince me. His character lacked development and the final act to me was absurdly clich and unjustified. If you want to be shocked for a little with a good amount of bloody scenes watch it. Now if you expect a good psychological drama and a wellwritten plot you'll definitely not find it in this movie.".

Doing a little research one finds that it is based on a story of serial killers albeit dog breeders instead of fish. But this isn't to say Sono likely doesn't take some liberties in his story despite or with the help of those title cards saying what the date and time is conveniently and then when it comes to the real crunch time of madness in the climax of the film there's even a stopwatch time code on the screen running even milliseconds as to the countdown of events. It's a neat trick perhaps the only real 'device' that Sono allows himself amid the naked honesty of the emotions of the characters.It's the story of a two fish store owners one the timid but 'normal' Shamoto Mitsuru Fukikoshi husband to a second wife beautiful Kagurazaka and father of a daughter who is not hers. His daughter is caught one night shoplifting but comes to the attention at the store of a loudbutseeminglycheery other fish store owner Murata Denden. He seems a little too brash to be warm but is friendly enough to invite them over to his store which has five times the fish and exotic ones than Shamoto's. The dynamic on the surface appears to be like out of one of those mob stories where the little shop clerk meets the Big Guy in town. Turns out it's not too far off an assumption.After Murata somehow convinces Shamoto's daughter to become one of his 'girls' who works at the fish store and in the midst of his 'gettinto knowyoufamily' stuff has his way with Shamoto's wife he drags the meek guy further into his darker pastime he kills people he and his wife Aiko bubbly Kurosawa who take a body from a guy who basically looks at Murata the wrong way to chop him up into little pieces and spill the parts into the nearby river. All the while Murata seems to be enjoying himself maniacally along with Aiko just as messed up and giggling as the olderricherpsychopath fishstore owner bosses around his apprentice. Shamoto doesn't know what to do. He thinks back to the Earth being 4.6 billion years old and will end in another 4.6 billion years staring at the stars in the planetarium...If you're familiar with any of Sono's previous efforts Suicide Club Love Exposure chiefly for worse and better you may know what to expect. Then again maybe not. Unlike those films Sono in a rather wise move doesn't sensationalize the violence and gore and believe you me there is plenty of it to go around since he's trying to stick to a somewhat more realistic aesthetic than the sensationalism of the epic Love Exposure. He draws out his characters more naturally and the acting is sometimes over the top certainly from Denden who chews up scenery faster than Sono can dish out lines for him to bark but not to the point where we're drawn out of the film's weirder moments... that is until the last half hour when it goes into total Gonzomode. This is especially helpful as Sono is dealing with some highly dramatic things on screen abuse rape insanity the works. It might be telling that the poster image of the film is almost identical and probably not by accident to the one for Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs also a film about a man bottling up everything inside and then it exploding when pushed to the edge. For the Japanese and for a character as emotionally bottled up as Shamoto who's only release is looking at the stars a guy like Murata is both the best and worst thing that's ever happened to him best as in he does finally open up emotionally worst in that his life will forever be in misery and madness. Cold Weather is extreme in violence and subject matter but it has strong points about human responsibility and familial dysfunction.".

	schema:headline " very scary if you live in Japan";
	schema:reviewBody "A young man on his way to a job interview is wrongly accused of groping a highschool girl on the train. He consistently denies the crime. But he is detained by the police and then charged. Most of the film consists of the numerous court sessions and I found it totally gripping all the way. The point of the film is that the Japanese justice system is totally unjust. Astonishingly 99.9 of defendants are found guilty. In Japan there are no juries  judges make the decisions themselves. This system is going to change in a few years so that for serious crimes the verdict is decided by judges and small juries together. But who knows whether this will make the system more just. Many Japanese people might feel a strong pressure to conform with authority and find the defendant guilty even if they don't think they actually are.In the film we get an excellent look at how evil the system is. For a start in Japan the police can hold anyone for ten days without charge and an extra thirteen days I think if the public prosecutor agrees. This is a very long time to be held without charge! The police repeatedly tell Teppei that if he confesses then he'll just be able to walk out of the police station  it's only groping it's just like a parking offence. But this is coercion and untrue. If he confesses he can easily be charged and convicted. So the police are not allowed to say this. And in court under oath one police officer perjures himself by denying that he ever said it.Someone in the film says that one problem with the system is that judges get regarded well and promoted if they deal with their cases quickly and find most defendants guilty. And judges are public employees civil servants so they naturally want to side with the police and the public prosecutors against some poor defendant they don't even know. But they're judges! Surely they should have enough moral fibre to put justice ahead of their personal careers.So for people living in Japan this is a very scary film. Innocence is no defence. For me the really shocking thing was that the judge and the police were outright evil. Actually the judge changes halfway through the trial. The first judge seemed like a good man  he told some students The highest responsibility of a judge is to not find innocent people guilty.What I wanted to know was what proportion of people found guilty in Japanese courts actually are guilty? Obviously there's no easy way to find this out. But perhaps a foreign lawyer or judge could read the transcripts of about a hundred Japanese criminal court cases and say whether they think the person should have been convicted assuming that guilt has to be proved beyond all reasonable doubt. I think this would be an interesting exercise though it is doubtless much more difficult than I imagine.The other thing I wanted to know was what should you do if you are arrested in Japan? If you confess the best thing that can happen is you settle out of court and if it's a groping case pay the victim about 2 million yen US20000. Or they might charge you and since you confessed you are certain to be convicted. If you don't confess you spend loads of money on lawyers spend a year of your life going through a terrible experience like Teppei in this film and then eventually get convicted anyway. What a nightmare. The director says he hopes lots of people around the world will watch this film. However this can't be because the story has relevance to people in other countries  most countries don't have such crowded trains so many men who want to grope teenage girls or such bad justice systems. Perhaps he wants to bring shame on Japan and international condemnation of its justice system. Anyway I highly recommend the official English website httpwww.soreboku.jpeng this page has disappeared use web.archive.org to find an archived copy. It is only one page but very interesting to read.Incidentally the film's official website gives the English title as I just didn't do it. But the Japanese title might be more accurately translated as I still didn't do it. When reading this out loud still should be emphasized to make the meaning clear which is maybe why they chose just instead. Soredemo boku wa yattenai is what you might say after someone talks at you for a long time telling you how bad you are for doing something and how damning the evidence against you is.".

	schema:headline " A poignant film that reflects a perfect society's imperfections";
	schema:reviewBody "I applaud the film director Masayuki Suo for having the courage to put out such a poignant film that speaks volumes about Japan's flawed justice system as a Japanese citizen. The 99.9 guilty rate is a reality not taken seriously by foreigners and many of those living in Japan. As a foreigner it was interesting to see how laws are applied within the context of such a seemingly modernized and developed country. We follow the main character Teppei who is caught at the wrong place at the wrong time as he is accused of committing a crime he did not commit. With the assumption that standing by his innocence will set him free quickly and painlessly we soon learn about the psychological battle he and those close to him have to battle.Japan's judicial system is very different from westernized systems. In Canada for instance much of our outcries and screams of injustice belies on the fact that the justice system protects criminals. More guilty people walk away or serve light sentences for crimes committed here. In Japan it is quite the opposite and it makes one ponder... how many innocent people exactly are locked up? How easy is it for individuals to take advantage on that trust and falsely accuse another person of a crime they did not commit for the purpose of a hefty outofcourt settlement? In all this film was excellent and is an important tool for us to reflect upon how justice is applied in different nations. It is exceptionally accurate in its portrayals of the daily ins and outs of those in Japanese jails. To assume that the Japanese system can't really be THAT bad is a slap in the face to all those who had to undergo that kind of psychological hardship as INNOCENT men and women. I am saying this as a fact. My boyfriend had spent close to a month in jail with accusations for a crime he did NOT commit. The prosecutor's only goal is to dig up any kind of confession by any means necessary  verbal coercion bending stories refusing or providing menial legal counsel etc. When your ultimate verdict is guilty from the start what kind of justice does an innocent individual have left? Is it right for an innocent man to say that he is guilty when he is absolutely innocent? Think about that.".

	schema:headline " when film matters";
	schema:reviewBody "Two ironies attest to critiquing this film a year after it was submitted to the 2008 Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film. First of all this year 2009 saw the Japanese feature Okuribito scoop that very award a film directed by a man whose early credits include a longrunning 'train molester' series a sniggering look at the titillation gained from the sport of groping vulnerablebutlovingit females on crowded commuter trains.The second irony is that the Japanese Supreme Court recently overturned a guilty verdict on a man convicted of such a crime citing the lack of evidence and due procedure on the part of police and prosecutors.Okuribito's debt to Suo's film is tenuous but the Supreme Court decision seems unlikely had Sore Demo not been made. The film highlights the primitive and highly dubious procedures that infest the Japanese judicial system where habeas corpus is trampled upon and a benign and apathetic populace conspire by neglect in the crushing of innocents. The scale of the molester problem is apparent to any visitor to these shores who spends time on commuter trains  Women Only carriages are now the norm at rushhour a far cry from the halcyon days previously celebrated by the director of Okuribito when 'how to molest' programmes were broadcast on mainstream TV channels. Times have changed and how.Suo elects to tell the tale as an Educational film attempting to edify his audience on the corruption of the Japanese judiciary from the base assumption that they know nothing. Such stylistics have come unstuck before in Nihon no Ichiban Kuroi Natsu where the didactic tone fails to encapsulate the social ramifications of the material it addresses. But Suo's film does not go off on that tangent presenting as its innocent in need of education a single man falsely accused in a groping incident.

Ryo Kase does excellent work as meek Teppei who puts up with his treatment initially unaware of the hole that is being dug for him. His resolve not to opt for the easy 'guilty' verdict that will secure quick release is a deep moral core by contrast lacking in the police judges fourth estate and even his own solicitor.The preaching can be a bit heavyhanded at times and the film is at least 30 minutes too long. Some dubious side characters are overdrawn such as an effeminate cellmate thrown on stage to provide giggles and more leadership for Teppei. Such small qualms aside this movie is an epochal event an important film that highlights an incredible meanspirited flaw in Japanese society that the recent Supreme Court decision may finally relegate to history.Suo's direction is spare and unobtrusive his actors given space to reveal the consequences of such judicial brutality which they do with aplomb. Brave important filmmaking that history will take note of.".

	onyx:emotionText "Two ironies attest to critiquing this film a year after it was submitted to the 2008 Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film. First of all this year 2009 saw the Japanese feature Okuribito scoop that very award a film directed by a man whose early credits include a longrunning 'train molester' series a sniggering look at the titillation gained from the sport of groping vulnerablebutlovingit females on crowded commuter trains.The second irony is that the Japanese Supreme Court recently overturned a guilty verdict on a man convicted of such a crime citing the lack of evidence and due procedure on the part of police and prosecutors.Okuribito's debt to Suo's film is tenuous but the Supreme Court decision seems unlikely had Sore Demo not been made. The film highlights the primitive and highly dubious procedures that infest the Japanese judicial system where habeas corpus is trampled upon and a benign and apathetic populace conspire by neglect in the crushing of innocents. The scale of the molester problem is apparent to any visitor to these shores who spends time on commuter trains  Women Only carriages are now the norm at rushhour a far cry from the halcyon days previously celebrated by the director of Okuribito when 'how to molest' programmes were broadcast on mainstream TV channels. Times have changed and how.Suo elects to tell the tale as an Educational film attempting to edify his audience on the corruption of the Japanese judiciary from the base assumption that they know nothing. Such stylistics have come unstuck before in Nihon no Ichiban Kuroi Natsu where the didactic tone fails to encapsulate the social ramifications of the material it addresses. But Suo's film does not go off on that tangent presenting as its innocent in need of education a single man falsely accused in a groping incident. He is a decent loved man who finds circumstances piling up against him in a country he previously naively accepted as fundamentally good. Ryo Kase does excellent work as meek Teppei who puts up with his treatment initially unaware of the hole that is being dug for him. His resolve not to opt for the easy 'guilty' verdict that will secure quick release is a deep moral core by contrast lacking in the police judges fourth estate and even his own solicitor.The preaching can be a bit heavyhanded at times and the film is at least 30 minutes too long.

	schema:reviewBody "The film follows the procedures of an unfortunate man as he is arrested indicted and tried for groping a criminal offense. Throughout the audience is confronted with moral dilemmas questions on the most basic most fundamental principles of the justice system and court procedure. Of course the basic tenet is innocent until proved guilty but how does a court truly guarantee such? How does a justice system work efficiently without error? How should the justice system correct itself when there is a mistake? And how should the defendant act when he is wrongly accused? These questions are relevant to any nation not just Japan.Despite all the considerations of a highly developed democratic system the main character Teppei still finds himself in the most unfortunate situation of being indicted for a crime he did not commit. Japan has checks and balances different from the United States or other western nations. Most innocent people are freed in the Kensatsu something similar to the prosecutor and are never indicted. In a sense there is a court involving investigation before the actual court. That a defendant before entering a court room has already been found guilty in two separate investigations renders the court a place to merely decide what the punishment should be. This is the reality of 99.9 guilty rate which includes those who plead guilty. Teppei finds himself in the unlucky situation where he actually gets indicted despite being innocent.After seeing this movie many people especially nonJapanese will get the wrong impression of the Japanese justice system which is a lot more fair than this film gives credit to. Regardless the film presents a very valuable and justified perspective of the way criminal cases are handled in Japan and forces us to contemplate the concept of courts regardless of nation.".

	schema:headline " This Gripping Film Will Make You Appreciate American Jurisprudence if you don't already";
	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes being innocent just isn't enough. That is the case of poor Teppei Ryo Kase from Letters From Iwo Jima in the Japanese legal drama I Just Didn't Do It. One morning while racing to a job interview the young man is on a particularly crowded subway train the kind you read about in Tokyo where train conductors at the station have to physically jam everyone on before the door closes.But then a fifteenyearold girl accuses Teppei of groping her and he is arrested. He says he didn't do it but his steadfast innocence means little to the police the prosecutors and eventually the entire Japanese legal system.We follow this apparently minor case at least minor in my eyes as it ends up in no less than twelve public hearings and lasts over 14 months.Immediately after he is taken into custody he is told by everyone including his public defender that it will be easier for all if he just confesses to the crime and pays a small fine. But our hero will not make that admission. I just didn't do it he says.Is this an accurate portrait of Japanese jurisprudence I have no idea but it sure feels believable and thorough.There are so many things that happen in Japanese courts from plea bargaining to bail setting to rules of discovery that are so different from our courts that many people may find this film hard to accept.But different countries have different have different legal systems and sometimes entirely different views about the societal function of the judiciary. Do courts exist to solely to dispense justice? Is their function to be punitive or to determine truth? This question is a lot harder to answer than you may think.Most people will say they can easily tell whether someone is guilty or not but as someone who was once a jury foreman for an eight day trial on attempted murder I can tell you it is not that easy or clear cut.We the jury could only consider the evidence that was presented at the trial a concept that is surprisingly difficult for some people to grasp but ultimately we ended up convicting the defendant on a lesser charge. Did we let a potential murderer get away?There is no way I can know that. What I do know is that we the jury did not feel the prosecutor presented enough evidence to warrant convicting the defendant on attempted murder. But overall I was astonished by the great thought and intelligence my fellow jurors brought to the table.Once again the strength of American democracy was evidenced by the extraordinary actions of ordinary Americans. Our legal system doesn't always work this way but it does more times than you think.That is probably why this film was so hard to watch for me because the case against Teppei is so flimsy it would never get through the front door of an American court.I Just Didn't Do It is a tribute to writerdirector Masayuki Suo especially when you consider the filmic problem he had to contend with. How to you present a long tiring and angry legal story without making a film that is long tiring and angry itself? That would seem an insurmountable problem but everything here works from the crisp cinematography to the wonderful cast to the clever screenplay. I want to also give a shout out to the excellent solo piano music score by Yoshikazu Suo. I hope it gets released here on CD as it is quite beautiful.Seeing films that look at details of another countries legal system are rare here in the USA. Which is surprising because as a culture Americans are totally in love with the law.At any given time there is almost always a legal show among the top 10 TV programs. There are dozens of afternoon TV shows like Judge Judy or The Peoples Court as well as whole 24 hour a day cable channels devoted to the law.Think about it more than 150 million of us stopped working in October 1995 just so we could watch the verdict in the OJ trial. Could this happen in any other country? Probably not.With that in mind I think I Just Didn't Do It will anger many people because of the injustice of it all. There was an audible angry gasp from the audience when the courts verdict was read out loud by the judge and our hero who we all believed was innocent was sentenced to three months in jail for groping the girl.To clarify none of us thought that the girl was making a false charge she may have very well been groped but the train was so crowded it would be difficult to accurately determine who did the groping. It all came down to her word against his and the judge believed her. Thus we are treated to the problem of just having a judge review the evidence.I'm glad the film begins with a title card stating that it is better to let ten guilty men go free than to lock up one innocent man. That is the basic rationale of our legal system and that makes me proud although there are still too many Americans who think the police won't ever arrest an innocent person. The truth is they do it all the time.Once again as with the Miranda case in this country it is because a few people stand up to the power of the state that any changes get made in the laws to make things better for all of us. So if you like legal dramas that are well acted and directed please see I Just Didn't Do It.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Suo Masayuki's latest film is quite a serious change from his lighthearted and comedic films Shall We Dance? and Shiko Funjatta Sumo Do Sumo Don't and comes at a time when Japanese society is struggling with the issues of victims rights particularly a women's right to sue for sexual harassment.Sexual harassment and molestations groping incidents on the Japanese subway and train systems has always been a problem with many women especially teens and younger women who silently tolerate the behavior for fear of societal judgment. While transit authorities have tried to address the issue  encouraging women to report incidents creating special female only subway cars during peak hours yet these problems still persist.While much advancement has been made over the years outdated attitudes of women as second class citizens are still prevalent in certain sectors of Japanese society  many Secretaries OL  Office Ladies are still expected to serve tea and attend to their male coworkers needs the Japanese media often parades women around as sex objectsvictims in various dramas TV game shows anime and films Japanese manga and adult video often show women humiliated raped molested and tortured in graphic and explicit detail.However an ever increasing number of women in Japan are now stepping forward to challenge some of the behaviors they've been exposed to and many sexuhara lawsuits have been filed against companies who have uptonow turned a blind eye.Suo's drama Soredemo Boku Wa Yatenai takes a look at the problem from a different perspective and at the same time takes a critical look at Japan's Judicial system.Kaneko Teppei Kase Ryo is your average unsuspecting and nondescript young working man salary man who finds himself in a living nightmare one morning as he makes his daily commute to work to Tokyo. Running late for a meeting Teppai jumps on a packed subway train. Young junior high school student Furukawa Toshiko Yagyu Miyu just happens to be in front of him. Trying to pull his stuck coat jacket from the train doors he brushes up against the student several times. However this seemingly innocent action soon becomes the basis of a sexuhara complaint made against him by the girl.Stopped by transit authorities he is detained and forced to spend several nights in a local jail. Police inspectors grill Teppei about the incident in an attempt to force a confession. A Public Defender assigned to him recommends that he confess to the offense as a lengthy trial would only make things worse. Stubbornly Teppei refuses to admit to the crime. Teppei's mother Motai Masako and freeterslacker best friend Tatsuo Yamamoto Kohji try in vain to retain an attorney to take his case but as one candidly admits unlike on TV dramas most don't have the experience to handle such criminal cases. They finally find a sympathetic and kindly attorney Arakawa Masayoshi the wonderful Yakusho Koji. Arakawa and his young junior legal partner Sudo Riko Seto Asaka attempt to make his case within the Japanese legal system. Teppei's mother also finds another ally in vocal legal critic Sada Mitsuru Mitsuishi Ken who himself was falsely accused of sexual harassment and is awaiting his own trial verdict.While Soredemo... may play out like your typical episode of the TV series Law  Order or other movie courtroom dramas like The Accused To Kill A Mockingbird and A Few Good Men it is a surprisingly engaging and fascinating courtroom drama that takes a simple he saidshe said story and makes it into a mesmerizing social drama and commentary that examines issues justice truth and morality. Suo's masterfully crafted and brilliant script story forces us not to take sides. Kudos should go to Suo's stellar cast who are all exceptional in their parts. Kase Ryo Letters From Iwo Jima Strawberry Shortcakes makes for a convincing everyman as Teppei. Yamamoto Kohji Fuji TV drama Hitotsu Yane No Shita is also quite good as supportive friend Tetsuo. Motai Masako Always SanChme No Yhi makes a sympathetic mother who we can only feel great sympathy and sorrow for. Yakusho Koji Shall We Dance Babel turns in another great performance as Teppei's stoic and compassionate attorney Arakawa. While some may see Seto Asaka's Death Note Chakushin Ari 2 young idealistic attorney Sudo Riko as a bit too beautiful to be a junior attorney I found the character a good example of the modern Japanese career woman young smart and earnest who is every bit an equal to her male colleagues and doesn't fit the stereotype of the meek Japanese woman. Young teen model Yagyu Miyu's performance as victimized student Furukawa is also quite effective particularly during her courtroom testimony. Mitsuishi Ken's Pacchigi! Audition legal advocate Sada character is the most interesting and I kind of wanted to find out more about his particular case but I guess his story would be enough to make for another movie.As one could judge from the title the film does not have the typical happy ending but Suo's story is less about the outcome and more about examining the process in which crimes are prosecuted in Japan. As Teppei remarks at the end the system is less about finding evidence to exonerate and prove a defendant's innocence but more about finding the evidence to support the criminal charges made by the court and police.While the story highlights the flaws of the Japanese Legal system I think Suo's primary message is one of standing by one's own moral convictions and principals and not backing down from those ideals even when faced with imprisonment. Many good people have gone to prison based on their own morals and beliefs the current situation in Tibet or based on false criminal charges the situation with Guantanamo and this movie forces us to look at what is true justice in this imperfect world.".

	onyx:emotionText "Director Suo Masayuki's latest film is quite a serious change from his lighthearted and comedic films Shall We Dance? and Shiko Funjatta Sumo Do Sumo Don't and comes at a time when Japanese society is struggling with the issues of victims rights particularly a women's right to sue for sexual harassment.Sexual harassment and molestations groping incidents on the Japanese subway and train systems has always been a problem with many women especially teens and younger women who silently tolerate the behavior for fear of societal judgment. While transit authorities have tried to address the issue  encouraging women to report incidents creating special female only subway cars during peak hours yet these problems still persist.While much advancement has been made over the years outdated attitudes of women as second class citizens are still prevalent in certain sectors of Japanese society  many Secretaries OL  Office Ladies are still expected to serve tea and attend to their male coworkers needs the Japanese media often parades women around as sex objectsvictims in various dramas TV game shows anime and films Japanese manga and adult video often show women humiliated raped molested and tortured in graphic and explicit detail.However an ever increasing number of women in Japan are now stepping forward to challenge some of the behaviors they've been exposed to and many sexuhara lawsuits have been filed against companies who have uptonow turned a blind eye.Suo's drama Soredemo Boku Wa Yatenai takes a look at the problem from a different perspective and at the same time takes a critical look at Japan's Judicial system.Kaneko Teppei Kase Ryo is your average unsuspecting and nondescript young working man salary man who finds himself in a living nightmare one morning as he makes his daily commute to work to Tokyo. Running late for a meeting Teppai jumps on a packed subway train. Young junior high school student Furukawa Toshiko Yagyu Miyu just happens to be in front of him. Trying to pull his stuck coat jacket from the train doors he brushes up against the student several times. However this seemingly innocent action soon becomes the basis of a sexuhara complaint made against him by the girl.Stopped by transit authorities he is detained and forced to spend several nights in a local jail. Police inspectors grill Teppei about the incident in an attempt to force a confession. A Public Defender assigned to him recommends that he confess to the offense as a lengthy trial would only make things worse. Stubbornly Teppei refuses to admit to the crime.

	schema:reviewBody "In May 1940 the French army had suffered an astonishingly quick defeat against the Germans. As a consequence of the armistice signed in June 1940 France was divided into two parts bordered by the socalled line of demarcation. The northern part including the entire Atlantic coast was occupied by the Germans. The south called Zone libre remained under French government. It was located at Vichy and headed by Word War I hero marchal Ptain.The film is set in Winter 1941 in a village divided by the demarcation line which coincides with a river at this section. A bridge crosses the river. Everyone who wants two pass over has to plead his legitimation to the Germans who have set up a military command on the northern side in the castle of count Damville played by Maurice Ronet. The count a captain of the defeated French army returns home from war multiply wounded. He can walk with the help of a cane only. But he is also morally damaged. He doesn't believe in the sense of resistance against the Germans any more quite in contrast to his wife the countess Jean Seberg. She is Britishborn listens every evening to the BBC broadcast to France and helps a British crew whose plane has been shot down to escape to Gibraltar.The film offers a wide crosssection of possible behavior in times of occupation. There are collaborators informers rsistance fighters patriotic veterans from World War I an upright doctor Daniel Glin and a courageous teacher Jean Yanne. The Germans are represented by an army major Reinhard Koldehoff who tries to keep his minimum standard of military decency while two Gestapo agents act without any legal or moral inhibitions. The conflict rises to a climax when a British radio operator working for the rsistance is found out and injured by the Germans. His comrades kidnap him from the hospital and he hides at the teacher's house where the countess nurses him. It turns out that the demarcation line not only cuts the French territory in two but also segregates the French population into true patriots and vile cowards. The crossing of the bridge can also symbolize the change of moral sides.This may seem a bit too clearcut. Indeed with the exception of the major the Germans are represented in the usual stereotypes. But the the French especially the count are shown with their doubts and weaknesses. And there are situations where you have to chose between one of two possibilities. A good deal of suspense is generated by the permanent danger of being found out by the Germans. So this film offers not only moral instruction but also exciting pleasure conveyed by good performances of Ronet and Seberg.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a French village in the winter of 1941 the river forms the line of demarcation between the Germanoccupied zone and the Vichy zone. Over the bridge comes a released prisoner of war Count de Damville who is physically wounded and mentally defeated. His chteau has become the headquarters of Major von Pritsch and he accepts German rule. His English wife the Countess Jean Seberg. looking more attractive than in any other film of hers I can think of has meanwhile joined the Resistance and is helping downed Allied airmen escape over the river.We meet many other inhabitants of the village mostly patriotic altruistic and brave but some selfish cowardly and traitorous. We meet various people they are smuggling over the river including an unfortunate Jewish family. We meet Resistance fighters ready to take on the Germans with guns and grenades. And we meet many of the Germans with von Pritsch and his soldiers doing their job relatively honestly while the Gestapo go about their sordid business with characteristic ruthlessness. Chabrol's black and white camera repeatedly scans the deserted carfree streets and shuttered houses of this bleak wartime winter. Human warmth where people show love and support for each other relieves the gloom but human treachery and brutality intensifies it. No laughs and little joy in the film but that was true of much of Europe at that unhappy time. Overall well worth seeing for the mounting tension the wide range of vivid characters the depiction of a small community under huge stress and the ultimate admittedly muted optimism that the suffering and sacrifices of the villagers will prove worthwhile.".

	schema:headline " An early nearly buried Chabrol film";
	schema:reviewBody "Claude Chabrol's study of a Nazi occupied French village that is right on the border of the free zone. It's a situation that brings out the best and in some cases the worst in the villagers. Count Maurice Ronet  his wife Jean Seberg have had their manor home commandeered by the Germans and are relegated to living in their carriage house. Doctor Daniel Glin fights with the resistance while Ren Havard serves as a toadie for the Nazis acting as their interpreter and supplying a lot more than just his translating talents. Each character in this film is fully fleshed out with idiosyncrasies exposed in short order. Ronet  Seberg are exceptional. Ronet gives a standout performance as an army veteran with a ravaged leg who turns out to be one of the village's gutsiest citizens. The music is by Pierre Jansen and the cinematography is by Jean Rabier who shot many of Chabrol's films.".
