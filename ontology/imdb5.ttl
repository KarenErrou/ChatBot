My favorite scenes are when the Fox sisters realize that they are sharing tea with a fan and of course Victor Fox's televised funeral. The end scene while meandering and very maudlin touched me and seemed the perfect end to an unexpected adventure. My favorite character was the daughterinlaw Maudey. What a woman!

I hadn't heard of it but Kathy Bates is always worth watching so I didn't even look at the back of the package for the rest of the credits. I got it home and was hooked from the beginning credits when the singer turns around and it is Jonathan Pryce. I fell in lurrrrrrrve with his voice years ago in Jumping Jack Flash in which he IS just a voice for most of the film. And even though he sings the most incredibly cheesy songs imaginable here if there was a soundtrack I would buy it in an instant. I enjoy movies which aren't easy to categorize. Here on IMDb it is listed as a DramaComedyMusicalThriller. That sums it up pretty well as far as I am concerned. If you need to have every little thing in a movie spelled out clearly and make perfect sense you will probably not enjoy this one. The whole movie has a slightly surrealistic feel and I loved the way it flows between reality and fantasy. It reminded me of Harry Sinclair's wonderful The Price of Milk but that wasn't a film for everybody either.Incidentally no one so far seems to have mentioned the first credited screenwriter Jocelyn Moorhouse. If you did like Unconditional Love you might want to see another film she wrote and directed called Proof with Hugo Weaving and Russell Crowe. It also was very strangeoddbeautifulmoving and hard to classify.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whether it is in drama or comedy I enjoy Kathy Bates's acting. She always presents her character in a real way that isn't a carbon copy of her last role. And in this particular movie we get to say Man what a voice that woman has! Kathy Bates is wonderfully funny in the role of Grace Beasley whose life is falling a part. Her husband has left her. Her favorite crooner Victor Fox Jonathan Pryce has been murdered while in Grace's home town of Chicago Illinois. The only moral support in her life comes from her daughterinlaw Maudey Beasley Meredith Eaton who is a little person with a big understanding heart. Maudey is married to Grace's only son Andrew. After Victor's death Grace decides to go to England. She wants to attend his funeral. She desires to be of help to his family. Instead she learns that a young gay man Dirk Simpson Rupert Everett is his family. And that Victor's blood family is trying to take everything Victor left to Dirk. Victor's sisters are played by Lynn Redgrave and Stephanie Beacham. Dirk has been hurt by Victor's death and the treatment he has received from the family. So needless to say it takes a bit for Grace to gain Dirk's trust. Once she does she talks him into going to Chicago to solve Victor's murder. The outcome of their hard work turns up surprises concerning Victor's death.Then there's all that happens to move Grace towards independence much to the dismay of husband Max Dan Aykroyd. This film is worth your time! Among the highlights of this movie are the roles played by Julie Andrews and Lynn Redgrave. What fun they added. AND getting to hear Grace Kathy Bates sing along with a surprise accompanist.".

	onyx:emotionText "Whether it is in drama or comedy I enjoy Kathy Bates's acting. She always presents her character in a real way that isn't a carbon copy of her last role. And in this particular movie we get to say Man what a voice that woman has! Kathy Bates is wonderfully funny in the role of Grace Beasley whose life is falling a part. Her husband has left her. Her favorite crooner Victor Fox Jonathan Pryce has been murdered while in Grace's home town of Chicago Illinois. The only moral support in her life comes from her daughterinlaw Maudey Beasley Meredith Eaton who is a little person with a big understanding heart. Maudey is married to Grace's only son Andrew. After Victor's death Grace decides to go to England. She wants to attend his funeral. She desires to be of help to his family. Instead she learns that a young gay man Dirk Simpson Rupert Everett is his family. And that Victor's blood family is trying to take everything Victor left to Dirk. Victor's sisters are played by Lynn Redgrave and Stephanie Beacham. Dirk has been hurt by Victor's death and the treatment he has received from the family. So needless to say it takes a bit for Grace to gain Dirk's trust. Once she does she talks him into going to Chicago to solve Victor's murder. The outcome of their hard work turns up surprises concerning Victor's death.Then there's all that happens to move Grace towards independence much to the dismay of husband Max Dan Aykroyd. This film is worth your time! Among the highlights of this movie are the roles played by Julie Andrews and Lynn Redgrave. What fun they added. AND getting to hear Grace Kathy Bates sing along with a surprise accompanist.";

	schema:reviewBody "Unconditional Love starts with great promise. As directed by P. J. Hogan the film works great up until the last third of the movie when it falls flat on its face. The screen play Mr. Hogan and Jocelyn Moorehouse wrote showed a myriad of possibilities that fizzle at the end. It appears the artistic team behind the movie had great hopes for it to play differently. The reality is this is a film that is looking in different directions in how to bring it to a resolution that ultimately fails. Don't get me wrong the movie is tremendously appealing and will resonate with a lot of its viewing public.Based on the strong cast we decided to take a look. The tremendously talented Kathy Bates is the perfect choice to play Grace Beasley the woman who finds at the beginning of the film that all is not well in her marriage. Ms. Bates is an excellent actress who deserved much better even when her character is not helped by what the authors have her do in the film.Rupert Everett is always dependable into delivering. His role as the late Victor Fox's lover is well written that is until Dirk is lured into coming to Chicago to find Victor's murderer. It's bizarre and it defies all rules of logic. Dirk doesn't look capable of hurting a fly let alone hunt down a killer with the help of Grace and her daughterinlaw the incredible funny Maudey.As played by Meredith Eaton this little woman Maudey is one of the best things in the film. She's is brash and tells it as she sees it. Peter Sarsgaard one of the best actors working in films these days has nothing to do in the picture he is totally wasted. Dan Aykroyd also has nothing to do. We see him at the beginning and at the end of the film and his Max doesn't make sense. He appears to want changes in his life and his marriage only to come back to Grace without any explanation all things forgiven.The English actors are good. Lynn Redgrave has a better opportunity as the hysterical Nola. Jonathan Pryce is seen throughout the film as a ghost singing bland songs. Julie Andrews makes a funny contribution in a couple of priceless scenes. Ultimately the television show hosted by Sally Jesse Raphael is a turn off and doesn't add anything to the movie. The best part is hearing Kathy Bates singing. What a beautiful voice she has! In fact Ms. Bates is the best excuse for staying until the end.".

The problem is that rather than straddling genres it attempts to be multiple genres. First Kathy Bates is initially starring in a typically American Lifestyle movie of a middleaged woman finding herself after her husband has a midlife crisis.Then we move to the UK where we're in a kind of Richard Curtis black comedy at one point they even sing one of the songs from Four Weddings and a Funeral. Various famous British actors pop up in the same kinds of comedic cameos that one would expect in such films. This even includes Julie Andrews twice calming down a crisis with Getting To Know You why not My Favourite Things?!Finally we return to the US where we're in a sort of Bgrade mystery thriller sort of Hallmark ChanneldoesSilenceoftheLambs. This still gets interspersed with comedic and surreal singing and dancing sequences and then we're back to screamingrunningchasing with Rupert Everett in a glittery jacket being the most histrionic of the lot.Meredith Eaton an actress of physically short stature has an interesting role. She plays Kathy Bates' daughter a woman with dwarfism but her character's condition is alternately used to make a meaningful point about prejudice and diversity and then for comedic effect. Does it work? I don't know. Sometimes it felt rather awkward.The biggest clash is really the American schmaltz versus the British black humour. I was reminded of Finding Your Feet 2017 a British comedy drama that also features a central character who is a middle aged woman suddenly dumped by her husband who has to find herself. That film has far more tragedy and poignancy than Unconditional Love and is much more bittersweet than comedic but it works much better.Perhaps being sharper simply enables a movie to be more sincere. Rupert Everett sniping about gay persecution is far more sympathetic and poignant than Kathy Bates schmaltzing about unconditional love and human relations.Unconditional Love ends with a huge singing performance that includes Barry Manilow. That possibly tells you more about this movie than anything else could.".

It has a huge potential to be a cultmovie with the presences of Julie Andrews and Barry Manilow themselves and a joke with Nicolas Roeg's masterpiece 'Don't Look Now' when Maudey wears a red raincoat in Chicago's underground part of the city. The beginning of the movie with Jonathan Price singing 'Hitchcock Railway' is wonderful. I have repeated it four consecutive times. The cast has a magnificent performance highlighting Kathy Bates Jonathan Price Rupert Everett and the unknown Meredith Eaton. Indeed this movie is an excellent entertainment. My vote is eight.Title Brazil 'Amor a Toda Prova' 'Love to the Proof'".

It has a huge potential to be a cultmovie with the presences of Julie Andrews and Barry Manilow themselves and a joke with Nicolas Roeg's masterpiece 'Don't Look Now' when Maudey wears a red raincoat in Chicago's underground part of the city. The beginning of the movie with Jonathan Price singing 'Hitchcock Railway' is wonderful. I have repeated it four consecutive times. The cast has a magnificent performance highlighting Kathy Bates Jonathan Price Rupert Everett and the unknown Meredith Eaton. Indeed this movie is an excellent entertainment. My vote is eight.Title Brazil 'Amor a Toda Prova' 'Love to the Proof'";

One comment on this board said I can't believe I never heard of this movie  it couldn't have been a straight to video release. While I was watching this movie I actually wondered how it could have possibly made it past audience screening and into the theaters in the first place.I really enjoyed the first 30 minutes of this movie. It actually seemed as if we were going somewhere with the arc of the story  a woman loses favorite singer and husband at the same time and sets off for England to find meaning in her life. Fair enough. She meets the relatives of the singer and finds that he wasn't exactly as advertised. We have some really funny revelations and interactions at this point. But then they Kathy Bates and Vincent Fox's lover Rupert Everret travel back to the US to try and hunt down the killer and suddenly it turns into an amatuerish whodunit. The bulk of the characters' actions especially by Everret at the end of the movie are completely out of character from what we have learned about them in the first half of the film. It's as if someone stopped editing the script at the midway part of the film and the whole thing goes flying around with arms waving until we have a completely unconvincing and painful Barry ManilowSally Jesse Rafael singalong at the end. It took more than 2 hours to eventually tell us that well I don't really know what it told us. Maybe there's a message here but it was clouded by all of the incredibly superfluous action in the last 45 minutes.I see that the working title of this movie was Who Shot Victor Fox which suggests a grossly different kind of movie than does Unconditional Love. That's perfect  even the writers didn't appear to know what the point of this movie was.".

Costa Rica is not like Mexico Argentina or Brazil that actually produce motion pictures. It would be of irrational thinking that Costa Rica in the next 20 years produces something like Iarritu's Amores Perros or Meirrelle's Cidade de Deus. Those Latin American movies there are lots of other example just to make my point I mention this twoare art works due to long processes conducted by those countries that actually incentive movie production and support financially logistically promotionally domestic movie production. Costa Rica is far from that but with Caribe things started going on a different direction it seemed like everyone wanted it to triumph a little counterproductive since it was too overrated but at least support was shown to a local production and that is quite a start to generate more movies form Costa Rica. A 5 is fairly decent for Caribe maybe a 4 but then again I'm Costa Rican so 5 is fine.".

The rest of the acting by the other characters in this movie is nothing special and the characters are all kind of cartoonish. The film has a good look to it though despite being shot in a brief five weeks. It had some elements of a good story but wasn't enough to be a film. A madeforTV movie maybe but not a theatrical release. The final scene was a little far fetched concerning everything that went on in the film.

The story never loses the right pacing and it shows a very good blending of the human figure with its natural environment which is a character in itself. The acting is great and for that we owe credit to the emerging director Esteban Ramrez. Furthermore the characters are very well written and masterfully complex so once you become familiarized with them you can perceive their feelings without them even saying anything. I can't say I liked this picture because of all the hype it generatedin Costa Rica but rather because of the way it really achieves in showing an interesting portrait of what happens when you interfere with the equilibrium of people's lives. Hopefully Caribe will establish a reference for future projects in Costa Rica as it is a very good example of nice movie making.".

Although their authors brag about it as a the biggest movie in Costa Rica ever made and their actors even dare to say that they didn't get an Oscar Nomination due to it's political relevance with oil he he right ...Well this is all a lie. This movie was supposedly based on a book written by Carlos Salazar Herrera about a love triangle super clich soap operalike subject and it secondary story is about an oil problem on the Atlantic Coast of Costa Rica with an American oil company who wanted to explore oil deposits on the region but at the end it never was approved by the government. Now it may have some nice footage about the beaches but that's it nothing bigger than that... it is all in the camera. Most of the actors are lousy except for two or three. The rest lack of sense of what acting means they overact most of the time. The story is completely common and clich worthy of a cheap Mexican soap opera as I said.. because the crew advertised it as a protest movie about oil but 80 of the movie is based on a stupid love triangle. The script is nothing impressing it is very simple and the dialogs are not very thought. It has also got some editing problem on a couple of scene changes... but besides that is pretty decent. The director did an alright job I mean he is not like an Oliver Stonebut he did his job with the resources he had handy. I would like to question him why instead of using Costarican actor he spent most of the money on foreign ones.. I mean after all they bragged about being an 100 Costarican Production... that's what you at least expect. Final the end is is not well done there are flaws and details that don't match or are useless. Besides being the most elaborated movie in all Costarican history I think it's mediocre. You can make way more interesting and better pictures with less cash. Never heard of Pi? Anyway if you are curious about Costa Rican or Central American movies this one will do but you are definitively not missing anything.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have just seen Caribe a couple of nights ago at the annual Vistas Film Festival held here in Dallas and I must express my discontent. The opening caption tries to tell us that the film is a portrayal of the current invasion of South American countries Costa Rica in this particular case by North American oil companies and the negative effects both economic and environmental of this invasion. The main characters are a married couple who live a simple pleasant life maintaining a banana farm. Right away a woman arrives and announces that she is the wife's halfsister. I'm not going to go into specifics about this and to be honest I don't feel that I'm spoiling anything with this review yet another key point is that the company to whom they distribute their bananas drops them due to budget demands in a poor economy. So the main conflict that is supposed to be addressed in the movie is of the husband between the rock and the hard place trying to preserve his livelihood. On one hand the Reynolds oil company has basically offered him employment and financial compensation basically a bribe to use his public influence to encourage the town to allow the company to begin drilling in their town compromising his standing with the community and the community itself. On the other hand he is faced with being dead broke but on the side of his community protesting the drilling. Given the length of this film it would have been ample time to explore the issues just described but it just doesn't happen and I'll tell you why. You will notice that this film has won a couple of awards so far one for direction and an audience award. I'm not going to pick apart Esteban's direction it wasn't bad or good enough for me to be all that passionate about writing anything. The audience award was at a film festival in Spain and for it to gain an audience award I'd have to imagine that Spanish people just dig soap operas. In fact Central and South America dig soap operas as well I know that much. I assume that Esteban was either aiming to take advantage of this or that he himself digs soap operas because that is what unfolds over the course of this film so much to the point that it kicks the whole oil company plot to the side almost as if they imagined halfway through the making of this film that it had become tiresome because it seems like at least three of the supporting characters have had their back story and character development severely compromised to make room for more sex and crying scenes. The only true villain in the movie is one of these three characters and at no point do you actually get to find out who the hell he is. It's almost as if they cut his screen time just short of taking him out of the film entirely. From time to time they toy with the oil against community plot but these are digressions at best. What we see a lot more of are scenes of passion jealousy betrayal adultery etc. These themes saturate the story to such a degree that the oil company 'sub'plot becomes unnecessary. It's almost as if this was a stunt to legitimize a romantic drama soap opera by throwing in a little political relevance. Nevertheless the film gets so caught up in the romance that it ultimately doesn't know what to do with itself resulting in an ending so tacked on that you're left wondering what it is that you've been waiting around for or if there was ever anything to begin with. Here are two things that I think could have saved this movie either cut out the halfsister or cut out the oil company. It's obvious which one of the two they were more interested in. Or perhaps if Caribe had been an hour longer they could have worked this all out. Regardless I'd have been fine with a straightup soap opera and I think that the subject of oil companies exploiting foreign nations is in dire need of addressing by the film community. Caribe is both and neither. These two angles could have worked together had they been balanced accordingly but with a romantic plot running around in circles and taking up almost twice as much time as necessary at the expense of an oil plot that's barely been established to begin with both sides suffer. Best of all the romance plot is never even resolved. I'd like to say I'd watch this movie again to see what I've missed but I have a strong feeling that I already know what it is. As far as I'm concerned it wouldn't matter if I saw Caribe ten more times. I've missed it because it is simply not there.".

	schema:headline " MOM is truly a great American horror movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "The first time I viewed the film Mom I was 12. It was one of the least expected horror films that I thought I would actually like having been raised on the classics of the genre including the 80's slasher and grindhouse fare that I loved. Late one night this film Mom was coming on Cinemax and I began watching it wondering how dull and boring it would be. About a couple minutes in this creepy guy turns into a creature and bites into this woman's stomach. I was like Hell Yeah. As film goes  A kindly old woman named Emily Dwyer takes in the creepy guy who by this time is seen as a blind man looking for a room to rent as the new tennant. The Tennant's name is Nester and he is rarely around during the night having the need to go out to eat. As Emily decides to get more familiar with Nester by making him dinner one night Nester attacks the nice old lady. After that Emily's son Clay Dwyer a nightly Newsreporter begins to worry about his Mother because he hasn't spoken to her in a few days. He soon comes to find out that Emily has become a flesheating ghoul and Nester is the cause of it all. After killing Nester in a fiery blaze Clay is left to watch over his Mom keeping her locked and barred in her room like a prisoner starving her to the point of madness. Emily eventually escapses and goes on a rampage killing an undercover cop. When Clay's pregnant wife tries to visit and check on Emily Emily tries to attack and consume the flesh of her and her unborn child only to be thwarted by Clay and a few cops. After taking care of the cops by killing and eating part of them she knocks Clay out a window where he appears to be dead. The motherly instinct takes over and the beastly looking Emily screams into the night a cry of horror because she believes she has killed her son. The climax is the most saddening of any I have ever witnessed in any horror film this is in part that Emily comes down the stairs her face covered in blood crying. She enters the kitchen as Clay comes crawling weakly and painfully through the front door. As Clay prepares to go up the steps a sudden explosion comes from the kitchen. Clay scrambles for the kitchen where he comes to find the charred body of Emily lying on the floor who waves an it's alright now frail and burnt arm as another explosion consumes her body in flames. Clay screams as he watches the exploison take his mother's life. Clay turns to see his wife who has been untouched by the monstrous Emily helping him to get out of the house. Then Credits.This film is in a totally different league of it's own. It's fresh and takes the whole zombiewerewolfvampire tale to a whole new level. It remains one of my favorite horror films because of it's uniqueness. My favorite line in the movie comes when Clay is starving his Mother who has been locked in her room and hasn't eaten in days. As she claws and bangs on the door she screams in a guttural demonic voice Let me out of here!!! I'm your MotherGoddamit!!!! I have never seen anything else like it. If you've never seen this monsterpiece I highly recommend it... it will make you think twice before pissing off your Mom.".

A pickup truck pulls up  an angry Father chucks his slutty daughter Virginia Monroe Claudia Christian out  leaves her there but she isn't alone as the shadowy figure of Nestor Duvalier Brion James watches her from a short distance. Virginia tries to make conversation but as she grinds a cigarette out under her Leopard print thigh high high heeled boots Nestor grabs her by her throat  drags her off into the darkness. Nestor then rips her top open turns into a monster  starts to eat her innards. Virginia is the latest victim of a serial killer that have Lieutenant Carlo Hendrix Art Evans  the LAPD baffled or at least that's the message a local TV news reporter named Clay Dwyer Mark Thomas MIller is telling his viewers. Clay is happily living with his pregnant girlfriend Alice Mary Beth McDonough  therefore his Mother Emily Jeanne Bates has a spare room going which she decides to rent out to the 'blind' dark sunglass wearing Nestor. Unfortunately for Emily she accidentally knocks Nestor's sunglasses off which reveal he has strange coloured eyes Nestor then turns into a monster again  bites Emily turning her into a flesheating monster just like himself. Nestor takes Emily out to train her they find a suitable homeless bum Rory VanSaint murder him  eat his guts but Emily's son Clay has witnessed the whole thing  he must choose between doing what is right  his love for his Mother who now just happens to be a grotesque bloodsucking  flesheating monster!Edited written  directed by Patrick Rand I thought Mom was a pretty awful film. Looking at some of the other comments on the IMDb  the genre listing it has been given it appears many seem to think that Mom is a comedy horror. Well I can tell you now that I didn't see any comedic elements in Mom at all because there aren't any unless they are very subtle. The only thing that I can assume is that people see comedy in the actual situation which Mom presents that being an old lady turning into a flesheating monster  the predictable problems  emotional angst that it causes to her son who finds out. There are no jokes apart from naming a prostitute Beverly Hills Stella Stevens slapstick humour or anything even remotely funny in the film itself  as far as I could see it is played totally straight throughout it's 90 minute run time. So with there being no comedy in Mom that must mean there's lots of horror right? Wrong Mom sucks  is painfully slow to watch especially after the first thirty odd minutes which consist of Nestor turning into a monster a couple of times biting Emily showing her how to hunt for food  Clay finding out. Until this point Mom was moving at a fairly decent pace had some OK special makeup effects  had me interested unfortunately Mom runs for another hour which is basically the emotional crap suffered by Emily's Son the eventual breakdown of his marriage  him being torn between love for his Mother  the fact that she's a flesheating monster. This part of the film is incredibly slow boring  as dull as dishwater even having the nerve to resort to a clichd rolereversal scenario where Clay tells his Mom to go to her room  stay there locking the door behind her telling her off  putting bars over her window so she can't escape her room. Mom's script totally ignores the monsters origins  ask's us to just accept that this thing exists without giving a single reason why we should no matter how silly an explanation might have been I think some background to the monster would have helped. Technically Mom is bland  cheap looking although I can't say it's badly made it's very average stuff all the way with nothing that particularly impresses or anything with which I could make fun of to pass the time. The special makeup effect's on the monster are OK but their used in very quick flashes blink  you'll miss them. Don't be fooled by any fancy video box artwork like I was the monster is only in it three times maximum  all of those are within the pacey first thirty minutes. There isn't much gore either a severed arm some brief intestine eating a burnt body  a drill in someone's arm is all we get. The acting is OK but please Mr. Brion James what is that dodgy accent all about!? At least James had the good sense to know he was in crap  sensibly opted to be killed off early on in the proceedings everyone else are nobodies expect the black Lieutenant who was also a black police officer in Fright Night 1985 but you may recognise him from Die Hard 2 1990 he made Mom  Die Hard 2 in the same year?! Talk about opposite ends of the spectrum! Overall there is nothing by which I can really recommend Mom as a horror film  it certainly isn't a comedy as far as I'm concerned. Very poor very disappointing  yet again I've been conned by fancy videobox artwork with lots of stills of cool looking monsters. Definitely one to avoid.".

James then goes on to ingratiate himself to the titular mother who invites him into her home only for him to attack her and turn her into a werewolf. The dark humor around a sweet old lady with blood dripping down her matronly house dresses is pretty funny and does go a long way but the rest of the film isn't all that clever or interesting.

The main character's struggles triumphs set backs hopes and desires are all so honestly shown that you wonder if he is acting at all. The film has a low budget and is obviously made without the glitz and glamour afforded to most Hollywood productions but that minimalism is what allows this film to transcend the stereotypical SciFi labeling and become a true drama. However calling this film solely a drama would take away from the fantastic postapocalyptic plot.

The connection between the beginning and end was a little spacey that is I had a hard time understanding the distances between the hotel and the opening sequence.

Le Dernier Combat has no dialogues but it does have sound. It was also shot in black and white and the total budget was 500000! It is very refreshing to see a good story well told on a shoe string budget. This was Eric Serra's first film score Luc Besson's first feature but everything came together thanks to Luc Besson's genius and creativity. Excellent acting on everyone's part especially Jean Boise Jean Reno and Pierre Jolivet helped a great deal. It seems that French actors just can't do a bad job... The film is about a loner in the middle of nowhere who somehow befriends another loner in that weird post apocalyptic world. Their interaction even if non verbal as well as the drama around them kept me glued to the screen. The occasional funny moments were great and contrasted well with the dark story. I consider this to be Bessons second best film after Nikita. One can only wish that all the low budget independent films turn out to be this good.".

As I did in Atlantis the other rare Besson movie I bought by the internet I saw this one at home with all the lights of my dvd and tv turned off and marveled at the experience. I didn't know what to expect. Wickedly I always searched some kind of disappointment when I saw a film by Luc Besson I never had seen before. But it never came. This movie was no exception. From the start I understood that the person who makes a film like this as a first feature is destined to be big in the future. And so it happened. This won several prizes including the highest prize in a film festival of my country which makes me proud and it shows that this movie is preparating many bigger things. This may be the most original afterthewar movie I have ever seen beating Mad Max in originality and artistic feel. There is not a problem with this movie its cinematography is genius as well the perfomances of the actors. I am also proud to say that finally I saw all the movies of my favorite director and have a copy of almost all of them Joan of Arc is still waiting for me to buy the DVD. This movie is most of all a work of style and dedication which makes clear why Luc Besson is a director of my choice good taste beautiful framing excellent use of music I also marveled at Eric Serra's first featurelength score and the promise of great achievements. Gaumont did well to bet in its boygenius the man who would later change the face of France's and Europe's relation between movies and their public. Let's hope Besson starts working in a new directorial project. I will be the first to cheer it. Until then I recommend this movie to anyone who need to learn a lesson of how good movies are made with little money. I loved the atmosphere of the movie which by its black and white cinematography suggests us an even more depressed view of the world after the holocaust. This movie works by the sheer magic of movies showing in pictures what we can't explain by words. And I'm with all the people who wrote comments to this movie and liked it good choice! A great hug to everyone who sees this and feels that a little of their lives were changed.".

Le Dernier Combat is saddled with a laughably inappropriate early 80's jazzdisco score that practically drains any dramatic impact from scenes in which it appears. Jaunty dance music isn't quite what one expects in a scene of tragic human suffering. Even Tangerine Dream would be preferable to Eric Serra's work on this film.Le Dernier Combat is a film worth seeing if only so that Luc Besson fans can get an early glimpse of the Besson style in its infancy and there is no denying the appeal of its performances and the impressive fact of how visually dynamic the film is given its rockbottom budget.

	schema:reviewBody "Luc Besson's first work is also his first foray in science fiction a genre to which he will return fourteen years later with the Fifth Element 1997. Even if this film was strongly influenced by Hollywood cinema it is still highly enjoyable. Back in 1983 le Dernier Combat reveals Besson's own approach of science fiction. He takes back a threadbare topic and his efforts are discernible to make a stylish work. Shot in widescreen and black and white a disaster has destroyed virtually all the population from earth and we will never know what was this disaster and why men can't talk any more. Some barbarian hordes were formed. In parallel a man Pierre Jolivet lives on his own and arrives in an unrecognizable Paris where he is received by a doctor Jean Bouise.There are no words in Besson's work. The characters' actions and the progression of the events go through looks and gestures. Although the starting point and the backdrop are unnerving the film has never the look of a despondent one. It seems that the man and the doctor try to reproduce gestures and actions linked to mankind before the disaster. The film opens with the man having sex with an inflatable doll. Later the doctor tries to make him speak through a machine and he is a painter in his spare time. It's all the more intriguing as these paintings seem to come from the prehistoric times. Following this reasoning one could argue that the bearded giant Jean Reno embodies evil and a threat to the efforts deployed by the man and the doctor to regain what finally made a human being. Ditto for the gang of baddies at the beginning of the film.The pessimistic whiff that such a film could convey isn't really at the fore and gives way to a glimmer of hope. Personally the film could have gained with no music at all except the one the man can hear with his cassette recorder. Luc Besson was to make better and still entrancing films like this one he also boosted Pierre Jolivet's career as a director who will leave a patchy work behind him in the future Force Majeure 1989 Simple Mortel 1991 ma Petite Entreprise 1999 or Filles Uniques 2003.".

It seems that the man and the doctor try to reproduce gestures and actions linked to mankind before the disaster. The film opens with the man having sex with an inflatable doll. Later the doctor tries to make him speak through a machine and he is a painter in his spare time. It's all the more intriguing as these paintings seem to come from the prehistoric times. Following this reasoning one could argue that the bearded giant Jean Reno embodies evil and a threat to the efforts deployed by the man and the doctor to regain what finally made a human being. Ditto for the gang of baddies at the beginning of the film.The pessimistic whiff that such a film could convey isn't really at the fore and gives way to a glimmer of hope. Personally the film could have gained with no music at all except the one the man can hear with his cassette recorder. Luc Besson was to make better and still entrancing films like this one he also boosted Pierre Jolivet's career as a director who will leave a patchy work behind him in the future Force Majeure 1989 Simple Mortel 1991 ma Petite Entreprise 1999 or Filles Uniques 2003.";

It plodded along at a pretty slow deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes but there wasn't really anything in it that I was terribly interested inthere's an intriguing and mysterious feud between Jean Reno's character and an old man but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the wanderings of the main character whom I didn't know much about and couldn't really relate to at the time.  He wanders around alone for the most part he doesn't meet anyone I imagine the director was trying to depict the loneliness of the human condition in this postapocalyptic world or something which is all good but I still wish he'd trimmed it down from 40 minutes to 15 because it can get incredibly boring.But after those 40 minutes things start to get very interesting.  I guess I won't really say more than that because I don't want to spoil anything.  So if you've seen the first 1530 minutes of this movie and are thinking about turning it off like I was just stick with itit gets a lot better.One of the most interesting things I found about this movie was the fact that it had no dialogue whatsoever which really made me have to think about what was happening how characters were feeling and what their motivations were why things were how they were in this postapocalyptic world all of which gives the story a lot of room for audience interpretation.  And it's amazing how much more satisfying a movie is when the actors aren't telling you exactly what's going on.".

	schema:reviewBody "Le Dernier CombatThe Last Battle 1983 is a film that fits perfectly into the post Blade Runnerpost Mad Max subgenre of the postapocalyptic art drama. Other examples of this style of filmmaking can be found in Sogo Ishii's Burst City 1982 Lars von Trier's The Element of Crime 1984 and Shinya Tsukamoto's Tetsuo The Iron Man 1988.As with those particular films The Last Battle is notable for its visual design and emphasis on style over narrative with director Luc Besson creating a dark dank and depressing world of decay and dilapidation. The visual iconography is filled with rich if somewhat slightly superficial detail including distressed buildings burnt out cars and gangs of feral warriors stalking the shadows. This is combined with a plot that attempts to encapsulate the metaphorical struggle of every day existence with plenty of room left over for Besson to create a lingering sense of atmosphere and some inventive visual setpieces. The film would be one of the first to introduce the concept of cinemadulook a brief cinematic resurgence in French cinema that saw a younger generation of filmmakers looking back to the days of the Nouvelle Vague and combining that sense of playful experimentation with elements of early 80's pop culture. Besson would come to define this movement with his second feature the chic and silly crime thriller Subway 1985 by creating an archetypical cinemadulook experience to stand alongside Diva 1981 by Jean Jacques Beineix and Mauvais Sang 1986 by Leos Carax.In keeping with the highstylehighconcept approach The Last Battle is notable for its overall cinematic design. Firstly the film is almost wordless with no real dialog interaction only sounds and a smattering of very 80's synth music care of Besson's regular musical collaborator Eric Serra. Secondly the film is shot in black and white cinemascope with much juxtaposition between the expressionistic use of light and shadow with the almost cinemavrit like use of actual physical production design and occasionally handheld cinematography. It gives us a slight hint of the direction that Besson would follow with later films such as his trio of 90's masterworks La Femme Nikita 1990 LonThe Professional 1994 and The Fifth Element 1997 but really this could still be seen something of an anomaly within his vast body of work.The basic plot of the film can be explained in a single line with the story exploring the devastation of civilization and issues of brutality hostility and isolation. Here French pop singer Pierre Jolivet stars as the main character identified cryptically as The Man again emphasising the antiplotantinarrative approach of the film who is menaced by The Brute played by Besson regular Jean Reno on his journey through a world filled with people rendered mute by an unknown incident. It is the titular battle of both cunning and wits between Jolivet and Reno that becomes the backbone of the film with the two characters testing each other both mentally and physically in a series of prolonged visual setpieces. Alongside these scenes we get some surreal moments and elements of broad humour that owes a small debt to the silent comedy of Chaplin and Keaton and a lot of exploration of the visual geography of the world that Besson creates quite spectacularly on an incredibly limited budget. Ultimately the film points towards the futility of conflict in an era when people should be banding together in order to fight the bigger issues but this is all perhaps secondary to the world that is created and the incredibly visual way in which Besson chooses to interpret it. Obviously having no dialog and only a few minutes worth of dated electronic music combined with the vague characterisations and emphasis on style over content The Last Battle certainly won't be a film for everyone. Even if you're already familiar with Besson's trio of 90's classics or even lesser known cult films such as The Big Blue 1988 and AngelA 2005 the look and feel of The Last Battle might still be something of a shock to the system.The film at times feels like an action film but really when we think about it there isn't all that much depicted in the way of conventional action. Likewise the film could be approached as something of an art film but again it seems almost too shallow or too playful to appeal to that particular crowd. So who will this film appeal to? I guess the target audience is anyone with an open mind and a real love for all forms of cinema regardless of genre or convention. Besson fans too might appreciate seeing his first feature film which really strays from the sunkissed cool of Subway and The Big Blue or the ultrachic violence of Nikita and Leon. It isn't something that I would call a classic but for me personally the film has a lot to recommend chiefly that great sense of style and the use of black and white widescreen cinematography which really makes it stand out. Likewise the performances from the two leads Jolivet and Reno as well as Jean Bouise as an aging doctor who looks after Jolivet's nameless drifter are all commendable drawing on subtlety and a strong sense of physicality to compensate for the lack of dialog and plot.The Last Battle may not be a masterpiece and may very well prove to be something that alienates many potential viewers however having said that one really has to admire Besson's scope and vision especially at this early stage in his career. Thematic similarities noted by other critics to films such as Claude Feraldo's Themroc 1973 as well as the aforementioned Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior 1982 are constant as is the vague feeling of nostalgia when you consider how much subsequent music videos and TV commercials have borrowed from this particular style. So a real cult film for anyone with a keen appreciation for underground artcinema postapocalyptic scifi or the work of Luc Besson.".

So a real cult film for anyone with a keen appreciation for underground artcinema postapocalyptic scifi or the work of Luc Besson.";

If you absolutely must see everything Luc Besson has directed then by all means see this movie. But if you are looking for a wellmade Besson then search somewhere else. Luc Besson has directed such classics as Nikita Leon Subway and Le Grand Bleu all of which are infinitely more entertaining and watchable than this postmodernistic French cinema which was likely praised at the time of its release as the future of film.

I don't think Besson despite what is evident in most of his later work meant it as any kind of cool gimmick. I think what makes it so clever and so effective is the fact that with no other way of communicating everyone has to read each other based on intuition and conveying of emotion no matter how slight. Though I wasn't glued to the screen upon reflection I see that it's a very touching and sensitive perspective on human nature. Its vehicle is the stylized scifi movie. Part of its reflection on the nature of the human world is that each of its humans is not necessarily played as a perfect human being The hero a lone drifter in the desolate new world is taken in by an older recluse who refuses to keep his part of an exchange of food between him and a husky brutish character played by Jean Reno and so Reno tries everything he can predominantly using brute force to get what he wants. So the antagonist is right though not a good person and the protagonist and his sympathetic foil are both wrong though they are both good people.It's shot in a clear and crisp black and white edited and captured in a lowkey yet spry and smallscale approach and its actors are very real. How can they not be? They like their characters are left with the bare necessities of communication. This is one of the few truly good films that Luc Besson has written. His earlier work is almost always better than the fluff he churns out now.".

	schema:reviewBody "If there's one thing the history of cinema has repeatedly pressed upon us whether consciously or not it is that physical beauty is superior. From an evolutionary standpoint this makes perfect sense as it's how we're programmed. We are made to want the best genes for our children in order to ensure that the species continues as fit and healthy as possible and physical appearance is the most immediate indicator of genetics.We see this again in Luc Bessons 'Le Dernier Combat' The Last Battle. Pierre Jolivet is our nameless hero identified in the credits as 'The Man'. Our storyline is a Hollywood standard. Our hero meets up with the nameless antagonist identified in the credits as 'The Brute' played by Jean Reno more on him in a moment. Our hero loses the battle sustaining injuries but managing to escape. He stumbles upon a third nameless character identified in the credits as 'The Doctor' and the pair strike up an unlikely friendship while our hero is nursed back to health. Friend of the hero who is intelligent and sophisticated but genetically inferior is killed leaving our hero to face the final showdown which he naturally wins leaving him to rule over all while getting the girl. As a French film rather than Hollywood it's not always quite as simple as this there are many subtleties and allegories and all the characters have a kind of comic existentialism.Our hero Jolivet is lithe and toned with deep dark searching eyes. In his pursuit of the woman he is refined presenting a neatlywrapped gift combing his hair. Our villain Reno by contrast is shown at one stage in his underpants hairy chest with his belly hanging over. He wears glasses an indicator of his genetic inferiority and to further force home the impression he is given facial scarring.Our third character Bouise is the intelligent sophisticate. Painting cooking enjoying fine wine repelling Reno with the wry humour of his multiple defensive barriers. He is older weaker. He has glasses and funny teeth but is apparently aware of his inferior position and doesn't attempt to impose himself on the woman. His role is the facilitator for our hero. When he removes our hero's blindfold indicating he can now visit the woman without restriction our facilitator is symbolically sacrificing himself for the hero which is made literal a few moments later when he is killed by falling debris on the way.As a Hollywood film this wouldn't have been anything special. But it's French so we instead have many delights in store. Reno's character is not given the Hollywood villain treatment despite his apparently psychopathic singleminded desire to destroy everyone in sight. The roles are instead enforced in more comedic ways Jolivet takes a double hob to attach to his gas canister but when Reno repels him and is sitting at his symbolic throne not only does the gas run out but the tape recorder which has worked perfectly up until now suddenly decides to break down not by running out of batteries but by inexplicably chewing up the cassette. Reno is such a wonderful and likable actor that we are never entirely against him. Similarly our hero is never entirely heroic in the film's first scene we are shown him having sex with a blowup doll only to be foiled in his designs by a deflation.Another thing Hollywood would and could never have done is to make an entire film containing only one word of dialogue a broken bon.... jour which is spoken by Bouise and Jolivet to each other. We are dropped into a postapocalyptic world where nothing is explained which is as it should be I feel least of all why people are now incapable of speech except in that one moment under the influence of some inhalation. Bouise is the symbol of the old world civilisation empathy artistry. Our hero is shocked to hear speech but desperately wants to join the jubilation when he is finally able to is quite touching. In his spare time our hero appears to enjoy listening to music and looking at paintings compared to Reno's pursuit of practicing smashing bottles with a sword. While our hero dines on cooked fillets Reno is seen stuffing raw fish into a bubble gum dispenser. The aforementioned scene of gas and tape recorder failure can be viewed as Reno's attempt to join that civilised world but his brute ignorance leads to inevitable failure he cannot be what he isn't. He is the barbarian trying to assume the role of King.The remaining world is one of shattered buildings and improvised weaponry apparently engulfed by a vast desert. Our hero is seen early on with a lance with a knife tied to the end of it and some padded 'armour'. Reno has similar padded protection and wanders around with a sword. Even Bouise comes out to attack Reno at the gate wielding an improvised crossbow. All this medieval weaponry lends itself neatly to Bouise painting our hero in the guise of a knight on the wall. Later Bouise adds the female figure is this to suggest the chivalric approach he would like our hero to take with the woman? If so the wrapped gift suggests that it has worked leading to Bouise's approval with the blindfold removal. In the end he doesn't get the girl as Reno has gotten to her first and apparently killed her in his insane villainy.We are then given a final scene of our hero flying back to his original location. Here he kills the leader and assumes command dressed no longer as the noble knight but now in the clothes reflecting the position he will take here... the white suit of a gangster. But he's still our noble hero because he immediately frees the bizarre gimplike water slave and is rewarded by being lead to a woman. They both smile and we have our happy ending.".

There's tragedy romance more tragedy and an uplifting ending sort of. The great acting by Gere and Lane helps disguise the fact that this film isn't really about much. Every single bit of the plot is predictable. I rolled my eyes a lot at some of the events. Also it's far too shortI didn't believe the romance between Gere and Lane for a second. If comes out of nowhere and moves VERY quickly. Still the movie does work. The inn itself is absolutely gorgeous and I was in tears by the end along with most of the audience. So it's a predictable but gorgeous movie with some wonderful acting. It doesn't deserve all the criticism it's getting. I give it a 7.".

	schema:reviewBody "Oh my friend was just dying to see Nights in Rodanthe I'm convinced she is absolutely in love with Richard Gere not to mention she just loves romantic movies so Richard Gere and romance? It's a no brainer she just had to see this movie guess who she begged to go with her? Yeah me I didn't really want to see it though it looked too sappy for my tastes but we got to see it for free so I figured to just go ahead and give it a fair chance. Well we saw it today it was a little better than I expected which is saying plenty. After seeing the movie Unfaithful I really wasn't into the whole Diane and Richard being back together on screen but for some reason they made this story more enjoyable. Even though it was predictable it was a sweet movie I hate the sappy movies despite it's sappiness that I normally resent it's still a nice movie and was just a breath of fresh air due to the recent movies that we're getting that are either thrillers comedies or action.Adrienne Willis is a divorced mother of two who's exhusband is begging to come back home after a nasty affair he had with one of her friends. She's debating on it since her children want them back together and she feels it should be that way. But when her friend leaves her to run her house on the beach that she rents out to people Adrienne meets Paul Flanner a doctor who has had a rough year after loosing a patient on a routine surgery he's staying in the house with Adrienne. Loosing themselves has been so hard but when they're together they find themselves once again and bring life back into their world realizing it's OK to be in love once more.Nights in Rodanthe is a nice movie to watch... more so I'd say for either a rental or a matine I was more impressed with it than I thought I would be but it does get predictable which I hate to say I've just been seeing nothing but predictable films lately. Maybe I should start writing scripts if this is all it takes I could write a number one movie maybe wish me luck. But back onto the movie it has decent acting and does give you watery eyes. It's a nice movie to watch gives you a little smile and reminds you of the sweeter things in life. Richard and Diane made this movie enjoyable and were lovely onscreen together it's worth the watch.610".

Usually good screenplays are the result of a talented writer who is in full control of hisher property understand his material and is a good writer. Then there is a little important part often neglected by the marketing geniuses that so often lack creativity and vision a good actor.A good actor can make the difference between a mediocre halfcooked try and a fully realized film that might not be an important and relevant movie but one that contributes to its genre and might eventually become a classic of its type. We get very few romantic comedies and we are people who are starved for them. Buried in the sexy humor of Sex in the City is the romantic yet stormy relationship of Big and Carrie and people flocked to Mamma Mia because it had some romance skillfully played by Streep and Brossnam. It could have a silly musical but it did touch us because it was played with intensity and conviction. Nights offers us more of it with the amazing talents of a woman who does magnificent work in romantic films Ms. Diane Lane. Ever since her days as a child actor we could appreciate how her talent combined with her appreciative soul allowed us to see into the hearts of the story's protagonists. A few years back she teamed up with Mr. Gere giving us a tormented romantic and sexy performance as the wife who is not too sure of her actions' consequences in Unfaithful work that should have garnered her at least an Academy Award. She is back doing more formidable work in this romantic gem as a woman who has given up on her romantic prospects and suddenly she realizes there might be another chance around the corner.Ms. Lane makes this film pulsate with intelligence and passion. Her facial expressions communicate volumes about the different emotions her character undergoes. We can read frustrations yearnings desperation anger hope loss and a range that is way out reach for a lot of the marketable types that Hollywood constantly push down our throats. Here is a mature performer who has the gift to project real emotions and allows us to connect with the material in such a way that we are moved as we become part of the experience.Ms. Lane is such a triumphant joy to watch as she goes through transformations from the first scenes of the film until the very end. Her discoveries become ours as we celebrate with her the power of hope and love. She is able to bring back the unsurpassed joy of a person in love much like a teenager does and yet she never lets you think of her character as silly or irresponsible. Her eyes are expressive gems that can move even the cynical in the audience. She is one of the stars that can do wonders with just one look. In her the classic feel of those grand movies of yesterday are back. Her work recalls the passionate and intelligent work of Hepburn Davis Garson women who played everyday types and made them memorable because they created complete characters.We admire those superb actresses who recreate real life legends and are rewarded for it. Half their work is done by the mystique of the figures they impersonate however as much as anyone might make you think it is the roles such as Lane's in this movie that are a more impressive achievement because they are created from scratch given a personal imprint and are able achieve heights without any previous theatrical material support such as plays and the background of a famous legend whose life is paid tribute on the silver screen. Lane's character is one woman whose experiences could be any of us. She represents our dreams and emotions with much quality class and just the right amount of sentiment. It is quite a remarkable achievement and we should be grateful that we are still able to find such a remarkable performance nowadays.There are a few adjectives I could use to pay tribute to her work but I can only say that in my humble opinion every single frame of her work in this film is testament to one of the greatest performances ever put on celluloid by a living performer. Thank you Ms. Lane.".

Move over The Notebook there's a new kid in town.Where to begin. Well how about the depth of this relationship? I think we can safely sum up the foundation of this undying love in the following steps1. Exchange polite pleasantries over a bite of salad. 2. Drink copious amounts of Jack Daniels play basketball with old food 3. Provide glib unsolicited advice to each other on your crappy lives. 4. Make love during a hurricane. 5. Devote your lives to each other via airmail.I noticed George C Wolfe has The Hairball and United Kanye West Project in his dossier. Would stick to your genre be too harsh? Enough said. I think most would agree that the best love stories make us cry or laugh or even hope. But the reason they are able to do that is that somewhere during the storyline we really start to care about the characters we're watching on screen. To make us care there must be time spent developing these characters...their lives their history why we're watching them now. Wolfe didn't seem to want to waste our time with such trivialities and instead provided us with all of about 8 minutes of background information on each character before hurling us into an intense oneonone interaction between two ACTORS we've all come to adore but two CHARACTERS we could care less about.For one brief tender moment when Richard Gere exclaims that he doesn't expect her to listen to his problems and she invites him for dinner the viewer sees a glimmer  a beginning  of something special between these two characters. But instead of being allowed to enjoy the anticipation and playfulness of what happens next in the wonderful unpredictable joy that is courtship we are instead pushed headlong into a love affair between two people we hardly know.Let's face it. We have all heard cheesy one liners in Romantic films. But the reason we cut some slack to Bogart in Casablanca or Nicholson in Something's Gotta Give is because our hearts and minds have been lifted to the heavens and dragged through the mud and back again with these characters and by the time they deliver the line we're so deeply involved with their plight we don't even notice the cheese factor. Since Wolfe doesn't allow us to love or even like our protagonists all we're left with a fromage sandwich and a few snickers in the audience.Wolfe takes the old Hollywood director's phrase cut to the chase much too literally here. As each stilted one liner is delivered by our cast the viewer is left wondering if director Wolfe is subliminally saying to the audience c'mon. it's a Richard Gere romance. just buy in.It is as a result of this stunning lack of character  or relationship  development that the film's climax fails miserably to tug at our hearts. When Gere's character dies I felt like I was watching the news about someone I didn't know passing away. Or watching a ladies' eights rowing race during the beijing olympics. Just. Didn't. Care.Epic. Fail.".

	schema:reviewBody "I like all different types of movies so this is not a bash on romantic movies from a guy who only likes The Matrix etc etc.I just felt it was a lousy movie. I don't feel that there was enough buildup of the characters to fall in love. They were there for a few days and while dealing with a severe hurricane and major issues in each of their lives Richard Gere and Diane Lane fall hopelessly and helplessly in love?? It isn't realistic. This movie didn't make me buy into it and feel it emotionally and that is something that you look for in a good plot. Some emotional connection. If someone can relate to them falling in love that quickly without any true substance  than so be it. You are neither right or wrong. Different strokes for different folks.Another very unbelievable component to the movie was Diane Lane's very rude teenage daughter becoming nice and sympathetic at the end of the movie. Does a teenage girl who is that miserable and aggravated at her mother for not getting back with her cheating husband going to just have a switch turn on and be nice? This movie in a nutshell had some big names but to me was a major disappointment.".

	onyx:emotionText "I like all different types of movies so this is not a bash on romantic movies from a guy who only likes The Matrix etc etc.I just felt it was a lousy movie. I don't feel that there was enough buildup of the characters to fall in love. They were there for a few days and while dealing with a severe hurricane and major issues in each of their lives Richard Gere and Diane Lane fall hopelessly and helplessly in love?? It isn't realistic. This movie didn't make me buy into it and feel it emotionally and that is something that you look for in a good plot. Some emotional connection. If someone can relate to them falling in love that quickly without any true substance  than so be it. You are neither right or wrong. Different strokes for different folks.Another very unbelievable component to the movie was Diane Lane's very rude teenage daughter becoming nice and sympathetic at the end of the movie. Does a teenage girl who is that miserable and aggravated at her mother for not getting back with her cheating husband going to just have a switch turn on and be nice? This movie in a nutshell had some big names but to me was a major disappointment.";

The movie is short and they do not really ever make us feel that these people were truly in love and felt like sole mates. Even if the movie did not go in the same direction as the book at least they could of made the romance between these two characters feel more intense.

Indeed you cannot find anything except what you expect to find romanticism and drama together through dialogues and situations which you may have heard in thousands of romancedramas.However I think some merits are to be found first the idea of portraying a love story between two mature people which is not so common or easy nowadays. Richard Gere and Diane Lane have a very good longterm chemistry going back to The Cotton club and later to Unfaithful and they are still able to convey a deep communion of soul showing with honesty how love can always give a chance and how past experiences can shape passion and attraction in such a tender and delicate way. The two actors are very good in the way they manage not to turn romantic scenes and sometimes a melodramatic script into a pathetic hodgepodge but always keeping a strong dignity of interpretation and a very professional attitude.I generally praise American nonpretentious pictures however simple and unoriginal they prove goodquality products thanks to a high professional attitude and a talented cast which can often make a difference. In this case also the enchanting settings the music at the right moments the good photography help make the final product credible and emotionally involving".

	schema:reviewBody "Discovering something the journey is so much more fun so much more surreal and so much more emotionally galvanizing than when you finally arrive at the destination. Falling in love is perhaps one of the most opulent feelings in the world. You feel energized invigorated and alive. You simply want to be around that person every second of the day and the very sound of their voice gets you excited and sometimes aroused. Love and all the physical and emotional side effects that comes with it is pure bliss. Where it goes from here is anyone's guess but when you first begin your journey together nothing can compare to it.Diane Lane and Richard Gere play Adrienne Willis and Dr. Paul Flanner two emotionally scarred middle aged individuals. In this film they are about to embark on that mystical journey together where love and the discovery of the emotions along the way will help save them.Lane is dealing with the typical jerk of an exhusband who still loves her but in her eyes only because the woman he cheated with no longer wants him. As hurt as she was by him as much as she really dislikes him there is a part of her that is actually considering taking him back. Why you might ask? Because in life and love sometimes comfort supersedes intelligence. Yes this man cheated on her but she has kids with him she built a life with him and there is obviously still a connection with him.Richard Gere plays a recently divorced husband and estranged father. He also just lost a patient as she reacted negatively to the anesthetic. He is now being sued by her family and he is guilt ridden but hardened about the issue. This is what brings him to Rodanthe in the first place. Although his lawyer told him not to he felt compelled to visit the woman's husband in Rodanthe. He stays at the Inn that Adrienne is taking care of. Soon they find comfort in each other's arms and discover that they too can have a second chance in life.By now this sounds like a simple idea for a film and although it might be something you've seen or read about before Gere and Lane simply own the film. Diane Lane lights the screen up with her smile. Her eyes twinkle in the dark and the life she brings to the character is one worth watching. Gere's character is a little different. He is more hardened and bitter. It takes Adrienne's pain and her passion to bring him out of his shell. He blames quietly himself for his strained relationship with his son and her secretly blames himself for the death of the patient. On the outside he tells anyone who will listen that it is not his fault and that she was a 1 in 50000 casualty. But deep down it eats away at him. They find each other at a time when both need someone to listen.Gere and Lane have been in film together before but this is the first time they play lovers. They were married in Unfaithful but here they play lovers finding each other when the people in their lives have abandoned them. They have a spark and a real chemistry. I would love to see more films with them together. In fact I'd love to see more films with Diane Lane but that's a story for another time.Nights in Rodanthe is a very passionate and romantic film about two lost souls who save each other. They both become better people they both become stronger people. I enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it to anyone not just couples. This is a film about redemption absolution and second chances.It will also ask you to bring some hankies.810".

Nights in Rodanthe got abysmal reviews but I decided to check it out anyway Richard Gere Diane Lane a gorgeous setting and a romance all attracted me.The movie is so awful its awfulness overwhelms even Gere's manly sexiness and Lane's sweet perkiness. This movie is to romance what motion sickness is to gourmet food.The setting is a house whose pillars are set in the Atlantic Ocean. It goes without saying that this is um slightly risky. It's painfully obvious that the interior shots are NOT the interior of the oceanbathed exterior. Since the house is a main character this disconnect and complete lack of verisimilitude is painfully obvious. The owner of the house an artist and descendant of slaves would not store her family's heirlooms and her artwork in a house that's about to fall into the Atlantic Ocean.The interior is the hell for tchotchke collectors. In place of a coherent plot or sincere dialogue or romantic heat the filmmakers offer us a set crammed to the gills with beaded curtains and retro kitchenware and embroidered pillowcases and carved little boxes and colorful vases I thought I was walking around inside Martha Stewart's brain. The combination of shoddy filmmaking shallow script and overstuffed house communicates loud and clear the makers of this film decided that romance film fans are such chuckleheads that they will accept vapid cinematic drek as long as there is a garage sale collectible in every shot.The film is so rushed it feels more like a filmed rehearsal than an actual film. Gere and Lane appear to have been given no direction no coherent scheme within which they could connect. The special effects of a hurricane and a mudslide are so ostentatiously subpar they could have been replaced with lights turned on and off by a stagehand and a shaken piece of tin roof material for sound. I don't know how a filmmaker could have directed a scene starring one of the sexiest men alive Richard Gere cute and adorable Diane Lane a house half in the Atlantic Ocean and a hurricane and created not one candlepower of fear romance sexual tension or meteorological oomph.Shame on the makers of this film for having so much contempt for their audience and for their material.There's one great scene and performance in this movie though. Scott Glenn who was himself a poor Appalachian lad plays a poor Southern man whose wife died. Glenn's performance is genuine and powerful. That he managed to work that performance into this movie is testimony to his power as an actor. I have a new respect for him. The rest of the film should have been better if only to honor Scott Glenn's incredibly fine turn.".

What upsets me the most is that this could have been the best romantic film since The Notebook but it just wasn't there.

Paul is able to go to his patient's husband and say he's sorry she died and is ready to make up with his son in South America. And Adrienne gets the courage to set out on her own and not take her cheating husband back. After Paul leaves Adrienne is shown reading many letters from him and the two seem to be destined to be together when he returns. Of course things don't always work out.Lane and Gere aren't given much to work with. Also the cinematography should have been much better since this is set along the Outer Banks. We could have had some pretty sunsets and beach walks. But even that was not done well.FINAL VERDICT If you want a chick flick that has a sad ending then this is for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "The chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane Lane periodically appears credible in the new film Nights in Rodanthe adapted from Nicholas Sparks' novel but the practicality and reasoning behind nearly all of their actions are unnatural. Borrowing heavily from the epic romance of 1980's Best Picture winner Out of Africa Nights in Rodanthe fails to develop sense behind a spontaneous love affair between two unlikely candidates.Dr. Paul Flanner Richard Gere feels responsible for the death of a surgery patient who died from a reaction to anesthesia. In his guilt he agrees to drive to an isolated beach house in Rodanthe North Carolina to meet with the husband Scott Glenn who has filed a lawsuit against the dispirited doctor. The trip is on the way to his ultimate destination however which is to retrieve his son James Franco from Equador where he has moved to in order to distance himself from his disappointment with his father and his poor handling of the fated operation.Meanwhile Adrienne Willis Diane Lane is struggling with her two young children who are in turn coping with their parent's recent divorce. Adrienne wants nothing to do with her unfaithful husband Jack Christopher Meloni who foments discontent with their children to coerce their mother into allowing him back. When Jack takes the kids for a spell Adrienne travels to Rodanthe to look after a luxurious inn for her best friend  the same vacation house that Dr. Flanner has booked  leaving the two of them alone to slowly craft a lifechanging romance.The love story that builds from so many tragedies simply isn't convincing. The unmindful unlucky doctor meets with the distraught mother in a terrifying hurricane  what a perfect setting for romance. Even looking past the uninspired genesis Nights in Rodanthe doesn't utilize its surprisingly short running time to develop the characters. The audience doesn't have time to become involved in their sudden affair and the rest of their wooing takes place through voiceovers as they narrate love letters back and forth.It's like a sillier version of Out of Africa but with more crying less sweeping romance and more modernized problems for the lovers to contend with. Not as lengthy and noticeably missing a moving soundtrack and score the story has been done repeatedly especially from Nicholas Sparks as a motion picture it is simply not ambitious enough to create a worthwhile moviegoing experience.Mike Massie".

I remembered 'A Walk To Remember' 'The Notebook' 'Message In A Bottle'. Starring Richard Gere  Diane Lane it's a story about a housewife who just divorced her husband and was helping out her best friend's beach inn when Dr Paul arrived at the inn to stay for 5 days. Both had problems they had to face and through these few days they found each other and fell in love. Unfortunately they had to part but continued to keep in touch the oldfashioned way until... Initially I was a bit reluctant to even make an effort to go to this movie but since it's Nicholas Sparks I thought I should give it a chance cos Im no fan of Richard Gere nor Diane Lane. The story is pretty pacey w enough sexual tension between the 2 stars I love the beach inn though just what I would picture my dream beach house to be except not that huge and prob not that close to the sea. Surprisingly I found myself mesmerized by Richard Gere especially his eyes so I would say for his age he's still very charming. This story is a tearjerker and even tho Im resistant to tearing it did squeeze out a few drops and certain parts of the movie so it's still good. Overall a soso movie that makes you feel like you want to be in love again the oldfashioned way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Starting off with a promising first act with lightly interesting and developed characters rich in personality and with hints of chemistry between the two love interests Nights in Rodanthe is a train wreck if ever there was on giving meaning to the fact that even if a movie starts out well it can end up in the gutter pretty quickly. Following on from the opening the movie then resorts to cheap melodramatic contrivances and demeans both its characters and performers by negating their roles to mere romantic plot devices used to set up act three's ridiculously sappy ending. The middle act which finds both characters slowly falling for each other isn't all that bad and while it does get irksome towards the end even such a closing would have saved the movie from being a complete disaster. Nevertheless with a few moments of interest usually inherent in the performance of Gere Nights in Rodanthe isn't without its positives but you certainly have to do a lot of looking to find them.As a romantic drama Nights tries to do one thing and one thing only and that is to make with the mushy. Director George C. Wolfe in his big screen debut here opts to take this to an extreme however and even goes to the point of rejecting any focus at all on characters past the halfway mark. After this point Nights in Rodanthe turns into a holiday from hell. Mawkish banal and overly pretentious both Wolfe and the writers here adopt a tone of whimsy lightheadedness that often clashes with the story's much more serious at least that's what it tries to be subplot involving a death caused by one of these characters. What's more annoying is that the movie's earlier sequences which although clearly unfocused and seemingly directionless at least had some humanity present in its central figures these earlier moments of promise are forgotten. After forty minutes or so all that's left for Wolfe to do is to drag on the romance as far as he can to the point where we're no longer watching real people fall in love we're simply watching an outline for a romance movie. Character A and Character B going through the motions Yawn. Haven't we done this before? To be fair both performers try and make the best of their undoubtedly tricky situation. Throughout there are moments of genuine chemistry between both Gere and Lane and while the romance isn't exactly palpable enough to sustain much interest past the halfway mark they at least keep the thing going as best as they can. Essentially however you get the feeling that both would rather be somewhere else in between these instances of chemistry are scenes which fail to deliver any emotion whatsoever even though the director seems sure that what he's doing is going to get your eyes watery. The truth is Nights in Rodanthe is a sappy overly emotional romantic drama so much so that it's absurd. I can't feel for these people and I can't feel for their petty outbreaks of selfloathing angst. When I begin arguing with characters in my head whilst I'm obviously supposed to be feeling pity for them I disconnect it's over. Stop trying to engage me. This happened an hour into Nights in Rodanthe and although I could have been won back sadly it only gets worse from there.It's hard to see why anyone would enjoy such a film. Sure enough if you're a major fan of weepies for some reason enjoy watching people cry a lot and don't mind romance that feels generic and predictable then you might just get something from Nights but even then you'll probably feel underwhelmed. There's no denying I had hope for this film with Gere and Lane helming what looked to be a mature love story I figured the worst that could happen would be if I was subjected to a teaspoon of fairy tale whimsy. Unfortunately however I did get that and I also got a shallow unremarkable feature that was essentially a few scenes drawn out far too long with a third act that wasn't necessary or even enjoyable in the slightest. Some decent individual performances throughout but with limited chemistry and an overwritten overly romanticised script Nights in Rodanthe isn't a night to remember by any means.A review by Jamie Robert Ward httpwww.invocus.net".

She displayed maturity and how she transformed throughout the show was easy to believe as what a teenager could possibly be like in real life. I loved this show from start to end. Definitely recommended for the romantic people out there!".

Unexpectedly they find that they can help heal each other. There were aspects of the film that I wished I'd seen play out more where simple flashes merely suggested themes that my mind had to fill in the blanks on such as the apology to the bereaved widower and how Adrienne goes from feeling guilty about having slept with Paul to feeling okay with it soon after. An opportunity for a tremendous love scene was lost when it was merely suggested they were going to make love with the hurricane coming. But in the end the film left me feeling deeply appreciative of the relationship that my wife and I share. And there were moments that moved me to the verge of tears. So I have to say it is well worth viewing.".

The producer of this movie is trying to convey some kind of important message to the audience and does a good job trying but succeeds only in sending bits and pieces. This movie also raises other questions Is Hollywood still able to produce a love story that succeeds in keeping the audience's interest? Is Hollywood still able to produce a love story that is not corny? Is Hollywood still able to produce a love story that is wellacted and wellwritten? Amazingly shockingly unbelievably after watching this movie the answer to these questions is a qualified yes. Parts of this movie are tedious and can bring a viewer to the brink of slumber but the movie sufficiently recovers to keep the audience at least awake if not thrilled. The story avoids corniness and the usual Hollywood contrivances that render such Hollywood movies unintentionally laughable and has an upbeat ending in what is for Hollywood an attempt to tell a dramatic story involving deeply emotional themes. Diane Lane's performance is outstanding. She is definitely the star of this movie. If you decide to take the time and spend the money to watch this movie please remember that it's made in Hollywood so don't expect profound philosophical insights but do expect a movie that you may actually like.".

	schema:reviewBody "The basic premise of this film with its spooky old castle and an aristocratic family with a skeleton in the closet was a popular theme of films in 30's and 40's THE OLD DARK HOUSE AMONG THE LIVINGand THE UNKNOWN are a few examples. The basic plot was probably considered old fashioned or at best quaint by the 1950's when this film was made. I agree with those who suspect that because Maurice Sandoz novel on which this film was based contained a bizarre science fiction twist this film was made. Instead of an insane twin or assumed dead relative hiding from the law for some unspeakable crime we have a phylogenetic freak! I think to like this film one must have a taste for offbeat fantasy. If viewed in  the right frame of mind and one is willing to suspend their disbelief this can be a very enjoyable film. That being said this film has many faults. The most obvious being that of the often intrusive narration by the Aunt. Richard Carlson tries hard but his performance is not up to snuff. Then there is the frog. In most scenes it is shown only in the shadows and in brief glimpses its okay but at the end when it goes no pun intended hopping mad and jumps out the window it looks silly. While this sequence I'm told by those who have seen this film on the big screen in 3D is rather startling shown flat or on T.V. is laughable. The frog looks like a bad rubbery prop. However even with todays high tech special effects I don't think a giant frog could be made to look scary now matter how hard anyone tried. While the maze of the title is interesting and give indications of Menzies design genius most of the castle consists standing sets left over sets from previous films. A SIDE NOTE The science fictional premise of this film is based on the theory of phylogeny. That is that the human embryo goes through stages just like in evolution a fish then an amphibian then a reptile then a mammal. Sir Roger the man with body of frog and the mind of a man stopped developing at the amphibian stage. However according to the theory the embryo resembles a neotenic salamander and not a frog. May I also add that this theory taught as written in stone in all biology textbooks has been mostly discredited in recent years.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Maze is directed by William Cameron Menzies and adapted to screenplay by Daniel Ullman from a story by Maurice Sandoz. It stars Richard Carlson Veronica Hurst Katherine Emery Michael Pate John Dodsworth and Hillary Brooke. Music is by Marlin Skiles and cinematography by Harry Neumann.Scotsman Gerald MacTeam Carlson suddenly breaks off his engagement to Kitty Murray Hurst and moves to his recently deceased uncle's castle in the Scottish highlands. Kitty wonders why and decides to travel to Craven Castle with her auntie Edith Emery. Upon arriving they find Gerald a changed man prematurely aged and acting in a most peculiar way. Just what is going on at this mysterious castle? What is the secret of the big maze out in the grounds?One of the early ventures into stereoscopic filming The Maze is a delightfully offkilter movie. As pretty much anyone who has seen it can attest the ending the culmination of great building by Menzies is so far off the scale it borders on the preposterous and for many it ruins the picture. Certainly myself had to rewind to check what I had just seen for I felt like I must have nodded off and slipped into some sort of bad liquor induced dream!That said for an hour this is a triumph of atmospherics and set design. Menzies and Neumann cover the story with foggy exteriors and murky shadows while the interior of the castle is a classic case of Gothic horror textures with Skiles' musical accompaniments are perfectly evocative. The narrative smoothly moves along with the air of mystery hanging heavy where the visitors to Craven are locked in their rooms at night thus at night from the gap under the doors of the bedrooms a slow moving shadow is glimpsed roaming the corridors. What is it? What is it in the distant maze that is shuffling around? Leaving weird footprints around the grounds?The characters are a stock group for the story with intrepid girls investigating shifty servants naturally well intentioned friends and lord of the manor harbouring a secret. Menzies fluidly uses the castle and grounds for atmospheric effects neatly placing the characters within the palpable sense of dread and tragedy and there truly are some striking scenes especially the build up sequence to the revelation at film's climax. Then it's that ending...On reflection the makers missed a trick the chance to really create a terrifying shock but you have to say it's also a product of its time and budget. And whilst I understand fully the groans and laughs that derail what has gone before there is a sadness right there in the reveal a touching tragedy that bears thought even if the ludicrousness of it all is practically impossible to forgive. 710".

Menzies and Neumann cover the story with foggy exteriors and murky shadows while the interior of the castle is a classic case of Gothic horror textures with Skiles' musical accompaniments are perfectly evocative. The narrative smoothly moves along with the air of mystery hanging heavy where the visitors to Craven are locked in their rooms at night thus at night from the gap under the doors of the bedrooms a slow moving shadow is glimpsed roaming the corridors. What is it? What is it in the distant maze that is shuffling around? Leaving weird footprints around the grounds?The characters are a stock group for the story with intrepid girls investigating shifty servants naturally well intentioned friends and lord of the manor harbouring a secret. Menzies fluidly uses the castle and grounds for atmospheric effects neatly placing the characters within the palpable sense of dread and tragedy and there truly are some striking scenes especially the build up sequence to the revelation at film's climax. Then it's that ending...On reflection the makers missed a trick the chance to really create a terrifying shock but you have to say it's also a product of its time and budget. And whilst I understand fully the groans and laughs that derail what has gone before there is a sadness right there in the reveal a touching tragedy that bears thought even if the ludicrousness of it all is practically impossible to forgive. 710";

	schema:reviewBody "Gerald Richard Carlson and Kitty Veronica Hurst have just finished celebrating their engagement announcement in France with family and friends when he receives a letter asking him to visit an ancestral castle located in Scotland. Gerald's uncle reportedly has fallen ill and has requested Gerald the sole heir be present. Gerald goes off to Scotland leaving his future bride behind. A few weeks pass and he doesn't come back. Concerned Kitty sends out telegrams but doesn't hear back from her fianc. Four more weeks pass and Kitty finally receives a weird response from Gerald calling off the engagement and telling her to move on with her life. Not ready to give up on her relationship and looking for answers Kitty hops on a plane and decides to pay Gerald a visit. Accompanying her on the trip is her levelheaded aunt Edith Katherine Emery best known for her starring role in the classic chiller ISLE OF THE DEAD. When Kitty and Edith arrive at the MacTeam estate they immediately suspect something strange is afoot. For starters Gerald seems to have aged twentyyears in a matter of weeks. Secondly this once nice and charming guy has turned into a complete jerk who repeatedly demands they leave the castle and never come back. When Edith comes down with a mild cold Kitty uses it as an excuse to stay there to try to get to the bottom of things.Why is Gerald being so cold and cruel to the woman he was just about to marry? Why is Gerald so opposed to having company? Why do the house rules state that guests must be locked inside their bedrooms at night? Why are guests forbidden to enter certain areas of the estate such as Gerald's bedroom and a large hedge maze out back? And what's making those strange dragging noises every night? These are just some of the questions THE MAZE poses. The movie actually does a fine job building up mystery and intrigue. You genuinely become interested in what's going on and patiently await the resolution to explain the weird events that are taking place. And then IT happens... I definitely don't want to ruin the finale of this film because you're better off not knowing but it takes one of the most unbelievable and jawdroppingly strange turns I've seen in any movie. It's wonderfully ludicrous in a way but it also takes a pretty solid little bw mystery and sends it straight into ZGrade schlock territory. And yet this ending seems so out of place you're not likely to forget it once you see it.Despite the ending or maybe even partially because of the ending I really enjoyed this odd bird. It's extremely talky and slow moving for the duration of the run time but it managed to keep my interest throughout. Director William Cameron Menzies who made the much more famous INVADERS FROM MARS the same year is best known as a twotime Oscarwinning art director and his set designs here are also really interesting. There's almost a silent movie feel at times with model work for some of the exteriors some painted backdrops and sparsely decorated interiors with very high ceilings. As with any good castle set there are also secret passageways and long staircases. This one also throws in a few rubberbatsonstrings for good measure.A few of the actors are a little stiff and awkward but I liked most of the cast. Hurst is one of those obscure and mostly unknown actresses who unfortunately never seemed to catch on despite being both beautiful and talented. Emery who also gets to play narrator in framing shots at the beginning and end of the film is decent enough as the overly mannered and cautious aunt. My favorite however was Michael Pate as the silverhaired sinister servant who does this hilariously upright zombie walk every time he ascends the stairs. Also on board in smaller roles are Hillary Brooke who played the title role in the Sherlock Holmes mystery THE WOMAN IN GREEN and Lilian Bond Whale's THE OLD DARK HOUSE. Of course Carlson also starred in IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON and some other horror flicks so you've got yourself a pretty decent cast for genre fans right there. I say check it out!".

He was reliable almost handsome had an MA from the University of Minnesota wrote novels and plays and projected intelligence boldness tension and earnestness that were perfectly suited to the unusual subject matter of hi later career. He was an exceptionally unexceptional actor but he was THERE for you.The opening is a brief flashback to a mysterious event in a 17thcentury Scottish castle. Then a shot of a pleasant lady speaking directly to the audience originally in 3D and introducing us to the story we're about to follow. I like the lady too. Katherine Emery is Aunt Edith and she had a pleasant relaxing smile and I believed every word when she explained I guess it all started with an engagement party at Cannes on the Rivera. She continues to do the voice over for the rest of the film. Dissolve to Carlson and a few others at a gay nightclub in which an attractive young girl is flung around with abandon by a couple of men in tuxedos. One of the guests uncredited is the immortal Bess Flowers whose entire career consisted of playing uncredited guests. Carlson seems to be enjoying himself immensely. He's engaged to Emery's niece Veronica Hurst.His holiday is interrupted by a message from that Scottish castle called Craven. Carlson must fly to Scotland immediately. He's next in line to inherit the castle and the title of Baronet that goes with it. The castle has no modern conveniences  no telephone no electricity  and stands just as it did hundreds of years ago. Still his fiance doesn't object although she muses that I suppose I'll get used to being addressed as Baroness. You bet you will. He does not return. Instead he sends a message to the aunt and his fiance dissolving their arrangement. Hurst is distraught as who wouldn't be in such a circumstance? Hurst and Emery travel to Craven Castle to find Carlson put out by their visit. What's worse he's turned twenty years older in the past few weeks. He reluctantly puts them up for the night cautioning his sinister butler to lock all the doors. Strange slithering sounds are heard in the hallway. Hurst is resolved to find out what the hell has been going on and she sneaks out that night and begins exploring the cobwebbed ruins. A bat flies at her or rather into the 3D camera lenses.It's impossible to know why bats have such a bad reputation. They mean no harm. One night standing on the lip of the Grand Canyon I tore a piece of scrap paper into bits and flung them into a floodlight only to be surrounded by thousands of bats with a dawning sense of disbelief. Two or three of the more adventurous entangled themselves in my hair and I toppled helplessly into the canyon. But two days later they brought me up by mule bloody but unbowed still at peace with bats. Anyway Hurst makes it to a grimy window that overlooks the back yard. There she sees a gigantic maze with dim figures moving through it.The next morning she finds a webbed footprint on the staircase and another in the gravel before the maze. At this point it's beginning to look less like a horror movie or science fiction than one of Edgar Allan Poe's fantasies. Nothing that happens from that point on changes anything.".

They could only do so much with the special effects back then but I can look past that. One thing this movie has going for it that too few movies do these days is goodheartedness. There aren't any truly bad guys. Everybody is acting primarily out of a desire to do good and to look out for the interests of others rather than themselves and I was left with a feeling of goodwill rather than the typical sense of foreboding and doom that so often is the central theme of movies like this one right to the end.

Once there the women discover that Gerald has aged for some reason and soon they realize that there's even more family secrets. THE MAZE is a hard film to judge because it contains some very good stuff but the problem is that the story itself is just boring and really drawn out for no good reason. The film features some terrific performances as well as a haunting atmosphere and these here make it worth sitting through. Director William Cameron Menzies INVADERS FROM MARS does a wonderful job building up the creepy atmosphere of the old castle. From the opening shots of the fog thick outside to the staircase with all the spider webs. The director really makes one believe you're in this location and he also puts the maze much like the one later seen in THE SHINING to good use. He also handles the BW cinematography very well as the film looks terrific and the use of shadows is well done. Carlson turns in a good performance in the lead and I though both Hurst and Emery were good. The supporting players are good as well so with all of this what's the problem? The screenplay is incredibly weak and it just doesn't go anywhere. Gerald asks the women to leave. They tell a lie to where they can stay an extra day. They discuss what could possibly be happened. These three steps repeat themselves over and over and it's just really boring. I won't give away the secret but when it's finally revealed you really can't help but laugh. The effect of this reveal is also rather laughable. The film was originally shot in 3D but watching the standard version I really didn't see anything that would really jump out.

I first saw it as a child at a YMCA Halloween party in the early Sixties and it scared the hell out of us kids in a fun way. I remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze. I can't risk giving away the ending except to say that it was surprising to say the least. I remember vaguely the entire audience of young boys letting out a big scared holler followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed. The ending has been seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally funny climaxes to a movie in film history and yet oddly moving in a way. You have to see it for yourself which is not easy these days. I don't know if it's available on home video or not but it would still make a great Halloween feature for both kids and adults.".

In this case he had used VHS tape made by Polaroid and the word Polaroid was printed in much larger letters than his typed words The Maze so for years my eyes just swept right by it on the shelf.His copy was taped from some TV station from their The 1 O'Clock Movie. No clue where from.So  that said  it was very disappointing. The Maze is a great title and I wish more of the action had revolved around the maze. The story was ridiculous and the ending even more so.When the old lady saw the seaweed on the floor I immediately thought Lovecraft but when she remarked and a bowl of tomahto soup I had to replay it twice. Is that what she really said? The blond lead was a total Marilyn Monroe clone poor man's version and Richard Carlson looked awful in that I am ill or troubled makeup.Odd film.ps  Someone had begun to tape RIDERS TO THE STARS after THE MAZE.

	schema:headline " You are invited to Ferris Bueller's House Party. Wanna come?";
	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes it is funny to watch films implode from your couch but other times it is just horribly painful to both your eyes and your mind. House Party 4 Down to the Last Minute is one of those rare examples of when both your eyes and your mind are pleading with you to turn the film off. This final installment to the House Party series is by far the worst not just sequel but film released by Hollywood. It becomes very apparent early on in this feature that director Chris Stokes loved Ferris Bueller's Day Off with a passion. I say this because it becomes very clear that Stokes had no trouble lifting the originality of Bueller off John Hughes' hands and choosing to create a film completely void of humor. You would think that by stealing themes and images from a funnier film your own film would at least be able to generate a giggle or two. With House Party 4 Stokes proved that he does not have what it takes to direct a sequel much less a Hollywood film. From his confusing and choppy story the inability to make sense of his characters and recycled oldtired clich moments all Stokes is doing is hitting a bigger nail into the coffin that holds the House Party films. It reminds me of that student that forgets about his project due in an hour and quickly slops together super glue macaroni cat hair chewing gum and straws and presents it as Hannibal Crossing the Alps. It just looks horrible and you feel embarrassed for the creator.So where did this film first take the plunge into the realm of comic stupidity? Honestly I do not think that most places will allow me to speak that long so instead I would like to hit upon some of the larger topics that hit me the hardest. To begin I still cannot shake the Ferris Beuller ripoff. It was as if director Stokes was ashamed of having to direct another sequel to House Party and decided to bring in a completely random formula from a funnier film and see if he could cut and paste elements from the original series into that formula. That was a huge mistake. When a director tries to do this what eventually happens is confusion within the audience. We think that we are going in one direction but instead we head in another one. That is exactly what you can witness in House Party 4. In one instance we have JohnJohn trying to have the biggest party of the decade while also trying to score a record deal ok kinda reminds me of the original House Party but then we whisk away to this random island where Uncle Charles is afraid of flying Grandma gets drunk and some idiotic minddulling moments with a supposed killer. Again we begin somewhat strong and end chaotic. This is the confusion in which I speak. Director Stokes did not have the ability to keep his hand on either the pulse of humor or the ability to tell a sequential story. He would rather cut corners keep the jokes cheap and think that the audiences are idiots than attempt to revive a stonedead series. One would think that when a director was handed that task of filming another House Party film he would walk into it thinking that heshe would be the one to revive it or bring it back to life instead Stokes just wanted to get paid.I realize that I am slowly growing older as the days go quickly by but I do believe I still keep my hand in the younger generation's culture. I listened to rap and RB growing up but the group Immature never made it to either my cassette deck or my CD player. Why? I don't think they ever quite had a following but apparently to director Chris Stokes it would be beneficial to cast them as leads in his new House Party film. Didn't anyone at any studio realize that this was going to be in the red rather quickly? Or how about the option to have Stokes himself play the comedic car repairman nothing like a director with no sense of comic timing casting himself as the only source of possible humor. It was one of those few instances when I actually missed Robin Harris and I never thought I would find myself saying that to any film. Outside of a gonowhere band playing the lead role I also thought that the remainder of the cast only continued to suck the life out of this film. Uncle Charles was annoying when he attempted humor. Kim Whitely was completely wasted for her scenes both literally and figuratively while  well  everyone else pretty much falls into that category.Where did Chris Stokes spend most of the budget for this film? Not for special guest stars because while this film may have boasted some there were definitely none present at the unforgettable House Party nor the possible dream that perhaps Kid or Play would make one final appearance. House Party 4 followed no preset design which ultimately ruined this feature from the foundation down. Can anyone explain to me why there was any need to use the escaped murderer who happened to be a licensed taxicab driver routine for humor? Stokes was reaching deep within the bottom of the barrel and only produced more muck instead of substance. For once I can admit to there being no redeeming value to this film. House Party 4 buried the series and while I do hear that there may be more in the pipeline I only hope Hollywood realizes that this series has died. Hollywood needs to let this series end forget about the past and move forward in the future. I think a sequel to Who's the Man? would get them started in the right direction.Grade  out of ".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure why the producers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a sequel to the first three movies..which it is not. Even though Marques Houston did appear in HP3 he played a totally different character he was eight years older in this film. Okay...so Reid and Martin weren't the most talented and couldn't carry a film all by themselves..but to trade on the HP franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference albeit minor to the earlier movies. I'm sure everyone who wanted to see it was hoodwinkedinto thinking that they were seeing a sequelnot a totally different film with a familiar name. And I'm sorry...Kym Whitley is not funny and could not hold a candle to the late Robin Harris Ketty Lester or DC Curry in the earlier films. Although Meagen Good and Mari Morrow are a substantial visual diversion...I have to give this a THUMBS DOWN!! Just naming the film Down to the Last Minute would have been OK. Furthermore the Hudlin brothers who produced the first three movies were not involved in the making of this film.".

Finally the female characters were all dressed up like cheap twodollar hookers throughout most of the flick.IMX separated a year after this flick got released probably due to the failure of this film and are all but forgotten nowadays.

Chris Stokes is like that except if you invite friends over to watch House Party 4 with you no one will be laughing. Not even the biased token black guy or the illiterate jock.

Anyways I'm glad I found this movie again I've been searching for it for more than 10 years! This movie falls into the category of movies like Airplane continuous jokes oneliners funny actions bodylanguage. Mark Blankfield is absolutely hilarious. His transformation from the shy Dr. Daniel Jekyll into the sexcrazed partyanimal Mr. Hyde is unforgettable complete with goldtooth chesthair and goldchains. The part I loved best was when he hijacked the car from this poor guy and then drove to Madam Woo Woo's. Totally psychedelic experience without the drugs! If you need laugh therapy this is the movie to do it. When I first seen it I had tears in my eyes and my belly was hurting from constantly laughing. This is a movie I could watch over and over again. I highly recommend it.".

Few comedians have gone as over the top as Blankfield and why we haven't seen more of him on the bigscreen will probably remain one of Hollywood's eternal secrets.Granted Jerry Belson though a veteran of light comedy himself is no Jim Abrahams or David Zucker.

If Viagra was the slime mold stage that white sparkling powder is the Stephen Hawking evolutionary rung or at least the pharmacist idiot savant branch. This reality show is really about the sacred cows of medicine seen as was the emperor without clothes. Few of us want to question the health field both because most of us would not have lived to our current age had we been born before modern medicine and because our subconscious hopes that we will continue to live on if we have faith in the helping professions. So the geniuses who produced this movie made jokes out of those Calcutta Bessy's giving us the sugar that allows us to swallow the modern institution of medicine. The timing was right and many were able to see the business side of the healing companies behind the curtain of Oz. A decade before when George C. Scott ranted through the movie The Hospital my wife and I were sitting in the packed premiere in Oklahoma City. Just as in Jekyll  Hyde's remake we were almost unable to keep from falling out of our seat and laughed and howled uncontrollably for the duration. The hundreds of other audience members were deadly silent. They were shocked that doctors nurses  the hospital institution were being mocked. It was as if the Pope Billy Graham and Gandhi were were sitting in the Animal House beer stained tee shirts and all competing to see who could tell the funniest God knockknock jokes between belches. Had The Hospital been a slapstick comedy rather than a satire they might have been able to see what was being shown to them. Unfortunately they were like Republicans at a screening of Michael Moore's 911. Perhaps smaller golden parachutes would have been given to the corrupt medical corporation leaders health insurance companies would have had a tougher time denying medical care and health providers would have been demystified earlier if George C. Scott had tap danced in a tutu while delivering his terrible truths. Butforget everything I just said. Watch the movie be consciously made as happy and joyful and full of laughter as the best ever Saturday Night Live skit and let the subconscious soak in the documentary of the underlying reality. Just don't blame me when Got to Got to Got to Got to becomes one of your sayings or when Hyde's Got Nothing to Hide occupies that portion of your brain now paralyzed by Its a Small World After All. Or when you start calling your local hospital Our Lady of Pain and Suffering instead of Our Lady of Eternal Construction. Even Oklahomans were changing their favorite terrible boss wishbone winner entreaty from Piss on him and leave him for dead to Body in a pit you in it..... The smell of death...it's gone!

Like most of its ilk it can be hit or miss with its surgically placed gags but it's a lot of wacky fun to watch because of Mark Blankfield's comic performance as the straightlaced Jekyll and maniacally trippedout Hyde. Especially the risible transformation scenes and his offtherocker interactions. Still he has great support in the shape of Tim Thomerson Michael McGuire Bess Armstrong Krista Errickson and bit part for Cassandra Peterson aka Elvira as a busty nurse. Judging by its title it's easy to guess how the premise will play out. Yep this is a bastardised version of Robert Louis Steven's story The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde which sees the medical practice and hipster scene coming together where Dr. Jekyll struggles to harness this animal instinct in to descent thanks to the temptation of a certain white magic powder. This time it's mostly set in America but heads to the story's basis country of origin England in the latter half. There it plays around with its source material and gives a wink to the original author. What the script snorts up is purely madcap where one minute it would be dry then suddenly quite lowbrow and then plain goofy. The dialogs are just madness. A pleasurably comical lowbudget bgrade cult comedy spoof.Only if the animal in man could be released.".

This is not uncommon as Swedish directors are not as hung up or uptight about life as Americans who are easily offended. This imaginative stirring unabashed and wonderful film originally called 'Children's island' became  Barnens O  for the Cinema. With a refreshing sense of originality it tell the story of Reine Larsson Tomas Fryk an elevenyearold Swedish boy on the verge of puberty. Noticeably disturbed by the onset of his twelfth birthday he displays a deep seated fear he will become as corrupt as every other adult. Living with his single mother Harriet Anita Hirdwall and her abusive boyfriend Stig Ingvar Hirdwall in a less fashionable part of the city he is informed he will be going to Camp for the summer. Realizing this is not his choice he decides to forgo Camp and instead spend his vacation wondering throughout the city. Once he tricks his mother he soon discovers each day must be recorded in his journal as he is certain each brings him closer to maturity and death something which he dreads with impending doom. The movie becomes one long segment of Home Alone Swedish Style. Traveling about he encounters the lessons of life with stark brutality. Seeking the 'Purity' of first love he is threatened with many dangers and somehow discovers each has cost him a bit of innocence. The film is long on story and punctuated with brief nudity and stark images which only the Swedes could offer an audience. The main star Tomas Fryk personifies the true talent of an emerging Thespian. Recommeded to anyone longing for an honest portrayal of youthful adolescence. ".

It's an extraordinary movie.I won't give a synopsis of the plot because other reviewers have already done that. But I will say that I don't understand comments that it's bleak shocking weird clinical depressing or pornographic. It is certainly very unusual which I suppose could make it seem weird to some people but the other criticisms must reflect the reviewers' own issues because I didn't see any of that in the movie I just watched. I'm not attracted to boys so the nudity didn't seem pornographic at all to meit's just a kid trying to figure out who he is with no help at all from the irresponsible adults in his life. And it's Sweden not Utah so topless women are no big deal.But what surprised me most is how positive the movie is in its depiction of this gutsy lost kid who goes on a sort of Odyssey through all sorts of strange experiences looking forand ultimately findinghimself. It's fascinating thoroughly original and deeply satisfying.I'm not at all surprised that Barnens  won three major Guldbagge awards for best film direction and actor but I'm absolutely astounded that the actor who won was not Tomas Fryk the kid whose fearless performance as Reine must be one of the most remarkable ever filmed but Ingvar Hirdwall in the relatively insignificant role of Stig Reine's mother's sleazy boyfriend. I don't understand that at all but it doesn't alter the fact that this is a great movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Telling the story wouldn't be the point at all would it? Barnens  spelled almost like boon aww is the title for that brilliant novel of the late seventies that shocked a lot of people including myself.Children's Island is the title and what an island. In the book Raine the main character has The Guiness World Record Book as his own Bible. And he's keen on breaking new records himself. In particular the youngest person under water for three minutes.The story is as most Swedish films and books of the time deep consciously provocative and awe inspiring. Bergman was beginning his final film and Cries and Whispers was barely out. expectations for any Swedish film were pretty high. They taught us then that great theatre great actors superb writers and gifted directors made a veritable team of perfection in cinema.All this said Barnens  is a story of discovery. It is too a story of alienation cities are alienating and living in one of them make us aliens to most of its residents. It is a story of revelations and sudden encounters with our own destiny. It is a film of overwhelming hope and desperation. Of feelings buried under layers and layers of isolation and insulation from a world that couldn't care less...This approach in itself is a pretty difficult way to weave a convincing narrative. Here the masterful guidance of Kay Pollak on Ola Olsson's script of P C Jersilds novel turns it not only in a possibility but in one of those master pieces of cinema.I may disagree a bit with someone who said that this work was all but forgotten. It is not. Even as I write this in 2009 discussions on P C Jersild's story are conducted all over the world and the film shown at many film schools and small theatres.Why? Waxing philosophical on all of it would be difficult and many have already done it scholarly through writing and lectures. The reason why Barnens  was and IS a special story is the cosy feeling you get from the start when you discover that everything is told through the eyes of a small child. And that's where it ends too. Maybe it's a clinical view as someone else pointed out. But deeply disturbing moving and satisfying. The concept is deep as long as we have no pubic hair we still can live one more day as an angel. Afterwards we'll become what Raine reflects as the colophon of his experiences Men are Pigs. He finds his fears when he's fearless. He finds love when the world is crumbling around him. He discovers a reason not to behave like the grownups because he refrains from committing crimes. He let go his inner purity and confidence in others without reservation just to learn how rotten the soul of a man can be.Where love is expected he finds hatred. Where compassion is needed he finds suspicion and cold hearts. It's a film of metaphors. A film to think and to raise questions that are hard to ask but harder to answer.In the end the satisfaction of witnessing such a superb work that really upped the ante for any other Swedish film after is a ride of joy and hope. Be aware that it is a film full with the dark side of our nature. But alas! a film of hope and deep joy. Reine will still be an Island in Stockholm but there is the big hope of living today in full even when we found our first signs of sexual maturity show.".

Its hard to accept that fact but thats the way it is.Yes one could say well they could have made that part be less obvious we'd still get it .. yes true they could have but as then and specially now there are soo many disgusting murders and whatnot in todays movies but somehow that is accepted and normal even when your 8yo is watching it you dont mind it? Just think about it.. what is more normal to see or know about  that movie part or butchering movies.I loved the JMJ soundtracks in it and alos that airal part where you can see Stockholm from the choppa together with JMJ's music is a perfect fit! As far as acting goes well.. i've seen better but its a pass.As far as the plot goes i'd do it differently some parts of the movie were too fast  and needed to be more slow while others that were slow could have been more faster.".

It was just that kind of pseudorealism that made the cultural elite of Sweden go in trance back then. As the author of the novel P.C. Jersild was highly reputable I read the novel that the script was based on and found it overall better perhaps a bit ethereal.Kay Pollak became however before long known as the 'enfant terrible' of Swedish cinema as he more or less tried to bleed the Swedish Film Institute for more and more financial support of yet another pathetic picture project of his Love Me! also starring Tomas Fryk released in 1986 and an immediate flop.Pollak later on released a video show To Choose Happiness a sort of stand up where he discussed the subject of managing conflicts. A narcissistic female boss of mine had the staff watching it in order to manipulate us into believing that instead of reacting at her mistreatment of us we should think as Pollak suggests So she hates me? Wonder what bad things I've done? Better walk the line onwards otherwise I'll start feeling unhappy... As for Kids' Island I do suspect the enthusiasts of this film of merely being fascinated by the infamous profanity in it that was staggering even by Swedish standards. One has to feel sorry for the young actor. Did he regret being there? After all he wasn't as bad an actor as Pollak was a bad director check out one of his better roles in The 9th Company 1987 about a military service unit where the inductees begin a large scale operation of selling out the army supply. It might be of interest to know that in Sweden documentaries or movies dealing with people exposed to various hardships frequently are referred to as Social Porn...".

I stepped inside and sat next to a very nice handsome gentleman. We got to talking as he was very friendly. He explained that he had a small part not being filmed at my house and we sat and chatted for awhile. He told me his name Dustin Hoffman.

It sure was... and I remembered my conversation on the bus with him. Over the years I've followed his career.Last night I was telling a friend about this movie. We later sat down to watch The Holiday.... I was saying wow... ELI WALLACH...we were just talking about him. Later in the movie when there was a short glimpse of Dustin Hoffman did I really get the chills...

Eli Wallach plays a frustrated everyman sick to death of the rat race and lack of imagination he sees around him. He decides to kidnap a sexy young girl and ends up with suburban housewife Anne Jackson by mistake. She gives him MUCH more than he bargained for. Schisgal wrote the screenplay and there are plenty of laughs to be had Bibi Osterwald with her leg stuck in Wallach's ceiling Wallach paying his monthly rent to landlords who'd sold his building six years earlier a very bizarre encounter between Wallach and the NYC housing commission. Wallach in a very rare lead is exceptional and Jackson is charming. Bob Dishey plays Jackson's egomaniacal yet unbelievably neurotic husband and the supporting cast includes a lot of great character actors. In addition to Osterwald Ruth White Charles Nelson Reilly David Doyle and Elizabeth Wilson have roles. Arthur Hiller's direction is probably a bit too flashy for the material he falls back on cross cutting editing and fast motion a lot aside from its over use on the Benny Hill Show is fast motion EVER funny?. Look for Frances Sternhagen in a very unlikely cameo and Dustin Hoffman in his first film.".

It has the feel of a 1960s beach movie turned into a sophisticated PGrated urban sex romp. It occasionally falls flat in attempts to imitate the zaniness of Richard Lester films but this doesn't detract from the clever humor.The film weakens however after the inevitable meeting of the main characters. It's unfortunate that the writers had to resort to a plot device so ludicrous and offensive. The movie becomes mainly dialog driven beyond this point but the dialog just isn't good enough to support that and Eli Wallach's excellent Eric Von Zipper imitation eventually grows annoying. Nevertheless the movie still has a few surprises to offer and the quick merciful ending provides an oddly satisfying lack of conclusion.".

Misleadingly thought by some to be a kids movie it is closer in spirit to David Lynch's stylized surreal looks at the real America. Jordan Christopher Michael plays a young boy who runs away from home and travel across America in a stolen car. Only it isn't exactly America as we know it. At a gas station he is given some motorama cards which are part of a competition which has a possible 500 million dollar prize. He slowly becomes obsessed with the game as he continues on his increasingly bizarre trip which sees him encounter a strange bunch of oddballs eccentrics and weirdos. He even loses an eye along the way! The nutters he interacts with are played by an amazing array of character actors and cult figures including Lynch favourite Jack Nance 'Eraserhead' Susan Tyrrell 'Flesh and Blood' Mary Woronov 'Eating Raoul' Michael J. Pollard 'Bonnie And Clyde' John Diehl 'Stripes' Dick Miller 'A Bucket Of Blood' Robert Picardo 'Innerspace' Flea Meatloaf and a teenage Drew Barrymore note sleaze fans  a prebreast reduction teenage Drew Barrymore!. This movie is easily overlooked in the video racks  especially with its misleading Home Alone meets Thelma And Louise packaging  but it is really worth watching. Fans of quirky road movies like 'Wild At Heart' 'Highway 61' or 'Roadside Prophets' should enjoy this quietly subversive dark fantasy which in my opinion is one of the most unfairly overlooked movies of the last ten years or so.".

He becomes one of the most rebellious badass 10 year olds you may ever witness on screen. This is no kid's flick! Look for cameos by Jack Nance Flea and Drew Berrymore. Be warned although Drew is on the front cover she only appears in the film in a dream sequence for a couple seconds. Also the film gets confusing towards the end reaching David Lynch territory you may want to watch it a couple times. Motorama was written by Joseph Minion most well known for his screenplays for After Hours and Vampire's Kiss So enjoy this depraved surreal roadtrip of fun!".

He becomes one of the most rebellious badass 10 year olds you may ever witness on screen. This is no kid's flick! Look for cameos by Jack Nance Flea and Drew Berrymore. Be warned although Drew is on the front cover she only appears in the film in a dream sequence for a couple seconds. Also the film gets confusing towards the end reaching David Lynch territory you may want to watch it a couple times. Motorama was written by Joseph Minion most well known for his screenplays for After Hours and Vampire's Kiss So enjoy this depraved surreal roadtrip of fun!";

	schema:headline " More absurd than surreal with significant Christian symbolism";
	schema:reviewBody "Some spoilers includedAlthough many commentators have called this film surreal the term fits poorly here.  To quote from Encyclopedia Britannica's surreal meansFantastic or incongruous imagery One needn't explain to the unimaginative how many ways a plucky tenyearold boy at large and seeking his fortune in the driver's seat of a red Mustang could be fantastic those curious might read James Kincaid but if you asked said lad how he were incongruous behind the wheel of a sports car he'd surely protest NO way! What fantasies and incongruities the film offers mostly appear within the first fifteen minutes.  Thereafter we get more iterations of the same in an evercruder and more squalid progression that far from incongruous soon proves predictable.  Not that it were on the other hand literally believable but it were unfair to tax Motorama in particular with this flaw any plausible suspension of disbelief having fallen precipitously on the typical filmmaker's and viewer's scale of values ever since Raiders of the Lost Ark became a blockbuster.Hallucinatory How do we know what a hallucination is if part of having one is not knowing that we are having one? At any rate some people know that they enjoy hallucinogenic drugs but if Motorama typifies the result of doing so then I'm at a loss as to why anyone would take them more than once.  There is of course the occasional bad trip.  The movie must be one of those pun and all.Juxtaposition of words that was startling How many times can a tenyearold startle you by uttering Oh my God! when he likes something or Damn! when he doesn't? These two interjections are about par for the course with this script.  Sadly any sense of the surreal in what passes for dialogue could only reveal in direct proportion one's naivete regarding the speech patterns of the rising American generation.A world completely defined and minutely depicted but that makes no rational sense Motorama's world indeed makes no sense but it is about as completely defined as a cartoon in an elementary school newspaper.  The numerous guest stars in the cast all have cameo roles even less intelligent than our little hero who exclaims Damn! in the blink of an eyelash but needs several seconds to concoct the lamest lie. And even his character despite appearing in nearly every scene gets no significant development. Here's scant reward for any viewer who sympathizes as I must enough to wish to know him better and understand 'where he's coming from.' One vaguely senses a far better story and protagonist struggling to get out.Fully recognizable realistically painted images are removed from their normal contexts and reassembled within an ambiguous paradoxical or shocking framework. No we see a succession of stereotypical and ever more dilapidated billboards filling stations greasyspoon eateries cheap hotels and their lowlife habitues along country highways exactly where they stereotypically belong.Largely responsible for perpetuating... the traditional emphasis on content.  There is little content momenttomoment in Motorama.To sum up Picture British millionaires dressed as clowns or pirates on the way to a posh costume party sitting serene and mute as cautious chauffeurs inch their RollsRoyces like fragile skiffs through a roiling sea of desperate humanity Chinese who implore them through the windows and smear the glass with blood.  Or imagine a stadium full of abandoned antiques limousines like those above now rusting and white pianos tinkled by ghosts. Into this detritus wander an exhausted boy and an ailing woman to whom he clings as motherfigure becoming girlfriend who fall asleep side by side on the grass.  He is awakened on the Feast of the Transfiguration white and glistering day 1945 by a brilliant flash on the horizon that is not the rising sun.  Finding that his consort has become a corpse he first believes that he has witnessed her soul going up to heaven.  Later he explains only a little less innocently 'I learned a new word today atombomb. It's like God taking a photograph.' Now there are just two samples of cinematic surrealism surrealism whose ironies ripple out far enough to invade its film's very title Empire of the Sun.  If you seek surreal please don't miss it.  Alas however hard he treads on the accelerator to race his chariot through and beyond the desert no scenes so exquisitely strange rich subtle or gorgeous await Motorama's poor little Gus in his quest.None of the above necessarily constitutes a thumbsdown on this film. Though somewhat disappointed I can't dismiss it in view of the respectability of another genre that it does exemplify one influenced to be sure by surrealism but also by expressionism existentialism and Franz Kafka's pessimism amidst omnipotent power structures. Let's try on for size Theater of the Absurd.Turning to E.B.'s article on this style I am amazed by how to the extent that Theater of the Absurd is a valid artistic style the above objections to Motorama vanish like a puff of smoke.  I'm tempted to quote the entire text as support of the identification.Theater of the Absurd attempts to show that the human situation is essentially absurd devoid of purpose...  humankind is left feeling hopeless bewildered and anxious. Having instantaneously achieved his purpose of getting away from a depressing home life among bickering parents Gus finds himself purposeless until he drives past a glittering billboard reading Motorama and decides to win the lottery that it promises.  As others have already revealed this ambition proves illusory although the game never expires the sponsoring corporation has no intention that anyone should ever win and has ways to trick confuse and leave crestfallen any aspirant to the reward.  He like others is ultimately disappointed in his dream.Absurdist playwrights therefore did away with most of the logical structure of traditional theatre.  There is little dramatic action as conventionally understood however frantically the characters perform their busyness serves to underscore the fact that nothing happens to change their existence...  a timeless circular quality emerges. Language in an absurdist play is full of...  repetitions...  repeating the obvious until it sounds like nonsense. Underneath a sometimes dazzling comic surface we find an underlying message of metaphysical distress. Gus's obsession with a silly game his inane language the plot device wherein he divines a bleak future andor returns to an earlier moment and takes a different but still bleak turn so much fits now.  While an admirer of the surreal would do better with some films anyway of Spielberg admirers of Motorama as it really is should find fellowtravelers not instead but addition in the works of Beckett Ionesco and Genet.But one can't quite stop here.  After his disillusionment with the game Gus returns to Phil i.e. Love the first attendant he had met and the one person who had treated him decently although he had also scolded him at a service station advertising Be fullfilled!.  Under Phil's tutelage he learns a life of waiting for cars.  We might note here that the absurdist playwright Beckett had entitled his most famous play Waiting for Godot and that for Godot we should read God. God is one of Phil's preoccupations too.  Furthermore as the indirect result of his previous encounter with Gus Phil is badly maimed and goes about in a cast with his arms straight out horizontally.  In the last scene Gus now Phil's protege says that he wants to hear music.  We hear none but we see Phil wiggling his fingers at the end of his outstretched arm beckoning Gus closer and Gus responds.  The End.Finally on to an author whom I happen to be reading currently the Anglican theologian William Stringfellow.  If this rebellawyer is not acknowledged as an architect or undergirder of Liberation Theology which is more a Roman Catholic than an Anglican movement perhaps he should be.  Police brutality and corporate greed are a cliche in cinema and literature including Motorama but Stringfellow supports and illuminates such sentiments with impressive warrants from scripture tradition and reason.His most significant work is an expose of the earthly activities of those fallen angels whom the Bible refers to as principalities and powers. Principalities wrote Stringfellow are behind all of our popular three I's Images Institutions and Ideologies.  All of these commend themselves to our worship by making false promises.  The more deeply involved with an image an institution or an ideology any person becomes the more his own personhood becomes depleted and be becomes a slave to them.  Promising power control and immortality they inexorably deliver helplessness chaos and death.  As essentially fallen defeated powers they can do no more than that.  Yet they beguile humans with that dominion over the earth promised by God in the book of Genesis while in fact no one of us controls an image an institution or an ideology bent inevitably on its own hegemony and selfpreservation. They take on lives of their own.  Dominion happens to be a mistranslation a more accurate rendering of the Hebrew would be stewardship. But this is a quibble beside a more fundamental problem Most of us neglect to notice that God had delegated this power to Adam before the fall.  We have no reason to assume that we his descendents still exercise it now on the contrary it should be obvious that demonic forces have stolen it from us.One might add two observations of C.S.  Lewis First that man's conquest of nature is a mere illusion and a ruse to cover the fact that one is really talking about the conquest of some men by other men with nature as the instrument and secondly contrary to popular belief Satan is no kind of goodtime Charlie.  He may dangle out pleasures at first but he is very niggardly with them and will withdraw them from any human firmly in his thrall perhaps leaving his prey sitting in front of the fire feeling miserably sorry for himself and seething with resentment.Now applying these insights to Motorama we seem them mirrored remarkably in Gus's experience.  He is if not nice at least a pretty little boy prior to falling victim to the Motorama game.  The first signs advertising it glisten glamorously.  The longer he continues however and the deeper he journeys towards the sponsoring corporation's headquarters the more shabby they become.  He's lonely meeting no one else who plays the game.  The stations giving out the cards have either fallen into ruins or are staffed by zombies.  The people he does meet along the way are more and more ugly deceitful and hostile.  The fact that the principalities answer to a common dictator does not mean that they can abide one another.  Gus's humanity is leached out of him as he becomes not only totally selfcentered and oblivious to the needs of others but partially blinded... disfigured... prematurely aged while infantile in the literal sense of linguistically challenged.  Eventually even his precious Mustang is taken from him in a crash and he must continue in a dead man's wreck.  Yet at long last having done everything he thought was expected he presents himself to the principality in its proud tower to receive his prize.  Using the biblical power to confuse wielded by those who have built such monuments to their own vanity its agents evade him disappoint insult and finally throw him from the top floor.  He FALLS long and hard landing finally in a body of water. In other words in classic symbolism he DIES.  He has met the inevitable bad end of anyone who has put his faith in such a deceiver.But this fate proves to be only a warning look into a mutable future. He repents and returns to Phil and upon seeing him performs the very first generous selfless act we have seen from him for almost an hour and a half noting that Phil is now handicapped and hardly able to insert a hose into a gas tank he asks Can I help you with that? Then seeing the help wanted sign he decides to apply for the job explaining to the motorist with whom he was hitchhiking that he reckons he'll get out here because it doesn't look like too bad a place to work.This interpretation is conjectural of course and it may surprise or even outrage the film's cult classic aficionados who see quite different points in it.If Motorama isn't quite my cup of tea I'm at least convinced now that it's hardly the worst film ever made.".

Not that it were on the other hand literally believable but it were unfair to tax Motorama in particular with this flaw any plausible suspension of disbelief having fallen precipitously on the typical filmmaker's and viewer's scale of values ever since Raiders of the Lost Ark became a blockbuster.Hallucinatory How do we know what a hallucination is if part of having one is not knowing that we are having one? At any rate some people know that they enjoy hallucinogenic drugs but if Motorama typifies the result of doing so then I'm at a loss as to why anyone would take them more than once.  There is of course the occasional bad trip.  The movie must be one of those pun and all.Juxtaposition of words that was startling How many times can a tenyearold startle you by uttering Oh my God! when he likes something or Damn! when he doesn't? These two interjections are about par for the course with this script.  Sadly any sense of the surreal in what passes for dialogue could only reveal in direct proportion one's naivete regarding the speech patterns of the rising American generation.A world completely defined and minutely depicted but that makes no rational sense Motorama's world indeed makes no sense but it is about as completely defined as a cartoon in an elementary school newspaper.  The numerous guest stars in the cast all have cameo roles even less intelligent than our little hero who exclaims Damn! in the blink of an eyelash but needs several seconds to concoct the lamest lie. And even his character despite appearing in nearly every scene gets no significant development. Here's scant reward for any viewer who sympathizes as I must enough to wish to know him better and understand 'where he's coming from.' One vaguely senses a far better story and protagonist struggling to get out.Fully recognizable realistically painted images are removed from their normal contexts and reassembled within an ambiguous paradoxical or shocking framework. No we see a succession of stereotypical and ever more dilapidated billboards filling stations greasyspoon eateries cheap hotels and their lowlife habitues along country highways exactly where they stereotypically belong.Largely responsible for perpetuating... the traditional emphasis on content.  There is little content momenttomoment in Motorama.To sum up Picture British millionaires dressed as clowns or pirates on the way to a posh costume party sitting serene and mute as cautious chauffeurs inch their RollsRoyces like fragile skiffs through a roiling sea of desperate humanity Chinese who implore them through the windows and smear the glass with blood.  Or imagine a stadium full of abandoned antiques limousines like those above now rusting and white pianos tinkled by ghosts. Into this detritus wander an exhausted boy and an ailing woman to whom he clings as motherfigure becoming girlfriend who fall asleep side by side on the grass.  He is awakened on the Feast of the Transfiguration white and glistering day 1945 by a brilliant flash on the horizon that is not the rising sun.  Finding that his consort has become a corpse he first believes that he has witnessed her soul going up to heaven.  Later he explains only a little less innocently 'I learned a new word today atombomb. It's like God taking a photograph.' Now there are just two samples of cinematic surrealism surrealism whose ironies ripple out far enough to invade its film's very title Empire of the Sun.  If you seek surreal please don't miss it.  Alas however hard he treads on the accelerator to race his chariot through and beyond the desert no scenes so exquisitely strange rich subtle or gorgeous await Motorama's poor little Gus in his quest.None of the above necessarily constitutes a thumbsdown on this film. Though somewhat disappointed I can't dismiss it in view of the respectability of another genre that it does exemplify one influenced to be sure by surrealism but also by expressionism existentialism and Franz Kafka's pessimism amidst omnipotent power structures. Let's try on for size Theater of the Absurd.Turning to E.B.'s article on this style I am amazed by how to the extent that Theater of the Absurd is a valid artistic style the above objections to Motorama vanish like a puff of smoke.  I'm tempted to quote the entire text as support of the identification.Theater of the Absurd attempts to show that the human situation is essentially absurd devoid of purpose...  humankind is left feeling hopeless bewildered and anxious. Having instantaneously achieved his purpose of getting away from a depressing home life among bickering parents Gus finds himself purposeless until he drives past a glittering billboard reading Motorama and decides to win the lottery that it promises.  As others have already revealed this ambition proves illusory although the game never expires the sponsoring corporation has no intention that anyone should ever win and has ways to trick confuse and leave crestfallen any aspirant to the reward.  He like others is ultimately disappointed in his dream.Absurdist playwrights therefore did away with most of the logical structure of traditional theatre.  There is little dramatic action as conventionally understood however frantically the characters perform their busyness serves to underscore the fact that nothing happens to change their existence...  a timeless circular quality emerges. Language in an absurdist play is full of...  repetitions...  repeating the obvious until it sounds like nonsense. Underneath a sometimes dazzling comic surface we find an underlying message of metaphysical distress. Gus's obsession with a silly game his inane language the plot device wherein he divines a bleak future andor returns to an earlier moment and takes a different but still bleak turn so much fits now.  While an admirer of the surreal would do better with some films anyway of Spielberg admirers of Motorama as it really is should find fellowtravelers not instead but addition in the works of Beckett Ionesco and Genet.But one can't quite stop here.  After his disillusionment with the game Gus returns to Phil i.e. Love the first attendant he had met and the one person who had treated him decently although he had also scolded him at a service station advertising Be fullfilled!.  Under Phil's tutelage he learns a life of waiting for cars.  We might note here that the absurdist playwright Beckett had entitled his most famous play Waiting for Godot and that for Godot we should read God. God is one of Phil's preoccupations too.  Furthermore as the indirect result of his previous encounter with Gus Phil is badly maimed and goes about in a cast with his arms straight out horizontally.  In the last scene Gus now Phil's protege says that he wants to hear music.  We hear none but we see Phil wiggling his fingers at the end of his outstretched arm beckoning Gus closer and Gus responds.  The End.Finally on to an author whom I happen to be reading currently the Anglican theologian William Stringfellow.  If this rebellawyer is not acknowledged as an architect or undergirder of Liberation Theology which is more a Roman Catholic than an Anglican movement perhaps he should be.  Police brutality and corporate greed are a cliche in cinema and literature including Motorama but Stringfellow supports and illuminates such sentiments with impressive warrants from scripture tradition and reason.His most significant work is an expose of the earthly activities of those fallen angels whom the Bible refers to as principalities and powers. Principalities wrote Stringfellow are behind all of our popular three I's Images Institutions and Ideologies.  All of these commend themselves to our worship by making false promises.  The more deeply involved with an image an institution or an ideology any person becomes the more his own personhood becomes depleted and be becomes a slave to them.  Promising power control and immortality they inexorably deliver helplessness chaos and death.  As essentially fallen defeated powers they can do no more than that.  Yet they beguile humans with that dominion over the earth promised by God in the book of Genesis while in fact no one of us controls an image an institution or an ideology bent inevitably on its own hegemony and selfpreservation. They take on lives of their own.  Dominion happens to be a mistranslation a more accurate rendering of the Hebrew would be stewardship. But this is a quibble beside a more fundamental problem Most of us neglect to notice that God had delegated this power to Adam before the fall.  We have no reason to assume that we his descendents still exercise it now on the contrary it should be obvious that demonic forces have stolen it from us.One might add two observations of C.S.  Lewis First that man's conquest of nature is a mere illusion and a ruse to cover the fact that one is really talking about the conquest of some men by other men with nature as the instrument and secondly contrary to popular belief Satan is no kind of goodtime Charlie.  He may dangle out pleasures at first but he is very niggardly with them and will withdraw them from any human firmly in his thrall perhaps leaving his prey sitting in front of the fire feeling miserably sorry for himself and seething with resentment.Now applying these insights to Motorama we seem them mirrored remarkably in Gus's experience.  He is if not nice at least a pretty little boy prior to falling victim to the Motorama game.  The first signs advertising it glisten glamorously.  The longer he continues however and the deeper he journeys towards the sponsoring corporation's headquarters the more shabby they become.  He's lonely meeting no one else who plays the game.  The stations giving out the cards have either fallen into ruins or are staffed by zombies.  The people he does meet along the way are more and more ugly deceitful and hostile.  The fact that the principalities answer to a common dictator does not mean that they can abide one another.  Gus's humanity is leached out of him as he becomes not only totally selfcentered and oblivious to the needs of others but partially blinded... disfigured... prematurely aged while infantile in the literal sense of linguistically challenged.  Eventually even his precious Mustang is taken from him in a crash and he must continue in a dead man's wreck.  Yet at long last having done everything he thought was expected he presents himself to the principality in its proud tower to receive his prize.  Using the biblical power to confuse wielded by those who have built such monuments to their own vanity its agents evade him disappoint insult and finally throw him from the top floor.  He FALLS long and hard landing finally in a body of water. In other words in classic symbolism he DIES.  He has met the inevitable bad end of anyone who has put his faith in such a deceiver.But this fate proves to be only a warning look into a mutable future. He repents and returns to Phil and upon seeing him performs the very first generous selfless act we have seen from him for almost an hour and a half noting that Phil is now handicapped and hardly able to insert a hose into a gas tank he asks Can I help you with that? Then seeing the help wanted sign he decides to apply for the job explaining to the motorist with whom he was hitchhiking that he reckons he'll get out here because it doesn't look like too bad a place to work.This interpretation is conjectural of course and it may surprise or even outrage the film's cult classic aficionados who see quite different points in it.If Motorama isn't quite my cup of tea I'm at least convinced now that it's hardly the worst film ever made.";

	schema:reviewBody "This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I've ever seen on film. I don't know if it's as serious as it seems to try to be but that hardly matters. This film is extreme absolutely wild and surreal. The packaging and the marketing only make it more so because you know that ever so often some mother has to reprogram her kid to accept our reality after he checks this out from the video store expecting something completely different. Look at the roadmap for one thing! And where else in America can you see a ten year old kid swear as much as this one does and then get his eye ripped out by pervert the rival of Pulp Fiction's Zed? And that food inspector scene is the best! The amount of well known to vaguely recognized actors in this film is one of the best things about it Soon much sooner than you realize you too will find yourself saying Is that Meat Loaf? Is that Drew Barrymore? Is that the holideck doctor from Star Trek Voyager? Is that Flea? Is that the sawmill owner from Twin Peaks gassing squirrels with car exhaust? And isn't this guy from the new Rob Zombie movie? He looks an awful lot like Shrek. I think my favorite scene is at the very end with Phil in a full body cast. I mean please why aren't more movies like this shown in airplanes? This director hardly has anything else to his name higher than Return To Salem's Lot but he displays true stumbling manchild genius in this creation! If you're an intellectual looking for something to ps away your evening on I highly suggest this film for satisfaction. This movie's plot is all too ridiculous but imagine it taken out of context boy arm wrestling an over aggressive Meat Loaf who seems hell bent on taking out his anger at not being accepted into Guns N Roses looks over his shoulder and sees the doctor from Voyager enter the bar Can you imagine what any half brained channel surfer active through the last six years would think of seeing that? Now imagine if you actually cared about Meat Loaf or Voyager to begin with! Or imagine if you're a Flea fan. Rocky Horror Picture Show fans this film contains notable music mind you but its soundtrack is more plasticine than Mad Max 3. What does that entail for you? This is the retarded inverted mongoloid cousinsistermotherpuppy of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. How about when Gus' sleeve flies back onto his arm in an act of cableaccess special effects quality mastercraft? When I saw this film it was on the suggestion of my cousin who had watched half of it in a fit of halfaware childhood in the early half of the nineties and who has since been haunted by vague memories of it I myself had not slept in three days. It made me laugh! Of course it's also an anxiety movie. The music doesn't encourage the suspense but it eventually gets to the point where it's been fully established that the American Censorship Committee has obviously missed this film entirely and absolutely anything can happen in it and probably will any time Gus turns a corner or the view so much as changes camera angles. I found myself obsessing over the possibility of those cards flying out his window at any second. Watch this movie. Awesome!".

	onyx:emotionText "This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I've ever seen on film. I don't know if it's as serious as it seems to try to be but that hardly matters. This film is extreme absolutely wild and surreal. The packaging and the marketing only make it more so because you know that ever so often some mother has to reprogram her kid to accept our reality after he checks this out from the video store expecting something completely different. Look at the roadmap for one thing! And where else in America can you see a ten year old kid swear as much as this one does and then get his eye ripped out by pervert the rival of Pulp Fiction's Zed? And that food inspector scene is the best! The amount of well known to vaguely recognized actors in this film is one of the best things about it Soon much sooner than you realize you too will find yourself saying Is that Meat Loaf? Is that Drew Barrymore? Is that the holideck doctor from Star Trek Voyager? Is that Flea? Is that the sawmill owner from Twin Peaks gassing squirrels with car exhaust? And isn't this guy from the new Rob Zombie movie? He looks an awful lot like Shrek. I think my favorite scene is at the very end with Phil in a full body cast. I mean please why aren't more movies like this shown in airplanes? This director hardly has anything else to his name higher than Return To Salem's Lot but he displays true stumbling manchild genius in this creation! If you're an intellectual looking for something to ps away your evening on I highly suggest this film for satisfaction. This movie's plot is all too ridiculous but imagine it taken out of context boy arm wrestling an over aggressive Meat Loaf who seems hell bent on taking out his anger at not being accepted into Guns N Roses looks over his shoulder and sees the doctor from Voyager enter the bar Can you imagine what any half brained channel surfer active through the last six years would think of seeing that? Now imagine if you actually cared about Meat Loaf or Voyager to begin with! Or imagine if you're a Flea fan. Rocky Horror Picture Show fans this film contains notable music mind you but its soundtrack is more plasticine than Mad Max 3. What does that entail for you? This is the retarded inverted mongoloid cousinsistermotherpuppy of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. How about when Gus' sleeve flies back onto his arm in an act of cableaccess special effects quality mastercraft?

May have been Cinemax's Vanguard Theatre  where they would feature cult B art house etc.but I can't remember.It starts out with scenes of a kid making something wood and metal in what looks like a basement while his parents are violently arguing upstairs. At first it's hard to tell if the voices are flashback and the metal and wood creation are some torture device of a deranged psycho or perhaps the kid is going to use the device he's building to kill his arguing parents. As it turns out he is making leg extensions so that he can run away in this candy apple red 60's era Mustang.From there it becomes a surreal road movie where the boy stops at various gas stations to play some long forgotten sweepstakes game. You get a certain number of gallons of gas from Chimera Gas Stations you get a game token and peel off the sticker you collect letters and if you spell out MOTORAMA you get a visit and tour of the Chimera headquarters.Along this odyssey he runs into the freakiest cast of characters to ever inhabit the deserts of the American southwest. He comes across a variety of oddballs at rest stops diners gas stations and roadside attractions. None of which seem to realize or at least acknowledge that he's a young preteen kid.One of the scenes I remember as particularly bizarre was a married couple pick him up act overtly sexual towards him and I believe drug him. When he awakes they apparently have given him a tattoo.Eventually he makes it to Chimera HQ but it turns out they want to renig because no one was supposed to make it that far. My memory is a little fuzzy on the exact ending.I have been looking for this movie off and on for ten years and every time I would describe it I would get blank stares as I tried to describe the whacked out plot to people. Apparently it is on DVD now so I can check one more off my wanted list.I urge anyone who is a fan of offbeat black comedy road movies to find this and watch it!".

But early on it's difficult not to miss the fact that one of the supposedly sophisticated killers purposely twists his foot in some red paint at the murder scene. Unfortunately this is not an intricate plot point and there are worse story stumbles afoot.

The main story about the industrial espionage and the gang hunting for an item is pretty good if a little unbelievable. You can see the twists coming from miles but it doesn't take too much away from the conclusion.It's difficult to care about either Stewart Dr Meybridge or Amanda AguayoStewart. With Stewart her character is so work focused that she neglects Amanda the idea being that we would gradually see her warm to the prospect of motherhood. However she is so unsympathetic for the majority of the film that it is that that stays with you and not the sudden urge of motherhood experienced towards the end. As an aside Stewart looks so much like Meg Ryan that if her current work dries up she should be able to get a job as one of those celebrity impersonators at parties!Amanda being mute for almost the entire film makes it difficult for AguayoStewart to convey a lot of character. This would have suited a more experienced or better child actress and makes you wonder about how she was picked out for the role. Rob Lowe brings a bit of starpower to the film but as projects like 'The West Wing' shows he's too good for projects like this.A reasonable TV thriller this would have benefited from better performances from both the female leads.".

The plot has holes but the lead performers make it work.Catherine Mary Stewart Julia Kerbridge does a great job as a woman of 37 who has sacrificed everything else to become a physician. She worked years to earn the money to go to medical school. She is performing brilliantly in her residency and is just about to take her board exam and realize her dream.Meanwhile Julia's sister and brotherinlaw are murdered and as the nearest living relative she is compelled to take in her niece Amanda Arlen AguayoStewart to avoid having her become a ward of the state. Amanda is about 7 years old from her appearance. Amanda is so traumatized from her parent's murder that she has become mute. Needless to say Julia's 16hour days get longer caring for Amanda.Rob Lowe plays Kevin Finney a charming neighbor man in their apartment building who works his way into the lives of Julia and Amanda. He is always there with a trick or a joke to help Amanda deal with her distress. Amanda really starts to warm up to Kevin as the film progresses perhaps more than to her aunt. Julia starts to rely on Kevin to take some of the load of caring for Amanda as she attempts to handle her case load and prepare for her board examination. Kevin is always there whenever some crisis erupts for Julia.The chemistry between Rob and Catherine Mary was great. You keep watching to see them get together before the end of the film. The chemistry between Rob and Arlen was good as well. Arlen managed to convey quite a lot without the benefit of words. The plot had Julia and Amanda gradually warming up to each other. You can see them working out a relationship as the film progresses.We discover that Julia's sister and brotherinlaw the Meyers were involved in industrial espionage. They stole an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer. They had three associates who intended to share the proceeds of the theft. Julia discovers that the Meyers were planning to skip the country under assumed identities. The plot is unclear whether the Meyers intended to double cross their associates or were themselves double crossed.In any case the Meyers are murdered in their home by 2 of their former associates. The killers make no attempt to extract the location of the microchip from the Meyers before killing them. The killers search the home and fail to find their prize. They leave a living witness to their crime Amanda. The killers then spend the remainder of the film making clumsy attempts to extract the microchip from Julia and Amanda who have no idea where the prize is located. Eventually the killers kidnap Amanda in hopes she knows something about the microchip's location.Eventually Julia discovers the truth about Kevin. He is an investigator hired to recover the stolen microchip. After some rough moments in the relationship they manage to rescue Amanda and dispatch the bad guys. The predictable ending has the three forming a family and moving happily into a future together.What struck me about the plot were major holes. Kevin moves into the same apartment building as Julia and Amanda the day after the murder of the Meyers. How does he know that the microchip is not already in the hands of the killers? The killers blithely leave fingerprints at the murder scene with no concern for concealing their identity. The killer that pretends to be a psychiatrist is revealed to Amanda by the remnants of red paint from the murder scene on his shoe soles. He was not shown in the murder scene at the start of the film. There are other weaknesses along these lines too numerous to mention.The film could have been a lot better if the script had been refined more before filming. Filling in the plot holes would have added little expense and greatly improved the effort.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Better then you would expect Canadian import that has a twist ending to it that comes as almost no surprise at all. With the killer acting so obnoxious and weird before his identity is revealedthat you can spot him almost as soon as you see him. The movie begins with young Amanda Mayers witnessing the murder of her parents  Larry  Elizabeth in a home invasion by two ruthless thugs that leaves her so traumatized that she loses her ability to speak. With Amanda's closest relative being her aunt third year hospital resident Julia Kerbridge she's put in Julia's care which has her parents killers zero in on the two in their attempt to recover a microchip that can revolutionize the world of technology. It was that chip that Amanda's dead parents had in their possession that their killers were looking for. We also have the mysterious and handsome nextdoor neighbor the on and off musician Kevin Finney who seems to take a more then a passing interest in Amanda and her aunt Julia. Kevin is always hanging around the place looking for something the missing microchip?. He also has compiled a massive file that Kevin foolishly leaves out in the open for Julia to later find on the Mayer murders.Kevin gets very friendly with both Amanda and Julia which leads him to become a target of the two killers who are trying to get their hands on the missing microchip that they overlooked when they murdered both of Amanda's parents. Having her niece get treated by psychiatrist Dr. Ettinger has Julia and Dr. Ettinger realize that she's hiding the secret of her parents murder and the missing microchip in her subconscious mind that if cured and able to talk again would reveal their identities! even more important where the microchip is hidden! What Julia doesn't know is that the man behind Amanda's parents murder is a lot closer to both her and Amanda that she could have ever imagined.Well acted and eyepopping photographed looking like it's in high definition made for TV movie has Rob Lowe as the odd man out who also plays a mean violin as the hero. Lowe or Kevin after a few false starts shows who's side he's really on as the movie leads it it's final and unexpected conclusion. The killers in the film are so determined to get the missingor stolen microchip that they so far as getting themselves exposed by hanging around Julia's apartment house and Amanda's school where they can easily be identified.SPOILER ALERTThings get out of hand for the killers when the real Dr. Ettinger shows up from a two week vacation and you begin to realize that Amanda's life is in far more danger then you or both Julia and Amanda could have ever suspected.

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS Better then you would expect Canadian import that has a twist ending to it that comes as almost no surprise at all. With the killer acting so obnoxious and weird before his identity is revealedthat you can spot him almost as soon as you see him. The movie begins with young Amanda Mayers witnessing the murder of her parents  Larry  Elizabeth in a home invasion by two ruthless thugs that leaves her so traumatized that she loses her ability to speak. With Amanda's closest relative being her aunt third year hospital resident Julia Kerbridge she's put in Julia's care which has her parents killers zero in on the two in their attempt to recover a microchip that can revolutionize the world of technology. It was that chip that Amanda's dead parents had in their possession that their killers were looking for. We also have the mysterious and handsome nextdoor neighbor the on and off musician Kevin Finney who seems to take a more then a passing interest in Amanda and her aunt Julia. Kevin is always hanging around the place looking for something the missing microchip?. He also has compiled a massive file that Kevin foolishly leaves out in the open for Julia to later find on the Mayer murders.Kevin gets very friendly with both Amanda and Julia which leads him to become a target of the two killers who are trying to get their hands on the missing microchip that they overlooked when they murdered both of Amanda's parents. Having her niece get treated by psychiatrist Dr. Ettinger has Julia and Dr. Ettinger realize that she's hiding the secret of her parents murder and the missing microchip in her subconscious mind that if cured and able to talk again would reveal their identities! even more important where the microchip is hidden! What Julia doesn't know is that the man behind Amanda's parents murder is a lot closer to both her and Amanda that she could have ever imagined.Well acted and eyepopping photographed looking like it's in high definition made for TV movie has Rob Lowe as the odd man out who also plays a mean violin as the hero. Lowe or Kevin after a few false starts shows who's side he's really on as the movie leads it it's final and unexpected conclusion. The killers in the film are so determined to get the missingor stolen microchip that they so far as getting themselves exposed by hanging around Julia's apartment house and Amanda's school where they can easily be identified.SPOILER ALERTThings get out of hand for the killers when the real Dr. Ettinger shows up from a two week vacation and you begin to realize that Amanda's life is in far more danger then you or both Julia and Amanda could have ever suspected. It turns out that very person who's supposed to help Amanda recover from her trauma of not being able to speak is the one who caused it! The film has a wild and effective final with Amanda now again traumatized by the fake Dr. Ettinger to the point where she can talk again. With no one suspecting who he is will it be enough for both Julia and Kevin who turns out to be a private investigator to get the drop on him before he does them both together with a terrorized Amanda in!";

Plots are intelligent scientifically accurate projections of the unknown possibilities of the sometimes frightening and imminent future.While most producers and directors in Hollywood ignorantly view SciFi as indistinguishable from Horror and Fantasy this series returns to the origins of Science Fiction in the logical moral and philosophical projections of current new technologies into their possibly fearful near term realizations. This series does this very well and remains unique in its avoidance of the shootemup video game monster mentally of much of the current generation. It has brains history a message and good entertainment. It is an adult series without unbearable teenage knowitall fantasies. Hurray!Now if we can only get MGM to release the entire New Outer Limits series on DVD instead of just the six poor teaser discs and the 1st season now only available.".

	schema:reviewBody "I discovered The Outer Limits in mid2001 while it was in syndication. Sadly I didn't realize that they had just wrapped their final season. I've been trying to catch all of the episodes on SciFi which has an erratic schedule for this show to say the least!I must say that I disagree with most of the negative comments that I've read so far regarding this program.  The series did indeed have some dud episodes  especially the episodes which pieced together parts of other episodes to somehow make a new story.  However for the most part the show ran 7 seasons with some very original creative and fresh concepts that in most cases held my attention until the very end.  In fact I felt sorry at the end of certain episodes that I wouldn't get to see more of the story as each episode is a selfcontained.  Unlike many shows than ran for 7 seasons I did not find a degradation in quality as the show wore on. In fact my secondfavorite episode A New Life was from the final season.While many writers were involved with the stories shown in The Outer Limits a few were responsible for the majority of the episodes.  It's interesting to take a look at some of the themes behind the show in general.  The main and stated theme of The Outer Limits was to explore human nature and the consequence of human mistakes.  However a viewing of all episodes also reveals a disdain that the writers seem to hold for both the American military and Christianity.  There were several episodes in which the military was either the villain or the protagonist whose mistakes lead to the destruction of mankind.  Christianity was frequently shown as the vehicle used to brainwash unsuspecting earthlings into helping aliens accomplish their evil goals.  I am neither Christian nor involved with the military but I found this apparent bias by the writers to be annoying and sometimes ruined otherwise good episodes.I liked how The Outer Limits mixed its endings between happy and catastrophic.  That made things a bit less predictable unlike many movies of today where you know in advance that the hero will survive and triumph.If you're looking for a great episode try The Refuge.  I won't detail any of the plot for you since it's best watched without knowing anything in advance.  It's from season 2 so I believe you can find it on the Season 2 DVD.".

I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode with the irresistible Brent Spiner as a Deprogrammer in a world where humans have become slaves to a lizard reptilian species. It's funny how the lizards and reptiles are our favorite evil aliens like V but anyway he has three days to program a man who is totally brainwashed in serving the alien species on earth.

These shows always have some type of moral story to them which most of the time if not all the time is very true! You can feel that the man whose voice is dubbed over the credits and in the beginning and ending believes what he is saying wholeheartedly! Not only do these shows have great story lines they also throw you into them get your mind racing and your blood pumping. The original outer limits was a black and white in the 60's right These shows made a triumphant comeback the likes of which I have never seen! The new twilight zone with Forest Whitaker was fun to watch but the New OUTER LIMITS is where it's at! If you have not seen I implore you to please check these episodes out and you will see exactly what I mean! LONG LIVE THE NEW OUTER LIMITS!!!!!!!!!!!!".

Others have been embarrassing to watch or just plain average it seems the way they did things was to have mostly low budget filler episodes and save up for a great blockbuster episode every now and then. The Outer Limits seems to offer both the best and worst of TV I say overall it's not a bad effort but viewers like me may lose patience when it starts to seem like a long time between good episodes. I'm surprised the show ran as long as it did with every science fictionthemed show outside of Star Trek and Stargate being cancelled at the first opportunity.".

Others have been embarrassing to watch or just plain average it seems the way they did things was to have mostly low budget filler episodes and save up for a great blockbuster episode every now and then. The Outer Limits seems to offer both the best and worst of TV I say overall it's not a bad effort but viewers like me may lose patience when it starts to seem like a long time between good episodes. I'm surprised the show ran as long as it did with every science fictionthemed show outside of Star Trek and Stargate being cancelled at the first opportunity.";

	schema:headline " Four of My Favorite Episodes and Two of The Worst!";
	schema:reviewBody "The six episodes here reflect the very best and worst of the series.Since The Outer Limits always preaches a moral. I would like to offer my own. Starting with the most entertaining to the flops.Favorite Number 1. Afterlife As an institution The U.S.A. militaryindustrial complex is both evil and paranoid not to mention plain stupid. However individuals with great integrity do serve our country and they will obey their conscience even at a mindboggling cost! In the end the aliens don't need to say a word. Those without a conscience are fools who are to be held in utter contempt! A truly subversive episode! One that should be shown on prime time television for all to see! This might be a revelation for some but folks without a conscience should not be allowed to serve in our military! Nor do the ends justify the means! Favorite Number 2. Relativity Theory A good person may be forced to make a splitsecond decision between good or evil in order to save the lives of defenseless intelligent beings and at great cost to one's self. What makes this decision all the more difficult is the stark choice Being marooned with exotic alien strangers who you can't even communicate with except through gestures or going along with a group of people you think will keep you safe from unknown dangers even if they are ruthless and devoid of compassion! This episode is brilliant! What fuels this depravity is good old fashioned greed. This episode is one of the most scathing indictments of capitalism transnational corporations and raping the environment I have ever seen in my lifetime! Unlike real life justice here is served  and swiftly! One of the most memorable lines is when the ruthless corporate thug said something to the effect We did the same thing in the Amazon Rainforest War. Alluding to the killing of Amazonian Indians who were attempting to protect their rain forests from being strip mined as justification for killing again literally in the name of the survival of the fittest. Something Darwin never meant to be taken literally! Favorite Number 3. Alien Shop Tremendous power can be used for good even from an exotic alien. This power can be used to heal instead of destroy. Mere mortals can learn from their mistakes! Even a criminal can see the light if given enough opportunity to do so.Sometimes it takes strong medicine but we all can wakeup and change our selfdestructive ways! Favorite Number 4. The Grell An alien can be a Christlike figure! In the distant future slavery can be justified once again in the name of expediency! Basically good people can be corrupted. Sometimes a person needs to be experience great shame in order to see the evil heshe is committing. Children are closer to the truth than adults. Those with political power have tremendous responsibility! Another work of genius! As a species Do human beings learn from history? Flop Number 1 Quality of Mercy Loose Lips Sinks Ships! When in war kindly keep your mouth shut about important military plans. Gee did I really need to watch an hourlong soap opera in order to figure this out?!! I wonder did the makers of The Outer Limits run out of ideas or did corporate pull the plug? Dark and ugly serving no purpose but despair! Flop Number 2 Beyond The Veil So bad there is no moral but this When lockedup in a mental hospital use some common sense please! This episode is so bad it disgusts. What an XFiles ripoff! Don't waste your time on this one! You'll thank me later! It's a sad commentary that The Outer Limits went down the tubes toward the end of its run. Subversive episodes like the first four could not last forever! It was a miracle they were made at all! Hopefully someday other brave souls will follow the subversive Outer Limits tradition into new territory! If you happen to be such a daring person a good place to start is with one unique book Anatomy Of Wonder A Critical Guide to Science Fiction edited by Neil Barron! As far as I'm concerned one of the most comprehensive books ever written on the subject!".

The greatest aspect of this episode is its ability to elicit intense introspection to imagine yourself in the protagonist's shoes and know you must make such a difficult decision. The clear warming humanity of the unbalanced equation is overwhelming which is why the choice is so painful. The ending still gives me chills.

	schema:reviewBody "I can be a bit of a sucker sometimes for anthologies I always love the fact that they have as many stories as you want it's true that quantity doesn't always equal a great amount of quality but sometimes quality really does help.This is another scifi gem I think is under the radar. Yeah I know I lot of people say this revival isn't as good as the original but lets face it it's a tough act to follow. What I really like about this version of the anthology is isn't trying to one up it's predecessor but it's trying to simply do it's own thing while staying true to the spirit at the same time which I feel is what a good revival should do. I remember seeing this show when I was about 12 so in a way this show is one of the final relics of my childhood at it's end also if it wasn't for this show I never would of known entirely about the original. It was also to me one of the last really good anthologies before they became a lost practice not to say there aren't anymore but they've became few and far between.There are a lot of things I feel this revival has going for it. I really like the theme song which I think is very good and memorable it has a really eerie and spooky tone to it. The production value I thought was on par it was done on a higher budget but it was used well. From the make up of the aliensmonsters certain special visual effects which hold up well may'be not all some CGI effects do look dated.The pacing I personally thought was better each of the stories like it's predecessor are an hour long but I hardly noticed the time. I really liked the into narrator he has that storyteller tone which is both wise and kinda creepy.Even liked the use of cast members each of them were a mixed bag from unknowns experienced actorsminor leaguers you might have seen here and there and some familiar faces from TV shows or movie you might know about. Each of them are different ages and I like that they all look like regular people which I like because it makes them more easier to emphasize or relate to than anyone from the CW whom look ridiculously good.And this show has a lot of good and memorable stories. It's true this show does have a lot of bad apples but that's the same fundamental truth about most other anthologies out there it's a matter of sorting out the bad ones in order to find the really good ones and the good ones really are tasty. I really like how most of them are morality tales that really do deal with the fallibility's of man and science the danger of uncontrolled progress conflict between man and mechanization fear of what is unknown or what we don't understand and the importance of being human and humanity triumphing.There are plenty of memorable stories I'll let you make your own lists and be the judge of them. But then again that's the point of most of these anthologies anyway. A couple of them for me are one Stream of Conciness which was about an internet technology completely running the show and books and literacy have became almost obsolete. Another which is my favorite one Tribunal which is an emotional story on a lawyer played well by Saul Yurik from TV's Warehouse 13 traveling in time to gather sufficient evidence to try and convict a wanted Nazi.Overall this show was a solid scifi I wouldn't mind another revival or at least some other anthology based on scifi to form. Anthologies are something the scifi community needs more of right now. Like any story in an anthology this show is worth checking out.Rating 3 and a half stars".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the standout features of the original Outer Limits series was the consistency of good writing. Oh there were some bad episodes like the one with the telepathic rocks but overall it was an amazing achievement in science fiction.The New Outer Limits saw just the reverse. Mainly the episodes were formula and where the endings in the original series brought hope the new series primarily brought doom and destruction. The reason for this comes from a lack of writing skills. Science fiction writing is like writing mysteries. Of course there are always the murder shows where the killer gets away with it but then there is the clever side as with Columbo or Agatha Christie where the writer creates a difficult situation but has figured out how to resolve it in the end. The endings in the New Outer Limits were for the most part unresolved and left the viewer with a sense of despair.There were a few exceptions though. One was entitled Tribunal and told how a man used a time watch to go back to Nazi Germany to a concentration camp to try and save his half sister from certain death. It is a four handkerchief ending.In another brilliant episode entitled A Stitch in Time Amada Plummer uses a time machine to go back in time and eliminate serial killers before they ever killed. Each trip back to a rewritten present slams a lifetime of memories into her head causing brain damage a concept borrowed for the film The Butterfly Effect.Finally in an episode entitled Think like a Dinosaur the concept of what happens to you when you are teleported is measured to the extreme. Perhaps inspired by the Star Trek Next Generation episode where Will Riker is split into two separate persons by a transporter beam each of which go on to lead two distinct and separate lives something goes wrong with the teleporter and the original is not destroyed but revived. So which one is actually real? While one of the doom and gloom episodes this one still raises enough questions as to the nature of the human soul that it manages to transcend the poor resolution of circumstances at the end.The fact of the matter is that the New OUter Limits more closely resembled the original Twilight Zone than the series whence it derived its name.".

Each trip back to a rewritten present slams a lifetime of memories into her head causing brain damage a concept borrowed for the film The Butterfly Effect.Finally in an episode entitled Think like a Dinosaur the concept of what happens to you when you are teleported is measured to the extreme. Perhaps inspired by the Star Trek Next Generation episode where Will Riker is split into two separate persons by a transporter beam each of which go on to lead two distinct and separate lives something goes wrong with the teleporter and the original is not destroyed but revived. So which one is actually real? While one of the doom and gloom episodes this one still raises enough questions as to the nature of the human soul that it manages to transcend the poor resolution of circumstances at the end.The fact of the matter is that the New OUter Limits more closely resembled the original Twilight Zone than the series whence it derived its name.";

Some of those episodes just creeped me out and years later they still do. While the Twilight Zone occasionally had morals to its stories the Outer Limits stories were more often an exercise in fear and terror bereft of any moral.This was because the stories created by the chief writer of the Outer Limits was going through psychological problems of his own and the stories that he wrote came to him in his car as he drove along. Had his psychologist been more successful the earlier Outer Limits would probably be like the dribble that is the new Outer Limits today.Some how all the terror has been leached away and what we see are a series of predictable episodes that have hamfisted morals that fit right in with the cynical '90s. There are only a few basic themes in the new version and all the rest is just a predictable variation of virus destroys all but a few people Mankind is bad and must be dealt with by alien or androids it changes each week Don't watch out or what you create may end up controlling you and a few other limited themes. There was nothing really new here.And to make the series all the more depressing was that nobody ever on. The good guyhero thinks he does but no!  he dies everybody dies and then there's the moral. It's '90s cynicism that's just there to hammer down dull and downbeat episodes where almost nobody ever comes out alive and happy.While 90 per cent of the episodes are a waste of time there are a few good ones you just have to sit and wade through all of the crappy ones to find a good one. For good science fiction go and buy the videos or DVDs of the original series those will either terrify you or give you things to think about. Unlike with the new series where you've seen a few you pretty much have seen them all with the originals they are all uniquely different from the others.".

	schema:reviewBody "The original Outer Limits was a groundbreaking show  even now forty years later the program is thoughtful provocative and imaginative.  It was scifi with a human twist showing realworld problems against a backdrop of aliens monster mad scientists and powerful political interests.  The show was steeped with Shakespearean themes of love murder betrayal faith family quarrels romance redemption and greed all cleverly offset against for instance the site of a man in an alien costume or a woman who was actually a queen bee.  This process of pairing two seemingly dissonant halves has proven to work well in other forms of entertainment most notably the Singing Detective.  It was a formula that worked well for the 1960s anthology series because it provided both real substance and genuine entertainment a void which the X Files was to fill later on in the 90s.The 90s version of the Outer Limits lacks the sense of drama and the magic that the 60s version had.  Sure the special effects are better but the writing is horrible.  Every time I watch this show it's one of three storylines that they beat into the ground1  Mad scientist invents something can't wait to try it out tests it on himself guess what happens and there's always an evil board of directors out to stop his funding.2  Human beings are being slowly changed into something else and the mystery will be revealed at the end of the show.3  Aliens or a robot have an ulterior motive and it's not a good one.Oh and you totally can't tell that they shot the series in Vancouver.Where is the drama the acting the great writing that the original show had?  For example Sally Kellerman Martin Landau and Chita Rivera are fantastic in the Bellero Shield my favorite OL episode.  You have a greedy ambitious Kellerman a slightly loopy but brilliant Landau Chita's weird dancelike movements and vaguely threatening presence an alien murder a wealthy industrialist a spooky old house and excellent writing.  Now that is an OL episode that none of the new episodes can even begin to compare with.  You feel something for each of the characters and the storyline pulls you along.On the new OL you can't care about the characters they are flat dull lifeless unlikable.  You can't identify with any of them it's like they are made of flexible plastic or something.  And everyone is either good or evil and the writing goes out of its way to make sure that the evil characters are pure evil and nothing else.  Like the one about the cloned robot who was put down by the greedy businesswoman at the end of the show only to have the robot come back to life again and strangle her.  Gee I didn't see that one coming.  Who wrote this crap?".

Although the Dino and Micheal have yet to find this out when they do it's up to Michael to decide to either kill her or to let her live. Yet what happen to him prior upon meeting her kamala was very much related to what happen to his wife his wife died similarly. This show professes irregularity and sorrow thruout most of it. After the show you're left pondering...about what SHOULD have been done and you're stuck with the 5050 of what's right from wrong.

I must say that it is one of the better and she is shaping up to be a rather decent actress. I am very much looking forward to see her in action when better material will be available.This being said this movie was terrible  and my score is given based on this 1 star for not being the worst movie I've seen 1 star for the performance of Tatyana Ali and 1 star for not thinking that it only deserves 2 stars there are worse movies for that.Ja Rule should stick to rapping not my favourite rapper to say the least but some seem to like him  and if he is contained there I would be delighted not to see him contaminate the acting scene.Ving Rhames Ah man Marcellus Wallace what are you doing here  you used to be cool man. Just because Michael Caine is a fiercely brilliant actor who has been in so many terrible flicks as well as good you don't have to copy him Ving.The rest of the semi big names in the cast It's OK there are bills to be paid and we all have to do things we're not proud of time to time.The movie itself. It so massively flawed it's pretty difficult to know where to start. It's more like a bunch of scenes thrown in together as were the director to say we need to tell this and we need to tell that. There is a story unfortunately there is nothing surprising about or within it. To say the least the plot changes in the story were overly obvious and it was therefore predictable what was going to happen all the time.To sum up in one word Reallynotgood".

There was another movie I saw on BET with another rapper in the starring role. It truly stunk and even the merciful breaks from commercials did not save that one. In fact even when I was out of the room hearing the audio it stunk even worse. Back In The Day was not such a stinker by far.Ja Rule did a decent job. Maybe even better than passable. He did not overplay the moments. He seemed to take directing well which leads to the subject of directing. I think it was a very well directed film and would like to see more from James Hunter. Even though he had some real power hitters to work with there seemed to be a good gel among the actors that made the writing of Mr. Hunter and Michael Raffanello credible.It was a low budget film. There is no doubt about that. It was an indie. You put these two together and you get Back In The Day. There were not the obligatory BOOM! SPLATTER! and ZOOM! that marks so many wannabe blockbusters but instead the focus was on the story which while common did bring some surprises that most may not anticipate. I did not although usually I do. Sometimes it felt like a play without the music. This is not a bad thing but a comment on the feel of the movie.I think Rhames one of my top 5 favorite actors Grier who could not love this ageless beauty Morton my neighbor Morgan the dimples I wished I could have married and Ali ok so Ms. Grier has competition all did a wonderful job. This was far from a paying the bills project as I am sure that all of these indemand actors can live very well off the residuals of their past work.That is all from me on Back in The Day. It was not a film that I would purchase for my personal library but if I see it in the TV listings again I would watch it. I love morality plays that are honest yet sensitive. One thing I noticed in this film which many lack especially those surrounding Black characterswas the respect given to role of Christianity and its more conscientious leaders in the community. I appreciated the lack of hyperbolic and rhetorical dialog and character stereotypes. I would like to thank the writers director and actors for a decent B movie.".

Ja Rule is Reggie  the young man torn between Godly influence and the lure of the streets. Tia Carrera plays a good supporting role and is eyecandy besides! I didn't recognize Pam Grier but good to see her outside the gangsta moll rut. Starting with a broken family the youth goes through the stereotypical stages  2 steps forward 1 back. Joe Morton plays an honest and good preacher  itself a rarity onscreen nowadays. When a seminal and sad event occurs you can see the internal struggle going on within Reggie. The conclusion is somewhat predictable but I like a positive movie anymore.".

It's more like an experience an aheadofitstime extended music video. Most of the action is stifled static and repressed. The images seem like setpieces paintings in time feelings encased in poses. All which remind me of famous Greek director Theo Angelopoulos and his static images  which were not static at all  since they housed emotions and a participation of audience in conjecturing what they were seeing by a process of mental elimination of causes and possible actions. BORDERLINE  instead of being images of things gazes at people and we are challenged to discover just what it is they are thinking. Mostly because the number of intertitles is scant and far between.All this is to say  this is not an easy film to watch. I enjoyed immersing myself in the images however. The story is rather odd in itself  perhaps it was risqu for its time. In fact I am sure that a biracial relationship was offcenter for those times. As were its sexual undertones.Indeed I think the film's title is about the BORDERLINE type of lifestyle that these people wanted to live. And in turn the consequences emotional and social which affected their decisions surrounding this.This sort of experimental film has been done and redone thousands of times by professionals and film students during the 20th century. Perhaps never as compelling as in this film  which is a landmark of sorts for film buffs.Yet I repeat not for everyone.The film is really about the myriad psychological states that we go through during a relationship  and racial prejudice is the juice that runs this study. But there are sometimes subtle and sometimes obvious moments of homosexual metaphor scattered throughout.Don't watch this movie if you are in a hurry. The film won't go faster just because you want it to.Intriguing but not altogether successful  but highly recommended for film buffs and Gothic types. Both in which I've dabbled through the years.".

Of its purposes it was trying to elevate film to the status of art it was trying to promote the educational qualities of film it was trying to kick the British film industry into high gear indeed all the articles lamenting the poor British film industry grow wearisome etc. etc. Of these purposes it was also championing the minorities blacks in film being one of the main focuses of this purpose.The brainchild behind this Close Up was a man named Kenneth MacPherson whose name you'll also notice under the Writing and Directing credits of Borderline the film in question of this review.I watched Borderline because I'm a fan of this old magazine. Back in these days the writers had a much clearer sense of film and its potentials and their writing has a pop and vigor the type that would transform into the raging wit that today's writers pass off. With MacPherson two others edited and contributed to Close Up. The first of these is Winifred Ellerman penname Bryher. The second is Hilda Doolittle penname H.D. American poet actor in Borderline. Other personalities of course frequently appear in the publication but it is these three whom I'm quite fond of especially the two women. Quite naturally I had to see these personalities materialize on film their only film.It's amazing how well this film corresponds to these personalities I've loved. The rhythm the technique the goodhumor of Borderline is so apparently theirs. Of course I say this from bias but I still say it is uniquely the product of MacPherson of his person and people. And the jazz score on the Criterion disc compliments this personality well I feel. It compliments the film. It compliments the rhythm the technique and the goodhumor. Oh I should probably define these. Hmm... The rhythm is difficult to describe. The cutting is strange and... jazzlike undoubtedly the jazz score again biases me. The story is more rhythmic than coherent and apparently this throws people off as evidenced by the few uninformed narrative junkies who have submitted embarrassingly bad reviews to this humble IMDb page. The technique is often impressionistic. Borderline is beautifully photographed if I may say so and the Criterion quality is the standard of excellence. The thoughtful angles the focus and lighting the goodhumor... all shines through on the DVD. Oh the goodhumor! Well that's something you have to experience.I'm thankful MacPherson made a film. He should have made more. Well anyone who's interested has some writings they can turn to. In fact more than Borderline I'd like to recommend Close Up to the intelligent filmscholar. You'd be surprised how finely clear these writers' thoughts are and you'll get a very good look at the industry of the time and the people who drove it. Worthwhile.P.S. Robeson is really good too.".

	schema:reviewBody "This littleseen experimental film definitely won't be to everyone's taste but I was impressed by how modern it looked apart from the lack of sound it wouldn't have looked out of place in the late1950s early 1960s and the bohemian atmosphere it created. The film makes very little use of intertitles and so the story can be a little tricky to follow at times but it isn't all that complicated and an attentive viewer should be easily able to fill in any gaps along the way.Paul Robeson stars as the husband of a halfcaste woman who has had an affair with a white man in a small village in Switzerland. She has ended the affair but too late to save the marriage and her lover  who is also married  is having trouble coming to terms with the split. The racial tolerance subject matter and message is fairly rare for the time and is handled with a surprising amount of maturity. For the peripheral figures caught up in the fallout from the affair life eventually continues unchanging and the entire film is pervaded with an air of melancholia.Although the story does drag a little at times and the director's choice of shot is sometimes open to question the look and feel of the film and the way it brims with innovative ideas for its time make this worth watching.".

The film makes very little use of intertitles and so the story can be a little tricky to follow at times but it isn't all that complicated and an attentive viewer should be easily able to fill in any gaps along the way.Paul Robeson stars as the husband of a halfcaste woman who has had an affair with a white man in a small village in Switzerland. She has ended the affair but too late to save the marriage and her lover  who is also married  is having trouble coming to terms with the split. The racial tolerance subject matter and message is fairly rare for the time and is handled with a surprising amount of maturity. For the peripheral figures caught up in the fallout from the affair life eventually continues unchanging and the entire film is pervaded with an air of melancholia.Although the story does drag a little at times and the director's choice of shot is sometimes open to question the look and feel of the film and the way it brims with innovative ideas for its time make this worth watching.";

	schema:reviewBody "This experimental silent film made in Switzerland by an independent British film company is chiefly remembered as Paul Robeson's first film.  It's very artistic with shots often seeming meaningless to the story which is difficult to understand anyway because of the lack of enough intertitles. From what I gathered Robeson's wife Adah is in an interracial love affair with a white man called Thorne.  It doesn't bother the cigarchomping owner of the barhotel where Thorne lives and she seems to be having a lesbian relationship with a barmaid but an old lady expresses the town's point of view in an intertitle If I had my way we wouldn't allow negroes in here. Thorne is also called nigger lover by someone in the bar.  Adah tries a reconciliation with Pete Robeson but eventually leaves him.  Thorne's wife Astrid goes off the deep end brandishes a knife cuts Thorne's arm and cheek and somehow dies.  Thorne must have been accused of murder because we learn he was acquitted.  As for Pete he gets a letter from the mayor telling him it is best for everyone that he leave town.  So the film is more about racism than anything but in an up note the owner tells Pete The sad thing is they think they're right.  That's the way we are.  The meaning of the title is a mystery.  It may refer to Adah being lightskinned a borderline negro or to the borderline behavior of of the main characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is very difficult to write a review of this experimental silent film. The people involved in making it in Switzerland are very interesting people for numerous reasons. Of some of them no other moving film images exist. And then there is the strange presence of Paul Robeson in a film without sound so that he has no chance to sing with that magnificent voice as his rendition of 'Ole Man River' in SHOW BOAT 1936 see my review has made so famous to those who might not otherwise have heard of him. During his lifetime he was very famous but memories fade and people are soon forgotten even people as tall forceful and charismatic as he was. Here he appears in numerous shots shooting up at his face shown against clouds in the sky as if he were a god. The director must have had a crush on him. Robeson's wife Eslanda Robeson also appears in the film opposite him which was her only credited appearance in a film she appeared in two later ones uncredited. Apart from the Robesons none of the actors in this film ever appeared in another film. Despite their complete lack of training or experience they all do a really good job. Moral is drama school really necessary? Before describing the largely incomprehensible film itself we need to consider the personalities involved apart from the Robesons whom I have already mentioned. The key figures were the lesbian couple consisting of Hilda Doolittle who wrote under the pseudonym H. D. and Winifred Ellerman who wrote under the pseudonym of Bryher the name of her favourite Scilly Isle. Although Bryher's work is largely forgotten today the poetry of the famous imagist poetess H. D. is very much still in print and continues to be highly regarded not least by myself I must say. I have some of her early publications including one or two signed by her. She and Ezra Pound had a fling when they were young together in Philadelphia. She later moved to London to join Ezra and Dorothy Pound. Dorothy told me that in those days her two closest friends were Hilda Doolittle and GaudierBrzeska and she truly adored them both. Gaudier was at that time having his affair with Nina Hamnett. Hilda lived in the same building with the Pounds for a while in Kensington but she did not follow them to Paris and Rapallo later. Bryher married Robert McAlmon in order to hide from her parents the fact that she was gay. McAlmon was gay himself so the marriage was for show. For an account of all this one should read McAlmon's wonderful memoir BEING GENIUSES TOGETHER. It is very much better to read the original than the heavily edited and hackedabout version by Kay Boyle. In 1927 Bryher tired of McAlmon and divorced him marrying instead Kenneth MacPherson who directed this film and also had been having an affair with H.D. who unlike Bryher was vaguely bisexual. They all lived together. All three of them were filmmad and they founded an arty film magazine called CLOSE UP in 1927 which lasted for a few years. I do not have a complete set of it alas but I do have a bound volume of numerous issues. They also founded an entity of some kind called Pool to make some experimental films of which this is apparently the only survival. They had meanwhile introduced Sergei Eisenstein's films to the Western world. This film has countless examples of jump shots and rapid editing in imitation of Eisenstein's style without the ability to make it work effectively however. But at least MacPherson was trying. They had all seen and been influenced by the earlier silent experimental films of Man Ray and this film is much better than anything he ever achieved on cinema. They were also heavily influenced by the German expressionists as the angles and shots and atmosphere show clearly. To go into all their theories about the cinema would be out of place here as taking too long. This film therefore has historical significance both for the history of experimental filmmaking and for those interested in the people appearing in it and many of those will perhaps have little or no knowledge of or concern for the cinema per se. Lovers of poetry will get a shock when they see Hilda Doolittle because her photos tend to be idealised and serene but when you see her in this you can see how scary and weird she really was. She wrote a lot about ancient Greece which was her chief obsession but if one were to class her as a character at that time one would have to place her amongst the maenads. One wonders whether one would really have wanted to know them. Both they and the film itself and much that they wrote as well concern extremes of passion. I don't have much interest in extreme passions myself being too cerebral perhaps. And anyway extreme passions do take up a lot of time and require a great expenditure of energy which could more profitably be put to use in studying something far more interesting. But this film is nothing but extreme passion shown disjointedly and with insufficient continuity to make out who is really doing what to whom or why. Hilda Doolittle ends up dead which is pretty shocking. It all goes to show that quarrelling lovers should never play with knives. The protracted knife scene in this film is very harrowing. The film also strenuously promotes the cause of black people and as an example of racial prejudice has a little old lady saying that all 'negroes' should be removed from Switzerland immediately another n word is used also which I do not repeat. In the story it seems that Hilda's husband has had an affair with Robeson's wife and it drives them all mad. Most of the film consists of them being overwrought.".

It's just a badly made art filmvery badly made. And because there is no sound you don't get to hear Robeson's gorgeous voicemaking me wonder if there is any reason to see the movie? For me the answer is an emphatic NO! Here are some of the MANY problems I had in watching the film. First as the film lacked a real narrative and had very few captions it was often hard to tell what was happening. And in some cases it looked as if the actors were in the same boat! Several times they moved aboutas if aimlessly wandering in front of a camera with no instruction from the director if there even was one. This was intensified by bad editing. Second the acting was badand it's obvious the folks didn't know the first thing about acting. While Robeson had already appeared in a couple silents he wasn't terribly experienced and lacked his later screen presence. Third the soundtrack provided by Criterion is godawful. It's a cacophonous jazz track that is intense and quite loudand dominates the film. It would be better to see this one with the sound turned all the way downit's that bad.The bottom line is that I love Paul Robeson films but this one is among the 'not read for prime time' films he made. It's definitely a film for the cinemaniac and those who adore his movies and don't mind seeing a terrible filmand this is a terrible movie.FYIThat's Robeson's wife in the film!".

And there were some nice little surprises and twists. The convenience store vignettes were a delight.When I say it is a wonderful small film I don't mean budget or quality. It is simple intimate and handcrafted. It tells a highly believable everyday story. Relax and go see it. Let it wash over you and you will feel good for having done so.".

	schema:headline " Modest Comedy About a Lonely Sad Sack Boasts a Smart Cast to Overcome Its Familiar Premise";
	schema:reviewBody "Any movie that offers Bonnie Hunt Sarah Silverman and Amy Sedaris in the supporting cast has to be well worth watching and comic actor Jeff Garlin takes advantage of the terrific talent he recruited for his 2007 directorial debut a sadsack comedy about an overweight man who feels out of step with the world around him. Familiar as Larry David's manager Jeff on Curb Your Enthusiasm Garlin plays James a stillstruggling 39year old Chicago actor who still lives with his widowed mother. His selfesteem is so low that he can't meet women but it's the comical way he views his single status that makes his dilemma involving. If the storyline sounds a bit familiar that's because the film is partially a tribute to the 1955 Ernest Borgnine classic Marty about a lonely Bronx butcher living with his meddlesome mother. In fact Garlin uses Marty as the play which James is desperate to do since he is so empathetic to the character's situation.Naturally there is a love story of sorts in this new millennium version and Silverman plays Beth an offkilter sexually voracious ice cream parlor server who takes him on an underwear shopping spree. Their best scene together is in his favorite convenience store where they improvise different characters in different aisles. Hunt plays a lonely elementary school teacher who shares a passion with James for jazz musician Ben Webster. They meet accidentally in a record store and then again at a career day at her school where he hilariously exposes his sexual neuroses in front of a classroom of firstgraders including his best friend Luca's pert daughter Penelope played by Dakota Fanning's lookalike baby sister Elle. In a wedgedin cameo and looking quite a bit like Jerri Blank Sedaris plays the school's counselor who speaks to James after his inappropriate monologue. David Pasquesi plays Luca a retirement home manager and his scenes with Garlin have an easy rapport that makes their friendship easy to believe. Almost stealing the movie is character actress Mina Kolb who plays James' pixilated mother with pluck and heart.There are also unexpected cameos from teen idol Aaron Carter and Gina Gershon don't askbut the setup is funny as well as sharply played bits by director Paul Mazursky as the snaky director of a candidcameratype show Smear Job Tim Kazurinsky as the unsuspecting victim of that show and Dan Castellaneta as the toughlove convenience store owner. With his rueful bouts of insecurity and selfloathing Garlin's comic sensibilities resemble those of Albert Brooks and the casual dialogue at its best reminds me of Modern Romance and Defending Your Life. The one persistent problem I had with the film is pacing as some scenes dragged out longer than necessary. The problem is more evident in the first half when Garlin is trying to establish the right tempo and the lack of real conflict adds to the sluggishness. Regardless what he does well is capture that gnawing sense of desperation one feels upon the revelation that life is not what it is supposed to be that a significant other may be out of reach and that a steady diet of junk food eaten on a car hood is the only sure thing when it comes to gratification.".

The laughs keep coming almost every minute. It's a somewhat dramatic and serious story about a man looking for love but done with great comedic writing and acting. The supporting roles are also very well done and very funny and really make the movie rich.Rose Abdoo is hysterical in her receptionist role taking you right into the mood of the rest of the film. Sara Silverman is awesome with some of the great bits she does with Jeff. Bonnie Hunt is classically great in her role. I only wish there was more of her in the film as I think most will agree. It's certainly refreshing to see her in a tight leather outfit.David Pasquesi was the aloof detached sidekick and voice of reason. Mina Kolb plays Jeff's mother who he lives with. There were numerous other cameos all of them done very well.At the premier Jeff mentioned his inability to do more with Bonnie due to production issues. Still it's good to leave you wanting more. I think it's that indie thing of keeping some things ambiguous to let the audience do some thinking for themselves to fill in the blanks. The wordy title should clue you in to this.Jeff said some of the basic characters were based on his past relationships. This explains why they work so well. Real life people are always unusually colorful and makes great characters. He departs quite a bit from what you might expect having seen Curb Your Enthusiasm and some of his other work. It's one of those break out things where an actor takes some risks to do something they maybe always wanted to do but couldn't.I think it's noteworthy that Garlin's improv Second City background and Hunt's for that matter set the style here of acting being the focus of the story and the directing. It's perhaps a new innovative hybrid of improv meets indie filmmaking.".

It's clever and the characters are well rounded and quite honestly the main character is entertaining in his own awkward way. The love interest aspect of the movie actually ends up taking a backseat to this man's somewhat depressing life but the film never stops being a little charming. The problem though is that it's been advertised as a romantic comedy. It's not.Mostly it's a sitcom in the form of a full length feature. Anyone familiar with the formula of Seinfeld or Curb Your Enthusiasm will recognize the setup of many jokes and situations throughout the film Jeff Garlin is a producer and character on CYE so this shouldn't come as a surprise that they're very similar. Even down to the soundtrack. My girlfriend and I picked this one up after seeing the trailer and thought it would be a funny romantic comedy. But as I've already said the relationship aspect to the film is only a side note. Sara Silverman's character gets maybe a total of fifteen minutes on screen and is not anything like the trailer portrays. To make a long story short my girlfriend fell asleep a long while before the movie ended and I while I thought it had it's funny moments and made a decent indie film about the life of a depressed overweight man was a bit disappointed that there wasn't a stronger romantic aspect to it since that's what I was expecting. The movie in its entirety seems like Jeff Garlin's attempt to emulate the style and comedy of Curb Your Enthusiasm with a slightly more truetolife tone. I could see this main character becoming a character in a sitcom and part of me wonders if this wasn't some type of offshoot of a project that was originally intended to be a sitcom or something that Garlin hoped would be well received enough for someone to give him his own show.Six out of ten because of its charm and several funny moments but seriously disappointed with the misleading advertising.".

	schema:headline " Should have been better with this cast";
	schema:reviewBody "Anybody expecting the acerbic wit of Curb Your Enthusiasm due to Jeff Garlin's presence or the belly laughs of Something About Mary due to Sarah Silverman's presence will be sorely disappointed. The film isn't bad but not bad is hardly a recommendation which is a shame because there's some great talent involved. Jeff Garlin seems to have cashed in a lot of favors with Second city alumni and fellow standup comics to help him out on his feature film directorial debut and I'm guessing that none of them will be putting this on their resums. It's got several inspired plot mechanics that go nowhere like the fake cast of Streetcar Named Desire starring Aaron Carter and Gina Gershon who are both great at scene stealing which is quite a feat when you read the laundry list of well known participants but someone should have told director Garlin that cameos do not a film make. The film is essentially without plot and tends to meander from one situational setup to the next without really developing a story. This lends an episodic feel at best and at its worst it comes off as mundane. It seems to be going for an early 90s indiecomedy nostalgia but it lacks the innovation and quite frankly the era that made those films appealing. It's shot well but still has a stagy directtovideo look and the music is so dinnertheater schmaltzy that you'd swear this was shotinCanada it wasn't. The performers are obviously having a good time but the whole project seems to be about ten years past relevance and I for one have always hated watching performers have an obviously better time than their audience but at least nobody is ghost walking through their roles which lends an improvisational spirit even if it goes nowhere. It's not offensively bad it's definitely watchable. But if you have any expectations arising from the supporting cast actors from Little Miss Sunshine Strangers With Candy The Simpsons you'll be more than aggravated that you wasted your time on this rather than rewatching one of those aforementioned titles instead. And with the title I Want Someone To Eat Cheese With they've all but assured that nobody's going to watch it anyways. You can do a lot worse but you can do a whole lot better too.".

The film is a conversation. We might as well be eavesdropping. Rather than go for antics the film relies on character flaws and human curiosity to deliver laughs. While it's not innovative it is far from banal and even if James views himself as being rather jejune we know that he is fairly average and this endears him.Selfbetterment is the primary theme of the movie. Sarah Silverman who plays Beth is excellent as the catalyst of change she revitalizes James and so reminds him to live a better life. Even so achieving some idyllic dream is not the end of these characters but rather something simpler that they might pick up what pieces there are of the life they love just to keep for themselves at least enough to carry on.A movie about life lessons can be overwrought as it can forget to connect with its audience.

	schema:reviewBody "Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce direct finance andor star in their own films who might otherwise not have been able to? Is that a good thing? This film does not answer the latter question either way but it does appear that without Curb Jeff Garlin would not have been able to make I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With. Like most new producersdirectors Jeff Garlin's independent piece heaves a heavily more sensitive sigh than the vehicle he is primarily known for Curb. And yet is it a sensitive guy film? He isn't really a sensitive guy. Likable sure. Relatable indeed. What this film really is about is a bit hard to say I can only relate what I took away from it. I rented the film because of the trailers particularly the scene of a counselor portrayed by Amy Sedaris informing James Aaron Garlin that a particular woman is interested in him mainly because she is a chubby chaser. I just about fell out of my seat. Based on that scene alone I ran to my computer to write a note to myself to rent this movie. The reason  I thought the school counselor Sedaris was talking about Beth portrayed by Sarah Silverman. I imagined a lightish romantic comedy between the foxy Silverman and the fat Garlin. I didn't think the story would be anything original but that the dialogue would be snappy and the scenes would move along at a satisfying pace. In short I thought it would be a comedy. It was intriguing that the film started out that way but then took a much much more realistic turn when Beth gives James the heave ho because I've never really been with a fat guy before. That is how brutally we live life and it was completely realistic. I applaud the decision. It just meant that Beth has now left the building and with her the one snappy person in the film.James's relationship with his mother was also interesting. That part made me wonder if the whole concept did not start out as a play. It had that intricate feel to it. The whole Marty movie within a movie thing was utterly lost on me as I have never seen that film.There were serious doubts I had about the character of James Aaron though. Is it really possible that at 39 he had not had a serious relationship? And he is an actor? That did not really square with me. To me his persona was less actory and more corporate. I could not really buy his ordinariness either. No doubt he was extremely disappointed that things with Beth did not work out. We felt that. But then did he really care? Another thing  how in the world can both he and his mother afford to move out at the same time? Hasn't he just lost his job? The last one he had? That was one reason he did not seem ordinary to me. Where's the funding for his life coming from? And yet I have read reviews that talk about the realistic portrayal of urban loneliness so there is that. Yes it is very realistic the way we must be satisfied with what we have because it is all that we have. The way we sort of disappear from ourselves and each other in interactions James and Stella some kind of selfeffacement that takes place just to move on to the next moment. That contrasted with the possibility of defining ourselves through our moments our thoughts the way James had with Beth it's really crushing.Very well done.".

	schema:reviewBody "I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With reminds me a little bit of World's Greatest Dad. It's marketed as a comedy when really it's a drama. The front cover of the film is quoted in being Hilarious when it's anything but. It's a melodrama that is only chuckle inducing rather than constant hilarity as one may assume. Personally I find nothing funny about a downonyourluck heavy set man going through almost a midlife crisis. I don't find the humor in that.Jeff Garlin stars as James an obese man who's luck has seemed to be at a halt. He works at Second City an improvising show in Chicago and he loses his job lives with his mother his girlfriend leaves him and he sneaks out of his Overeaters Anonymous seminar to go to an ice cream parlor. He meets a plucky and younger woman named Beth Silverman. Beth gives him an ice cream snack she made as practice and even questions James if he's ever done anything kinky.James and Beth hang out the next day and it's beginning to be noticeable that both are getting attracted to one another. James continues to go on with his every day life which involves a goofy show or two and hanging out with his friends. My favorite the clerk played by Dan Castellaneta.The movie tends to hit starts and stops and sometimes seems as if it is not progressing at all. It's short and sweet but Garlin works through the film softly and calmly. He doesn't rely on regular humor most romantic comedies do and it certainly isn't formulaic. Its got the humor of Larry David's show Curb Your Enthusiasm which Jeff also stars in.Shot in eighteen years but spread over the course of almost two years I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With is a strange strange little film with some off the wall humor and some very well crafted characters. I enjoyed Garlin's sweet and simple attitude Silverman's presence and its far from clich ending. This isn't the most eventful romcom but it's one that shows love in a different light. With IFC Films on the cover it is surely far from the Hollywood light.Starring Jeff Garlin Sarah Silverman Bonnie Hunt Dan Castellaneta. Directed by Jeff Garlin.".

But he shares with M. Hulot a polite regard for the welfare of others.The problem with Jeff Garlin a cast member of Chicago's Second City is that he's not particularly handsome and he's overweight. By the way I don't know if it's intentional or not but the Second City sketch we see something about Garlin's being a hillbilly who likes corn is anything but funny. At any rate his weight and his features which are about as interesting as a hardboiled egg don't get him very far with the girls. Invited to speak about himself and his job before a class of kindergartners he announces loudly My problem is that I need to get laid. The little kids sit there dumbly while their teacher's jaw drops. It's one of many cute scenes. Then there is his mother hanging over him predicting his every move and divining his every thought.Then he bumps into Sarah Silverman and begins to get resonant vibes. She's an interesting actress. She does well by a rather complex role. She's attractive too with her vulpine face and her eyes set so close to each other across the bridge of her nose. And she's surprisingly well built. She's trying on underwear in a department store and Garlin is doing his best to sneak sidewise glimpses of her behind the curtain. A sales lady comes to him and asks him to take another pair of bra and panties to your girlfriend. This struck a personal chord because I was once asked to do a similar favor for a beautiful girl I hardly knew. I gulped and complied. I don't know if I should reveal why an attractive young woman like Sarah Silverman should be interested in a nice but plump guy like Jeff Garlin. I guess I won't. It's enough that the next day Garlin goes around with a big smile and tells everyone his mother included that Last night I had sex for the first time in five years. It really IS something like Marty without the drama. There are constant references to Marty throughout the film. Garlin tries out for the part in a local play arguing I AM Marty! But Marty was genuinely in love with the frangible Betsy Blair while Jeff Garlin though he likes Silverman seems mainly interested in sleeping with her. And Garlin smiling and puzzled as he often is never experiences a moment of despair  which is okay with me as far as that goes.It's a pleasant enough way to spend an hour and a half and it has its moments of quirky charm much of them coming from Garlin's oddball friends like a hot dog vendor dressed as a pirate.".

And I love Donald Westlake one of the best writers of light capers on the scene today.  Westlake wrote the novel on which this is based which I seem to recall reading as Enough not A Travesty which is what it says in the credits.  The combination of these two guys is inspired all the better in that Macy cowrote the adaptation and tailored the lead precisely to his acting strengths.  Macy just looks like a typical Westlake hero only as one of the other characters points out he really can't be the hero if he's killed his girlfriend even accidentally.  And he's not really the hero I guess although you do sort of root for him.  Macy plays Jerry Thorpe a notverynice TV film critic whose attempts to evade the consequences of committing an accidental murder get more and more involved as the plot thickens.  It's an antiColumbo where we follow the criminal not the cop and wonder when and how he's going to blow it.  Macy's stayed true to the book adding a lot of character touches and a couple of nifty flourishes.  He even includes a funny reference to one of his own previous pictures Searching for Bobby Fischer.  I guess for me the fun was just watching Macy have so much fun in a leading role like Steve Buscemi he's a terrific character actor who rarely gets the chance to carry a film.  He carries this one and I hope to see him carry more.".

The film also stars Felicity Huffman Adam Arkin James Cromwell Julia Campbell Paul Mazurski and Vincent Pastore.Macy plays a film critic and teacher Terry Thorpe who accidentally kills his girlfriend and becomes frantic to cover up the crime and hide the body. The matter is complicated by a detective Cromwell who saw him at the building and is now attempting to blackmail him.

Constantly twisting and turning the plot sends Macy deeper and deeper into the quicksand of his perfect crime. William H.

He is having an affair with a coworker when she accidentally slips and dies while he is with her.

The PI attempts to blackmail him and Macy whacks him eventually disposing of the body parts in a lake over the side of his girlfriend's sailboat while she is fast asleep after he drugs her wine.Meanwhile the detective Adam Arkin Adam on Northern Exposure befriends Macy who ends up having an affair with the detective's wife.

After I watched it I was not all that thrilled.  Recently I had the chance to watch it a second time with my aunt and once again I was disappointed she didn't like it much either and she'd never read the book.  In this movie they managed to sap all the charm from the book and turn it into dull mush.  A big part of the problem was William H. Macy.  I like him fine in other films but he played TerryCarey Thorpe as a stammering incompetent yutz. In the book Thorpe takes a lot of valium for his nerves but remains outwardly collected at almost all times which is part of the fun.  SPOILERS follow They also left out a big part of the story other than a 2 second glimpse at the embassy where Thorpe solves not 1 but 4 homicides for the police.  This is important not just because it's funny but because it helps set up the relationship between Fred and Thorpe.  In the movie Fred's betrayal in the end is not nearly as affecting because they don't seem all that close.  In the book they become pretty good friends especially on Fred's side which makes it all the more ironic that he is he one that arranges Thorpe's downfall.  Fred also suffered a bit from casting I love Adam Arkin but he was not a cheerful happy to be alive upbeat sort of Detective character traits which book Fred possesses which makes it more obviously out of character for him to mess with evidence and thus more shocking.  Patricia and Edgarson were pretty close to the book and James Cromwell was great despite not looking much like Martin Balsam.  The whole boring boat house scene which was entirely added for the film was much less interesting than the police finding Edgarson's body after Thorpe ships it to Seattle and blaming the death on the mob.  Kit was okay although she was mostly rewritten and it would have been nice to see her die as she did get slightly annoying.  I don't mind changes to books to make movies I know they are necessary because of length and difficulty but it would have been nice if some of the changes in this movie had been funnier or smarter instead of duller.".

	schema:reviewBody "House of wax is a typical slasher in many respects but that does not take away from the certain charm it holds...it has pretty much everything you would want in a horror film.The plot is simple and standard for the genre. We are introduced to a group of young adults on their way to a football game. Carly Jones Elisha Cuthbert a sweet yet sassy girl who is nervous about moving to the city for a new job. Her troublemaking badboy brother Nick Chad Michael Murray supportive best friend Paige Paris Hilton. Along with Carly's sweet and protective boyfriend Wade Jared Padalecki and rounding off the cast Dalton Jon Abrahams proving comic relief and Blake Robert Ri'chard Paige's boyfriend who is really just a token character. whilst hoping to score tickets to the final football game of the season. Along the way they run into some car trouble and are forced to camp in the woods where they enter a desolate town where nothing is what it appears to be. What's nice about House of Wax is its relatively slow burning sure there are some jump scares and creepy moments but the real action does not start until around the 40 minute mark some might call this dull but for me it only makes the third act even more impressive.Despite the little character development the acting is surprisingly good and helps make the characters likable. Jared makes a sympathetic turn as Wade but the real stars are Elisha and Chad. Elisha gives a great performance as Carly and is one of the better lead actresses I've seen in recent horror. She is vulnerable and strong at the same time portraying fear very well indeed. Chad despite his pretty boy image does a good job as the badboy and unlikely hero of the film he is strong and protective and you root for him as he tries to save himself and his sister. The only problem i had with this paring was the high sexual tension there seemed to be between them. There were many moments where you felt as if they were about to kiss and its almost better to just picture them as girlfriend and boyfriend during the final act.The film is of course not perfect the dialog was weak and the big twist was hardly anything surprising as you could have predicted it from the start. The ending tried to give you another twist which again failed in the same way the previous one did....in fact the whole ending was a let down. The characters make very stupid choices through out the film such as not making sure the attacker is dead splitting up etc and whilst these are also a given in slasher films it never stops being annoying. The third act was pretty intense though if a little short but all in all the film is a great fun ride full of scares and tension....also great kills and leads you want to live instead of hoping they would die.".

	schema:headline " Beautifully twisted. Satisfyingly gross.";
	schema:reviewBody "I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it. It's one of the best teenager horror films I've ever seen and that's saying a lot. Nothing is left without an explanation to back it up the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes and it has got nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've been submitted to lately. A clear example is the mindless Saint Ange. The first 3040 minutes might be downright boring with the exception of the beginning although some minor light mistakes can be easily spotted. After the arrival to the village though the horror a different twisted kind of horror begins.With the plot and the details goofs are minor the characters are this movie's strongest point given that so many clichs are broken in it. For example the two main male characters Nick and Wade are not by any means the idiotic types we're used to although Dalton might fit better in this stereotype not is he the only one to pay for this lack of consciousness. Some scenes are truly satisfyingly horrible making up for tense moments scattered around all the film. And in the end and although everything is decorously explained it's easy to see that things won't go so easy to the surviving characters.The only errors I can see and which do not imply continuity IE Carly not finding her own cut finger in the unconscious Bo's pockets is the illumination which is somehow annoying during the first boring 30 minutes. Although plot and effectswise everything is drastically and cruelly twisted with the arrival of the main characters to Ambrosia that little village in the midst of nothing so I'll give it that. It's been pretty much argued that about 70 of the movie is illogical How can two people build an entire house of wax? Where do they get all the wax from?. These wouldn't be uprising questions if people would have paid more attention to the movie. The Sinclair brothers did not build the House of Wax their mother worked making actual wax figures and they were exhibited at the museum. And the scenario where Paris Hilton's unfortunate character meets her untimely death is the answer to the second question what is with all the personal objects mobile phones cars clothes of the dead people? Using their third brother as a connection with the exterior it's pretty much arguable that the Sinclair twins should obtain the money necessary to buy the wax in a WWIItype fashion.So that aside I think the movie deserves a lot more than it gets and nobody should lose the chance to watch it. So go see the House of Wax. Right now.".

While I admit that the movie took it's time getting to the good stuff it was well worth the wait. The special effects department have outdone themselves.

Elisha Cuthbert was also good but the best performance has to go to Brian Van Holt. He played the bad guy too well I mean he was sick sadistic and very cruel. The back story between the brothers was good plus I liked how no killings took place until about 40 minutes into the film. It gave you time to pick the character you wanted to see live and the one you wanted to see die. Jon Abrahams was pretty good as the goofy best bud of CMM. I liked how Chad kind of cried when he found him dead it was better then just him being like Whatever my buddy is dead who cares. It showed how he really cared. So overall this was a darn god slasher with some great effects. Bravo!".

	schema:reviewBody "While HOUSE OF WAX will never be mistaken for Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE or HALLOWEEN it does try and ultimately succeed in being a worthy addition to quality horror film making. There is enough tension and enough implied gore in here to please the young audience of today and there is also enough explicit gore to please some of the purists of yesterday. Overall it is quite a well done film that should do okay on DVD.Six kids on the way to a football game get stranded in a DELIVERANCE like setting and what ensues actually looks like it may have been taken out a discarded Deilverance sequel and the backwoods hicks seem to taunt the group. Eventually the group has to break up and half of them head into the desolate town to get some car parts. The other half of the group stays behind at camp and this sets up the second half of the film.House of Wax has many strengths. The first is that it is blessed with a very likable cast. Paris Hilton is fine in her role but she is far from the focal point. Chad Michael Murray Elisabeth Cuthbert and Brian Van Holt are three very charismatic actors and their presence in the film adds some panache some credibility and some flair. I had never really heard of Chad Michael Murray only that he was a pinup type teen heartthrob. But he has a presence to him. He imbues an intangible to him that seems to translate into his performance. He is instantly likable and he possesses a strong character trait. I enjoyed his performance much more than I figured I would and when he was on screen the film flowed.The question now becomes Is this film a worthy horror film? And the answer to that is a resounding YES. As I mentioned off the top it is not in the same class a NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET or LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT or even THE RING but it is relatively tense quite graphic and there are some very inventive death scenes. This is not the HOUSE OF WAX that your parents told you about. Vincent Price is nowhere to be seen and when you start seeing fingers being cut off and hot wax covering comatose bodies you realize this film is a little on the edge.I'd like to see an uncut director's X rated version. I bet there is one out there somewhere that would be much more violent than this one. Be that as it may this is a very good entry into the horror genre and it is heads and shoulders above weak films like I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and DARK WATER and a few others. It is definitely worth a look.810".

	onyx:emotionText "While HOUSE OF WAX will never be mistaken for Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE or HALLOWEEN it does try and ultimately succeed in being a worthy addition to quality horror film making. There is enough tension and enough implied gore in here to please the young audience of today and there is also enough explicit gore to please some of the purists of yesterday. Overall it is quite a well done film that should do okay on DVD.Six kids on the way to a football game get stranded in a DELIVERANCE like setting and what ensues actually looks like it may have been taken out a discarded Deilverance sequel and the backwoods hicks seem to taunt the group. Eventually the group has to break up and half of them head into the desolate town to get some car parts. The other half of the group stays behind at camp and this sets up the second half of the film.House of Wax has many strengths. The first is that it is blessed with a very likable cast. Paris Hilton is fine in her role but she is far from the focal point. Chad Michael Murray Elisabeth Cuthbert and Brian Van Holt are three very charismatic actors and their presence in the film adds some panache some credibility and some flair. I had never really heard of Chad Michael Murray only that he was a pinup type teen heartthrob. But he has a presence to him. He imbues an intangible to him that seems to translate into his performance. He is instantly likable and he possesses a strong character trait. I enjoyed his performance much more than I figured I would and when he was on screen the film flowed.The question now becomes Is this film a worthy horror film? And the answer to that is a resounding YES. As I mentioned off the top it is not in the same class a NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET or LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT or even THE RING but it is relatively tense quite graphic and there are some very inventive death scenes.

House of wax Is the story of a group of college kids on their way to a football game whom decide to camp out for the night and have a run in with a local weirdo. Upon waking the next morning they make a gruesome discovery and decide to go into town for a broken car part. The town is creepy and I'm just gonna stop there. Because thats when the truly gruesome mayhem begins. trust me when I say if your looking for a horror film go see this you will love it. It's wonderfully diabolical and inventive with it's killing scenes the story is interesting and the characters are decently drawn with the actors giving them gobs of personality. Paris Hilton included whom does quite well with her part. the film lies a little on the shallow side but it's so much fun and who cares. This movie should eat up the box office and all horror fans should have part in it. Go see House of Wax the film that features skin being peeled super glued lips dead animal carcasses hot wax sprayed on a still living person a finger being cut off a decapitation a pole through the head and much more. I was lucky enough to witness this film at the Tribeca premiere and all the actors were on hand to promote the film. And boy do they have something to be proud of House of wax is the scariest roller coater ride of the year! 910".

	schema:reviewBody "I typically prefer more underground horror films to the recent run of theatrical teenietheater trash and remakes that have bombarded the cinemas recently...but honestly even with all it's faults and annoyances  the HOUSE OF WAX remake wasn't too bad. I did hate the cast made up of your typical pretty and popular Hollywood postteens in typical and ununique stereotypical roles the toughguy loner rebel the goofy but semihip dork thrown in for comic relief the slut the tough but innocent female lead the nosy boyfriend and of course the token black guy.... But of course these films aren't typically praised for their performances or originality  so I won't bitch too much. Also it's been far too long since I've watched the original HOUSE OF WAX for me to compare the two  so I'll rate this one strictly on its own merits or lack thereof....Six kids in two cars are on their way to an outoftown football game. They camp for the night and have a brief runin with a weirdo in a pickup truck. When they wake up one of the cars has a busted belt. 4 of the six continue on to the game the other two decide to head to a small nearby town instead to get the part they need. Of course the town isn't what it seems  and when the two discover a strange wax museum things start to go nuts as the towns secrets are revealed...HOUSE OF WAX drags on for the first fifty minutes or so but not so badly that it'll put you to sleep  especially if you sit around with a few friends and make fun of Paris Hilton and the toughguy and the other dildo's on display here. But once things get moving the film stays pretty fastpaced for the rest of the run time. There are actually some very decent kill and gore scenes  much stronger than I would have expected for such a film Paris Hilton's demise and the baseballbat facesmash being particularly notable... and are most of the reason this film gets an OK rating from me. No actual tits or ass so sleaze fans will be disappointed. A good bit of typical horror clich jumps and twists which I find annoying but are nothing out of the ordinary for this type of production. An OK way to blow a couple of hours  theatrical and younger horror fans will probably dig it a lot and may appeal to more hardcore horror fans due to a few relatively gruesome moments. 710".

While Cursed Hide and Seek The Ring Two and The Amityville Horror all showed glimpses of interest and potential there have been more misses than hits. For proof see White Noise Boogeyman The Jacket Mindhunters and Alone in the Dark. Imagine my surprise when House of Wax tightly written by siblings Chad and Carey Hayes turned out to be... well a surprise.Carly Jones Elisha Cuthbert is a young woman traveling with her troublemaking brother Nick Chad Michael Murray and boyfriend Wade Jared Padalecki. They are along with Paige Paris Hilton Blake Robert Ri'chard and Dalton Jon Abrahams hoping to score tickets to the final football game of the season. Along the way they run into some car trouble and are forced to enter a desolate town where nothing is what it appears to be.Upon hearing of this a remake of the classic Vincent Price Bmovie I rolled my eyes. I did not even want to think about what disaster freshman director Jaume Serra had cooked up for his audience. In a time when most highprofile horror films are disappointments latent with bad writing static direction and amateur acting I consider myself lucky that Serra and the Hayes brothers took it upon themselves to make a good oldfashioned spook fest. Unlike the disappointments that I named before this flick pulls no punches and uses every cinematic trick in the book to give everyone exactly what they came for.I am happy that the Hayes' actually took the time and effort to create likable and believable characters thus making the events that much more urgent. It also gives the young actors portraying them something grip on. As she did in The Girl Next Door Elisha Cuthbert proves to audiences what a skilled actress she really is. In the 2003 remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Jessica Biel silenced naysayers by delivering a raw and emotional performance one that put the viewer right there with her. Here Cuthbert does the same. Chad Michael Murray A Cinderella Story in one of his first more mature roles is no slacker as Nick. Murray exudes charisma and a hard edge as well as some impressive athleticism on top of it. Murray and Cuthbert gel perfectly and have tangible familial chemistry.More so than anything else the press and the American public have made a field day about Paris Hilton's major acting debut. As I expected Hilton does not embarrass herself. In fact she is just as good as anyone else in the movie do with that what you will. Like Cuthbert and Murray Hilton has screen presence. She is sexy and playful. I cannot think one of reason why she's gotten the worst of the film's harsh reception other than they are simply picking on her. Jared Padalecki TV's 'Gilmore Girls' memorably manages to overcome his underwritten role. Robert Ri'chard TV's 'Cousin Skeeter' and Jon Abrahams Meet the Parents do not have much to work with but get the job done. With only one scene Damon Herriman Soar makes an unforgettable impression and his presence hangs over the rest of the film. Finally Brian Van Holt Basic is superb and threatening in a dual role.Once more kudos must go to the screenwriters for avoiding clichs whenever possible. Despite popular opinion House of Wax is quite unpredictable for a majority of its running time. Take this for example It seems as if the killer is down for the count and Carly bends down to retrieve something from his pockets. What do you expect to happen? See the movie and you will understand what I mean. It is also refreshing to see a horror film in which the characters show even a modicum of good sense.Unlike most horror scores John Ottman's exhilarating work never distracts. However as with Dark Castle's other releases the visual aspects of Wax are awardworthy and lift the film above its genre trappings. The talents of cinematographer Stephen F. Windon production designer Graham Walker art director Nicholas McCallum and editor Joel Negron highlight the ghoulish imagery. Speaking of imagery I believe that the gore hounds will be thrilled with the many makeup effects and tricks in store here. Each death scene is more stomach churning than the last. Considering his past in music videos and commercials it is obvious that Jaume Serra has a great eye for style. His inyourface approach is a great asset to this film's success. Just when you think the camera will turn away it does not. He is also particularly good a building thick layers of dread and atmosphere. One standout shot is our introduction to the killer as he slowly emerges from a trap door.In a case like this I would usually admit when I am in the minority Shut up okay? I liked House of 1000 Corpses!. In this case I firmly that the detractors have gotten it wrong. I am not sure why people are so hard on this film considering it's much better than recent genre entries. Maybe they're afraid to admit that a horror flick starring Paris Hilton could possibly be worth watching... Who knows? This is a horror film and a commendably stylish and effective one at that. As a lifelong horror fan all I can say is that I thoroughly enjoyed House of Wax in all of its lurid and sadistic glory. I safely consider it a great accomplishment in modern horror as well as along with Sin City the first completely satisfying release of 2005.".

	schema:headline " Very Entertaining!";
	schema:reviewBody "I've never seen the original House Of Wax so I really didn't know what to expect when I went to a sneak preview of the new film. After a somewhat wobbly start introducing our young characters House Of Wax shifts gears and becomes an extremely effective horror outing.The plot really doesn't matter too much here  I think most people know upon seeing this that these stranded kids are going to meet up with a nasty killer and find some awful things in the titular house of wax. It's all about the special effects here and they are top notch. Viewers who like their horror movies with lots of blood will be satisfied here but there are other ghoulish effects as well. The production design and sets are excellent and the cast makes the most of their underwritten roles.Of course many people are probably wondering just how Paris Hilton's performance is. To be honest Hilton acquits herself quite well and she doesn't portray herself as so many people are predicting. Her character is sexy and sweet and I think her good work will hopefully change a lot of people's opinions about her. Elisha Cuthbert is also good moving up from her previous movie the atrocious The Girl Next Door. Her character is put through a lot and Cuthbert proves to be a feisty heroine. Chad Michael Murray like Hilton and Cuthbert is pretty to look at but unfortunately is not very convincing as the bad boy of the group.I predict good things for House Of Wax as the audience at the screening I attended hollered screamed and clapped through out many parts of the movie. Congrats to the cast and crew for a job well done.And a congrats to Paris Hilton for proving a lot of people wrong. Like she always says  That's hot.".

	onyx:emotionText "I've never seen the original House Of Wax so I really didn't know what to expect when I went to a sneak preview of the new film. After a somewhat wobbly start introducing our young characters House Of Wax shifts gears and becomes an extremely effective horror outing.The plot really doesn't matter too much here  I think most people know upon seeing this that these stranded kids are going to meet up with a nasty killer and find some awful things in the titular house of wax. It's all about the special effects here and they are top notch. Viewers who like their horror movies with lots of blood will be satisfied here but there are other ghoulish effects as well. The production design and sets are excellent and the cast makes the most of their underwritten roles.Of course many people are probably wondering just how Paris Hilton's performance is. To be honest Hilton acquits herself quite well and she doesn't portray herself as so many people are predicting. Her character is sexy and sweet and I think her good work will hopefully change a lot of people's opinions about her. Elisha Cuthbert is also good moving up from her previous movie the atrocious The Girl Next Door. Her character is put through a lot and Cuthbert proves to be a feisty heroine.

After seeing sneak peaks for BOOGEYMAN Horrible! 310 and Amityville Remake soso 610 I enjoyed this a lot more! As seen in the trailer one knock I had was believing that a whole town could be forgotten but this is a cheesy popcorn horror movie so I accept it for what it is.My only major complaint is I assumed Paris Hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc. and moan that's hot but they didn't do that how could they resist???.There is NO nudity from the 2 girls although Paris looks great in her lingerie! I'm surprised they didn't put a 3rd hot token victim in the movie for some needless nudity which is the norm for this type of flick! I won't list any death or plot spoilers BUT I will say that Paris  Eliza both get roughed up good! The characters are developed decently and are somewhat likable not like Cabin Fever where you wanted them to die and the movie has a decent pace although nothing happens in the 1st 30 minutes like most horror films.I give it a 810 as it delivered good scares and gore and I had low expectations going into it. If you go with some friends that like cheesy horror movies you'll have a good time.Noah".

Or maybe even dreadful. But in my opinion all of this doesn't matter a bit. And thats because i had a great time watching this movie.Sure the first 40 minutes are pretty slow but as the movie progresses something in it you will like if you are like I was and anybody else should be when watching this movie. And that is looking for 2 hours of fun mindless violence. And a kickass ending which i won't spoil. Yes there are many flaws in this movie but don't let the cast list on the front cover fool you. Hilton delivers a decent performance that nobody saw coming. Even her greatest haters like me and my friends had to agree that she surprised us greatly with her barely believable acting skills and a striptease that wasn't as nasty as anything an online popup would promise of her but still not so unbearable as to fastforward or turn off the DVD.The violence in this surprised me nobody at school or on the horror board was talking about it like they were about these new movies called 'Saw' and 'Hostel' but I could safely say that Wax was more graphic than Saw and some death scenes were actually quite disturbing.In conclusion I'm not surprised House of Wax didn't make a place on the IMDb Top 250 but it is definitely worth a look.".

	schema:reviewBody "House of Wax is a very formulaic horror movie it follows all of the formulas that are used in modern slashers but it still manages to keep itself entertaining and enjoyable enough for any horror fan to enjoy it. The film is about a group of teenagers are on their way to a college football game. They stop in the woods and set up a camp and party all night hoping to leave early the next morning. A strange person in a truck arrives during their partying and one of the kids throws a beer bottle smashing out a headlight. The next day they find that one of their cars is broken so the group splits up most of them leaving for the game and the rest stay behind to head to an old abandoned town where there is a magnificent wax museum and all kinds of odd things. But little do they know the entire town is one giant wax museum  each wax sculpture an actual corpse coated with a thick layer of wax...This movie was really clichd in some instances but it was still entertaining on many levels. The cast was good and surprisingly Paris Hilton can actually act  she's not amazing but she pulled it off better than I expected. Elisha Cuthbert is actually a pretty good actress too and I was rooting for her throughout the whole movie. The chemistry between her character and her twin brother Nick was kind of awkward though. They seemed more like exboyfriendgirlfriend but that's a minor problem really. Chad Michael Murry is Cuthbert's opposite twin brother and Jared Padalecki plays Carly's polite boyfriend.Really the most remarkable thing that I picked out of this film was the wax town Ambrose. It was a really atmospheric and spooky location and the wax figures were interesting too. The finale in the melting wax museum had some great visuals probably my favorite scene from the whole movie. There's some decent and realistic gore in the film as well but it doesn't go too far overboard and has it's limits. This film obviously ripped off the 1979 culthorror film Tourist Trap go back and watch that and you will notice the many similarities between the two. According to IMDb though this film is a semiremake of that film no surprise there.Bottom line  House of Wax is a pretty formulaic slasher movie but it does what it's supposed to do and it manages to be a pretty entertaining movie nonetheless. Expect a routine slasher movie that is slightly better than most and don't forget to look out for the nicely done Whatever Happened To Baby Jane? theater scene. I enjoyed it for it's creativeness and the nicely told story  most horror fans won't be disappointed with it. 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although not strictly a remake House of Wax is the latest in the recent trend of Hollywood plundering old horror titles and repackaging them for a new younger audience. The story is as formulaic as you'd expect six good looking young people go on a road trip for a big college football game only to become stranded in a forest by nightfall. The next morning they find that their car has broken downbeen sabotaged so searching for help this brings them to an isolated town that is home to the roadside attraction the House of Wax. Here they meet a strange yet friendly local called Bo Brian Van Holt who is hiding a sinister secret and well you can probably guess the rest.The group is led by Carly Elisha Cuthbert her bad boy twin brother Nick Chad Michael Murray their friend Paige Paris Hilton the rest of the friends are all fairly one dimensional and therefore doomed. As the teens try to get help in the town they soon discover that it has long been deserted and is now being run by the sadistic Bo and his deformed twin brother Vincent who have been immortalizing their victims as wax sculptures all over the town. Each teen is killed in a more brutal way until it is only Carly and Nick left to face off against Bo and Vincent.I'll admit I went into this one with very low expectations it has Paris Hilton in it for God's sake. But I was pleasantly surprised Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray both work hard with the material their given which isn't much but both are convincing in their roles. Elisha Cuthbert gives a good Sigourney Weaver Jamie Lee Curtis heroine performance and Murray is good as the brooding bad boy. Fortunately for the film Paris Hilton is only a minor character in the films plot she's kept away from the action most of the time and only pops up to make a few in jokes about her infamous sex tape and then to meet her demise.The film does have its faults though it's very slow starting and tries desperately to create backstorys about characters you don't care too much for. In fact it's almost a third into the movie before a murder happens. Also the ending with twins versus twins seemed to be trying to be something more profound. The fact that the screenwriters are twins may be a clue but I have a twin brother myself and I couldn't work it out.Serra a first time film director does do a nice job though especially with making the murders extremely graphic and inventive. There are no simple splatters of blood but more horrific incidents such as having your achilles tendon cut skin peeled off and fingers chopped off. All these are done in close up with cringe inducing sound affects that will delight any horror fan. The special effects in the last twenty minutes as the House of Wax begins to burn are also very impressive and show clear influences from producer Robert Zemeckis.If your a big fan of Horror films you'll love this if not just leave your brain at the door and enjoy yourself.".

	schema:headline " Yet another remake";
	schema:reviewBody "Most of you who keep track of my reviews know my opinion of remakes. If you can't take the existing material and improve on the original idea then don't waste the movie going public's time. Naturally when I heard that a remake of the 1953 Vincent Price camp classic House of Wax was being made..and starring Paris HILTON for God's sake I naturally assumed that this was going to be an epic suckfest just as every other remake for the past few years.I couldn't have been more wrong. The 2005 version of House of Wax is a suspenseful savage overly gory horror film that really packs a wallop. Director Jaume Serra has created an atmospheric film that once it gets going is relentless in it's goal to scare the hell out of you.Plot line is fairly simple by the book horror film. Group of kids go on a trip in this case a football game stop to camp in the backwoods and end up running into a vicious killer. In this case a man and his separated Siamese twin take over the work done by their mother turning an entire town which conveniently has been forgotten by the world into wax. Once the somewhat stereotypical characters wander into this town after having car trouble the viciousness begins and never relents.The lovely and talented Elisha Cuthbert leads the cast as Carly a young woman who is about to begin her new life in New York interning at a popular magazine. She heads off to a football game with her boyfriend Wade Jared Padalecki his friend Blake Robert Ri'chard and his girlfriend Paige Paris Hilton. Also along for the ride is Carly's troublemaking brother Nick Chad Michael Murray in a great characterization and his buddy Dalton Jon Abrahams. Nick steals the movie but Carly more than holds her own especially given the extreme brutality she endures during the last half of the movie. Blake and Dalton's characters were really throw away I could have easily lived without them but Paris never detracted from the film at all. In fact up till her well publicized death she got very little screen time.As I stated earlier this was an extremely gory film. The death scenes are not only very creative but very explicit in their onscreen execution. In fact this movie's savagery is rivaled only by Saw in terms of graphic.I went into the theater expecting this movie to be horrible I walked out two hours later feeling drained and breathless. Surprisingly good remake and not for the squeamish.3 out of 5".

	onyx:emotionText "Most of you who keep track of my reviews know my opinion of remakes. If you can't take the existing material and improve on the original idea then don't waste the movie going public's time. Naturally when I heard that a remake of the 1953 Vincent Price camp classic House of Wax was being made..and starring Paris HILTON for God's sake I naturally assumed that this was going to be an epic suckfest just as every other remake for the past few years.I couldn't have been more wrong. The 2005 version of House of Wax is a suspenseful savage overly gory horror film that really packs a wallop. Director Jaume Serra has created an atmospheric film that once it gets going is relentless in it's goal to scare the hell out of you.Plot line is fairly simple by the book horror film. Group of kids go on a trip in this case a football game stop to camp in the backwoods and end up running into a vicious killer. In this case a man and his separated Siamese twin take over the work done by their mother turning an entire town which conveniently has been forgotten by the world into wax. Once the somewhat stereotypical characters wander into this town after having car trouble the viciousness begins and never relents.The lovely and talented Elisha Cuthbert leads the cast as Carly a young woman who is about to begin her new life in New York interning at a popular magazine. She heads off to a football game with her boyfriend Wade Jared Padalecki his friend Blake Robert Ri'chard and his girlfriend Paige Paris Hilton. Also along for the ride is Carly's troublemaking brother Nick Chad Michael Murray in a great characterization and his buddy Dalton Jon Abrahams. Nick steals the movie but Carly more than holds her own especially given the extreme brutality she endures during the last half of the movie. Blake and Dalton's characters were really throw away I could have easily lived without them but Paris never detracted from the film at all. In fact up till her well publicized death she got very little screen time.As I stated earlier this was an extremely gory film. The death scenes are not only very creative but very explicit in their onscreen execution. In fact this movie's savagery is rivaled only by Saw in terms of graphic.I went into the theater expecting this movie to be horrible I walked out two hours later feeling drained and breathless. Surprisingly good remake and not for the squeamish.3 out of 5";

	schema:reviewBody "My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film. I have got to say that I think everyone was impressed with how good this movie was. Though my roommate didn't care for it but he's not into horror movies anyway and just went to see if Paris Hilton can act. By the way if you're worried about that don't be. I'm not exactly one of her fans but I must be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene. Overall all the actor's were very good. I'm not gonna go into detail for the plot since I'm sure you know about it. Surpirsisngly the characters are pretty engaging and you actually care for them especially Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray's characters. We meet them as rival siblings and end with them having to work together. Another plus is that it does not have the sleek look of Amityville Horror or Texas Chainsaw Massacre and feels almost documentarylike rather than a music video Don't get me wrong I loved Texas Chainsaw and enjoyed Amityville.Now for the death scenes. In most slasher movies whenever a character is stabbed or killed the scene immediately cuts away to another scenebut not in this one. When a character is about to die they die pretty gruesomely. But the filmmakers don't stop there and add a little something extra each time for each victim. I won't say anything about the death scenes and will let you see them for yourself.While this is a great slasher movies it does have the flaws of almost all slasher films exploring a creepy house when you shouldn't be getting a ride with a suspicious character splitting up and screaming so the killer can hear you. Also there is a kinda stupid plot twist that was unnecessary and didn't add to the film at all. You could tell it was just added in at the last moment and if you took it out it would not have affected the movie at all.Basically if you are a horror film fan see this movie. You will not be disappointed. It's got all that's needed to make it a great slasher film possibly the best of the year even though it's kinda early. The suspense is felt and it is at times a funny movie. If you hate horror films chances are you may like this one and if you are divided I encourage you to give it a shot.".

	schema:reviewBody "A group of friends on their way to a college football game fall afoul of a pair of killers who trap them in a town made entirely out of wax except for the eerie wax figures may actually be more real than they look.The premise is fairly simple and not that original. Recent horror films like Wrong Turn and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre have already covered this territory. However this doesn't stop House of Wax from being an enjoyable and entertaining horror film. For starters the story and characters have a lot more depth than recent slasher films. Instead of just rushing into the murders the film moves at a slow pace and actually introduces the characters. The audience will actually feel sympathy for them later on since they aren't all one dimensional. Jaume Serra keeps the first half of the film bloodless yet still engaging and he manages to make the second half pretty suspenseful. I'm glad he took this route and it made the film a lot better than I was expecting.The acting is pretty good for this type of film with the best being Elisha Cuthbert. Her performance isn't amazing but she's easy to like and she also has an engaging quality that draws the viewer's attention to her. Chad Michael Murray gives an okay performance nothing special. Jared Padalecki also gives an okay performance again nothing special. Paris Hilton just plays herself and she does an okay job. However she's easily the worst out of everyone. Jon Abrahams just gives an annoying performance and his character isn't really needed.While the characters are developed some of them are still kind of stupid. I know this is a horror film but some of their actions just left me confused. There were a lot of don't do that moments but this was kind of expected. The death scenes were pretty nice and stylish. There were some creative ones that are worth checking out. The killers looked scary and they were pretty effective. The ending was kind of disappointing though. I loved watching the whole museum melt down and it looked awesome but the ending still felt a little to simple. Also I hope they do make a sequel since they left it open for one. In the end House of Wax is a solid horror film that's worth checking out. Rating 710".

Monkey tries his best to battle them but is overwhelmed knowing his master is in grave danger he uses his trusty golden staff to thrust Tripitaka to safety.The monk ends up being knocked out when he land and when he wakes up he finds himself in the presence of a young lizard imp named Maiyan who takes quite a shine to our young hero after many verbal misunderstandings Maiyan becomes convinced Tripitaka loves her so when the monk decides he must rescue Monkey and the others she insists on accompanying him. So the mismatched pair begins their adventure together.REVIEW Okay so it's another Journey To The West movie which isn't a bad thing to me since I love the story and the characters associated with it so I was a little excited to get my hands on the DVD. So I think I'll start off my review with the story which is all over the place at first it was your standard fantasy film then it became a ridiculous comedy then suddenly became full blown scifi if the director Jeff Lau was experimenting with mixing genres then he did a pretty scatological job with this movie. I think it's a pretty unique approach by having the story centre on a character other then the infamous Monkey King especially taking a character as pacifistic as Tripitaka and then putting him into what is at it's core a love story. So overall I liked it.The acting is for the most part solid with leads Nicholas Tse and Charlene Choi putting in some really good performances though Ah Char does spend most of her screen time behind some rather ugly make up. The supporting cast is nicely put together it includes all the usual EEG main stays so Boy'Z and Isabella Leong make appearances one actor I'd like to mention is Wilson Chen who plays the Monkey King he did a good job with the limited material he seemed to have been given he played a version of the Monkey King who was subdued yet arrogant I had a feeling he'd be retreading Twins Effect II territory but fortunately that's not the case here. I hope he gets to do a follow up to this with himself in the central role since the film does leave itself open for a sequel.Okay so let's get down to the directing which again is kinda all over the place Lau gives too much time to the Stephen Chowesquire nonsense comedy which includes a scene where Tripitaka in order to toughen himself up dresses up as SpiderMan which I assume lead to many a head scratching moment since the film is meant to be set in Ancient China. He does create some really nice and tender moments between the two leads and does delve into sappy territory but this reviewer does enjoy a bit of sap on occasion so it didn't bother me in the slightest.Right now onto the CGI which for the most part is quite bearable there are a lot of moments which probably belong on a PS2 like many other reviews have stated but there are some cool moments particularly the scene in which Monkey battles a flying minion. A lot of the CG gags are provided in the form of the golden staff which turns into a range of different things ranging from a giant fly swatter to a mech suit straight out of The Matrix Revolutions. So yeah it sounds crazy but I guess you'd have to see it to believe it.Right so in closing A Chinese Tall Story isn't a movie without it's flaws but it keeps itself together long enough to be able to entertain and generally be a overall enjoyable movie. If all of the above doesn't swing you to see it how about I put it this way it's much better then Twins Effect II.".

A lot of the CG gags are provided in the form of the golden staff which turns into a range of different things ranging from a giant fly swatter to a mech suit straight out of The Matrix Revolutions. So yeah it sounds crazy but I guess you'd have to see it to believe it.Right so in closing A Chinese Tall Story isn't a movie without it's flaws but it keeps itself together long enough to be able to entertain and generally be a overall enjoyable movie. If all of the above doesn't swing you to see it how about I put it this way it's much better then Twins Effect II.";

This is a comedy movie and its all about the story the beautiful scenarios clothing the jokes the acting originality. The story is very funny and original besides the director is one of the most recognized of Chinese culture. It also have the background stories and legends of Chinese folklore like journey to the west among others so there are many layers of meaning about the jokes and the story. Its a silly story but it also has its deepness and tenderness. The CGI are used only for the sake of the story the director Jeffrey Lau and many folk stories like this in Chinese cinema have an approach of cinema more like a theatre play not like a hoolywood movie that want to impress with special effects. So you have to expect very cheesy and bad CGI. I put 10 stars not because it's perfect movie but because it's so underrated that it hurts its the kind of movie that many people who aren't aware of Chinese cinema tradition will rate it as garbage. An extremely original fun and even beautiful at moments experience for me.".

The movie relies heavily on CGI effects but no more than the Matrix or Star Wars movies. The two leads are likable and they encounter many interesting characters along their journey. There are a few tongue in cheek moments but thankfully the characters don't interact with their audience.

While some similarity does come to pass the awkwardlytitled newer film has more to do with stuff from the first half of this decade namely goofball comedies like The Lion Roars and Himalaya Singh. And when we tell you that Tall Story's not even as accomplished as those that should be enough to seal its fate and consign the thing to that dubious realm of halfbaked movie projects hovering somewhere between the recycle and bargain bins.Not wanting to be harsh really but how can we possibly gloss over a meager story that's clearly never intended to become anything remotely attractive instead playing distant runnerup to visual stimulants that quite frankly not only seem like true lifts out of Tsui Hark's Legend of Zu 2001 but also add nothing to the pantheon of video bonanzas when considering much older fare to wit Storm Riders yes some eight years ago if memory serves us right.Indeed Tall Story compiles various components in a feeble attempt to sway audiences but sadly possesses nary a bona fide element worthy of acclaim save perhaps for the surprising amount of gore evident throughout. Considering its kidfriendly rating one must surely feel satisfied with the producers' decision to go ahead and include several instances of such sheer carnage.The main issue with Jeff Lau's latest project is that unlike his own heartfelt but humorous Chinese Odyssey 2002 Tall Story plays out a connectthedots scenario thus leaving folks with almost no tangible merits to cling on to. And with its focus on effects not coming up roses due to their rather formulaic execution the movie perhaps could have hoped for increased reliance on a strong cast. Alas it has none.Nicholas Tse flies in from leftfield in his second release of the season hot on the heels of alsoran likewisefailed The Promise. Here reformed rebel Tse plays naughty Buddhist monk Tripitaka on a pilgrimage to hallowed city Shache which turns out to be yet another stereotypical portrayal of what moviegoers in China today are supposed to expect India to look like. Thus the place comes nestled around some hills and you get people dancing in the streets to the merry tune of offscreen snake tamers. Whoa as Neo would probably have quipped.Tirpitaka's in town with his apostles or hangerson questing to obtain ancient knowledge on their way to nirvana. The three stooges accompanying him Steven Cheung Chen Bo Lin and Kenny Kwan could have passed for the Monkey King's posse were they actually good for anything but as the picture stands all receive very little play and produce next to no effect.Later monk and holy city come under attack from nefarious evil forces known as the Tree Spirits although they don't mind being called Insomnia 'cause that's the baddie from Legend of Zu their obvious source of inspiration. At least these mean ugly bastards look passable on screen more than can be said for much of the film's video contingent.Literally shot out of harm's way Tripitaka falls into the custody of a deviant clan of reprobate imps especially assigned caretaker Meiyan who's under orders from her mom to eat the pilgrim for his fountain of youthlike flesh. Meiyan's cavewoman visage should be enough to send anyone packing and we're meant to observe her as the embodiment of everything repulsive played by Charlene Choi of Twins and hey we're not saying anything. Naturally as the wouldbe plot progresses that turns out to be quite misleading.Mostly the bulk of this story revolves around Tripitaka and the nasty devilish imps as they try to subvert him away from righteousness. This leads to numerous gags and routines that truly arrive at scant funny conclusions. Even likable Isabella Leung Bug Me Not makes no difference at all.Other influences on the story include a spacefaring aristocratic beauty Fan Bingbing who returns to earth in order to combat the overzealous Tree Spirits with her armada of googleyeyed Ultraman clones. Again these guys do look OK and also serve to garnish Tall Story with its muchvaunted SF categorization something most genrepurists understandably enough have been balking and hurling at.Additionally we witness one slightly courageous scene where Tripitaka a prettified Meiyan now looking like Charlene Choi minus the heavy makeup and hey we're still not saying anything plus everyone else takes on the Yellow Emperor himself. On the offchance Lau wants us to deem it as some sort of sly political comment well all the more power to him but it remains highly doubtful.That about sums up the extent of A Chinese Tall Story and here's hoping the next one soars taller. It's too bad the last big HK release of the year doesn't deliver on its promises of action laughs frights and CG superlatives. With a bland often dragging storyline characters that don't really go anywhere and sights of a distinctly average persuasion we can't honestly issue a recommendation and it doesn't matter if the folks involved in this project wanted it to come out right and gave their best.And shouldn't it have been a tall tale anyway?

The evil force wants the monk because if you eat him you will live forever. The retainers battle the forces of darkness before forcibly sending the monk off for safety The monk thinks he can win simply by reasoning with the bad guys. The monk ends up with a bunch of lizard imps who plan at some point eating him... however the bad guys arrive and he's off an odyssey with the ugliest of the lot.Can a movie that starts off the rails go off the rails? Don't get me wrong I really liked this movie but its so scatter shot and all over the place that plot and logic simply fall away as some scenes simply pick up mid action with no way of knowing how we got there The final battle to rescue the disciples is completely out of left field. This is one of the messiest movies I've seen in a while but it made me laugh and smile like no get out. The movie starts and you have no idea where things are and then whats on screen is either interesting or funny and you just go with it. How do we get from thing to thing is often beyond me. Its full of odd asides and strange references as we go from heaven to the ocean to space to the rib cage of some mythic beast to god knows where. This movie floats all over the place which helps keep it fun since you don't know where it will end up and is the reasonm keeping details to a minimum And its funny. Very very funny at times.And the action is very good even if a good chunk of it is unabashed CGI animation which provides for some cool images the golden staff the spider attack formation the angel in flight... And its very touching. Action and comedy aside this is actually a wonderful love story. Its the story of an ugly imp and a monk who end up falling in love and having other complications. Its a interesting look at the nature of love and what is true love. You will be moved.However much I enjoyed it I was still annoyed by its scatter shot construction. The films inability to hold its ideas together and to tell a complete story really hurts the film and takes away from the enjoyment every time we get to a bump in the road. the bumps take you out of the movie itself and make you realize how much is being cribbed from other sources.Absolutely worth seeing since it does have many choice moments just be prepared for some bumps and you'll have a good time.".

The movie starts and you have no idea where things are and then whats on screen is either interesting or funny and you just go with it. How do we get from thing to thing is often beyond me. Its full of odd asides and strange references as we go from heaven to the ocean to space to the rib cage of some mythic beast to god knows where. This movie floats all over the place which helps keep it fun since you don't know where it will end up and is the reasonm keeping details to a minimum And its funny. Very very funny at times.And the action is very good even if a good chunk of it is unabashed CGI animation which provides for some cool images the golden staff the spider attack formation the angel in flight... And its very touching. Action and comedy aside this is actually a wonderful love story. Its the story of an ugly imp and a monk who end up falling in love and having other complications. Its a interesting look at the nature of love and what is true love. You will be moved.However much I enjoyed it I was still annoyed by its scatter shot construction. The films inability to hold its ideas together and to tell a complete story really hurts the film and takes away from the enjoyment every time we get to a bump in the road. the bumps take you out of the movie itself and make you realize how much is being cribbed from other sources.Absolutely worth seeing since it does have many choice moments just be prepared for some bumps and you'll have a good time.";

The monk went to show the Heavenly Gates the Celestial Palace and Buddha himself how love can overcome even the worst fear of all and deemed fit as the most powerful weapon that can be used against any enemy of superior powers.A wonderfully created and funny acts awaits those who buys this ticket.

All the performances are fine particularly that by James Franco as Danny who's convincing despair at having found love and lost it so quickly and so violently is very moving. Apart from his good looks he essays considerable depth of character that should take him a long way as an actor. Only the ending was somewhat frustrating. It was too rushed as if once the shooting was over so was the film. I had become so immersed in Danny's story a little more fleshing out would have helped for he did go through a visceral experience and lost his first love. To have him happily turning up back at school as if nothing had happened was simply unbelievable. Nonetheless this is an excellent and mysterious thriller. Perhaps a little too ambiguous for the huge cinema audience that has been fed on pap for so long. I hope it does well and I sure hope it makes it to DVD as soon as possible.".

	schema:headline " Terrific film noir with outstanding cinematography and editing! some spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "Films belonging to the film noir genre usually contain similar elements a deus ex machina plot twist that drives the main character headlong into bedlam a pretty but psychotic girl a handsome but psychotic thug lots of money lots of brutality and usually a denouement in the desert.  Think High Sierra or White Heat.There is plenty of hardboiled bad film noir out there.  But when film noir is good you can't take your eyes off the train wreck of human lives.It is this latter tradition that Blind Spot belongs to.  The film follows Danny Alton a troubled teenager superbly played with depth grace emotional integrity and downright plaintiveness by James Franco who throws himself completely into this role who has fallen in love with the roughedged streetkid Darcy.From the beginning you know this is going to be bad.Darcy invites Danny to his house. But the house is empty and for sale and a bloody check for thousands of dollars is on the floor. Danny is robbed of his clothing and possessions but uses the check to track down the suicidal April  Darcy's other lover. When they reach Darcy's real home they find Wayne  a thug hunting Darcy down for the money he's stolen.  Together the three manage to locate Darcy in a dusty rundown motel in the desert. But that's only the beginning of the tale as plastic explosives drugs gunrunning a creepy funeral home bisexual assassins and a lonely halffinished house in the desert bring events to an explosive head in an alley outside a tattoo parlor in Los Angeles.This film contains some of the best noir cinematography I have seen in years.  In one scene Danny races on foot through the desert to the halffinished house in the desert where he believes Darcy may have been taken that evening by mobsters.  A very long shot with sharp lighting effects shows Danny  arms and legs flailing palpable fear etched on his face visible even at this distance dust cloud trailing behind him as the wind whips in his direction  racing across the desert flats toward the house.  The loneliness the desperation the despair Danny feels is shocking depicted.  There are many such scenes in this film wonderfully crafted by the experienced Maximo Munzi.  This is Oscarwinning material.The editing too is just astounding.  The film contains little moments where the characters gain insight into themselves or their situation. Bits of time where memory and feeling come flooding back.  At these times quick montages of images flash across the screen.  This is superb editing by directorwritereditor Stephan Woloszczuk.  In one early montage Danny describes the wondrous feelings he has now that Darcy has entered his life. Quick images of Danny's diary flash across the screen the words 4 life lucky and safe stop momentarily while page upon page of words the contents of a human heart race across the screen  out of focus too quick to read.  It's like the flood of emotion Danny himself feels.The flood of images reveals something else about this film  Just how beautiful Nathaniel Waters' production design is.  Darcy's quonsethut home is the perfect match of hightech and slob a tribute to the attentiveness of set decorator Kimberly Foster.  The stunning desert house scene is just outright creepy.  The ruined motel where Darcy hides out can be found in any abandoned small town in America.  The creepy and astoundingly lit funeral home where the plot takes a horrific turn mixes starkness with the pall of death hanging over the entire film.  It's too bad the film's lighting director is not credited.  This film has a superb production design one that enhances every single frame and every actor's performance.That's the fourth element of this film which makes it grab you and hold on to you  The acting.  James Franco is a superb actor.  Even in SpiderMan  where he was given practically nothing to do  Franco showed that he understands human emotion like no other actor of his generation.  He's no prettyboy coasting on his good looks like Brad Pitt.  Franco portrays deep emotion with full force.  His performances contain pure human heart. Consider the scene in the phone booth outside the funeral home where Danny collapses after telling April and Wayne that Darcy is dead.  Lesser actors couldn't carry off the complete emotional breakdown of a human being. Franco does.Shawn Montgomery in her first film simply blows you away with her performance as the suicidal April.  Deeply in love with Darcy suffering from massive depression after having to bury alone her unborn child after the fetus spontaneously aborts in a perfume box in the woods her life of luxury and perfection now a shambles  April is one of the bestdrawn characters on film that I have ever seen.  While Danny's relationship to Darcy is slowly teased out during the film April's nervous breakdown is revealed only to the audience.  Neither Danny nor Wayne seem particularly interested in her as a human being.  April's despair when she realizes Danny has also been Darcy's lover is poignant and potent even if it is truncated by the character's complete inability to feel any emotion for very long now. Montgomery brings to April a pathos that puts your heart through the wringer.Mark Patrick Gleason is given the hardest job in the film  Having to make something human and real out of the thug Wayne.  At first Wayne is simply one of any number of violent foulmouthed obsessed drugpushersgunrunners that appears in any number of films from Kindergarten Cop to Beverly Hills Cop 2.  Gleason does very well with what he's given but he doesn't quite get to where you feel much for Wayne.  It's difficult to say whether this is Gleason's problem or the material's.  There is one moment  where Wayne who is Darcy's brother although neither Danny nor April know this reads Danny's diary and realizes the sexual and emotional link between the two men  where you just know that Wayne is going to go homophobic on Danny's ass.  But the explosion never comes.  Thank god! Trite plots are death to film noir.  Once the revelation about the siblings comes at the film's end the audience is fairly astounded to realize the depth of love and compassion Wayne truly felt for Darcy  so deep that Wayne accepted Danny's homosexual love for his bisexual brother.  But this all happens offscreen.  Gleason is never given a chance to act out Wayne's feelings. It must have been very frustrating for the performer.The story is rather inventive although the smuggling device seen at the end of the film is likely to remind viewers of Diamonds Are Forever yes James Bond.  A traditional narrative voiceover which proves Franco is as great a voice talent as he is a physical actor provides terrific atmosphere although it does tend to flow over into schmaltz a few times toward the end of the film providing some unintentional laughter. Terrific locales play key visual roles in the film.  Kudos to the location scout for finding such astounding buildings!  The end of the film struck me as a bit rushed not pat but a little too firm for my film noir tastes.Now I've seen audiences either hate or love Blind Spot.  Modern film audiences exposed to the most extreme brutality and violence often have little appreciation for the subtleties of film noir.  My suggestion is to take a small group of friends who don't see despair emotional collapse desperation or depression as laughable.  Take them to a small theater where they can glory in the spectacle of the film's vision but where their viewing won't be ruined by a crowd of people who won't recognize good film noir.  Get them some popcorn trust me they'll be so engrossed they won't finish it get them a soda and let them be overwhelmed.  Go some place bright and cheery afterward to wash the grime and awfullness out of your soul.  Because this film is so good at making you feel you'll need that restorative.".

The action is frightening and the mood of loneliness that the film projects is amazing. There is much beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three misfit heroes. Not just in the desert but in the city too. My best scene was after the boy discovers his friends in the apartment and then rides his skateboard through all the remarkable lights of the city. You really feel for this guy. I never heard of the actors before but I liked all three very much. I think they did a terrific job on their journey to selfdiscovery. All in all this is an amazingly cool and suspenseful suspenseful film. I still carry many of the images in my mind.".

I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers searching for a mysterious man who has loved and betrayed each of them in different ways. The cast is great. James Franco is particularly amazing as the brokenhearted boy from Los Angeles. His journal entries which we hear in voiceovernarration work well with the visuals and are quite intense. The film has a powerful style. It pushes elements like the road movie and revengedrama in new directions. It also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the frightening ambiance of lost love. There is a dreamlike quality to several sequences and the images are saturated with an eerie sense of tension. Strange. Suspenseful. Beautiful to look at. Definitely worth seeing. I really would like to see it again. Periodically I check to see if Blind Spot has been distributed. I can't wait to see the film again in the cinema or on DVD.Davide Pepe 13082005 Bologna  Italy".

The three heroes share a chemistry on screen that runs all across the film making it so thrilling. They are set on outstanding landscapes spotted by such an original eye the DOP's work is just great that makes you feel like you are discovering them for the first time. The mood of the desert floods everywhere and even the scenes filmed in the streets of Los Angeles or San Francisaco seem to be a natural extension of it. The story rides you smoothly through all these beautiful settings to lead you to a bittersweet ending being the perfect climax for this perfect journey. The construction of the film itself is a master craft. The skilled use of innovative resources like stills stitching Danny's memories into the film will compare to those handmade pieces of work so rare and so enjoyable. Blind Spot achieves to capture the essence of the desert taking you to an universal common ground where anyone of us can feel being both discoverer and native.".

Blind Spot is proof positive of his tremendous talent. In this film he carries himself with a different sort of weight entirely. It's a unique performance. Bittersweet and really moving. The lines from his journal cut you like a knife. You sense a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words. The tone is everything. He carries it through the action and suspense as well as the grim bits of gallows humor. I like the other two actors a great deal too. The blonde girl is totally gorgeous and the man is hysterical in his twisted tough guy stoicism. Some of the thugs seemed a little sketchy but this is a minipoint really.

This film just might put him on a fast track to the A list. The rest of the cast also did their jobs perfectly this is an excellent little film with a nice message.

I regularly catch him on XM Radio's uncensored comedy channel. Give Black an idea and let him improvise. Whether his rants and lines here are scripted or improvised are no matter.

His mom and dad are very disappointed that Bartleby hasn't been accepted into college. His parents think that if Bartleby doesn't go to college he will have no future. Several of Bartleby's friends are in the same situation of being rejected by all the colleges they applied to.

They will be the only students. However the web site states that we accept anyone. On the first day of school they unexpectedly have a large number of accepted students that were also rejected by all colleges. With a million dollars in tuition money Bartleby must make his fake college into a functioning one. He hires Uncle Ben Lewis Black as the College Dean. The fun begins when they design their own curriculum make their own rules and party all night.My Comment The premise of starting a college without a teaching staff is a little off the wall. Since it was a fake college Bartleby really didn't need a staff. The movie reminded me of the classic movie Animal House the college setting the fraternity lots of gags and pretty young women. These new college freshmen had a different notion of what the college experience was all about. The movie not only has lots of humor it also has a good message for life. People should reach for their dream and create a passion for what they want to do in life and not settle for what other people want them to do. The ending was a little unrealistic but it is only a movie. The movie was made for the young crowd to have a little fun. Universal Pictures Run time 132 Rated PG13 710".

The ending I really did love because It had to take itself seriously I mean how else would you end it? Yes it's another underdog story but not in your typical format and the movie wasn't their ups and downs it was people coming together for one common goal To go to college where they were accepted. The cast was amazing and yes I did laugh at loud when I didn't think I would and the laughter lasted longer then I thought to. The parents and sister played their roles well but their characters are put in when necessary. The movie was not focused around them but at the same time they showed up when you expect and not expect them to. They played in to the story very well and I loved the familiar faces Anthony HealdBoston Public Jeremy Howard I Galaxy Quest with Justin Long Ross Patterson The New Guyand Sam Horrigan Brink. Blake Lively added her certain something to the movie which made it even more enjoyable as well as B's Friends.

	schema:reviewBody "Look the plot is preposterous and unrealistic but the film is so much fun it's charms won me over. Long is a likable lead but honestly he's too cool to be portrayed as such a disregarded kid. I would watch him and how the film wants to create this downgraded high school kid who couldn't get into a decent college and is portrayed as such a loser...but he's got all these charismatic qualities that sort of challenge that perception of school invisibility where his character appears uncool and abandoned by the cliques that determine worth as a recognized figure amongst his peers.

Long is a likable lead but honestly he's too cool to be portrayed as such a disregarded kid. I would watch him and how the film wants to create this downgraded high school kid who couldn't get into a decent college and is portrayed as such a loser...but he's got all these charismatic qualities that sort of challenge that perception of school invisibility where his character appears uncool and abandoned by the cliques that determine worth as a recognized figure amongst his peers.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie deserved a better class of reviews and definitely a higher rating than it actually has. In my opinion Accepted is based on one of the most relevant topic of our generation wherein the agony and feelings of all those students who due to one reason or another are unable to get accepted to a good enough college after completion of their high school. The central character played by Justin long who when unable to get accepted to any College starts an Unaccredited college along with a few of his friends so as to fulfill the expectations and dreams of his family. During the course of this the whole lot of students like him which too were not accepted to any of the college come to this institute to pursue higher studies. This movie provides proper insight to our education system and its inability to carve innovation and fuel imagination in young fresh minds which wants only possibilities in life and a belief that they also can contribute to the development of world and change the face of time on their watch. The character played by the dean of South Harmon Institute of Technology was quite interesting and intriguing as its views presented about the existing system and world around may not please many but unfortunately are true. Also the character of Sherman Schrader is also relevant in the current time as the person who is somewhat different may be in appearance or attitude is always met with hatred of others and becomes a misfit in the society of commons. Lastly Justin long proved that he too can put by the act together and give a performance which can demonstrate its worth as an actor. He stuck the chord with connecting beautifully with the character of protagonist Bartelbey Gaines. His speech at the end of the movie encapsulates the essence of the movie and packs a Knock out punch in front of the panel before whom they had a hearing for accreditation. The line do not Judge us by the way we look is my personal favorite. Hence I would rate it as 810.".

The premise is simple yet funny and there aren't a bunch of annoying clichs that bring it down. The story is kind of ridiculous and unbelievable but if you enter the movie with an open mind then you have a better shot at enjoying it. The screenplay itself offered some funny dialog and a few interesting characters. Some of them were really annoying and unnecessary while some of the other ones were actually relatable and fun to watch on screen. Behind the camera Steve Pink did a decent job. He followed a familiar path but he at least kept the film interesting. He moved the movie at a decent pace and it never became too dull or cheesy. The ninety minutes flew by fast and the ending was actually pretty good. It may have been a bit over the top but it also finished with a bang.The acting was surprisingly good given the genre. Justin Long was pretty good as Bartleby Gaines. He was charismatic and for once his character wasn't a complete loser. I hope he gets more leading roles in the future although he should probably stick to comedy. Blake Lively was just bland and she looked really bad next to Justin Long. They just didn't look realistic together and her performance was so mundane that it sounded like she was reading her lines. Jonah Hill was pretty good and he had many funny lines. Adam Herschman was just annoying and completely unnecessary. Lewis Black was good just a bit over the top though. The rest of the performances were fine they're just not worth mentioning. Overall I thought Accepted was a decent comedy. It's a good film to watch for a few laughs just don't expect too much. Rating 610".

Something that is not very funny because it got this very mild humor for that actual teen but at the same time it wasnt that bad.Synopsis B is good in extra curriculum unfortunately that doesnt help in a place at any university. With a pressure from his parents he and couple of friends finally came up with the idea to built fake college. Problem arises when other students also get accepted into this fake college.Not bad of an idea not an original but who care its a teen movie after all. I like it the only problem for me was the character development wasnt that good and there are too many characters that havent been polish very well. Like Glen he was suppose to be like Booger Revenge of the Nerd stupid yet intelligence in his own way and funny. But here he hardly does anything.I love the cast I love Justin Long which guy is funny I always follow his work and he does a pretty good job as B. Everyone here seems to fit the jigsaw very well. And the acting is decent though from time to time it gets cheesy and the dialogue is also weird at time.The movie consists of very touching and inspiring moments and the bond about friendship and the stupid and how the education system should be. Unfortunately the movie more or less lack in humor dont get it wrong it just not laugh out loud kind it is more of smile type. This movie is for someone older and preteen that does not look for toilet humor and more life good morale kind of movie.Recommendation Yea Sure It Worth A Rental.Reason To Watch Justin Long Fake College.Reason Not To If youre A Teenager Looking For Real Humor and Nudity.Rating 6.510 Grade C".

Problem arises when other students also get accepted into this fake college.Not bad of an idea not an original but who care its a teen movie after all. I like it the only problem for me was the character development wasnt that good and there are too many characters that havent been polish very well. Like Glen he was suppose to be like Booger Revenge of the Nerd stupid yet intelligence in his own way and funny. But here he hardly does anything.I love the cast I love Justin Long which guy is funny I always follow his work and he does a pretty good job as B. Everyone here seems to fit the jigsaw very well. And the acting is decent though from time to time it gets cheesy and the dialogue is also weird at time.The movie consists of very touching and inspiring moments and the bond about friendship and the stupid and how the education system should be. Unfortunately the movie more or less lack in humor dont get it wrong it just not laugh out loud kind it is more of smile type. This movie is for someone older and preteen that does not look for toilet humor and more life good morale kind of movie.Recommendation Yea Sure It Worth A Rental.Reason To Watch Justin Long Fake College.Reason Not To If youre A Teenager Looking For Real Humor and Nudity.Rating 6.510 Grade C";

The same formula that has been plugged into summer comedy for about 7 years. Rat Race for instance. This one also has trouble deciding between an inspirational piece or an all out party movie i.e. Animal House. The blending between both aspects of the story is done well and some of the characters in the movie are just plain funny in their antics. This isn't one that your breath will be taken away by but it is definitely funny and it at least attempts to give the audience a lesson in finding their purpose after high school.".

If you believe that we're all OK man then this movie is for you. Furthermore you must understand that1. Kids have it all inside themthey just need to let it out.2. Teaching really stifles the innate creativity that everyone is born with. 3. Someone else should pay for you to follow your passion. 4. 300 teenagers can live together in harmony as long as you take away those restrictive rules. 5. Extemporaneous speeches are often much more convincing than a prepared presentation. 6. If the Board of Education allows you to open a charter school with nontraditional teaching techniques it's because they have your best interests at heart. Not that they are willing to let go of lowfunctioning students who will end up working fast food anyways. This movie is one in the college comedy genre i.e. Animal House. It follows the pattern pretty closely. What's new here though is a complete attack on higher education not a parody of the bad elements. It's missing the sympathetic insider a professor who embodies the worthwhile part of university life. This lack of balance will doom this film to the back rows of Blockbuster. It is so one sided that I wondered if it was an ironic selfreferential take on the whole genrefor about one minute. The movie has no deep meaning no layers no introspection. It's as if they let some kids who never went to class do what comes naturally. And what is natural is what the name of the school is S. Never thought I'd say this Go see something with Will Farrell instead. His comedies can be surprisingly sophisticated.".

He is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing. The only film that he has attempted to anchor that I've remotely enjoyed was Waiting... and that is almost solely because I've worked in a restaurant. But I digress. Aside from it's terrible lead this film has loads of other debits. I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive. Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the PG13 rating certainly won't allow. The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim. His one liners were funny on occasion but were certainly not enough to make this anywhere close to bearable. If you just want to completely turn your brain off or better yet don't have one then maybe you'd enjoy this but I can't recommend it at all.".

Black is terrific here frankly telling the kids what life is really like his expletiveladen final line is hysterical and providing the adult face to the bogus university for the parents.But Long has to carry most of the film and he does so in spades Bartleby is easily identified with and we take to him almost immediately.

Not that it's a brain teaser by any means but Accepted isn't just another mindless teen comedy or Owen Wilson vehicle. It's a funny clever 90 minutes that while not a great departure from its genre is intelligent and creative enough to be very enjoyable.There is at least one moment of unadulterated brilliance in the film when Bartleby checks out a nearby college in an attempt to harvest ideas for his own school's curriculum. When he sees that the kids are all stressed out at the other school several refuse to even talk to him during class for fear of missing something he shakes his head thinking that there must be a better way. As he moves to leave he is met by a stream of kids going the other way one person moving against a human tide while in the background the opening lines of Eleanor Rigby play. Perhaps an unplanned moment of brilliance but brilliance none the less.".

Billy Crystal plays a talent agent who gets fired by his client then almost drowns. Luckily two giant hands save him from the water and they are of course attached to the giant George Muresan spelling? who he immediately tries to sign on as a client because there is obvious potential jobs for such a huge man. He brings him to the states under the pretense of reuniting him with the girl he used to like only she doesn't want to see him at all. The movie has comedy at times but mostly it is a dramatic movie which it wasn't marketed as so I think that might be why a lot of people are disappointed. It's not a really deep story and the acting isn't great Muresan is a basketball player and Billy Crystal is pretty much just going through the motions but it's definitely worth seeing and is a good little movie.".

However it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion. His portrayal of talent agent Sammy was brilliantly performed and uniquely him. In addition Gheorghe Muresan as Maximus was superb in his first film role. When Sammy goes to Romania to visit his client on location he has his world turned upside down. He never expected that he would accidentally find the one person who could change his life. Sammy and Max's journey is unique and moving and even humorous at times. Plus the location in Czech Republic where parts of the film were shot was absolutely beautiful. I have to say this dramatic comedy had me feeling a variety of emotions. I thought it was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.".

When he is fired by the actor he drives off in a rage and crashes his car only to be saved by a Romanian shepherd and taken to a monastery.  When he sees his saviour is 7ft10 tall he realises the potential and gets him a job on the local movie.  Together the pair set out for America  Max wanting to find the only girl ever to care for him 25 years ago and Sammy eyeing a key part for Max as a bad guy in the new Steven Seagal movie.I love Billy Crystal.  When he is on form he is very funny and can make even average romantic comedies worth watching.  He alone makes it worth sitting through an overlong Oscar ceremony when he comperes it.  However this film is beyond his saving grasp as it is simply just not funny enough.  The plot and humour is basically oh look here's a really tall guy'.  The worst thing is that it then goes into cloying sentimentality every five minutes as Sammy learns to love again through the spirit of his gentle giant.  And up comes the music that every Crystal film seems to use for touching' moments.At the start of the film is a scene where Sammy as a child shows his ability of persuasion by sitting down to a roast pig dinner with a rabbi.  This I laughed at but that was the last time only 100 more minutes to go! because most of the film is just amusing and any rare good lines are lost in a sea of middling humour.  A cameo by Seagal is quite good but not as funny as it could have been if he'd made more fun of himself.  Even Crystal's dialogue usually an oasis in the sea of sentimentality is poor.He doesn't do a good job at all here and although he is playing his usual character it's difficult to care less what happens to him or why.  Muresan is an average basketball player who is good as a bench player but not as a starter.  I saw him play in San Antonio when he was with Washington Bullets as was and was surprised at how slow and uncoordinated he was on court. On the screen he has the same qualities  awkward ungainly etc.  He makes a sympathetic character so it's not all bad but it doesn't seem to come naturally for him. The two don't have much chemistry and you wonder if there was much onset banter between them once Crystal had used up all his NBA questions.  The rest of the cast are Ok and there's a few well known faces in there but Seagal is probably the best bit of casting in the film and he is amusing if not funny.Overall this is a pretty average film that is just about passable but certainly not funny or enjoyable.  There are a few laughs and the rest of the film either falls into fake cloying sentimentality or just goes for laughs by having the big and the small man beside each other.  I love Crystal even in poor films but I won't be watching My Giant again unless I'm tied to a chair a la Clockwork Orange'.".

The second part in the States is sentimental sometimes oversentimental and touching. Needless to say I prefer the first part which offers some really funny moments NOT the vomit scene which is fortunately the only coarseness in the film.The sentimental part is a bit boring. Moreover we find in it the cliche family troubles that according to movies any American male seems to have. But in fairness some developments of the story are original unexpected and surprising if not particularly cheerful.I like Billy Crystal and I'm always amused by him. The character of the giant Max is depicted with extreme sympathy Gheorghe Muresan shows that he can act.A surprising peculiarity of My Giant is the great respect for Christian religion and priests here monks shown along the movie. This is really amazing. The trend in current movies is the exact contrary Christian religious feelings are systematically scorned and in particular priests are usually depicted as the hypocritical origin of all evil. Since I'm always fond of people swimming against the main stream I heartily thank Billy Crystal and Gheorghe Muresan for having violated these annoying conventions.".

It does carry an interesting theme regarding human possession and discovery. Billy Crystal plays a filmmaker who is in a car accident in Albania and is rescued by an eightfoot man named Max. He is friendly and skilled in five languages. They come to a mutual agreement. He will star in Crystal's movies and in turn Crystal must locate Max's lost love who broke his heart and has no desire to rekindle. The method in which Crystal handles this is a break in trust. Another poorly handled scene involves Crystal's son on the phone with Steven Seagal. Directed by Michael Lehman with beautiful photography. He previously made The Truth About Cats and Dogs. Gheorghe Muresan is likable as Max despite his despairing final scenes. Crystal is great with comic dialogue as he takes his discovery to new heights. Kathleen Quinlan as his wife is cardboard with a scene towards the end where she is used to solve a problem that is questionable. Joanna Pacula as Max's ex is not remotely likable. Seagal is either desperate or has a really good sense of humour to be the bunt of this joke as himself. Hardly funny but it does contain a strong theme regarding acceptance and abilities. Score 6  10".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all around the time I wrote this comment I had already read what kittiwake1 had written about this game and was confused. This is a video game and not an actual movie. I mean I myself would choose a good Deniro movie or playing a video game any day. But dude what are you talking about? Now that I have that out of the way let's move on shall we? The video game adaption of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is as you may have guessed based on the movie of the same name. What's stranger is that this was released three years after the film was released. Whether that's due to a slow development time or just plain laziness no one really knows. At least I don't.The game allows the player to play as the four main characters of the movie Jen Shu Lien LiMuBi and Dark Cloud Whose story is a secret bonus that is unlocked for separate gameplay. All four of these characters have fighting styles based on how they fought in the movie. However the real eye candy is the evasion moves that allow each character to avoid the blows of an enemy's attack in the most impossible and gravity defying ways that were first showcased in the movie.The story is obviously based on the story told in the movie. The story in the game is told using CG movies and spoken in a subtitled Mandarin language A nice little touch considering I preferred the foreign language track of the film over the dubbed one. The story goes to expand on what might've happened to the other characters during the film and even No real surprise since pretty much all video game movie adaptions have done this alters what officially happened in the movie to make the game have more action. I never thought Jade Fox would go so far as to actually go and get hired goons.The real bonus for the story is the ability to decide how the game ends. What if Jen had all the ingredients to cure LiMuBi in her possession? What if Jen had not gotten back her comb? What if LiMuBi had not gotten the green destiny back for the second time? Your actions will decide the outcome of these scenarios and the destiny of the characters in this game. This is truly the best feature of the game.Yet for all it's strengths it also showcases some flaws. The enemies often tend to become a nuisance after a while and the camera angle tends to be fixed on the most unhelpful of spots. Not even the special features Which are unlocked after beating the game are good enough to even forgive such hardships that are forced upon the player.If you loved the movie you may enjoy the game. However this game is the only way you're going to be able to immerse yourself into a playable version of such a beautiful and amazing movie.Of course you could have just picked a Deniro movie instead.".

They have definitely upped their game since the guy below me's review 2006. It's the only place that I get my tech info. Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn work beautifully with each other and the show always has segments referring to things in the game movie comic... Universe. If you know those universes you will understand the jokes. Long story short aots is a hilarious show that gives me and anyone all the news about anything and everything that you care about. I'm watching it right now as I type this they are 'in' San Diego covering the red bull air races. Sweet.";

Also the interviews with stars and computer tech people is okay and the games and DVD reviews are worth a look. Most of all the spice and icing on the cake is the show's good eye candy of young hot sexy female host. First up is Candace Bailey yet she's a runner up to my main viewing squeeze Sara Underwood. Sara's so hot I remember her Playboy past and her recent Maxim photo shot of her in a flowered pink bra was so hot! Overall the series Attack of the Show was a fun little ride it never took it's time to serious but it was a fun informative watch with some Sara sugar and Candace spice.".

Its very easy to point the blame at the sex sells' theory that plagues the televisions world but i think the change is a result of big business taking over a small network. The network use to be great i stayed turned in daily in fact but the great things they did costs a lot of money. Thus to obtain more money they need more high name sponsors and with sponsorship comes changes usually negative one.Now I admit the change on cheat from Corey Rouse to a sexier ex cheerleader Kristin HoltAdams was a bit of a sex sells ploy but there are still some good things about the network. The much debated attack of the show does focus on sex a lot at times but what is it that gamers do with their spare time i believe the concept that gamers do nothing but play games and get fat is absolutely retarded. I have a life and the new content to the network attracts the non hardcore audience. Now my girl will watch G4 with me because it just doesn't talk about games anymore. Now by no means am i saying that the changes are good but they are not all bad and you can't fault them for trying to bring in new viewers. So my stand is one of neutrality.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months maybe longer but not much. I was very infatuated with Olivia and I found Kevin to be very witty and the repertoire between them very good. Lately though it's starting to wear thin due to many factors for me. First my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called Around The Net that shows 5 video clips that you would find on a site like Youtube that are generally funny or of people getting hurt inadvertently some intentionally. Umm this when watched 4 to 5 times a week shows again and again the same stuff I really haven't seen anything that good and I can only laugh at people actually probably breaking their necks and being paralyzed so many times. The show is like a Late Show wanna beColbert Report wanna be with it's politics also if you do not live in a blue state and are not an automatic liberal this humor gets old also McCain is old yeah yeah whatever. Libs have no guts to make fun of themselves because they are not smart enough to realize that would endear themselves as having a sense of humor that they can laugh at themselves so it's almost every show bash McCain or Palin sheesh. So we get the same old vids of people getting hurt that we are supposed to keep laughing at and then some leftist political humor that never laugh's at itself out of it's own weakness. I'll keep watching since I watch at work and it's all that's on hoping that I'll be entertained but it is getting somewhat old. I did like the fill in host's of Chris and Alison though they were actually a good change of pace maybe this show could do a rotating host thing. Olivia who I thought at times in the beginning was really funny has resorted to this constant pouting response and it's getting old lol. 7 of 10 it will keep you in a young mindset which is good if you're a younger Baby Boomer like me mid 40's. Maybe a cartoon of the day would be another segment they should do there is a ton of stuff available they could use. 7 out of 10 in 2008UPDATEIt's late 2012 now still tune into AOTS to catch around the net which they now do not show at the top of the show all the time and do not show 5 web videos anymore now it's like 3 videos. So the main reason why I tuned back into the show has been cut back. Kevin and Olivia are both gone both were long time hosts. Kevin was a total liberal metro sexual I guess he got too old for the age demo of the show under 21 or maybe he realized staying on a G4 show his whole career would typecast him I can't say I really miss him since he was such a pansy and very brainwashed for anything Democrat and not white years and years of him chanting USA USA and making fun of American success is basically just a liberal propaganda thing it's not comedy. Olivia bailed out and rightly so she's on to much bigger and better things. She was the reason why I loved the show. So who is there now? Candice who is from Florida and OK but not nearly as hot as Olivia and a rotation of even more metro sexual leaning and out right gay men host. This show has NEVER had a guy host on who you would think is actually manly or cool never. The closest was the stand up comedian guy who did another show on G4 called The Soup I think and I have not seen him enough oh and they did have a back packer guy do some spots but he's few and far between so thats about it. It's not funny anymore the chick hosts are not so hot or funny or raunchy and they cut most of the Around the Net segment out. Will I still tune in? If it's on when I'm home but thats about it. The show has jumped the shark with Kevin and Olivia leaving. Bring back an Asian woman who's hot I guess or another ethnicity then pale white to improve the show. Late 2012 rating 3 out of 10".

Don't ask me how it happened but I suppose having the film feature Ed I'll Sponsor Anything McMahon as a tailchasing crack hustler had a bit to do with it.Frankly I was disappointed with Slaughter's first outing in 1972. Nothing more than a quick throwtogether to follow Shaftmania. How does the sequel get away from this? Big Jim Brown seems stronger as Slaughter here than in the first. Perhaps this is due to the fact that one year later he had something to work from instead of his simple Be like Shaft motivation before.The most outstanding part about the film is the soundtrack provided by pimpdaddy number one James Brown. Almost every scene is graced with a touch of funk by the Godfather. An excellent period film for the music wardrobe vehicles lingo and hair. I should also point out this film is also an excellent period film to represent a time in motion picture history when Jim Brown and Ed McMahon could actually GROW hair.Double the chicks double the blow triple the body count and factor in Ed McMahon and James Brown. You'll be in for one hell of a 70s action flick and one that outshines it's predecessor no less. For my money Slaughter's Big RipOff can play ball with any Blaxploitation film ever made. Even Shaft. Chances are you'll disagree but Slaughter's Big RipOff has it's own distinct feel. Something the original was lacking.".

	schema:reviewBody "Brown returned to his role from the year before in Slaughter for this rough followup film. In the original he had avenged his parents' slaying by wiping out a huge mob organization in Mexico. Here he is the one being pursued retaliated against by a money launderer portrayed by McMahon. When the first assassination attempt fails Brown is back in action once more kicking gangster butt all over the place while trying to protect his new girlfriend Hendry. While the original film was overall a better and more coherent movie this one delivers all the exploitation aspects in far heavier doses making it more pleasing to fans of the genre. Aside from a fairly dreary opening on horseback and a downright deadly car ride down a city street at night this movie clips along at a very brisk pace. Every few minutes there appears one or more of the following drug use sex nudity gunplay murder or some other action. Brown is his usual reliable amiable self helped by his amazing physical presence which goes a long way in glossing over any stiffness in his acting. McMahon is a riot! With tinted glasses and his hair parted down the middle ! he is shown meting out orders to his gang of thugs and is overheard making passionate love to his furclad bimbo. Seeing Johnny Carson's sidekick in a role like this is a perverse thrill. Stroud makes an impression as an intense raciallybigoted hitman while Peters adds just a tinge of class as an upright police detective who enlists Brown's aid. Sadly no mention at all is made of Brown's original sidekicks Don Gordon and Stella Stevens. Suddenly Brown now has a girlfriend Hendry who is likable enough but lacking in the voluptuousness and personality that Stevens had before. Williams does an outrageous turn as a pimp who can seemingly pick any girl out of a bar and make her an instant member of his harem. The cinematography and overall direction is less polished than the first film but this one does have a drive and a sense of danger that exceeds the original's feel. The film spends a lot of time in the sewage of organized crime drugs prostitution and other vices but it retains interest through the creativity of its action scenes and the nowstartling lack of political correctness. One odd note A key supporting player in the first film was shown getting shot to death but pops up here in a different role.".

	schema:reviewBody "9 out of 10 filmgoers agree if you put Jim Brown on screen whatever film he happens to be in will immediately improve noticeably for as long as he remains on screen. There's just something about the guy's presence and charisma even in a nonaction setting that makes you want to see what he is going to say or do next. So a film with Jim Brown up front and center for the entire duration is going to be fun to watch even if the surroundings are second rate. That is certainly the case here.This was a pure blaxploitation flick that doesn't pretend to be anything else so the audience for it is going to be fairly selfselecting  a title like Slaughter's Big RipOff is not going to pull in the Merchant Ivory crowd or fans of British comedy. The filmmakers knew the kind of film they wanted to make and they made it a film about guns drugs sex soul power cussing funk guitar and muscle cars...and mostly about Jim Brown and how cool he is. For a contemporary version of this think of Matt Damon in The Bourne Identity which is all about how cool Matt Damon is. I was a little bothered by the fact that the Slaughter's supposed soul mates who went been through hell with him and for him in the 1st Slaughter Don Gordon and Stella Stevens were nowhere to be seen in this one. Nor was any mention made of their characters...even though the events in this film are directly related to the events from the first film. That detracted a bit from the overall image of Slaughter as a man who inspired loyalty because he gave it. But we all know about the perils of the casting call and agent negotiations although it's hard to imagine why Don Gordon was too busy to reappear with the highest profile celebrity he'd ever been associated with. So if you don't think about it too hard it's OK.One really odd note to the seamless blend of guns goons and funk is the appearance of Ed McMahon right in the middle of things as a Boss type. I don't who was mad at him or how he got talked into it but he is the goofiest looking twerp you can imagine here. The eras fashions were not kind to him and he was foolish to appear on screen in anything other than a sack suit or a Hawaiian shirt. Imagine a pale pudgy lounge lizard in aviator spectacles leisure suit and long hair parted straight down the middle in a pageboy bob run amok and you still can't even come close to the horror of his appearance in this film. When Brown finally shoots him I was praying that he would also call in an air strike to obliterate McMahon's wardrobe so that it would never sully innocent eyeballs again.Anyway Slaughter's Big RipOff might have been OK or even good with another actor in the role but Jim Brown makes it a great period piece. If you enjoy blaxploitation movies this one belongs in your collection.".

There's a bunch of familiar faces in the supporting cast among them Gloria Hendry as Marcia Slaughter's gal pal Dick Anthony Williams as flamboyant pimp Joe Creole a pimp who's also talented in the art of safecracking Art Metrano as the sleazy Mario Bertoli Hoke Howell as one of the Parker brothers who make the foolish mistake of not cooperating with Slaughter Russ Marin as top cop Crowder the always lovably genial Scatman Crothers you wish he was in the film longer as Cleveland Pamela Des Barres in a sexy bit part George Gaynes as the illfated Warren and an uncredited Adam Roarke as Harry.The pacing is mostly efficient the action when it happens is always viscerally effective and there are some good laughs to be had as well. Just check out the amount of vocalizations during a fight scene with Slaughter and two goons one of whom happens to be Oriental. You hear them even when people aren't moving their lips.Good if not great entertainment overall with a very funny wrapup. It's just a shame that the original James Brown soundtrack got replaced for the DVD the new score is adequate but hardly inspired.Seven out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Slaughter's Big RipOff 1973  12 out of 4 Violent sequel sees a mob boss Ed McMahon taking a hit out on Slaughter Jim Brown who of course has to seek vengeance when a couple of his friends are killed instead. This sequel to the 1972 hit comes as a major letdown because we've got a pretty good cast here but sadly they're given very little to do and this film runs out of gas before we even hit the thirtyminute mark. Not only do we have Brown and McMahon but we also have a brief appearance by Scatman Crothers and Don Stroud as well as Brock Peters who most will remember from TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. The biggest problem with this film is that the entire set up is just boring and never really gets us interested in what's going on. As soon as the movie starts we witness this hit and we have no reason why it's happening or who the people are that are getting killed. We're thrown right into this story but it's so slim that you can't help but feel you're just watching this movie because the first one made money and the studio is trying to milk some more cash. I know that just about every blaxploitation flick used this revenge storyline but they still could have came up with something better here. What we do get are a few fun performances with Brown once again delivering the good lines and kicking enough heads in for some slight entertainment. It was very funny seeing McMahon playing the womanizing gangster and Peters turns in a good performance as a cop helping Slaughter. Veteran director Gordon whose credits go as far back as campy stuff like ZOMBIES ON Broadway handles the material fairly well but he's just not given enough to save the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like the first film in this series SLAUGHTER 1972 I think it would be a mistake to just label this a blaxsploitation film. Sure Slaughter is a tough guntoting Black man but it's more of an action picture regardless of the color of the leading man or the bad guysand a very good action picture at that.For the second and final time Jim Brown plays the title character. The film begins with one of the goofiest scenes I can remember in a film. As Slaughter and his friends are enjoying an outdoor party along comes a biplane and begins spraying the group with machine gun fire! No Slaughter isn't so tough that he then shoots down the plane with his .357! But Slaughter is ticked and no one is sure why this hit was happenedhowever Slaughter is going to get to the bottom of it! Well it turns out that the hit was attempted in retribution for the last movie. In it Slaughter takes on the Mafia and kicks lots of butt down in Mexico. Now in a horribly bungled and clumsy attempt the guys in the plane kill and injure quite a few people but miss Slaughter. And because the job was bungled so badly the mob boss Ed MacMahon!! orders the pilot and gunman killed by his brutal assassin Don Stroudin a very typical sort of role for him. Stroud is greatscary and nasty to the core but Ed MacMahon as the boss?! Wow that's an interesting twist! Slaughter is now stumped. He figured out who the two guys were in the plane but by the time he got to them they were dead. So to help him along in his own private vendetta Brock Peters who plays a cop tells him who the mobsters are who ordered the hit and got Slaughter to agree to help by doing some illegal undercover work. So Slaughter and his pimp friend break into the mobster's mansion and steal a list of payoffs to key government and police officials. And naturally there is a lot of shooting and bloodshed in the process.Stroud isn't about to let Slaughter get away with this and kidnaps Slaughter's girlfriend. Now it's a standoffSlaughter has the list but if he doesn't give it back the lady is dead. Being a tough but gallant man you might just be able to guess much of what happens next.The action is very good in the film and Jim Brown is menacing and tough. The only negative I noticed was that while having MacMahon play this nasty boss at the end he simply foldedand way too quickly. When Slaughter catches up to him MacMahon becomes a wimp and all the previous nastiness disappearsand this is too much of a clich and inconsistent. Still despite this minor quibble it's an engaging film that is NOT for the kids due to all the violence and boobs.".

But first he has to find out who issued the contract on him and why. But before he can initiate an investigation he has to find a safe place for his girlfriend Marcia Gloria Hendry and somehow get the police off of his back as well. Unfortunately this process becomes more problematic the closer he gets. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this turned out to be a fairly decent Blaxploitation film with good action and solid acting all around. Likewise the addition of Judith Brown as Norja and the aforementioned Gloria Hendry certainly didn't hurt the scenery in any way either. On the other hand I have to admit that it loses points on the realism scale due to a couple of scenes which defied reality. Even so I thought that this sequel was a slight improvement over the 1972 film Slaughter and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.".

Duncan goes to his reliable trigger manmechanic KirkDon Stroudto clean up the mess left in the wake of this failed hit. But Slaughter isn't about to go down without a fight.Plot's simple as that. A revenge actioner where big Jim Brown takes out a mobster's goons as Kirk targets him for extermination. Duncan is in bed with the chief of police..and other city officials and Slaughter must secure a list with his name on it for detective ReynoldsBrock Peters.Fans of Jim Brown and blaxploitation should enjoy this but the plot itself really isn't anything to write home about. Brown built like a mack truck makes both black and white women swoon and kicks a lot of ass..a tailor made vehicle designed specifically to make him look cool while defeating those who wish to kill him. Dick Anthony Williams steals the film as a sneering pimp Joe Creole who also has a reputation as a safe cracker and is enlisted by Slaughter to lift the list from a safe in Duncan's mansion. Stroud inhibits the usual heavy role of Kirk a ruthless coldblooded henchman who has obviously eliminated a lot of Duncan's competition.The yummy Judith M Brown has a minor role as a former squeeze of Slaughter's who negotiates with him over information regarding those he is after in return for sexual favors..and we get to see her fabulous nude body as she disrobes for Slaughter who didn't need too much coaxing. Gloria HendryLive and Let Die is Slaughter's girlfriend Marcia her life soon threatened as Kirk desires the list for his boss. Hoke Howell has a funny cameo as a plane mechanic who at first doesn't give out the name of the person who hired the Spearman which flew over gunning down Slaughter's friends. Scatman Crothers stops by as an old friend of Slaughter who leads him to Creole as a favor in regards to finding someone available for opening Duncan's safe.Preposterous sequence where Slaughter somehow survives a car's plunging into the ocean after driving off a cliff and how he's able to move about freely despite the powerful connections of Duncan is a major logical problem..you'd think Duncan would have gunmen throughout the city with Slaughter encountering them everywhere he goes but this is not the case. Plus the whole opening sequence doesn't properly set the stage for the revenge of the movie..shouldn't we get to know Slaughter's comrades a bit before they are murdered?. It does deliver the violence though as Slaughter lives up to his name blowing away quite a many of Duncan's men with blood all over the place. Brown's sheer charisma and presence are of major importance as the plot itself doesn't exactly do him any favors. It's too bad the film doesn't use McMahon more because he is fun to watch as the mafioso with those big shades and ugly suits.".

Brown built like a mack truck makes both black and white women swoon and kicks a lot of ass..a tailor made vehicle designed specifically to make him look cool while defeating those who wish to kill him. Dick Anthony Williams steals the film as a sneering pimp Joe Creole who also has a reputation as a safe cracker and is enlisted by Slaughter to lift the list from a safe in Duncan's mansion. Stroud inhibits the usual heavy role of Kirk a ruthless coldblooded henchman who has obviously eliminated a lot of Duncan's competition.The yummy Judith M Brown has a minor role as a former squeeze of Slaughter's who negotiates with him over information regarding those he is after in return for sexual favors..and we get to see her fabulous nude body as she disrobes for Slaughter who didn't need too much coaxing. Gloria HendryLive and Let Die is Slaughter's girlfriend Marcia her life soon threatened as Kirk desires the list for his boss. Hoke Howell has a funny cameo as a plane mechanic who at first doesn't give out the name of the person who hired the Spearman which flew over gunning down Slaughter's friends. Scatman Crothers stops by as an old friend of Slaughter who leads him to Creole as a favor in regards to finding someone available for opening Duncan's safe.Preposterous sequence where Slaughter somehow survives a car's plunging into the ocean after driving off a cliff and how he's able to move about freely despite the powerful connections of Duncan is a major logical problem..you'd think Duncan would have gunmen throughout the city with Slaughter encountering them everywhere he goes but this is not the case. Plus the whole opening sequence doesn't properly set the stage for the revenge of the movie..shouldn't we get to know Slaughter's comrades a bit before they are murdered?. It does deliver the violence though as Slaughter lives up to his name blowing away quite a many of Duncan's men with blood all over the place. Brown's sheer charisma and presence are of major importance as the plot itself doesn't exactly do him any favors. It's too bad the film doesn't use McMahon more because he is fun to watch as the mafioso with those big shades and ugly suits.";

However it is an interesting film to analyze.Unlike the first Slaughter movie this one is different in tone. Slaughter has no well meaning white partner like Don Gordon. In fact except for the beginning there is no good white male in the entire film. The screenplay writer a Mr Johnson who I believe to be African American I believe is the real auteur of this movie. The opening scene with an attack by an airplane may remind people of an incident in Tulsa Oklahoma in the early 1920's. Here an elderly white man the only good white man in the whole film who has just lost a close horse race to Jim Brown as Slaughter is killed by this plane as is another black person. The attempt was made to kill Slaughter. During this scene before the attack their are several tables set up. Ironically all the black people at this party sit together separate from the white people. Even here it is implied somewhat that while blacks and whites can be polite they cannot be together.Later on we will meet African American Brock Peter who at first appears to be antagonistic to Slaughter while his white boss who appears to be a nice guy we will later learn is corrupt and dealing with the mob led by all people Ed McMahon I guess Johnny Carson show didn't pay him enough. Brock Peters however will help Slaughter and they form an alliance.The White World is shown to be decadent and in decline. Sluaghter beats up three Rednecks terrorize's a white perverted drug dealer. During a murder of a white gangster who failed to kill Slaughter imaginatively done in a swimming pool especially as all the people at this party all white all of a sudden disappear implying somewhat that the white world condones such killing though they try to show that they are respectable. The only good white person from here on end is a white woman who just wants to have sex with Slaughter somewhat suggesting that for her white men are of no use. Slaughter complies but in no way does he seem to love this woman while he is making love to a black woman later on and we feel that he certainly cares more for her. Also a black pimp who appears to be a sleaze is allowed to show courage and that even he has more good character qualities than the white man.Don Stroud makes an interesting villain. He appears at the beginning while he is evil that he may be a match for Slaughter. But in the end when Slaughter faces him he will be no match for Jim Brown's Slaughter. As Jim Brown faces the bad white gangsters in the end I am struck by his getting his guns ready to put the massacre on these white baddies. Certainly it might go against Martin Luther Kings principals. However metaphorically one could see Slaughter getting his guns ready to go after the people behind James Earl Ray who wanted King dead.This is no classic it is not even good cinema but Slaughters Big Ripoff is none the less an interesting movie for what it is saying.".

	schema:reviewBody "This remake of the 1950 classic film noir of the same name cleverly utilises a combination of old and new elements to create an entertaining thriller which although designed for 1980s moviegoers still has a strong appeal to contemporary audiences.Fans of the original will particularly appreciate the fact that the basic premise of the story has been retained and will also enjoy the black and white sequences at the beginning and end of the movie which provide a stylish homage to Rudolph Mate's film. Those not familiar with the original will also find it an enjoyable mystery which involves murder jealousy campus politics and a very unusual motive for murder.University professor Dexter Dex Cornell Dennis Quaid goes into a police station to report his own murder and as his story is recorded on video tape it becomes clear that he's been poisoned with a slow acting substance which left him with less than 48 hours to track down his killer and to find out why anyone would want to murder him.Dex had written some successful novels but when writer's block set in he'd become disillusioned and progressively lost interest in what he was doing. His despair became even greater when one of his most talented students Nick Lang Robert Knepper died after falling from a high building and his wife Gail Jane Kaczmarek pressed him to go ahead with action to speed up their divorce. Dexter then reacted by seeking consolation in the local bars where he met Sydney Fuller Meg Ryan who was one of his students who had a crush on him. The couple then got drunk together and went back to Sydney's place.Next morning when Dex woke up feeling ill he knew he was suffering from something more serious than a hangover and checks at a local clinic confirmed that he'd been poisoned. There was no antidote which could help his condition and so knowing that he didn't have long to live he decided to visit Gail who had been involved in an affair with Nick. When Dex found her dead body the police immediately suspected him of murdering both her and Nick. Dex took an opportunity to escape from the police and then decided to force Sydney to go with him to the places they'd visited the previous night to try to discover who'd murdered him.During Dex's frantic race against time he learned more about Nick's complicated family background and together with Sydney escaped the attentions of a vicious assailant who pursued them with a nail gun. The identity of the murderer surprises Dex but the motive proves to be even more shocking.Directors Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel employ an interesting combination of stylistic influences which work together very effectively. The use of high and low angle shots closeups and tilted camera angles are also especially successful as they reflect the sense of chaos and confusion which prevails through certain passages of the action.This is a film which features good performances from Dennis Quaid Meg Ryan and Charlotte Rampling and has a premise which gives its story a natural sense of pace and urgency. Add to this a number of twists and numerous moments of suspense and humour and the final result is an intriguing mystery which is great fun to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "D.O.A has a good premise borrowed from a 1950 film of the same name and a 1969 film entitled Color Me Dead. But beyond the premise it fails to develop into anything worthwhile. The script mistakes ludicrousness for cleverness the directors peculiarly seem to think they're making a pop video rather than a film and Dennis Quaid puts on a weird grin and raises his eyebrows maniacally as if he's auditioning as a Jack Nicholson impersonator. It's good for a laugh but since that wasn't the original intention it's hard to rate this as a worthwhile film.English lecturer Dexter Cornell Quaid is a bitter bored shell of a man. Formerly a great author he never recovered from the critical failure of his fourth and final novel and vowed never to write again. Without the drive of writing to fill his life he gave up on everything else too including his marriage and his dedication to the job. When pupil Nick Lang Rob Knepper apparently commits suicide after handing in an assignment Cornell hits the booze to get over the shock. But soon thereafter he learns that he has drunk a slowacting poison and that within 48 hours he will be dead. So close to death he finally finds a renewed purpose in being alive.... as aided by student Sydney Fuller Meg Ryan he desperately attempts to solve his own murder.It's such a good idea that one can hardly imagine how it could fail. But it does. It really really does fail in a big way. All the pointlessly fancy camera angles all the inappropriate musical scoring and especially the jawdroppingly stupid solution to the mystery conspire to ruin the film. D.O.A stands for Dead On Arrival and that's the perfect adjectival phrase for the entire film. Some day this wonderful idea for a film might be used once again to better effect but for now you'd be best advised to stick with the 1950 version.".

	schema:reviewBody "For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something and who appreciate a farce that is clever enough for you to take it seriously this movie will surprise you. It is not a 'whodunit' for people who can't aren't able to follow the verbal exchange of our hero Professor Dexter Cornell Dennis Quaid.Cornell teaches in Southern California near the tar pits. He has not published a novel in four years his wife is divorcing him he drinks a bit much and is blessed or cursed with caustic wit which he freely dispenses to his students. He has recommended a friend for advancement and one bright young student has submitted a manuscript to him as an independent project. Cornell doesn't even want to read it so gives it an A and pushes it to the side. Leaning back with a drink in his office he stares out the window when the bright young student falls past his window on the way to meeting the sidewalk in a splat encounter.Hal comes to talk and they chat drinking some more. The Cornell realizes that he HAS to read the manuscript now. When he goes home his wife is waiting with divorce papers. He drinks some more. She leaves and he goes to a faculty affair only to find her there. He drinks even more. And when his wife learns that the student is dead she swoons and he learns that she had been having an affair with the student. This of course prompts him to do some more serious drinking. The next morning he wakes up to find himself in the dorm room of one of his students a freshman named Syd Meg Ryan.He feels worse than a  hangover goes to the doctor and learns that he has been poisoned it is irreversible and he has 2448 hours to live. He doesn't have much time to find out who killed him and there are subplots motives relationships and surprises at every turn although everything makes sense at the end. All his discoveries and exchanges are adorned with sarcasm dry wit and keen observations. Let's just say that this movie will give new meaning to the adage publish or perish.There are no bad performances in this movie. There are recurrent images and symbolism used at careful intervals. Watch for the cracked glass and images distorted through glass. Some of the camera shots are revolutionary for 1988 and some of the violent action is carefully and skillfully choreographed. The music is unobtrusive and appropriate although occasionally it makes it's own statement in song lyrics. The visuals in this flick are impressive.If there are any failures it is that the opening 20 minutes move a little slow and nearly puts you to sleep. But the pacing picks up quickly with just the right amount of exposition in between action segments.There are no explicit sexual encounters although there is violence and some bad language.This is a writer's movie and is best appreciated by those who have a sense of humor about their own success or failure. I do think if you take it seriously you're already in big trouble.".

The plot is pretty much the same. A man this time an English professor at the University of Texas at Austin is poisoned and he has only 24 hours to find out who poisoned him and why. Meg Ryan plays a young college student who tries to help him. Jane Kaczmarek plays Quaid's estranged wife in a low key but intense performance she steals every scene she is in. Daniel Stern also in an early role before Home Alone made him famous plays Quaid's colleague. Charlotte Rampling is fine too in a supporting role.The entire cast is top notch The film is stylish with a quick pace that keeps you guessing until the end.

I guess when you aren't sure whether you can do one or two things really well the best thing to do is crank out two dozen things and hope at least a few of them will stick in the audience's mind. And why treat a movie like a short story  everything toward one effect  when you can make it like one of those sprawling 1200 page literary developments the kind the drugstore sells?The music again irritates here seeming jarring and incongruous in several places. And long slow lazy Tangerine Dream style synthesizer blares and wails while evocative of a certain mood are also perhaps even more evocative of the earlymid 80s. 7 stars. I like this Quaid he works in the role. After seeing it I would say it is hard to imagine anyone else in Hollywood at the time playing this character with the right mix of vulnerability and near toughness.".

I guess when you aren't sure whether you can do one or two things really well the best thing to do is crank out two dozen things and hope at least a few of them will stick in the audience's mind. And why treat a movie like a short story  everything toward one effect  when you can make it like one of those sprawling 1200 page literary developments the kind the drugstore sells?The music again irritates here seeming jarring and incongruous in several places. And long slow lazy Tangerine Dream style synthesizer blares and wails while evocative of a certain mood are also perhaps even more evocative of the earlymid 80s. 7 stars. I like this Quaid he works in the role. After seeing it I would say it is hard to imagine anyone else in Hollywood at the time playing this character with the right mix of vulnerability and near toughness.";

It stars Dennis Quaid Meg Ryan Daniel Stern Charlotte Rampling Jane Kaczmarek and Christopher Neame. Music is by Chaz Jankel and cinematography by Yuri Neyman.A loose remake of the 1950 film noir of the same name the story finds Professor Dexter Cornell Quaid staggering into a police station proclaiming that he is dying because someone has poisoned him. Told in flashback by Cornell we see the events that led up to the point he was poisoned but not who did it and then track the frantic Professor as he tries to solve the who done it mystery before he keels over and dies.Not as bad as the poor box office returns suggest it is D.O.A. is still very much a frustratingly shaky experience. Lifting only the basic idea of the 1950 movie the makers stamp their own mark on the premise but add too many red herrings to the already fishy stew. Some plot developments are daft as is the casting of Meg Ryan in the key femme role  seriously she is just too cookie cute and homely for this material  while the motive reveal is a bit much to swallow. Yet there's still a lot to enjoy and sample here for the neonoir faithful.Visually the picture is stylish and appreciative to its noir roots. Opening in black and white to set the story in motion Jankel and Morton then infuse the film with angled shots and frame distortions. Shadows often come into play with Venetian blinds and roof rafters impacting while the addition of a spiral staircase late in the day is most pleasing. Quaid is ever watchable in what is a tricky role that calls for him to garner sympathy whilst not being likable! While elsewhere Stern and Rampling provide good characterisations even if as written the roles are too small given the importance the characters have to the plot shenanigans.A bit over cooked on the page and basically a race against time thriller dressed up in neonoir clothing D.O.A. is still none the less worthy of a viewing. 6.510".

This one mixes in a bit more dark humor than the 1950 version but the stories are different and the inclusion of Ryan adds zest. The direction is crisp.

The plot keeps the viewer guessing and the film has a sort of Hitchcock quality to it. But some of the dialog and much of the action are kinda cheesy.  Dex's last line to the policemen ready to tape his story Just somebody's homework. That was all.I'm going to change my mind and only give it 6 of 10 it's just a little too ragged.".

Not long after Dex demurs to Nick to read his novel Nick is killed in a fall. Only then does Dex find out that Nick has been having an affair with his wife.

Teaming up with the adoring Sydney Dex tries to track down the person who poisoned him while dodging the cops since he happens to be a prime murder suspect.It's not on the same level as the original but this updated version still manages a few enjoyable twists as it is a witty and literate thriller with a lot of irony to cut the violence. The ending shouldn't be given away but it hangs on a laughable motivation for murder that says more about the plagiarist Zen of Hollywood and screenwriters than anything else. Quaid is convincing as the chainsmoking English professor Ryan is true blue as the stalwart coed and Rampling looks capable of keeping her victims alive just to toy with them.In summary film noir on campus idea works surprisingly well as it has enough inventive moments to make it interesting.".

I really liked that even though the premise was the same man gets poisoned man goes to police to tell the story movie unfolds in a flashback I did not feel like I was watching the original movie after about the first 10 minutes of the film. Now the original is a noir classic This movie though I would not say is a classic in the NEO NOIR category it definitely is worth a watch.Quaid gives a slightly manacle performance that is fun to watch and he does a pretty good job of holding the movie together. Some of the other cast members well they work but their motives to me do not lead up to the results that are laid out but this is a movie so who cares? The production is spot on. The lighting is what I always imagine a noir picture to be. Fan shadows lights through blinds lit cig smoke. All the stereotypes that make a Noir a Noir are here. It does work and looks spectacular. This movie would be a great movie if you were to be studying lighting techniques.The end I did see coming but it felt underwhelming. Noir is known for having some twist or cool plot device that is set up without even knowing was set up and then BOOM last ten seconds changes everything....not so much here.Is it as solid as the original? Well the original is a classic but to me is a different movie and other than the set up and the title are different and should be judged on their own.I enjoyed it and will watch it again.".

While it's not the worst remake I have seen it is burdened by flaws that will be noticeable to even those who haven't seen the original version. For one thing there is the portrayal of the central protagonist. He comes across as a kind of a jerk both before he is poisoned as well as when he knows he is dying and is trying to figure out who the culprit is. Another problem with the movie is that it is pretty easy to figure out who the culprit is as well as that person's motives  all you have to do is look at who is near the top of the cast billing and realize that that certain person seems to have no other purpose in the movie. The direction is stylish and effective at times but more often than not it is loud and garish and ends up being very distracting. Even if you dislike black and white movies unlike myself this is definitely one time where you'd be more satisfied with the original movie rather than this remake.".

	schema:reviewBody "My main attraction was that I absolutely love the original Snow Queen story and always have done for me it is one of Hans Christian Andersen's best stories. So naturally I would see any adaptation of it regardless of the company or who was in it. I was a little dubious though as for me Hallmark's output have been a very mixed bag. The good news is that while it is miles away from being perfect Snow Queen is really quite decent and one of Hallmark's better efforts.It does have a number of good things. The best asset is by far the visuals. The scenery settings and lighting look absolutely stunning easily one of Hallmark's bestlooking movies and the Snow Queen's costumes and makeup are an absolute knockout. The cinematography is basic and maybe some of the slowmotion shots get too much and unnecessary but on the most part it is focused and fluid. The music score is very good also it has the sparkling motifs that you'd associate with a fantasy score the darker moments have a haunting musical undercurrent and it does all this without ever sounding generic.Snow Queen's lead performance I did think were quite good. The acting honours do go to Bridget Fonda who I think is wonderful as the Snow Queen. She looks breathtakingly beautiful and while she is cold and icy at points she also has a humane side which she delivers with a surprising amount of pathos. Jeremy Guilbaut showed a lot of potential as Kai he does bring genuine character and natural intensity to him proving that he is more than just a pretty face. Chelsea Hobbs is a little bland to start with but I didn't worry too much actually as it fitted with the character going on a journeyliterally and in character development and later on she is easier to warm to.Oh and before I forget I was surprised by how good the special effects were the reindeer and the polar bear looked great. Snow Queen began and ended well the darker moments providing a lot of promise for the telling of such a timeless story.Unfortunately for all the good things that Snow Queen it does also have debits. The rest of the acting is uneven though with one exception nobody is exactly bad. That exception though is Kira Clavell's Summer Princess who acts and sounds like she is participating in a highschool production. But the main problems are the script the pacing and the story. The script once the darkness shifts dissolves into anachronism and modern vernacular which against the production values proved to be quite a stilted mismatch.At this point as well the pacing does get tedious and save for some inspired moments never really picks up some of the action sequences like with the Summer Princess' minions and the Autumn robbers are quite nifty though which is a shame considering how promising the beginning and end proved to be. The story showed a lot of potential and I personally did find Gerda and Kai's love for one another and together convincing which took a nosedive in the tone shift. For a programme of this length I was disappointed at how forced the Autumn scenes seemed to be and by how certain events were introduced but never explained satisfactorily and consequently coming across as confused instead.So in summing up Snow Queen was decent and watchable with the art direction being the best thing about it but there were a number of things that stopped it from being great. 610 Bethany Cox".

The three main characters are played with varying degrees of success Kai comes across as bland as does Gerda initially but once she sets off to find Kai you warm to her. Bridget Fonda looks great as the Snow Queen but seems to be in a different movie to everyone else.Ultimately the film is unsatisfying. It looks good but drags and lacks magic.".

I know that they were going for a true love conquers all kind of thing but about all this film conquered was about 3which felt more like 9 hours of my afternoon which I will never get back. The movie is about two young lovers named Kai and Gerta who live in a remote town in a fantasy world.  Kai is the muchabused bellboy at a hotel owned by Gerta's father.  At first Gerta ignores Kai's advances but she eventually warms up to him much to the disgust of You Guessed It! Gerta's father.  As if this obstacle wasn't enough to overcome an evil snow queen shoots a shard of glass in Kai's eye and he becomes a mean person treats Gerta poorly.  Kai is eventually taken to the Snow Queen's fortress Which is the same set as the hotel just covered in ice because the good people at Hallmark like to go all out and Gerta sets out on a mission to get Kai back.  Along the way she runs into the 3 other seasons that are evil in their own special way but Gerta escapes them with the help of some dull and forgettable characters she meets along the way.  All the while you will want to turn it off but can't force yourself to do it.  It's probably the most evil and most effective spells cast by the Snow Queen Anyways I will spare you from the ending because anything you can think up in your head right now is probably better then how they ended it.  So in conclusion the Snow Queen is an incredibly boring movie which takes the fan out of fantasy.".

The film I was looking for was The Polar Bear King a Norwegian production dealing with a very similar story about a young princess searching for her abducted prince.Snow Queen however is not set in the middle ages but circa 1900 in the cold reaches of a Nordic landscape even though everyone speaks English. We're presented with a sprawling magical epic of young love challenged by the callous heart of a queen who herself seeks to conquer what she already had but failed to see.There's a lot of subtext and other themes going on here. We see the Snow Queen and witness her cold manifest itself on both physical emotional and even spiritual levels. She goes forth and sees that another wants and covets another's possession. She exercises her power and so our tale begins. Is she really evil and cold or is there something missing from her life? Perhaps there's even more to her that we as yet fail to discover? Again the story reveals all.During the unfolding of the tale our young protagonist ventures forth into a realm that lies straight on til morning to borrow from Disney's Peter Pan. There she meets eccentric antagonists and other characters mostly female and mostly with an agenda. Our young heroine must brave challenge and escape those who pose a roadblock to her ultimate objective.The production values are the usual top notch from Halmark. They don't spare expense when it comes to filming their intimate epics nor do they waste money on extravagance that will not be used nor seen. We see a town that's in transition from becoming a small intimate affair where everyone knows everyone else to becoming more of almost a small city ready to latently embrace the industrial revolution that's occurred in the outside world. We see vast wastes of snow capped mountains and lush green forests and gardens. We see bandits and soldiers and a whole feast of visuals as our gallant heroine moves from one episode of her adventure to another.The cinematography is basic but unlike a lot of other made for TV movies is not bland for the sake of expediency. The camera angles are a bit more dynamic and inspired but not quite the caliber of theatrical release. A combination of good camera usage and quality art direction gives the audience a very sumptuous TV film production.My critique is that it's not the film I wanted but I enjoyed it for what it was. It's an American film made for American audiences based on some Scandinavian folklore in regards to a tale that has some role reversal from the familiar tale of Gilgamesh. Everything aside it is worth a night's viewing if you have nothing better to do.Enjoy.".

The acting talent although not Alist is still great and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger movie with an Alist cast. My particular favourite from this movie is Bridget Fonda whose performance as the Snow Queen herself was quite moving assisted enormously by a stupendous wardrobe and makeup. She injected humanity and a sense of pathos into the character of the fallen season corrupted by the devil's evil magic. Fonda aside the acting was not what we have come to expect from Hollywood which I think is a good thing since Hollywood seems to have run out of ideas on how to train its acting talent to portray roles and so they have become stale and reliant on CGI and other special effects to take us away from the actors who all use the same tricks on us. Instead it shows new ideas some real thinking on the part of the actors about how they can find new variations on the the old themes of love and danger.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Snow Queen is based on the famous and very beautiful fairytale by Hans Christian Andersen about a girl Gerda who goes on a dangerous journey to rescue her friend Kai from the clutches of the Snow Queen. This adaption attempts to capture that story's sense of adventure and luminously intricate imagery through lavish sets and production design but fails on a number of counts.Like so many Hallmark productions the potential of the story is completely undercut by heavyhanded scripting and direction. The two actors playing Gerda and Kai are blandly pleasant but forgettable Bridget Fonda as the Snow Queen looks the part but is otherwise miscast for the role. There's a notable lack of dramatic tension to this meandering threehour miniseries. At least some of the pacing problems can be attributed to the addition of filler scenes that add very little to the original story particularly in the opening hour that introduces the main characters.That said The Snow Queen would be just about ideal for preteens with a liking for fantasy and a bit of patience. It's great eyecandy without being scary and the acting is pitched at the sort of pantomime overthetop level that spells out the storyline in very very bold text. Just make sure you read them Andersen's story too.".

The two actors playing Gerda and Kai are blandly pleasant but forgettable Bridget Fonda as the Snow Queen looks the part but is otherwise miscast for the role. There's a notable lack of dramatic tension to this meandering threehour miniseries. At least some of the pacing problems can be attributed to the addition of filler scenes that add very little to the original story particularly in the opening hour that introduces the main characters.That said The Snow Queen would be just about ideal for preteens with a liking for fantasy and a bit of patience. It's great eyecandy without being scary and the acting is pitched at the sort of pantomime overthetop level that spells out the storyline in very very bold text. Just make sure you read them Andersen's story too.";

The two of us will always be one combined with sad piano tones in some places gives a very touching result and if one watches both parts at once he'll see the Snow Queen is not so bad. She only tries to surround Herself with love in the wrong way. The evening this movie was on here first part I only watched it because I was bored but I loved it a lot more after and was very angry when they didn't show the next part because of the Pope's funeral... Yeah that was terribly sad for me. But when they said it will be on next week I was so happy that I recorded it and now I'm glad to have done so.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is based on The Snow Queen traditional fairytale by Hans Christian Andersen. The original story is quite depressing and I didn't like Snow Queen as a child it was cold and quite dreary. The book didn't appeal to me. This film is a lot more colourful than the original fairytale. Gerda looks for her missing boyfriend and traces him across the seasons meeting various sisters of the four seasons who each want to keep her as their prisoner. It's only the Snow Queen who doesn't want Gerda the only season who has no interest in her. The snow queen wants boys and has frozen a lot of them. She turned a man into a polar bear and forced Kai to fix a broken mirror puzzle. The main theme is that Snow Queen is actually Winter itself and threatens the world with an Ice Age. It was Gerda's magical broach that protected her from the Snow Queen. The costumes the flying snow car scenery flowers and theme of seasonal sisters is delightful and appeals to kids mainly and some adults who enjoy watching family fantasy. Oh and the reindeer was cool but a shame he wasn't in it that much.".

I disliked the fact that Gerda and KayKai were so much older and their little flirtation with romance it felt heavy handed and false. There's no way that just after a couple of months and one kiss Gerda would chase off after Kay. Even with his silly Help Me note.That said I think that the bits with Kay and the Snow Queen could have been considerably edited down and more time spent with Gerda on her travels. I am not sure about the poster who said that there was no robber girl but there was. I do know that the travelling thru the seasons was added because of the whole the mirror is the devils creation and he gave it to the seasons... bs storyline. Which of course is utter tripe.As far as being beautifully shot sure if you like white. Everything frm the frozen land looked as if it had been sprayed with canned snow nothing really looked good. I didn't really like what they did to the snow queen all in all it was a complete disappointment to me. ESP the fact that I rented it and didn't think to remember that since it was hallmark it was probably a freaking miniseries or at least a two part movie.

	schema:reviewBody "I fret saw this sprawling romantic fantasy epic years ago when it premiered as a television mini series and I found it to be something special and loved it right away it felt like this big fantasy adventure a love story and a Christmas movie all rolled into one. When I watch this 'movie' which is always sometime in December I'm always drawn in by the atmosphere and colourful visuals there's so much attention to detail in the sets and costumes it wasn't a superhigh budgeted production but they were highly creative with what they had and it has a fantastic look. Anyway to me despite it being perhaps a bit too long I still find it very fun and festive to unwind with during the chilly holidays. It's a big movie but I personally don't find it boring there's a lot that goes on in it once it gets going and once I start watching I'm in for the long haul and have to watch it to the very end there's something about it that I find very engaging and it cruises through the long story with a competence that most TVproduced short fantasy series fail to achieve and happy sad or awed you get a lot of emotional bang for your buck with Snow Queen. Watching it is like being locked in jail but you love the warden! I like it best in the second chunk of the story where Gerda embarks on her quest to find her bewitched boyfriend and the Snow Queen and encounters the three other sister witches of the seasons who each act as obstacles to her final goal and are all selfish possessive and various degrees of crazy! It's not exactly what you'd call a linear story arc a lot of it is pretty surreal and even metaphorical there are points where you don't actually know which direction it's going to go in next but it keeps a sense of strange reality about itself and has a good balance between the dramatic and fantastical and for me the overall presentation is a most enchanting one. I think the characters are good enough and make it work Chelsea Hobbs is boring at first but as she traverses her very layered journey she really grows as a character and gains the strength and courage to face and defeat a foe who's far more powerful than she is by awakening her lost inner warmth and humanity and free her boyfriend's frozen spirit. Jeremy Guilbaut was so impossibly adorable in this I had such a huge crush on him when I first watched it and I thought he had the face of an angel! He could play the cutie but also a jerk really well so he was good for the part. I truly thought that Bridget Fonda made an awesome Snow Queen. She was hauntingly beautiful vain powerful and commanding was selfcentred had a cruel sense of humour and was quick to anger and everything she did including essentially sacrificing many young men that she had enslaved to her will over who knows how long was for the sole purpose of the virtually impossible task of reassembling the thousands of shards of a magic mirror forged by the devil himself that would give her the power to cast an eternal winter and reign supreme over the other seasons... I loved how it wasn't like she was only wicked and nothing else she had an enigmatic tone to her character like she wasn't always so completely cold and heartless but had at some point been corrupted by something which eventually turns out to be true. I loved all of the gripping scenes with her and Kai which stay in the same frozen hopeless place while Gerda travels throughout the seasonal realms. I also liked the touch of how the Snow Queen's domain was an icy version of the hotel I find that quite clever in how it played into the theme if Kai's cold heart as well as Gerda's father's. I still love this and feel drawn to watching it around Christmas I find it an uplifting and satisfying watch. It deserves a lot more love and to be remembered better than what it has been and I'd suggest while watching it that you try to see beyond the kinks and look at the bigger picture of its story and try to enjoy it for what it is. Recommended to fans of fantasy and romance the young and the young at heart. Truly magical. X".

Winter being carried away by the expolarbear gives the feeling that rather than the typically stupid idea of 'evil turning good at the last minute' that she instead was merely going back to the way she was and should have been that she had been bewitched by the mirror.";

I am a fan of fantasy and I really like watching mysterious characters. The snow queen by itself has the potential to be beautiful terrible and mysterious. The snow queen of the movie is just like a teenager and does not convey the sense of superiority a queen from a fairy tale should have.

What director Tom Dey has tried to do is make it a satire of the clichs of buddy comedy and the media. Early in the movie the executive of a cable network asks How is this different from Cops? when Chase Renzi is pitching the idea of a reality show dealing with De Niro's character Mitch Preston hilariously boring name by the way. That's when I saw it in a new light that I hadn't previously noticed.The idea is to show all the elements of the buddy comedy and put a twist on them. De Niro's reluctance to star in the show and to partner up with Murphy is right out of every cop film you can think of. You can say that De Niro is actually playing himself asking Why would I do another movie playing a cop? Chase Renzi is portrayed to be a Hollywood phony but if you look at her opening scene again she is merely doing it to save her job. She somehow sees the ridiculousness of what she is doing but she wants to succeed despite that. One line says it all Who doesn't want to be on TV? Maybe this is reading too much into what is essentially a lightweight film merely set to entertain but it does give it a little spin that I hadn't noticed before.As for Murphy. You got to applaud him for looking this ridiculous. Trey wants to be a star so bad that he is willing to sell out everything he comes in contact with. Murphy was a big star and maybe it struck a nerve that it is all so fleeting.The plot with the gun is of course pretty boring. The action sequences are nothing special except the end which required a lot of effort both from cast and crew. One thing that I noticed about the villain is that he is dressed like an 80's pop star. George Michael comes to mind and that adds to the whole media spin.So I trashed it the first time around but what the heck if you are gonna do this why not point out how ridiculous it really is and De Niro and Murphy took a big chance doing this.".

Rene Russo well she's just fun to watch anyway and she's played her part excellent.Some wild and unusual stunts especially the garbage truck scene. This was worth seeing in the theater.

Deniro proves he can be a great Straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments.  Eddie was fun to watch working with people instead of CGI animals and rodents.  Rene Russo well she's just fun to watch anyway and she's played her part excellent.Some wild and unusual stunts especially the garbage truck scene. This was worth seeing in the theater.  We needed a good laugh and got many from the movie and the great outtakes at the end.  DO NOT LEAVE at the start of the credits!At least a 7.";

De Niro and Murphy portray two LAPD officers who are recruited to be the central characters' for a new Cops'type reality TV show wherein a camera crew will follow the two on their appointed rounds as they chase suspects round up criminals and all in all make the streets of LA safe for the common decent citizens who reside therein.  De Niro's Mitch Preston is a reluctant participant in the series while Murphy's Trey Sellars is a wannabe actor with stars in his eyes who sees this as his golden opportunity to make it big in show business.The initial problem with Showtime' is that it feels more like a high concept' exercise than an actual movie.  Despite the fact that there are a number of funny moments in the film too many of the scenes fall flat both as comedy and as action drama.  The saving grace is that De Niro's understated cynicism provides an effective counterpoint to Murphy's overthetop enthusiasm resulting in just enough comic tension to wring laughs out of even the weakest of material.  It is a joy to watch these two pros at work and they are nicely complemented by Rene Russo as the driven TV producer whose brainchild serves as the excuse for the story.  William Shatner playing himself also generates some laughs often at his own goodnatured expense.Yet the film itself is a failure.  One of the prime dictums of the screenplay is to try to show the discrepancy between police work as it is portrayed on the screen and police work as it really is.  In fact the film opens with veteran De Niro instructing a class of elementary school children about the mundane realities of life on the job.  Yet the film betrays its own theme by itself indulging in all the inane shootemup and car chase scenes it is supposed to be satirizing the scenes are not exploited for comic effect which might have lent some much needed satirical bite to the proceedings.  Even worse the serious' side of the story involving drug deals and gun running fails to generate any interest or suspense.Oh well.  De Niro and Murphy are such likable comic actors that the movie for all its many weaknesses manages to whiz by without inflicting too much boredom and pain.  Showtime' is a completely forgettable and innocuous little time waster but fans of these particular actors will at least appreciate their efforts.".

However Showtime is a pretty decent buddy actioncomedy that is fairly entertaining. Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro are a mismatched pair of cops that are working together and are being filmed on a reality cop show called Showtime. Both of these actors are great at what they do with De Niro being an excellent dramatic actor Eddie is a comic genius and while Robert De Niro is one of the best actors of his time Eddie Murphy is equally talented in the comedic realm. Also both of these guys worked with director Martin Breast and made two of the best action comedies Beverly Hills Cop and Midnight Run. Showtime can't really hold a candle against either of these classics but still is pretty fast paced lighthearted and action packed entertainment. Both Murphy and De Niro are great here but the film itself is nothing spectacular. You could do much worst for an evenings entertainment and this is in my opinion Eddie Murphy's best modern comedy that suites my tastes much better than the crappy family movies he has focused on since his classic period in the 80's and early 90's.".

I mean can you really see Eddie Murphy or anyone else going through the rigors of the real Police Academy not the screen version just to get a day job?Anyway DeNiro is your basic hard working detective who's on the trail of a major gun dealer. He's undercover and Murphy is part of his backup. So what does the showboating Murphy do he calls a reality based TV series like COPS to film the action. So DeNiro's bust gets blown sky high but the producer of the show gets some good footage of Murphy and DeNiro and decides on a new reality based television series. So these unwilling partners get joined and try to continue working DeNiro's case with all the TV cameras around.Eddie Murphy's a funny guy I loved him in Beverly Hills Cop and in the Doctor Doolittle movies but he's done better things than Showtime and Robert DeNiro certainly has.

Eddie Murphy plays Trey Sellers a cop who dreams of acting in films. After Mitch shoots out a TV camera at a crime scene a network executive Rene Russo decides that they will sue the police department unless Mitch agrees to be part of their new reality based cop show. When Mitch is forced to become part of the show he ends up getting Trey Sellers as a partner. Trey is nothing like Mitch. Trey is goofy doesn't follow standard police procedures and doesn't take his police work seriously. Mitch is the exact opposite. So here comes the average copbuddy film right? Two opposites forced to work together who in the end patch everything up and become best friends? Not exactly.What makes Showtime different from the rest of the copbuddy films in the genre is that the whole situation is different and is not exactly what you'd expect. Never before has a copbuddy movie had the officers followed around with a camera. So with this in mind this movie might be great right? Again not exactly.The problem with Showtime is it could have been so much better. The camera really could've gotten some funny stuff. But in this film instead of focusing more on the fact that they're constantly being filmed most of the film we don't see the camera man following them. We see them at home or talking about things doing things. We never see the camera man with them. The film focuses more on what it's like to be followed by a camera instead of WITH a camera. What I mean by this is that we are shown footage of how Mitch and Trey react AFTER filming. It's like a celebrity bio. We see them behind the camera their ordinary lives and how they cope with paparazzi and spotlight. However in Showtime that's not what we want to see. We want to see the camera chasing them the whole way through the movie. We want to see Mitch and Trey react on the spot dealing with the camera THERE and THEN not later. It would be so much more of a fun movie if we could just see Mitch and Trey the whole time being followed on the street getting into funny situations instead of what Showtime gives usa look at how Mitch and Trey deal with it after their work day is over and the cameras stop rolling. I'll admit this happened a few times in the film but it should've been more. The director really missed out on a funny movie here by not portraying it the right way and not taking it in the right direction.We find the plot in this film to not really be taken seriously at all. No one really cares. At one point Mitch and Trey get a big lead and the camera doesn't show them react at all to it. They just go off and we see them joking around driving in the car again.The acting in Showtime was good but the chemistry between the characters wasn't all that special. Nothing jumped out at me with DeNiro and Murphy. I've seen much better chemistry between actors. It wasn't horrible chemistry but it wasn't great either.All in all what Showtime could've been it isn't. It more or less forgets the cameras are following these cops and just leads us away from caring about anything going on. Showtime is like a mix between Lethal Weapon Beverly Hills cop COPS and Turner and Hootch. It may sound like a weird combo but it's true. Some of those filmsshows are great but if you combined them the wrong way with wrong directing style and progression what would you get? Showtime.So do I recommend this film to you? Believe it or not yes I do. Because though it wasn't great and wasn't half of what it could've been it's still got some funny moments and Robert DeNiro gives us the ol tough guy cop image like some of his other films and Eddie Murphy redoes his Break all the rulesprocedures goof off and triumph!' attitude. So though Showtime isn't great a one time viewing isn't going to hurt. DeNiro's expressions throughout the movie help a lot. That's why I recommend renting and viewing the film once. 35 stars enjoy!".

This interesting angle on a familiar genre is lamentably under used descending into a cameo by William Shatner full of poor jokes about T.J. HOOKER. Like THE LAST ACTION HERO it actually metamorphasises into the very thing it is mocking. Unlike that film it isn't entertaining.Robert De Niro looks tired and old clearly in it for the cash. Eddie Murphy continues to be the most annoying man on film. Rene Russo gives it her best shot but is let down by weak characterisation and a lack of anything to do.The film takes over half its running time just to get the two cops set up leaving them very little time in the latter half. To keep the running time down the investigation is made absurdly easy. The baddie is utterly generic as is the McGuffin and the stakes are nonexistent. The screenplay must take a lot of the criticism for this being poorly paced characterised and unfunny. A good car chase and a single good stunt involving a flood in a penthouse apartment fail to redeem the film. A poor effort.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you've seen the trailer for this movie you pretty much know what to expect because what you see here is what you get.  And even if you haven't seen the previews it won't take you long to pick up on what you're in for specifically a good time and plenty of laughs from this clever satire of Reality TV' shows and Buddy Cop' movies Showtime' directed by Tom Dey starring Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy.Mitch Preston De Niro is a detective with the L.A.P.D. and he's good at what he does but working a case one night things suddenly go south when another cop Trey Sellars Murphy inadvertently intervenes a television news crew shows up and Mitch loses his cool which results in a lawsuit by the television station that's going to cost the department some big bucks. Except that they may be able to get around it thanks to Chase Renzi Rene Russo who works for the station and likes what she sees in Mitch enough to pitch an idea to her boss for a Reality' cop show that would feature none other than Mitch Preston whom Chase sees as a real life Dirty Harry.'Her boss likes the idea and gives Chase the green light.  Now all she has to do is convince Mitch to participate which shouldn't be too hard since the station has agreed to drop the lawsuit if he will do the show.  But Mitch is a cop not an actor and he wants nothing to do with any of it that is until he has a hearttoheart with his boss Captain Winship Frankie Faison who puts Mitch's future into succinct perspective for him. And just like that the show is on.  Oh yes there's one more thing for the show Mitch is going to need a partner.  And who do you suppose they're going to come up with for that?  Let's put it this way  Trey Sellars is more than one of the usual suspects.This is Dey's second film as a director his first being Shanghai Noon' also a comedy and he's definitely showing a penchant for the genre.  From the opening frames he establishes a pace that keeps the story moving right along and he allows his stars to make the most of their respective talents and personal strengths including their impeccable timing.  With stars like De Niro and Murphy Dey of course had a leg up on this project to begin with but he's the one who keeps it on track demonstrating that he knows what works achieving just the right blend of physical comedy and action and employing the subtleties of the dialogue to great effect. There isn't a more natural actor in the business than De Niro and he steps into Mitch's skin like he was born to it.  And after years of doing hardedge cutting drama in which he turned in one remarkable performance after another with such films as Analyze This' Meet the Parents' and now this one he has firmly established his proficiency for doing comedy as well.  Mitch is not an especially complex character he is in fact something of an ordinary' guy but therein lies the challenge for the actor to make him believable to make him seem like the guy who could be your neighbor and just another member of the community.  And on all counts De Niro succeeds.  He's Mitch the guy you run into at the grocery store or the bank or say good morning' to on your way to work who likes to watch the game on TV and has a life just like you and me who happens to make his living by being a cop.  It's the character Mitch has to be to make this film work because it makes the ordinary guy in extraordinary circumstances' angle credible.  It's one of those role and work that is often wrongly dismissed outofhand because it looks so easy and of course this is what makes De Niro so exceptional he does make it look easy and he does it with facility.As Trey Sellars Eddie Murphy turns in a winning performance as well and it's a role that fits him like the proverbial glove.  Trey is a cop but also an aspiring actor and a bad one and it gives Murphy the opportunity to play on the overexuberant side of his personality reigned in enough by Dey however to keep him from soaring overthetop into Jim Carrey territory which works perfectly for this character and this film.  From his melodramatic take on a part during an audition to his throwing out of oneliners delivered by looking directly into the camera which as far as he's concerned isn't even there while filming the reality' show Murphy's a riot.  And he has a chemistry with De Niro that really clicks which is not unexpected as this is another of De Niro's many talents his ability to connect with and bring out the best in his costars all of whom evidence will support are better at their craft after having worked with him including the likes of Meryl Streep Christopher Walken and Ed Harris just to name a few.  Most importantly this is a part that allows Murphy to excel at what he does best and he certainly makes the most of it.Russo makes the most of her role as Chase too a character who isn't much of a stretch artistically but whom she presents delightfully with a strong believable performance.  And William Shatner playing himself absolutely steals a couple of scenes as the director of the show.The supporting cast includes Drena De Niro Annie Pedro Damian Vargas and James Roday Camera Man.  Well crafted and delivered Showtime' is a comedy that's exactly what it is meant to be  Pure entertainment that provides plenty of laughs and a pleasant couple of hours that will have you chuckling for some time after.  It's the magic of the movies.  810.".

Rene Russo is the sleazy producer and ham William Shatner plays himself as he directs the odd duo. Murphy naturally has always had dreams of stardom while DeNiro is as serious as a heart attack. Thus their relationship is strained to put it mildly. Soon they end up going after criminal Pedro Damian who seemingly has an arsenal of weapons at his disposal. There is not much thought in Showtime. It is typical Eddie Murphy fare as it is a production to show off his unique comedic timing. DeNiro has also become a comedy regular the last several years unfortunately in my opinion and he too shows an uncanny ability to add humor to his natural edginess. Overall though the movie plays like a long sitcom or an episode of Saturday Night Live as everything seems way too scripted. There is no real drama here just cheap laughs. In the end those minor laughs make Showtime viewable but not memorable. 2.5 out of 5 stars.".

That film was Showtime and funnily enough it was the film out of the selection that I ended up watching. 'Why?' you might ask 'did you watch the only one you didn't pick?'. Well it was a lazy and chilling Friday night in and Showtime pretty much delivers just what I needed by being quite fun but never once causing you to think or really engage your brain by being original or clever. The plot is basically the standard mismatched buddy stuff and the actual crime story is merely the set up and something that allows the story to have an ending to speak of. As a buddy cop movie it does nothing new at all but still manages to be fun even if it doesn't really have anything approaching big consistent laughs. Many viewers will be annoyed considering what a high profile movie it is that it just trundles along the tired old clichs and jokes but others will find it forgettable and basic fun  I supposed it depends on your mood and you expectations.The cast is maybe part of the reason expectations would be high since both have had some success with the mismatched buddy genre before Midnight Run and to a lesser extent Beverly Hills Cop. De Niro is always watchable but he is very much on autopilot here plying his usual moody self without ever giving an indication that he was doing more than taking money and aiming for an easy popular hit. Murphy also wheels out his usual shtick with subBHC banter and 'that' laugh. Together they manage to have just enough energy and natural screen presence to make a mark despite the tired material but really they have both been much better elsewhere. Russo has nothing to do and is really just a distraction in a role that could have been better served with a less wellknown actress in it. The cameos are mixed and this is best demonstrated by the presence of Mos Def and Wiliam Shatner. Mos Def offered me hope because he is so often the best thing in average films sadly here he was boring and I was surprised he had taken such an uninteresting role. Shatner however is much better and steals the film from the other stars in his scenes as he wonderfully sends himself and TJ Hooker up.Overall this is far from being a great film despite the budget and big name actors involved. It is unoriginal lazy and rather uninspiring however this is not to say that it is not some degree of simple fun to watch  if the genre weren't then they would have stopped kicking them out some time ago. If you approach it in the mindset of looking for basic entertainment with no real expectations on it then you should enjoy it however if you think that it will rise above the pack solely on the basis of being a high profile film then think again and approach with caution.".

The thing to complain about after the unoriginality of the script is the nointerplay between the 2 leads. Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy weren't so good together. De Niro was kind of spoofing his seriousness in other movies. Murphy was watching De Niro more than doing his stuff creatively. They were great in just one scene the frank conversation in the car now I think that this scene was totally something of their improvisation! Another point De Niro was 59 and Murphy was 41. True that the 20 years difference worked well but I think that Murphy's character as young actor who wants desperately to be a star is just younger than him. However Showtime isn't a bad experience at all. Maybe a little disappointing compared to the names of its stars. Its action compensates for the less good rest anyway. And it's only where you got the chance to hear William Shatner says about De Niro This guy is the worst actor I've ever seen !. It's in the best analyzing simple fun to entertain for an hour and a half. Despite its reputation as a flop Budget 85 million. Gross 37 million ! you maybe appreciate it more when you know that this as it is was the best buddyaction or comedy for its year beating movies like Men in Black II I Spy for Murphy and Analyze That for De Niro too.".

De Niro is in no way Murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie. In fact part of the comedy of this film is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with anybody.Murphy really shines in this one. He is back at doing what he does best acting like a complete ham. He is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show. De Niro is perfect as the straight man who thinks the entire thing is stupid. I thought the two of them had great chemistry and were a perfect casting choice. Rene Russo is also great as the TV producer. Of course she loves everything Murphy does and tries so hard along with Murhpy to get DeNiro going too.A lot of reviewers have touched on the hilarious scene with William Shatner reprising his role as TJ Hooker to train Murhpy  De Niro how to act like cops. But my favorite scene involves Murphy in the confessional hoping he could get a Wesly SnipesLike cop to team up with instead of De Niro. Man that was hilarious! Comedies often depend on your personal tastes. Sure you could poke holes in the plot most often you can with a comedy. I was psyched to see the pairing of Murphy and De Niro...I think it brought out the best in Murphy which was nice to see him at the top of his game again. I can only imagine it was a great honor for Murphy to be paired with the great De Niro. Rating 8 of 10 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "As an ex Merchant Seaman I was really interested in this movie  I personally have been involved in a stowaway search on leaving Kingston Jamaica where one person was found. We managed to get him ashore though as we were in territorial limits. On another ship I was on the stowaway was found and we could not land him anywhere due to passportnationality issues. In fact he stayed on for a year as an almost honorary crew member and worked for his keep. Africa is notorious for stowaway pickups. There is a great scene in the beginning of the film when the bulk carrier enters the African port  her size dwarfing all. The crew pop ashore for a little intercourse and inebriation. So far normal. The drama starts when the stowaways enter the vast cavernous holds of the ship. Joss Ackland is brilliant as the Captain with a drink problem being harassed by his Nemesis Suchet right on form as the Companys representative on board. The stowaway search is classic but we did not have guns. I question the use of guns in this film. This ship seemed to have a vast armoury. In my experience guns at sea are severely restricted due to customs regulations. also having a dog on board was odd.Anti Rabies laws especially in Europe restrict carrying of animal severely. Anyway Pertwee is brilliant as the embittered Mate. The horror which follows the discovery of the victims is unbearable  the grim metallic background of the ships holds and a feeling that there is no where to hide adds to the drama.Some of the freighters crew are not into the murder and those who get involved are gradually sucked in to a world of violence from which there is no escape.The chase through the ship especially the engine room scenes are edge on the seat  the feeling of extreme claustrophobia abounds. The feeling of metal pressing in and death being only a gun barrel away. The film is brutal  my girlfriend had to give up watching it during the shooting and beating scenes. While this goes on Suchet in the comfort of his well appointed cabin gets drunk unaware of the mayhem 3 decks below. Its a tense film flawed in parts but the real message is that we can all get sucked into violence like this. Slowly and surely. Think of the train drivers who took Jews to Auschwitz the clerks who worked out those train timetable. I always remember someone who had visited Dachau concentration camp at the end of the war and he said that one of the S.S. Guards had put a birdtable outside the camp crematorium. This film is like that  ordinary people suddenly finding themselves in a world of unstoppable violence!".

	onyx:emotionText "As an ex Merchant Seaman I was really interested in this movie  I personally have been involved in a stowaway search on leaving Kingston Jamaica where one person was found. We managed to get him ashore though as we were in territorial limits. On another ship I was on the stowaway was found and we could not land him anywhere due to passportnationality issues. In fact he stayed on for a year as an almost honorary crew member and worked for his keep. Africa is notorious for stowaway pickups. There is a great scene in the beginning of the film when the bulk carrier enters the African port  her size dwarfing all. The crew pop ashore for a little intercourse and inebriation. So far normal. The drama starts when the stowaways enter the vast cavernous holds of the ship.

For me TVMs usually involve Jane Seymour or Jaclyn Smith as the mother of a sick child who is dying of a difficult to treat disease all done in such a sugary manner that the audience doesnt need tissues it needs insulin . So when DEADLY VOYAGE a made for TV film by the BBC and HBO based on a true story I vaguely remembered from a couple of years previously turned up on the TV schedules I sat down waiting to be bored senseless . I was surprised.No strike that last sentence  I wasnt surprised I was shocked . Here is a TVM that grips you tighter than a great white shark  in fact DEADLY VOYAGE doesnt deserve to be relegated to the TV schedules it should have been made and distributed by a top Hollywood film company  due its absolutely terrifying premise and whats more its  unlike PAPILLON and SLEEPERS  completely true For those who dont know the story !!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS AS TO PLOT !!!!! sometime in the early 90s a bunch of Africans stowed away on an Ukrainian freight ship bound for France in order to work there. Of course it was an attempt at illegal immigration but the crew of the freighter had already been fined for allowing illegal immigrants onto their ship from a previous journey and not wanting to get into anymore trouble with maritime and immigration authorities the crew murder the Africans after discovering them hiding in the hold. All except one African   Kingsley Ofusu  who manages to escape from the firing squad but who must try and survive aboard the ship  but the problem is the crew are hunting him and France is still several days voyage away .Just typing the above paragraph reminds of how good DEADLY VOYAGE is . What a remarkable story  and once again it is  unlike many stories that claim to be  totally true . Its very well written  directed and acted  especially by Sean Pertwee  Why isnt that guy a big name star ?   and most of all its a tense claustrophobic disturbing thriller that I can still remember vividly six years after seeing it for the one and only time . I look forward to seeing again .But youve got to ask yourself how can a TVM be better than most of the Hollywood action blockbusters that came out round about the same time ? Oh hold on  Ive just had a disturbing thought about Jerry Bruickhiemer doing a remake with Tony Scott directing and with Denzil Washington playing Kingsley  Brad Pitt playing Pertwees role  massive artistic licence taken with events etc. Lets keep DEADLY VOYAGE a superlative TVM rather than a poor blockbuster".

Like most movies about racial prejudice and the violence that it can inspire you think about how the reviewers would sanction the portrayals of the villains as  too onedimensional caricatures of stock rednecks or South Afrikaaners which is what I thought they were especially when I saw Joss Ackland Andrew Divoff and Sean Pertwee who have all played similar roles before.The most shocking thing to discover is that this is based on a true story which renders most critiques as moot and irrelevant. Even more amazing is that this took place on a Russian ship. With the history of persecution amongst their own people you would think they'd be the last ones to commit such an atrocity. But no one needs to find an object of persecution more than the persecuted and that certainly doesn't excuse what happened whether it adequately explains it or not.In any case I stuck it out until the end and couldn't have been happier to see that the crew was prosecuted by the French authorities. It is a tale that needs to be seen more widely as a cautionary story that warns us all that prejudice and the virulence it breeds is universal and comes in any language any background no matter where or who you are.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched Deadly Voyage because David Suchet was in it after enjoying him in the Poirot series. And Joss Ackland is always worth watching so I went into the film with an expectation of it being a potentially worthwhile film. Alas it was not to be.I won't bother critiquing the performances the pacing the cinematography or any other structural aspect of the film others here have already given their opinions on those elements. The only thing I want to address is the film's message since it proclaims in the intro that it's based upon a true story and therein hangs the film's supposed importance.Deadly Voyage primarily focuses upon an impoverished black African man named Kingsley who wants to move to the US because he believes that he can make money there. Nothing more nothing less  his motivation is utterly selfish. Of course some people will prevaricate by saying that he was doing it for his family but in fact he decided to have children on the income he could make in Ghana so he really just created his own problem. To that end Kingsley decides to stowaway aboard a Russian freighter bound for New York. In the process of doing this he faces harsh conditions racist crew members and other challenges.But this is precisely where the film leaves me unsympathetic. Why should the audience be expected to care about Kingsley? Simply because he has a goal? Goals aren't such a rare commodity that his should be privileged above say the goal of the ship's captain or the woman he left at home with his newborn child. Kingsley's goal is illegal in the eyes of the US Government. It is also illegal in that it steals from the Russian shipping company. If he makes it to the US it would involve taking out of a system that he has not put into. And if he gets caught the shipping company will be fined 45000. I doubt very much that any of the stowaways care about what their chosen course of action is costing anyone else they're clearly just out for their own gain. He could've spent the 1000 he won in the lottery at the beginning of the film for legal passage to the US and applied for residency and a work permit. Instead he takes the illegal and dangerous route.So since Kingsley's voyage is illegal selfish and cannot be ethically justified why should we care about him or his ordeal? Simply because he faces challenges? Why should his challenges be privileged above the challenge of the Russian shipping company getting to New York without stowaways? Because he's black and the shipping company is white? The reason seems to be because Danny Glover the film's executive producer and others involved want us to root for Kingsley as if he's a hero on some sort of noble voyage. But once you accept that illegal immigration theft and a fool's mission aren't noble at all you can't really care about him.Before anyone plays the race card I assure you that I would've felt the same no matter what ethnicitynationality the involved parties were. Imagine if a British person decided to stowaway in a train headed for Bhutan sneak across the border and collect unwanted Buddhist antiquities to bring back to Britain to sell. How much sympathy could the challenges he faced generate? Very little I'd bet. So why should we feel different for Kingley? Because he's black? Because he's poor by American standards? The filmmakers are banking on us sharing their views that the ends justify the means and that a shipping company being fined 45000 is inconsequential compared to the remote possibility of an unskilled laborer earning slightly more in the US than he could've if he had just stayed in his own home country. I didn't buy it for a minute.".

	schema:reviewBody "While the songs and dance numbers in general aren't as strong as many would have them be the film's storyline and message are still there and ring out loudly above the simple 70sstyle musical numbers. Keeping in mind that this film was made after the Hollywood Musical had nearly died out with few exceptions being rock musicals the audiences that went to see it new didn't appreciate the fact that it was a brave attempt at something that hadn't been done to date.  Audiences that see it today will tend to judge it against the films and musicals of today and perhaps the huge allstar casts of musicals gone past.  But to do that to this film or any for that matter is an injustice to the film itself.There are some good musical moments in the film.  The first is that of Bobby Van.  Mr. Van took his role of Harry Lovett just after closing a 2 year Tony nominated for best actor run of the Broadway revival No No Nanette. He is a songanddanceman from way back and honestly the only one in the cast that was truly talented and experienced for musicals.  He never misses a step in his Question Me An Answer and rightly so ... he was totally at home as Harry.  Other pleasant numbers are done by Olivia Hussey when she welcomes the new visitors and while the lyrics are weak James Shigeta shows his strong voice in the Family song as well as a nicely done staging of the full piece.View the film for what it is ... a fantasy about a place where you never grow old hidden in the ice and snow covered mountains of Tibet found by a group of unsuspecting modernday people wrapped up in the strife of any modern culture.  Take this and compare it to reality and you get a film that falls short of a goal.  But ... take this film for the message of love and peace and tranquility and brotherly love and you get a warm and refreshing message and a positive one at that.To some this film may seem corny to others a welcomed release from the hectic pace of reality.  To the first try to not judge and just enjoy the message.  To the second you have discovered the secret of ShangriLa!".

Unforgettable in its mangy charm and an intro into the glamorous world of second rate showbiz to which I am still magnetized today. As a result I have a special place in my heart for this gloriously awful musical. All I can say was that the opening night crowd fled into the darkness after the last reel flapped off the projector. Some even promised to return and asked what was on next week MAME ...with Lucy I grinned as I locked the door. Somehow the business survived and I even got to showcase AT LONG LAST LOVE the next year. LOST HORIZON was quite successful in Australia and was first released in Sydney as presented in 70mm for 13 weeks.... families liked it and for a while it was considered the sort of Brady Bunch family sort of musical. I just wanted to open my crummy seaside cinema with something nice. So I did and thank Neptune the locals forgave me. I deliciously look forward to the DVD release with the infamous deleted scenes especially the legendary diaper dance with the guys swinging teapots and extended versions of Bobby Van leaping about with Liv Ullman. Am I correct in believing this was Ross Hunter's last production?".

Hard to figure the studios out sometimes. Certainly the roles could have been given to people who could sing better than Peter Finch Liv Ullman George Kennedy and Sally Kellerman but what do you want in a movie good acting or melodious pipes? Song and dance man Bobby Van is great fun Michael York is a suitably tragic villain and seeing Sir John Gielgud decked out as Chang may sound silly but actually works very well on screen.

	schema:reviewBody "I was 19 or 20 years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City Utah and I still remember the new dome theater called the century 21. Layback chairs that rocked and a new sound system large screen and huge open space between the screen and the packed theater. We felt all the excitement of a new preview screening of a film. Ta da da daa da ta da dada dada... I can still hear the opening music ringing trumpet and the crash of cymbals. I loved the interplay of characters and the filmed vistas. I know Peter Finch and Luv and Sally had some trouble with the lipsink but hey this was a feel good go feel better about things film! What I regret is the way they cut the meaningful heart out of it showed the cut version and then called it a flop. I saw the cut version and I can see it lost its view of the vision it had in the preview edition. Yes I wince a bit at Peter's effort to make love through music but you know I didn't see it that way when I left the theater. when they surveyed us as we left I regret any comment I made that may have altered the original. I liked it then and still see it while I listen to the music on my LP. Most of my family has heard me sing much of the sound track and I can use the films monologues in our games of what movie is this. I wish a director's cut on DVD was available. It is available on VHS but its not quite the same. I would particularly like a full serious lord of the rings style commentary about its origins struggles and triumphs. Picky people should leave things well enough alone. Bring it back!!!!".

LOST HORIZON certainly does not fit that last description because while CITIZEN KANE it is not it certainly does not deserve to be trashed.By the time LOST HORIZON came along the movie musical was already considered a dead genre save for the occasional import from Broadway that actually turned out well OLIVER!  CABARET come immediately to mind. However the age of the musical where songs were written especially for the movie had long been buried. That did not matter to producer Ross Hunter who always was a safeguard of Old Hollywood even after the advent of the MPAA allowed for movies to be made of subjects that the studios would not have touched with a tenfoot pole. Hunter may have succeeded in bringing back oldfashioned soap operas with the Douglas Sirk movies but as THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE showed with its original songs that paled in comparison to the classics it stood alongside well almost the musical was perhaps not a genre in need of a revival.You certainly could have fooled Hunter who went fullsteam ahead with his musicalization of a property that should have been left alone to begin with. Casting actors with little to no musical training  badly dubbing them was bad enough but choosing a project that worked best in its original format was double trouble. That is certainly not to fault Burt Bacharach  Hal David's music which is fine enough though certainly not up to par with their Dionne Warwick spectaculars. But you get the idea that maybe even they were doubtful of this project's bankability. Supposedly the film led to the breakup of their previously infallible partnership as well as Hunter's film career he mostly worked for TV afterwards.Apparently Hollywood likes to keep its megaflops very secret because LOST HORIZON has not been seen much since its theatrical debut and has not even made it onto VHS let alone DVD in the U.S. I found my copy courtesy of eBay. But if even Ed Wood's hilariously bad movies can be released  enjoyed by people even for all the wrong reasons then certainly LOST HORIZON can. So I hope that Columbia Pictures can find it in their hearts to bring this movie back into circulation so we can enjoy it even genuinely because it appears some people actually did. Heck if only for the camp value it would be a surefire hit. With CHICAGO  MOULIN ROUGE having indicated the musical is making a comeback then it would be good to have LOST HORIZON out on the market again to educate people in how not to make one. But it sure is hell of a lot of fun along the way.".

And most of all in this film's defense it is appropriate for a family audience at least I remember it being that way when I saw it on Christmas Day a few years ago.  With all the outcry over sex and violence in the cinema these days I find it refreshing to note that this film deserves its Grating.  And they don't say that naughty F word every ten minutes like some films I've seen.  Thank God.  So although this film may not be everyone's cup of tea it does have some redeeming value and I give it ten points out of a possible ten.  That's my story and I'm sticking to it.".

Reflections The World is a Circle and I Might Frighten Her Away being great songs and routines. I recall this movie bombed was panned by fan and critic alike when it came out. At the time the 70's musicals were not a hot topic. Unless you were making a gritty realistic musical like Cabaret you were going against the grain. Dancing and prancing people seemed strange in this time of Easy Rider Midnight Cowboy and grittier films of the era. The movie was mistimed to be sure because there isn't anything more ridiculous in this than any of the great musicals of years past be it prancing knife wielding gang members to store clerks to lions to scare crows.I am sure the great actors known so much more so for drama than a musical threw off the public. Seeing Ullmann Finch Kellerman York and Kennedy especially so often playing the heavy in lighter roles was different. But guess what? They are all great actors and pull it off completely.If you have read any of my reviews you know I review lesser known or disparaged movies that I feel deserve a lot better fate. Why review for the one millionth time Casablanca Spartacus Network or Gone With the Wind? Guess what? They are great and considered so for a very real reason.Lost Horizon on it's own is one of the best musicals made and a great telling of the classic story. The B  W Ronald Coleman version  as good as it is  is flawed due to the lost footage and the scars the film has due to it's repair. This musical version is the best version of Lost Horizon I recommend giving it a try . I guarantee you will be whistling the songs soon after.".

But aside from Van there's no one with experience of musicals. More of that later.The songs are not that memorable aside from the melody which first introduces the fantasy village up in the mountains. The staging of musical numbers by Fred Astaire's associate Hermes Pan aren't that fascinating. However there is still enough here to keep you watching but whether it is from the impulse to watch a real turkey unfolding or from a need to watch the story to the end I'm not sure.I wouldn't really class this as a musical there are too few songs.

Therefore I've never been able to watch it without smirking at the choreographysetsongs etc. Just recently I came across a widescreen DVD and watched it for the first time in years along with a friend who had never heard of the film's reputation. HE really enjoyed it and  after trying to block out all the negative prejudices I obviously had about the film  so did I. There is nothing especially bad about Lost Horizon and it is far more enjoyable and watchable than many other early 1970's movies. It isn't even especially camp. The lyrics to some of the songs are rather repetitive and simplistic but this isn't really apparent when hearing them for the first time or having the flaws pointed out in advance so you are ready to scoff at them. As for all the reviewers who claimed the cast cannot sing in tune this criticism falls apart since Liv Ullmann Olivia Hussey and Peter Finch were dubbed brilliantly too as the vocals match their speaking voices perfectly and Sally Kellerman has a really lovely and totally unique singing style. Vocally Kellerman's duet with Olivia Hussey on The Things I Will Not Miss is excellent. Special mention should be made of the legendary Hollywood star Charles Boyer's brilliant performance as the High Lama  and his comments about mankind destroying itself are chillingly apt to today's fractured world. I wouldn't claim for a second that Lost Horizon is a masterpiece The things I wouldn't miss about it are the uninspired choreography and Bobby Van's Question Me An Answer number which could easily have been cut but if you haven't ever seen Lost Horizon or haven't seen it for some time try watching without that Oh boy let's have a laugh at this pile of junk attitude and you will be surprised at how enjoyable it actually is.".

	schema:reviewBody "Warning there are spoilers sprinkled throughout but I wouldn't worryThere is only one movie I have seen that is worse than this one. Howling New Moon Rising. This film is an utter waste of celluloid. How such a large cast of decent actors could be so totally wasted is incredible. The really amazing thing is that some of the cast still managed to keep their careers going. Michael York is the only cast member who adds any credibility to his role. In his final BIG scene after Olivia Hussey's character ages before his eyes he begins to cry Or he has a severe stomach cramp I haven't decided which and then he runs screaming off a cliff. I'm not sure if it was from the agony over losing the love of his life or if he suddenly realized how far down the crapper this movie was going to send his career and decided to cease the humiliation. George Kennedy plays the same role he does in every movie which is O.K. but he is dragged down by the terrible script. Sally Kellerman shows she has no shame Bobby Van and Olivia Hussey more than likely needed the money and John Geilgud and Liv Ullman look like they'd rather be somewhere else.What really bothers me is that we are supposed to view York's character as the sshole because he wants to leave. Now let's think this over. His character is supposed to cut off all ties to the outside world for what? So he can live for hundreds of years and be forced to listen to Kennedy and Kellerman duet and Bobby Van tapdance and sing? Who could blame him for wanting to leave?The movie starts out with promise It's a fairly strong cast and a fairly good plot. then the filmmakers decided that it needed to be a musical. That alone is terrible but they hired BURT BACHARACH to write the music. THAT is an abomination. Not only do the songs pop up in the least likely of places Well except for Hussey's song during dinner. I can suspend my disbelief for that one But the songs are so swinging 70's that the movie became dated almost before it reached the theaters And it bombed at the box office. It cost 6 million to make and only got 3 million from U.S. Moviegoers and probably 99 of them wanted their money back.Trust me avoid this movie like the plague. It honestly is awful. I just can't believe I wasted two and a half hours of my time watching this when I could have done something constructive like organize my sock drawer.010".

It starts out with the attempts of a peace ambassador to evacuate refugees from an airport which is actually fairly interesting. The attempt fails and the only people to escape are the ambassador two journalists a contractor and a freakin' stand up comic. The plane is hijacked and they crash in the mountains. A furclad rescue party shows up and escorts the survivors back to ShangriLa and that's when the movie slips you a hit of acid. Everyone there sings and breaks into pathetically choreographed dance numbers at the drop of a hat. The music is how should I put this? instantly forgettable  except The World Is a Circle the chorus of which may stick in your brain like a tumor if you aren't careful. Poor Sally Kellerman. She looked miserable whenever she had to sing and terrified when she had to dance. The Twist she did while singing to George Kennedy was truly cringeworthy. I told you the songs were forgettable I've seen this 50 times and still can't remember what she was singing. George Kennedy was spared the indignity of singing or dancing. Lucky him. Liv Ullman seemed just as uncomfortable trying to dance so they let her off the hook by allowing her to sway around awkwardly while trying to keep a serene smile plastered to her face. I think they should have made her dance like Sally  it's no fair for the director to play favorites in a film like this. And Bobby Van! Words cannot describe the prancing about this man does you have to see it to believe it. Maybe I'm giving away too much here no I'm not but I was glad when Michael York died at the end. I was tired of his incessant whining about wanting to go home. Why the fuss? I'd be willing to put up with the singing and the goofy clothes to spend the rest of my life in a place with no traffic pesky jobs or the IRS. Thoroughly misguided and miscast it is a wonderful example of how not to make a musical which is why I love it so. So take some prescription painkillers they'll help! grab a pillow to prevent a laughter hernia and watch this disaster unfold.".

I also enjoy listening to the words of the songs because it makes me think that one day we could live in a place where the sound of guns don't pound in our ears and if we look at our reflection  we should be happy with what we see. This is what I call a feel good film because I feel happy after watching it. Maybe I am still naive but it makes me happy and I'm sure it will make you happy if you watch it with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is  a good family film.

I told him it was going to be a remake of Lost Horizons only as a musical. There was a long pause then he replied Man this movie is gonna suck. Pretty perceptive of him I thought. I had a good time and made a bit of money but even with some interesting personal memories attached to this movie I can't sit through the whole thing. If you ever saw the movie The Swarm you can pretty much get the idea. You get to see a lot of famous and talented people wasted on an an idea that on the face of it is just BAD. The idea seemed to be that if you throw enough money at a movie and hire enough big names then a good story and good writing aren't necessary. Just turn the big crank and out comes the product.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie would have been alright indeed probably excellent if the directors would have left the interviews and the concert footage separate. Into the Void is a great song and I hate how it is cut off at the best part to go to an mumbling interview with Ozzy Osbourne. That should have been at the end of the film or located in a special feature. The best part of concert DVDs is to put them on and let the music play but Black Sabbath The Last Supper is hard to put and and simply let play because the music is continually interrupted. Nevertheless there are a few strengths to this film the concert footage when it does play it excellent. Black Sabbath returns to the stage after a long hiatus without Osbourne and this film captures that well Sabbath basically rocks the fans. The fans of course have a sweet advantage in the film because they are seeing the band live of course but also they do not have to put up with the incessant interviews that the DVD viewers are burdened with. Shame on Jeb Brien and Monica Hardiman the directors for doing this to the film! Also shame on Wyatt Smith for editing the film in such a way.".

He kept jumping up and down. Calling the crowd bastards. His voice was pretty OK for such an old man. I liked the way the crowd reacted when Children of the Grave began. It was terrific. There were quite a few mosh pits forming during that song. Best Regards Pimpin. 810".

Almost every single he put out was a hit.So I was very pleasantly surprised how good a job Gary Busey did at playing him and at imitating his singing voice. He did Buddy proud as were the actors Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith who played Holly's backup group The Crickets.Musicwise there are some of Holly's betterknown songs in the beginning of the film and its really good with a strong finish at the end as Holly and the boys are shown in Iowa in their last concert ever. Busey not only sings like Holly he's a dead ringer for him in the looks department. Some thing was the actor''s best performance ever and you get no argument from me.I'm also glad they ended the film on an upbeat note with that Iowa concert instead of dwelling on his tragic accident. The ending could have been a real downer but they didn't let it be.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink in 1956 Lubbock Texas. As the credits start the camera moves down from the moon to the parking lot into the roller rink past the concessions and across the rink to a small bandstand where a small band is doing their sound check. It's a tracking shot Welles and Scorcese would both appreciate. It cuts to Buddy Holly's bespectacled face peering down in rapt concentration as he grips the headphones and talks to a man putting this band on the radio. A young Gary Busey plays Buddy Holly and his performance is key. He has to somehow show the passion that Holly had for his music to make the film work. This is a rock and roll story without lines of coke chased with shots of heroin and a fifth of whiskey. This isn't about a man with several women to choose between in a sex scandalized brood abandoned lusty tragedy. This is a film about a nice Texas boy who respected his parents and went to church and had the same girlfriend for 5 years and fell in love with rock and roll. Busey finds that spark and ignites it his passion is clear and infectious. He really plays the guitar in the film and sings its not overdubbed with Holly's recordings. Busey was a young guy in Hollywood in the seventies a struggling actor and as much or more so a struggling rock musician as well. Thus he gives a great performance because although he isn't Buddy Holly he's in a similar situation. His first song is the old Les Paul classic Mockingbird Hill and he has the country twang to nail it. Next a kid calls out for some bop and against his two band mates in reality the Crickets were 3 guys but the downsizing works fine for the film's limited narrativehe leads them wailing into Rocking with Ollie Vee. The kids love it and the parents hate it. The DJ at the rolling rink tapes it and it is later released in New York without Buddy Holly even knowing it was ever recorded. This leads to the funniest scene in a film filled with humorous moments. An ampedup disc jockey from Buffalo calls up Buddy at home. The DJ has been playing That'll be the Day for 12 hours and is going for 24. The cops are banging on the station's barricaded door. Holly is confused but when the dust settles he is quite thrilled. He tells the boys and their meteoric rise begins. Dan Stroud as the drummer and Charles Martin Smith as the bassist round out the band nicely and have good chemistry with each other. There are problems but not overblown drama thats found in most rock all? biopics. The movie doesn't manipulate you either. Your emotions soar but they're not manipulated. When the Crickets step onto the Apollo stage in Harlem the first white group ever to play there then rip into an electrically charged performance of Oh Boy and win the audience over my rock and roll loving ass got choked up and cried. Next Busey and the boys make It's so Easy sound funkier and more soulful than I would have believed possible. Anyone with even a cursory knowledge of Buddy Holly's story will know where this movie will end. Holly died in a plane crash with Richie Valens and the Big Bopper way too young. We as the audience know that yet the movie is so well written directed and lovingly acted that we forget it almost immediately. The movie isn't about his death it's about his life and his place in rock and roll history. The film ends with his last performance and it's a good fifteen minutes of Busey rocking out possessed by the ghost of Buddy Holly. I was happy to hear him end it on Not Fade Away my favorite of his songs. The film freezes before the end credits with the information about the plane crash but I hardly noticed it. I was still thinking about how good that last song was.".

It was a fantastic experience.Gary Busey Charles Martin Smith and Don Stroud played the music live all day! As a musician I can appreciate the tireless work and dedication these guys put in to their roles. They must have played those songs 20 times. It's very difficult to maintain consistency and energy under those conditions. This is visible during a cut to a closeup on That'll Be the Day but fortunately the unsuspecting public probably wouldn't have picked it up.Skating around all day getting the day off from school and being transported back in time was a incredible thrill. I also had my first date on film. I had to walk a girl up to the ticket booth. Woo hoo! Even with an outofdate haircut and hot lights melting the vaseline in my hair it was still worth it. Fun stuff.The movie is top notch and is highly satisfying as a whole. Busey delivers his best role ever and the supporting cast is superb. I'm glad to have participated in a great film of the day. To think I could have been in Corvette Summer or something. Not.A funny ironic ending to this is that years later I was in a video store in Malibu looking at the movie the week it was released on video. Gary Busey walked in and stood right next to me. I showed him the cover and babbled on how great he was and how I was an extra and whatnot. Pretty weird but very cool for what it's worth.".

	schema:headline " Great Busey Performance Weak Everything Else";
	schema:reviewBody "When Gary Busey got nominated for an Oscar for his performance in The Buddy Holly Story alongside Robert DeNiro Warren Beatty Laurence Olivier and winner Jon Voight it turned a lot of heads and made people pay more attention when the film came out on video and cable. Seeing it then for the first time years ago I was amazed by Busey's powerful dynamism the way he lives through each moment of the film so authentically. The rest of the film was enjoyable funny perceptive and made me feel like I really understood something about Buddy Holly.Watching it again years later I still think Busey is terrific. But the rest of the film feels like a 1970s TV movie with broad characterizations by the likes of Conrad Janis as a record exec. The Crickets are woefully portrayed or perhaps a better word might be betrayed given this shows them to be racist mediocrities who hold their buddy Buddy down. Even when the history isn't wrong it feels wrong like the scene of the Buffalo DJ who locks himself in his studio and plays That'll Be The Day nonstop until the police break down the door helping launch the band.How'd get that dynamite sound? the actor playing the DJ asks hamming it up.Well there's a guitar drums a standup bass and a cricket Buddy replies meaning an insect got in the middle of the recording session and made some background noise.Wow Buddy Holly and the Crickets! What a super name!There's some truth behind the anecdote a cricket apparently did find its way into the studio and inspired the band's name but it just feels too contrived. Same with Buddy's problems back home in Lubbock Texas where his girl wants him to shape up and go to college. The actress playing the girlfriend is cute and winsome but she pouts like a sitcom actress and says her lines like she's auditioning to play Marsha Brady.But when the camera is on Busey as Holly something takes over. He throws himself into every song with utter abandon losing himself in Buddy's big glasses and pompadoured curls. It's not a noteperfect Buddy but it encapsulates his spirit in a defining way. The only other actor who so dominated a film was George C. Scott in Patton.The fictionalized Crickets only two instead of three Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith are pretty terrific as backing musicians. I especially liked Stroud as Jesse the drummer the way he cracks the skins and hammers the high hats with doorslamming authority. All the numbers are performed live an unusual and brave choice by director Steve Rash that pays off brilliantly capturing the raw vibrancy of straightahead rock 'n' roll.There's a great opening sequence done with a swooping camera shot inside a roller rink to where Buddy and his band play some bop for the kiddies and scandalize the community. Just the way the band switches from the soporific Mockingbird Hill to the thumping Rock Around With Ollie Vee with the audience reacting in comically but believably different ways kids rushing the stage clapping their hands adults rushing the exits clapping their ears is a thrilling capsule commentary on what rock overcame to take over American culture. Also good are the period touches at the rink like the malt bar the roller skates the sad fellow with the combover who plays rinkydink piano until someone taps him on the shoulders in midnote.Also good is the Apollo Theater scene where Buddy and the Crickets become the first white band to play in that Harlem venue getting a hilariously cold reaction when the curtain goes up then winning the crowd over. I sort of doubt it happened like that but there's some funny exchanges with the theater manager and it's nice seeing Stymie from Our Gang in an adult role complete with his trademark derby.Basically any scene where Buddy is performing is good though his final performance at the Winter Dance Party in Clear Lake Iowa by which point he has become a solo act is a little overdone what with the overthetop violins on True Love Ways and Ritchie Valens joining him on stage at the end with maracas.Meanwhile back home the Crickets come over to Buddy's apartment and after talking to Buddy's pregnant wife Maria Elena decide to surprise Buddy at his next tour stop in Moorhead Minnesota. Yeah right. Of course Buddy won't be there he and Ritchie and the Big Bopper having picked the wrong night to fly. All that's left is a freeze frame of Buddy and some sad music over the credits.We only had Buddy for 18 months and this film along with Don McLean's 1972 hit American Pie gave him back to us in a small but tangible way. For that and for Busey's breakout moment it is worth treasuring and there are some nice scenes here and there. But playing with the facts is no way to tell a legend's story especially when it serves sitcomcaliber punch lines. It's a good movie but the real story behind it is better.".

Busey received a well deserved Best Actor Oscar nomination for his tour de force. The film is a docudrama that overstates and overglorifies Holly's contribution to and achievements in the early Rock and Roll era. I guess John Lennon was joking when he said Before Elvis there was nothing because anyone who watched this movie understands that nobody knew what they were doing before Good Ole Buddy emerged on the scene a few years later. And he did it all without a producer or even a band who believed in and supported him! But when you're in the same league as Motzart anything's possible! That's what makes Busey's performance so remarkable he is so convincing and compelling that you actually believe this is who Buddy Holly was. Busey succeeds in creating this charismatic and dynamic performerleader and visionary who never existed to that extent. The final scene is case in point when Holly is bombastically leading Richie Valens and the Big Bopper on stage during the final concert in reality it could have been the 4th coheadliner Dion and Belmonts closing that show and Holly playing drums for them which he had to do often on that tour. But this movie is not about presentation of the hard facts but a celebration of a man and his music which Busey's performance along with all of Holly's best songs easily accomplishes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fate sometimes acts like a bitch it takes one's life at the commencement of a promising career making an immediate legend out of him. You pay the biggest price to become a star who'll never die  This is the fate of legends who can't afford to become old to get civilized to host TV shows or do concerts in Las Vegas or simply remember the good old days  You die early to become immortal. Indeed life is a bitch! The Buddy Holly Story is a movie about one of these legends that prematurely deserted our world but whose style of music never ceased to appeal and influence coming generations  Buddy Holly one of the most influential Rock and Roll pioneers. His career didn't last more than one year and half yet he would change the face of music forever inspiring many generation of singers among them The Beatles and Bob Dylan  he would even inspire one of the most touching and beautiful songs ever Don McLean's famous eulogy about that tragic February day where the Music died  And I started mentioning the tragedy because I'm sure everyone who watches the film has the accident in mind anxiously waiting for it. The apprehension becomes sadness as we're absorbed by the character's charisma his goodhearted nature and enthusiastic attitude. We're sad because we develop an obvious fondness for Buddy Holly this tall nerdy guy whose physical appearance would fit more for an astrophysics student. He's fun and gentle but undeniably talented and perfectly aware of this talent. Buddy has the little something sparkling behind his legendary hornrimmed glasses that outshines the band. And after his buddies left the group I understood why the movie wasn't titled The Buddy Holly and the Crickets Story. HE is the legend.And this is the story of the legend. From his beginning in the ice skating station to his confrontation with the racist Nashville music manager and the New York producer we respect Buddy Holly both the artist who knows his value and the man of principles who means business. This respect is stimulated by his incredible show in the iconic Apollo theater where he handles a skeptical black audience with a nervousness repressed by humor we didn't expect you either before giving a virtuoso performance that would launch his stardom. His whole life is lead by a dedication to his work and an extraordinarily frenetic energy communicated during his concerts while singing That'll be the Day or Rock Around with Ollie Vee. I don't think there was any moment my feet stopped following the rhythm and while watching him swaying his hips and walking on his toes I couldn't help but think that Elvis Presley's status owes something to Buddy's precocious death. And if his life is dedicated to music his heart is for Maria Elena. The film is not just a chronicle on Rock and Roll music or a 50's time capsule it's about a man whose convictions don't only affect his approach to music but to love too. The Buddy Holly Story is a poignant love story with a nice little humorous touch as in the scene where Buddy asks Maria's aunt if he can date her niece. Maria will inspire Buddy Holly's famous love songs including True Love Ways Words of Love becoming the heart of his music before being forever known as the widowed bride. A sad destiny for a woman we wish she could have prevented Buddy from going on this doomed winter part tour if she wasn't pregnant. Ironically Buddy's commitment indirectly killed him while he could have become an established and sedentary artist comfortably seated in a TV driven stardom. In a flash of realization Buddy understood that his life was on stage.And all our admiration to Buddy relies on Gary Busey's extraordinary performance. I never thought the man I remembered as Mr. Joshua from Lethal Weapon and countless forgettable villainous roles could blow me away like he did. But after watching Steve Rash's film my respect for Busey increased so did my sorrow to learn that his career may have been more successful if it wasn't for an accident the actor had in the 80's. When you pull such an authentic performance I'm sure you can handle anything. A very well deserved Oscar nomination for a performance harder than Jamie Foxx in Ray because there are many mimics speech mannerisms or attitudes immediately indicative of Ray Charles while Busey had to resurrect Buddy giving him an unknown aura a personality likable and complex and last but not least he did the whole singing and dancing. It's a perfect example of a great performance carrying a whole film with a solid supporting cast. Though I wish the movie gave more screen time to Ritchie Valens who deserved like the Big Bopper more than two seconds of him dancing with the maracas in the climactic singing scene.And what a climax what a thrilling moment that conveys so many opposite feelings a joyful and exhilarating sensation of freedom and an anticipated sadness because we know these guys are living the last moments of their life. I was waiting for the scene in the plane but unconsciously I didn't want to see it as it would have ended the movie in an extreme negative mood. So I was surprisingly satisfied with the ending of the film. Buddy shouts See you next year the image freezes and  the rest is Rock and Roll. An abrupt ending indeed but conveying extremely well the brutality and the shock that was Buddy Holly and his companions' death.I kept staring at the image a long time contemplating that face that revolutionized music and incarnated an era of insouciance  my eyes were meditating and my heart was crying as if something really touched me deep inside ".

His career didn't last more than one year and half yet he would change the face of music forever inspiring many generation of singers among them The Beatles and Bob Dylan  he would even inspire one of the most touching and beautiful songs ever Don McLean's famous eulogy about that tragic February day where the Music died  And I started mentioning the tragedy because I'm sure everyone who watches the film has the accident in mind anxiously waiting for it. The apprehension becomes sadness as we're absorbed by the character's charisma his goodhearted nature and enthusiastic attitude. We're sad because we develop an obvious fondness for Buddy Holly this tall nerdy guy whose physical appearance would fit more for an astrophysics student. He's fun and gentle but undeniably talented and perfectly aware of this talent. Buddy has the little something sparkling behind his legendary hornrimmed glasses that outshines the band. And after his buddies left the group I understood why the movie wasn't titled The Buddy Holly and the Crickets Story. HE is the legend.And this is the story of the legend. From his beginning in the ice skating station to his confrontation with the racist Nashville music manager and the New York producer we respect Buddy Holly both the artist who knows his value and the man of principles who means business. This respect is stimulated by his incredible show in the iconic Apollo theater where he handles a skeptical black audience with a nervousness repressed by humor we didn't expect you either before giving a virtuoso performance that would launch his stardom. His whole life is lead by a dedication to his work and an extraordinarily frenetic energy communicated during his concerts while singing That'll be the Day or Rock Around with Ollie Vee. I don't think there was any moment my feet stopped following the rhythm and while watching him swaying his hips and walking on his toes I couldn't help but think that Elvis Presley's status owes something to Buddy's precocious death. And if his life is dedicated to music his heart is for Maria Elena. The film is not just a chronicle on Rock and Roll music or a 50's time capsule it's about a man whose convictions don't only affect his approach to music but to love too. The Buddy Holly Story is a poignant love story with a nice little humorous touch as in the scene where Buddy asks Maria's aunt if he can date her niece. Maria will inspire Buddy Holly's famous love songs including True Love Ways Words of Love becoming the heart of his music before being forever known as the widowed bride. A sad destiny for a woman we wish she could have prevented Buddy from going on this doomed winter part tour if she wasn't pregnant. Ironically Buddy's commitment indirectly killed him while he could have become an established and sedentary artist comfortably seated in a TV driven stardom. In a flash of realization Buddy understood that his life was on stage.And all our admiration to Buddy relies on Gary Busey's extraordinary performance. I never thought the man I remembered as Mr. Joshua from Lethal Weapon and countless forgettable villainous roles could blow me away like he did. But after watching Steve Rash's film my respect for Busey increased so did my sorrow to learn that his career may have been more successful if it wasn't for an accident the actor had in the 80's. When you pull such an authentic performance I'm sure you can handle anything. A very well deserved Oscar nomination for a performance harder than Jamie Foxx in Ray because there are many mimics speech mannerisms or attitudes immediately indicative of Ray Charles while Busey had to resurrect Buddy giving him an unknown aura a personality likable and complex and last but not least he did the whole singing and dancing. It's a perfect example of a great performance carrying a whole film with a solid supporting cast. Though I wish the movie gave more screen time to Ritchie Valens who deserved like the Big Bopper more than two seconds of him dancing with the maracas in the climactic singing scene.And what a climax what a thrilling moment that conveys so many opposite feelings a joyful and exhilarating sensation of freedom and an anticipated sadness because we know these guys are living the last moments of their life. I was waiting for the scene in the plane but unconsciously I didn't want to see it as it would have ended the movie in an extreme negative mood. So I was surprisingly satisfied with the ending of the film. Buddy shouts See you next year the image freezes and  the rest is Rock and Roll. An abrupt ending indeed but conveying extremely well the brutality and the shock that was Buddy Holly and his companions' death.I kept staring at the image a long time contemplating that face that revolutionized music and incarnated an era of insouciance  my eyes were meditating and my heart was crying as if something really touched me deep inside ";

Both formats have an underlying form of fiction and are never a true reflection of reality as producers seek to reconstruct and narrate stories in their perspectives. As both formats usually leaves some issues undiscussed due to 'complexities of subplots' and screen time it denies viewers the opportunity to open up debates and to further investigate and construct the real truth. Adding to the viewer's inability to evaluate sources eg comparisons with written history and the logics behind arguments history may be open to distortion through narrative and documentary.To most people documentary may be seen more truthful as it usually involves actual participants' testimonies and reallife footages. However these visuals are selected and edited to be arranged in a way that allows producers to present their version of realism to the viewers. In The Real Buddy Holly Story Paul McCartney seeks to establish the Buddy Holly as remembered by family and friends and how Buddy had influence the rest of the music world. The testimonies may have been distorted as memories may not be accurate and emotions have evolved to make a legend out of Buddy. The documentary did make corrections to the film version and cover other events such as there were 3 members of Crickets and that Buddy's music was actually heard outside of USA at that time he had to embark on a world tour!. However it did not go into deep discussion about what happened to Buddy's wife after his death. Criticism andor negative discussions may have been left out of the documentary as the producers seek to present a Buddy that the world should have remembered. Eventually we don't manage to construct the whole truth as we only restrict ourselves to the past 'realties' that the documentary tells us.Personally I prefer a narrative film because it provides rich visual imageries which helps us to reconnect with the collective memory of that era. It gives the audiences a more constructive structure of the story and this leads to better memory retention for the audiences when they retell the story. There is also an element of flexibility which allows filmmakers to express their thoughts and views on certain issues. In The Buddy Holly Story racial issues were highlighted and viewers can certainly relate to these issues with respect to current situations.Moviegoers consistently seek to revisit certain emotions when watching a film and using these emotions audiences can choose to make personal connections with the applied meanings that a filmmaker wants to deliver. In most stories people are more likely to selectively remember the struggles the inspirations and the way the story ends. Through The Buddy Holly Story we do remember the struggles Buddy and the Crickets had how Maria had been a source of encouragement and that Buddy Holly was a great performer until the day he dies.".

There were other contemporary master guitar rockers of equal caliber such as Chuck Berry Carl Perkins and Eddie Cochran but Buddy's talent is often overlooked.As noted by others Busey is the driving force behind the success of The Buddy Holly Story. Not only does the script play with the facts of Buddy's life but it even interjects several anachronisms for the two years of Buddy's popularity basically 19571959. One that comes to mind is the scene where Buddy and Maria are watching a 3D movie. Buddy is disenchanted with it all and tells Maria that it'll never last. It's just a fad. In reality there were no 3D movies in circulation at the time. The heyday for 3D was in the early 1950's. By 1955 the fad had already faded. Yet another example where just a little research would have sufficed to make the story more believable.At times it is difficult to separate what really happened from urban legends surrounding Buddy's career. The story about how the Crickets got their name may or may not be apocryphal but it certainly did not take place the way it is presented in the movie. Another problem with the film is how Buddy's parents are depicted. Certainly Buddy's parents were supportive of his musical career. Maybe Baby is credited to Buddy's mother and she did have input into the writing of the song.It's good that Buddy's biggest hits were used in the movie but I miss hearing one of my favorites I'm Looking For Someone to Love. I'm proud that as a result of this movie Buddy's music was reissued for a new generation to hear. His legacy is one of the very best from the early days of rock 'n' roll. Rave on Buddy rave on.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was a teenager when Buddy Holly became popular leading the charge into Rock 'N Roll. But I don't remember much about him because I had not yet gotten into that type of music. I was mostly listening to Ray Charles Bobby Vinton and Dion.What I especially liked about this movie is that Gary Busey who played Buddy Holly did his own singing. In fact what we see are the live recordings during filming. I don't recall how Buddy Holly really sounded but I suspect Busey did a pretty good imitation.SPOILERS. The story is pretty well known. Holly and his friends the Crickets began making music in their garage in Lubbock Texas. A tape gets into the hands of a NYC record executive and he presses a 45 rpm disk that immediately becomes a hit. Holley only signs a contract if he is given full control to produce his own records. He gets taken with the pretty secretary Maria Elena from Puerto Rico and marries her. Forced to go on tour during the winter to promote his records their bus breaks down and the next day must charter a private plane. It crashed Buddy Holly died along with the Big Bopper and Richie Valens. Being a low budget movie we don't see anything of the crash or the wreckage the music and image of Holly just stops during a stage performance and we read what happened. I think that is even a better way to end it.".

I was mostly listening to Ray Charles Bobby Vinton and Dion.What I especially liked about this movie is that Gary Busey who played Buddy Holly did his own singing. In fact what we see are the live recordings during filming. I don't recall how Buddy Holly really sounded but I suspect Busey did a pretty good imitation.SPOILERS. The story is pretty well known. Holly and his friends the Crickets began making music in their garage in Lubbock Texas. A tape gets into the hands of a NYC record executive and he presses a 45 rpm disk that immediately becomes a hit. Holley only signs a contract if he is given full control to produce his own records. He gets taken with the pretty secretary Maria Elena from Puerto Rico and marries her. Forced to go on tour during the winter to promote his records their bus breaks down and the next day must charter a private plane. It crashed Buddy Holly died along with the Big Bopper and Richie Valens. Being a low budget movie we don't see anything of the crash or the wreckage the music and image of Holly just stops during a stage performance and we read what happened. I think that is even a better way to end it.";

I bet that Buddy HollyBusey was a much better musician than most of what I heard. Since he lived in Lubbock Texas it was only a quiet country town back then. His parents were Christians though his mother was a strong supporter of her son's work. That's one of the reasons he didn't act like Elvis. He stuck to his kinder ways. That really makes him good! When he went to Tennessee he saw how bad the producers were. They hated rocknroll that turned Holly off big time. Getting used to the different atmosphere was a challenge to Holly and his friends. He got to tour with Sam Cooke went to the famous Apollo which the allAfroAmerican audience quickly accepted them I liked that! And Sam Cooke made sure Holly and his band got some service. That's what I call tolerance. It's sad that he Ritchie Valens and J.P. The Big Bopper Richardson had their music careers cut short by a plane crash in 1959 at least their memories will live on in our hearts. I don't what inaccuracies were in the movie all I care is that Buddy Holly overcame the obstacles of music and politics in that time and the music is nearlyperfect. For Gary Busey he was perfect in the role and making the music as well. GOD BLESS YOU GARY BUSEY! 5 STARS!".

The movie shows both small town American life Lubbuck TX and Iowa as well as New York City life. It was surprising to see NYC play such a pivotal role in Buddy Holly's brief life and career.Of course there are things I about Buddy Holly and the Crickets I would like to explore further to see about their accuracy.

In the final and best scene we are introduced to the Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens on that fateful night. These are again flawless performances and that night could be a movie in of itself. The most brilliant aspect of the film is the brave decision to not show the plane crash nor the aftermath. It may have been too much to bare. Instead we are treated to a 10minute performance of Buddy Holly bringing life to Iowa in middle of winter. By focusing on the haunting and brilliant final performance the storyteller reminds us of the fragility of life instead of the tragedy of the day music died.".

	schema:reviewBody "Emanuele Crialese did a fantastic job with one of those films that linger in the back of your mind for years. It was Respiro see comments and synopsis here in IMDb.Now carrying the magnificent young talents he had for the first time on screen then he takes the audience into a dark void. A literal plunge into dangerous waters. The subject is migration. In this case from Italy to the New World the name of the film. A big deal calling it for its American release The Golden Door.The story of a family that leaves everything and risks the rest that is their lives for a dream.I hate to spoil the show telling the story so I'll dwell a bit in the work Crialese and all his team did so brilliantly.First of all choosing to stick to what he knows direct sound as much as possible. This means the whole film. The textures the pain the nuances of reality are always mingled with the smells the heat or the cold the sweat and the blood life and death as vibrantly as it is in real life.The squeaks of bent metal and grinding wood the infamous drone of the wind and the ominous sounds of big engines and ship horns are among the points that make this film so involving.Cinematography is in the hands of a French couturier. The symbolism of light is present from the very first shot again almost the very first shot from Respiro and pervades throughout the film with intimacy and a terrible sense of desperation. The subdued tones and the very gray and grim depictions of people suffering the cramped and filthy boat they sail to hope is mesmerising.Light is used sparsely almost to discover every character in the dark. The beauty of every shot and every scene is accentuated by the period costumes and the perfectly selected physical features of the actors.Again as he usually does Vincenzo Amato is definitely on his own. He plays the father of two sons the same actors who were fifteen and twelve and now are nineteen and sixteen with all the power he always conveys to his very complex characters.Charlotte Gainsbourg is soso. I guess she's never achieved again the perfection she reached in The Cement Garden and in her very first film L'Effronte.Maybe it's just that she seems a bit awkward in her role.The locations and sets are harsh and compelling almost playing a character on their own.Maybe the most remarkable character is the one played by Filippo Pucillo the mute younger son. The contrast here with his first role is complete. Then he played a supercharged kid that was as relentless as anything around him. Now his character is all expression. And just that no words at all. His eyes tell the whole story with sublime power.Maybe this is one of those films that will not be very well received in the States. It's absolutely Italian in everything. It's so Italian that most of the time the language is one of the many dialects that is much older than Italian itself. In the USA this film may be a bit too much for Americans because of the subject. But anyone who remembers the story of their families when they arrived in the States will see this films with awe.And again the minimalism that goes hand in hand with Crialese's ideas is back with a closing scene in the water. Only this time it goes from underwater photography to aerial.All in all another great and very well told story from this filmmaker that only this year 2006 has collected 6 prizes and was nominated for the Golden Lion. Not a small deed!".

	onyx:emotionText "Emanuele Crialese did a fantastic job with one of those films that linger in the back of your mind for years. It was Respiro see comments and synopsis here in IMDb.Now carrying the magnificent young talents he had for the first time on screen then he takes the audience into a dark void. A literal plunge into dangerous waters. The subject is migration. In this case from Italy to the New World the name of the film. A big deal calling it for its American release The Golden Door.The story of a family that leaves everything and risks the rest that is their lives for a dream.I hate to spoil the show telling the story so I'll dwell a bit in the work Crialese and all his team did so brilliantly.First of all choosing to stick to what he knows direct sound as much as possible. This means the whole film. The textures the pain the nuances of reality are always mingled with the smells the heat or the cold the sweat and the blood life and death as vibrantly as it is in real life.The squeaks of bent metal and grinding wood the infamous drone of the wind and the ominous sounds of big engines and ship horns are among the points that make this film so involving.Cinematography is in the hands of a French couturier. The symbolism of light is present from the very first shot again almost the very first shot from Respiro and pervades throughout the film with intimacy and a terrible sense of desperation. The subdued tones and the very gray and grim depictions of people suffering the cramped and filthy boat they sail to hope is mesmerising.Light is used sparsely almost to discover every character in the dark. The beauty of every shot and every scene is accentuated by the period costumes and the perfectly selected physical features of the actors.Again as he usually does Vincenzo Amato is definitely on his own.

It is a surreal enigmatic often strange but ultimately deeply rewarding experience. Interweaving dreamlike and symbolic imagery with gritty realism the latest film by Emanuele Crialese Respiro is like an impressionistic painting  a cinematic artist's rendering of what the immigration process may have been like for our parents and grandparents. Crialese's magical mystery tour came about as a result of his visit to the museum on Ellis Island the looks on the faces of the immigrants depicted in photographs he saw and his research into the harsh policies and procedures used during the admission of immigrants.Guided by letters he read of immigrants sent to relatives who remained at home Crialese identifies with those impoverished immigrants who were able to see the positive side of things beyond their ordeal. To Salvatore Mancuso Vincenzo Amato and his older son Angelo Francesco Casisa America is a distant dream that they know nothing about. After climbing a rocky mountain to pray to the saints for a sign they are rewarded when they are shown post cards by Salvatore's younger son Pietro Filippo Pucillo a deaf mute that depict the new world as a land where they can bathe in rivers of milk sit under a money tree or harvest giant onions and carrots.After disposing of their animals in exchange for shoes and suits Salvatore his two sons and his elderly mother Fortunata Aurora Quattrocchi set out on their adventure with more hope than trepidation but the equation soon shifts the other way. As they board the boat and settle into their crowded thirdclass steerage compartments the mosttalked about scene in the film takes place.

	schema:reviewBody "THE GOLDEN DOOR NUOVOMONDO is for this viewer the finest film of the year to date. It is a masterpiece of concept writing directing acting and cinematography. More importantly this radiantly beautiful film is a much needed reflective mirror for us to view the history of immigration of 'foreigners' into America at a time when the very mention of the word 'borders' is a political fuse. Writerdirector Emanuele Crialese has given us not only a deeply moving story he has also provided a touchstone for viewers to revisit the history of each of our origins with the exception of the Native Americans we all entered America as 'foreigners' at some point in our histories and it is humbling to view this film with that fact in mind.The film opens in turn of the century Sicily as poverty stricken widower Salvatore Mancuso Vincenzo Amato and his brother Angelo Francesco Casisa climb a rocky hill to present their tokens to the cross to ask for a sign as to whether they should continue to struggle for existence on the island or go to America the land of dreams. Mancuso's deaf mute son Pietro Filippo Pucillo runs to the top of the hill with postcards he has found with images of America money growing on trees fruits and vegetables larger than people etc and Salvatore accepts this as the sign that he should move his family to America. After convincing his reluctant mother Fortunata Aurora Quattrocchi and his sisters Rita Federica De Cola and Rosa Isabella Ragonese to make the trip he sells his only possessions two donkeys goats and rabbits and the man with the boat arranges their trip giving the family shoes appropriate clothing and instructions to board an ocean liner as third class passengers. As the Mancuso family prepares to board they are asked for a photograph and as they pose behind a painted set an Englishwoman LucyLuce Charlotte Gainsbourg walks into the photo as though she were part of this peasant family. Lucy cannot board the boat for America without male escort.The voyage begins and Luce in her gentle way identifies with the Mancuso family finally solidifying her safe passage by proposing to Salvatore to marry her 'for convenience not for love' when they arrive in America. Through a violent storm and living conditions that are appalling poor the multitude of third class passengers survive bond and eventually arrive at Ellis Island believing their dream of America has been fulfilled. But everyone must pass harsh physical tests delousing and even intelligence testing to determine if they can enter America the officials let them know that America does not want genetically inferior people entering the new world! Each woman must be selected by a man to marry on Ellis Island before they are allowed admission. The manner in which the Mancuso family remains united until a somewhat surprising ending is the closing of the tale.Few of us understand the strict rules and harsh treatment immigrants face or at least faced at the turn of the century on Ellis Island and if we do we have elected to submerge that information. THE GOLDEN DOOR presents the case for immigrants' struggles in a manner that not only touches our hearts but also challenges our acceptance of current immigration legislation. But all political issues aside THE GOLDEN DOOR is first and foremost a film of enormous beauty exquisite photography deeply felt performances by a huge cast and a very sensitively written and directed story. The is a film that deserves wide distribution a movie that is a must see for everyone. Highly recommended. Grady Harp".

This film is differentand I think betterthan most movies about impoverished people who leave Europe and come to the United States.The film begins with scenes in a poor rural region of Sicily. We always hear that Sicily is a rocky island but you won't really understand the implications of that phrase until you see the first halfhour of The Golden Door. The middle section of the film is devoted to the long voyage to the U.S. Most immigration films show us ten minutes of people in the thirdclass section becoming seasick and then show us the Statue of Liberty. Not this moviewe get a sense for life below decks and it isn't charming. We never actually see the Statue of Liberty either. Finally the typical movie will give us another ten minutes of Ellis Island and then the immigrants are walking through New York's Lower East Side. Not herethe Ellis Island experience occupies about onethird of the footage. Vincenzo Amato is outstanding as Salvatore Mancuso who is bringing his two sons and his mother to the new world. Charlotte Gainsbourg is equally good as Lucy Reed a mysterious Englishwoman who also speaks fluent Italian.There are some strange touches in the movie especially the sound track with songs by Nina Simone. There must be some symbolism there but I couldn't make sense of it.Another reviewer has already pointed out that this film will do better viewed in a theater rather than on DVD. Still large screen or small screen it's worth seeking out.".

	schema:headline " Masterful direction of impressionistic look at emigration by Crialese";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is an impressionistic poetic take on the immigrant experience a reflective look at the turmoil and fear which might be associated with emigrating. These are aspects not often considered in movies about emigration to America in particular and to to any country more generally and the film vividly and convincingly depicts the nervousness and enthusiasm if ignorance that poor illiterate Sicilian immigrants have in anticipation of their emigration to the United States. They have some fantastic unrealistic notions about the United States which are disseminated on the trip over. One is that the rivers run with milk an image which is depicted in the movie to poetic impressionistic effect. The film is devoid of sound and the silence seems to reflect the uneasiness of the ignorance the locals have about life in America or if not ignorance of it a vision significantly colored with superstition and fantasy. That said the movie depicts with jolting realism the boat ride to the United States and the intake process which arrivals at Ellis Island had to undergo. The boat ride is imagined as rather dull which surely it was much of the time. The quarters in which the incoming residents sleep is depicted as extremely crowded with beds spaced four or five inches from one another and lacking much light which it was surely the case below deck. Again the film is not supplemented with undue music or excessively bright lighting and the effect is to create a fairly realistic imagining of what it was truly like for people emigrating to the United States. The villagers may not be worldly but they are quite reasonable and the interaction with the eldest of the emigrants Fortunata Aurora Quattrocchi with the immigration officer who insists on particular results are quite bittersweet inasmuch as they are not diluted or softened for the benefit of a syrupy conclusion and one sees the melding of the realism of Sicily with the extensive regulations which guide life in the United States.The immigrants and their story are very interesting and the combination of coldeyed realism and the magical fantasy of peoples' imaginations make for a persuasive vision of the beliefs held by Sicilians or any people with little formal education moving to the United States. The acting is similarly barebones it is not at all demonstrative or showy but seems the more realistic for it. That said all the main performers in particular Salvatore Mancuso Vincenzo Amato the clear leader of the group is excellent. While never smiling his character's actions speak much louder and it is clear that thankfully the other members of the group his two sons and the above mentioned elder Fortunata the boys' grandmother have faith in his leadership abilities and respect his clear leadership. Amato imbues his character with great decency and forthrightness and it is a testament to his abilities that his character appears so capable and confident while his character betrays very little emotion. One oddness of the film is a chance encounter with a mysterious Englishwoman the excellent and fittingly mysterious Charlotte Gainsbourg who speaks Italian and during the entire film we wonder why she is going to the United States or what connection she has to the otherwise unanimously Sicilian emigrant group. At the end this is finally revealed and the revelation is done typically realistically and does not seem particularly melodramatic or showy. The film is directed by Emmanuel Crialese who has a firm grasp on the realistic if sometimes superstitious world view his characters inhabit and presents it competently and confidently. It is in fact fantastically confident given how awkwardly the realism and superstition might have combined in the film. It is a worthy examination of the immigrant experience.".

	schema:headline " Nativity!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is Christmas time! A nativity in terms of rebirth or at least this is what can be hoped regarding the Italian cinema. It was something like 3040 years that the Italian cinema didn't craft an art piece of this size. This is an absolute contemporary film that can be also regarded at the same level of quality as the Italian masterpieces of the past needless to quote any name. And finally this is also a big production for Italian standards of the time. In this movie there is a rare balance of different elements all of them understandable and enjoyable at different levels of fruition. Real poetry real humor real tenderness real drama real beauty. No rhetoric no easy surreal shortcuts no typical touristic Tornatorelike picturing no over acting no director autoreferentialism. There is also a cool use of two heartbreaking Nina Simone's songs whose music I reckon has never been used in a proper way for a score. So if this will not be a real reviveing for the Italian cinema it is an extraordinary evolution for Emanuele Crialese after his 'Respiro' another definitive beautiful film. 'Nuovomondo' is not to be missed it is that kind of 'medicine film' helpful to enjoy moviemaking movie watching helpful to enjoy and understand life. Francesco Cabras".

	onyx:emotionText "This is Christmas time! A nativity in terms of rebirth or at least this is what can be hoped regarding the Italian cinema. It was something like 3040 years that the Italian cinema didn't craft an art piece of this size. This is an absolute contemporary film that can be also regarded at the same level of quality as the Italian masterpieces of the past needless to quote any name. And finally this is also a big production for Italian standards of the time. In this movie there is a rare balance of different elements all of them understandable and enjoyable at different levels of fruition. Real poetry real humor real tenderness real drama real beauty. No rhetoric no easy surreal shortcuts no typical touristic Tornatorelike picturing no over acting no director autoreferentialism. There is also a cool use of two heartbreaking Nina Simone's songs whose music I reckon has never been used in a proper way for a score.

	schema:reviewBody "So now I have a very good idea what my immigrant grandparents went through traveling by boat from Italy and through Ellis Island aka Golden Door in the early part of the twentieth century. Emanuel Crialese's Golden Door amply describes the primitive living circumstances that motivate these adventurers to leave home the cramped weeks aboard a steamer and the indignities. In fact the director is so precise that most of the tale lumbers through the details of living and then processing at the island to the detriment of engaging story telling.The only relief from the boredom like the voyage is the occasional Fellinilike impressionism One prominently has characters swimming in milk as in the land of milk and honey more than once. It could be argued that the director doesn't prepare the audience for the abrupt transitions into the formalist episodes but I felt relief with them.By contrast Mira Nair's recent Namesake is superior in telling an interesting story about identity and the new world and Chaplin's Immigrant 1917 makes the boat ride a model of slapstick and the restaurant scene not only humorous but telling about the challenges immigrants inevitably face. Nobody ever said Chaplin was boring.Charlotte Gainsbourg stands out as Lucy a husbandseeking Brit whose literate background makes her useful and whose role as a strong beautiful woman allows the film to explore the prejudices against women. She is unforgettable when she and other women sit in a room awaiting the magistrate's permission to marry a man often the woman is meeting for the first time. That a woman would need a man to qualify for entry into America may not be so anachronistic given Hilary needing Bill to make her political career in the twenty first century.Agnes Godard's cinematography is often the salvation of a scene for instance when she catches two mountain climbers with rocks in their mouths deftly negotiating a rockstrewn hill top to arrive at a shrine. Mostly she photographs the climbers close up to keep the adventurous sense of surprise. Then she reduces them to just more rubble as she pulls back into a major bird's eye view losing them slowly just as their journey across the Atlantic will reduce them again.It's a slow journey.".

	schema:headline " New World vs. Old World";
	schema:reviewBody "The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family's journey from the Old World Italy to the New World America. Salvatore a middleaged man who hopes for a more fruitful life persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in Sicily take the arduous journey across the raging seas and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk. In short they believe that by risking everything for the New World their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The imagery of the New World is optimistic clever and highly imaginative. Silver coins rain from heaven upon Salvatore as he anticipates how prosperous he'll be in the New World carrots and onions twice the size of human beings are shown being harvested to suggest wealth and health and rivers of milk are swam in and flow through the minds of those who anticipate what the New World will yield. All of this imagery is surrealistically interwoven with the characters and helps nicely compliment the gritty realism that the story unfolds to the audience. The contrast between this imagery versus the dark reality of the Sicilian people helps provide hope while they're aboard the ship to the New World.The voyage to the New World is shot almost in complete darkness especially when the seas tempests roar and nearly kill the people within. The dark reality I referred to is the Old World and the journey itself to the New World. The Old World is depicted as somewhat destitute and primitive. This is shown as Salvatore scrambles together to sell what few possessions he has left donkeys goats and rabbits in order to obtain the appropriate clothing he needs to enter the New World. I thought it was rather interesting that these people believed they had to conform to a certain dress code in order to be accepted in the New World it was almost suggesting that people had to fit a particular stereotype or mold in order to be recognized as morally fit. The most powerful image in the film was when the ship is leaving their homeland and setting sail for the New World. This shot shows an overhead view of a crowd of people who slowly seem to separate from one another depicting the separation between the Old and New Worlds. This shot also suggested that the people were being torn away from all that was once familiar wanted to divorce from their previous dark living conditions and were desirous to enter a world that held more promise.As later contrasted to how the New World visually looks the Old World seems dark and bleak as compared to the bright yet foggy New World. I thought it was particularly interesting that the Statue of Liberty is never shown through the fog at Ellis Island but is remained hidden. I think this was an intentional directing choice that seemed to negate the purpose of what the Statue of Liberty stands for Give me your poor your tired your hungry seemed like a joke in regards to what these people had to go through when arriving at the New World. Once they arrived in the Americas they had to go through rather humiliating tests i.e. delousing mathematics puzzles etc. in order to prove themselves as fit for the New World. These tests completely changed the perspectives of the Sicilian people. In particular Salvatore's mother had the most difficult time subjecting herself to the rules and laws of the New World feeling more violated than treated with respect. Where their dreams once provided hope and optimism for what the New World would provide the reality of what the New World required was disparaging and rude. Salvatore doesn't change much other than his attitude towards what he felt the New World would be like versus what the New World actually was seemed disappointing to him. This attitude was shared by mostly everyone who voyaged with him. Their character arcs deal more with a cherished dream being greatly upset and a dark reality that had to be accepted.The film seems to make a strong commentary on preparing oneself to enter a heavenly and civilized society. Cleanliness marriage and intelligence are prerequisites. Adhering to these rules is to prevent disease immoral behavior and stupidity from dominating. Perhaps this is a commentary on how America has learned from the failings of other nations and so was purposefully established to secure that these plagues did not infest and destruct. Though the rules seemed rigid they were there to protect and help the people flourish.".

I would guess that these laws were more strict on those who came from the Mediterranean and Africa. Immigrants had to be free from contagious diseases or hereditary infirmities. In the film we see physical and mental exams the latter because of the view that low intelligence is heritable. Single women could not enter the country on the presumption that they would become prostitutes so most married single men already in the country as arranged beforehand at Ellis Island before entry.This is the story of a British immigrant Charlotte Gainsbourg who arranges to marry a poor Sicilian Vincenzo Amato. He is trying to get his family through with a son that is mute and a mother Aurora Quattrocchi that is considered feebleminded. She was fantastic in the role by the way.You will also see character actor Vincent Schiavelli in his next to the last appearance. I don't know if his last film has been released.

	schema:reviewBody "Although there are some beautiful cinematographic moments witty scripts morally benign intention and promising acting here and there in the film I regret to say that the film is not good enough to win a Silver Lion but I have to admit that I haven't seen all films in the competition.I was impressed by the initial and the ending scenes. In the beginning the magnificent mountain in Sicily shows how tough it is to live there in the end the milk river shows how difficult it is for the Italian immigrants to struggle in a murky stream full of uncertainties. Another brilliant scene is when the boat was leaving the harbor splitting the crowds on the land and on the boat into two with the rhythmic noise of the boat engine in the background.Apart from these wellframed visual presentations the film also shows some witty conversations from the Mancuso family e.g. the dad's hack on the blocks IQ examination and strong acting from Vincenzo Amato as Salvatore Mancuso and Aurora Quattrocchi as Fortunata Mancuso.The director however did not handle the time on the boat well. The nebulous feeling between the Mancuso family and Lucy Reed did not sweeten up the unpleasant experience of immigrants on the boat. Instead it spoils and endures the difficult time on the boat. Or perhaps even worse the existence of Lucy Reed is not necessary at all. This character weakens the whole plot making everything alienated and inconsistent.Despite the unsatisfactory arrangements the issues presented in this film do show that immigration policies haven't changed much through time and space. Today immigrants particularly those who want to enter the border of the US Canada Australia the EU all need to go through the equally if not more painful and prolonged process. This film certainly mirrors the inhumanity in immigration policies across time and space.".

In the beginning the magnificent mountain in Sicily shows how tough it is to live there in the end the milk river shows how difficult it is for the Italian immigrants to struggle in a murky stream full of uncertainties.

The movie can be thought of in three distinct segments the life the immigrants left behind in the old country the Atlantic passage to America and the processing through Ellis Island.The opening scenes although they take place a mere 100 or so years ago conjure up the Dark Ages. For all the superstition illiteracy and darkness that pervaded peasant life in Italy at that time it might very well have been that era.Once the family decides to depart only after receiving a sign from a saint to whom the patriarch prays the horrendous conditions in steerage make it hard to imagine that these poor souls took on this voyage voluntarily. But they went. They went seeking out a life in a new land where money grows on trees and rivers run with milk two of the more surreal themes in the movie.The processing on Ellis Island  which could end in forced return to the old country  included every kind of indignity including communal showers medical exams en massed intelligence testing that today would be denounced as culturally biased and brokered engagements held in an almost auctionlike public setting. When it is inquired why all this is necessary it is pronounced that America does not want the taint of inferior people.Running as a subplot to the story of the Mancuso family is the story of Salvatore Mancuso and Lucy Reed an English gentlewoman on board the ship who proposes to him as a means of gaining her admission to America where sponsorship is required of immigrant women. Although she claims that this will be nothing more than a marriage of convenience and not for love her eyes tell a different story whereas Salvatore is clearly smitten with her.This is a gritty and richly detailed movie. One scene where an elderly grandmother holds her grandson's hands in hers focuses on the dirt embedded under their finger nails.The soundtrack is great although not appropriate to time or place alternating between too modern the music playing over the credits and more Middle Easternsounding than Italian the folk music played by the immigrants while on board ship.To witness the hardships that our forebears forbore to pass through the golden door is to be jolted out of our American complacency and to appreciate what they endured to pave the way for the lives we enjoy today.Laura L.".

For everything he wants to tell he finds powerful images that are able to stand for themselves. Thus he understands film as a medium that primarily tells its stories over the pictures on screen. Particularly European cinema is often very dialoguedriven and many of the young USAmerican directors are strongly influenced by that. Crialese's opposite attitude was really the point that made this film special for me. It has also a very interesting topic that is wrapped up in a quite unusual story and told with humour. Vincenzo Amato is outstanding as family head Salvatore as well as the amazing Charlotte Gainsbourg who I enjoy watching in every single one of her movies. There are many great sequences in this movie. Just to pick one When the ship leaves Italy and the people just quietly stare.

The Mancuso family live in a place that is not even a hamlet just a stone cottage set amid the harsh unyielding stones of a country that cannot offer even a single blade of green grass. An opening sequence sees the Mancuso males scrambling barefoot up a craggy hillside stones in their mouth to offer at a shrine at the top in exchange for a 'sign' that they should set out for the New World or remain where they are. It further shows life aboard the liner huddled masses indeed yearning to breathe free and conditions in Ellis Island where their journey still not over they are interrogated and examined to prove their 'fitness' to enter America. What is NOT shown is the ship in Longshot or indeed ANY shot that would identify it as a large oceangoing liner what is also not shown is anything that would identify America no clich view of New York Harbour and the Statue of Liberty so that Ellis Island could be anywhere in any country. Perhaps the most remarkable shot is the one from a Camera Crane looking down on hundreds of people jammed together slowly almost imperceptibly two thirds of the people at Screen Left begin to separate from the third at Screen Right and we realize that those on the left are actually aboard the ship and those on the right are on the dock a powerful statement of society being fragmented. There's a strong documentary feel throughout as though we were following an actual ship full of immigrants even though it has been carefully scripted and is clearly an amalgam of typical familiesconditions at the time.

	schema:headline " A brooding epic of realism and 'magic'";
	schema:reviewBody "Stranger things have happened than the director of 'Respiro' seeing the wellworn and muchloved opening credits sequence for Monty Python and allowing his memory to resurface in the opening of this epic as two young men now in closeup now tiny and lost in the aerial microcosmic pattern of hill rocks pieces of stone jammed in their bleeding mouths struggle to the holy cairn at the top to ask a vital question. Simultaneously two girls bearing promises of marriage to perhaps rich foreigners and photos of giant vegetables and American streets paved with gold are persuaded to throw the photos away the pictures are taken by a dumb lad to the cairn just as the eldest Salvatore Amato begs the Gods to tell us if we should stay or leave. Salvatore his family which gradually grows as the story opens out are joined by a lost and rootless English lady Gainsbourg who decides to join the family if she can to gain entry into the Promised Land. The story right from the start looks like a coat hanger for the visuals and it is a treat throughout for the eyes. The great break as the ship leaves home is handled in a completely unconventional way A God'seye view shows the heads on board and the heads remaining on shore slowly separating as the ship moves out as if the crowd is a 'people cake' that has been sliced. The sheer brutality of the situation these people have to live through is leavened by this kind of camerawork and by the occasional magic dream as when the nolonger brooding Salvatore's face is showered by coins. The tensions though coming out of the struggle to leave the Old Country survive the voyage and pass into the New Country and the simple efforts of strangers to cope with each other keep it fascinating. Whenever Aurora Quattrocchi 'Mama' is on screen it seems to shift round to her point of view yet another layer. The episodic structure too adds to the illusion of it's being shorter than it is. There are as many apparent links to the coming century as to the past here  the scenes on the mountain look like Pasolini and the three males could almost have been the Marx BrothersAfter the nightmare of travelling 'steerage' a storm in midAtlantic and the interminable and humiliating selection process and 'aptitude' tests at Ellis Island lack of intelligence has been scientifically proved to be genetically inherited and we do not want these people amongst our citizens it remains ambiguous whether everyone has got through to the Land of Milk and Honey or the Mean Streets. I would say on the strength of this that if anyone has the guts to put up the money for a film of 100 Years of Solitude Crialese must be your man. CLIFF HANLEY".

Simultaneously two girls bearing promises of marriage to perhaps rich foreigners and photos of giant vegetables and American streets paved with gold are persuaded to throw the photos away the pictures are taken by a dumb lad to the cairn just as the eldest Salvatore Amato begs the Gods to tell us if we should stay or leave. Salvatore his family which gradually grows as the story opens out are joined by a lost and rootless English lady Gainsbourg who decides to join the family if she can to gain entry into the Promised Land. The story right from the start looks like a coat hanger for the visuals and it is a treat throughout for the eyes. The great break as the ship leaves home is handled in a completely unconventional way A God'seye view shows the heads on board and the heads remaining on shore slowly separating as the ship moves out as if the crowd is a 'people cake' that has been sliced. The sheer brutality of the situation these people have to live through is leavened by this kind of camerawork and by the occasional magic dream as when the nolonger brooding Salvatore's face is showered by coins. The tensions though coming out of the struggle to leave the Old Country survive the voyage and pass into the New Country and the simple efforts of strangers to cope with each other keep it fascinating. Whenever Aurora Quattrocchi 'Mama' is on screen it seems to shift round to her point of view yet another layer. The episodic structure too adds to the illusion of it's being shorter than it is. There are as many apparent links to the coming century as to the past here  the scenes on the mountain look like Pasolini and the three males could almost have been the Marx BrothersAfter the nightmare of travelling 'steerage' a storm in midAtlantic and the interminable and humiliating selection process and 'aptitude' tests at Ellis Island lack of intelligence has been scientifically proved to be genetically inherited and we do not want these people amongst our citizens it remains ambiguous whether everyone has got through to the Land of Milk and Honey or the Mean Streets. I would say on the strength of this that if anyone has the guts to put up the money for a film of 100 Years of Solitude Crialese must be your man. CLIFF HANLEY";

This is particularly troubling since it seems to demean not only the characters in the movie but also the history of immigration itself. Immigrants themselves were heroic figures fully capable of getting along without having to satisfied what I believer to be a veiled image of the white man's burden.

The Left Elbow Index considers seven aspects of filmacting production sets dialogue artistry film continuity plot and character developmenton a scale from high of 10 for excellent 5 for average and 1 for needs help. Both film continuity and plot rate a low of 1. The continuity as discussed above is further degraded by the surrealistic ending. Does not a film of such important historical significance deserve more than a conclusion which reminds one of Marc Chagall? The plot is simple enough until it seems to become entangled with too much time in the old country too little time on the ship and too much emphasis on the ending. The acting and character development is average since all the characters are fixed throughout the film and the inclusion of the AngloSaxon speaking perfect English almost turns the movie into a satire. Where's Groucho when you need him? The production sets the dialogue and the artistry are very good each rating a 10. The sets in Sicily on the ship and on Ellis Island are as good as one can find. The dialogue is marvelous and the ethic singing is superb. I agree with Scorsese that listening to the Sicilian dialect is a pleasure. Note that the immigrants speak of America not the United Statesthe ideal vs. the political reality.

One other notion seems to run through Ellis Island experience the tribulations of pass immigrants was grueling later in 2006 one only had to pay a coyote or boat owner and sneak into the county under the darkness of night no questions asked!

Beyond that though we learned little about most of his family's hopes fears etc. as they embarked on an adventure into the unknown.And why was Lucy even in this movie?

To those who might suggest that she was needed to underscore the point that a single woman however cultured could not get into this country alone I say that that fact is not enough justification to give her so much screen time. That point could have been made in five minutes with Lucy as a momentary character.More questions Why wasn't the twin brother at the boat to meet the family? We heard about the brother and some closure on that point would have been helpful in giving the movie some cohesiveness. Also how long was the journey from Italy to New York? Given the conditions on the ship it makes a difference to the viewer if the voyage took five or 10 or 50 days. Someone said something about seeing land a week at one point but I think that was when they were already en route. I needed these types of details to better appreciate what they were going through.The only scene I really liked was when the boat filled with passengers left the dock.

Miyazawa's selfless compassion for the farmers in his village his sister and other unfortunate people can serve as a lesson to us all. Furthermore Miyazawa's devotion to science was also nicely portrayed. In a time when Western ideas were still met with skepticism especially in provincial towns like the one where Miyazawa grew up he understands its usefulness in helping his fellow villagers and is inspired by its elegance. The way the film presented moments of artistic passion and disappointment in the writer were truly intense and well interpreted.I felt that the CGI integrated into the film while groundbreaking an innovative clashed with the more organic animation. It could be argued that this was intentional to represent conflict within the main character but I found it rather unaesthetic. I also wish that the film had discussed Miyazawa's Buddhist influence but it worked fine without it. I though this film was very well done. I give it a 910 with the one point being deducted for the CGI. Otherwise the animation plot and dialog were all wonderful and heartfelt.

Words cannot express my profound disappointment at this overrated selfindulgent piece of garbage.Some reviewers have actually equated parts of this lowbudget trainwreck to Fantasia which makes me sad for some people who must be visually challenged. Honestly some of the more experimental aspects of this anime are actually quite derivative most notably the colorful etching style which artlessly apes George Plympton. And the computer animation that people praise is middling even for the 1990s.The dub which features an obviously AfricanAmerican voice actor as Kenji Miyazawa is a legendary miscasting. Anime like this must be watched in Japanese with subtitles  English cannot possibly do justice to the local color needed to flesh out some of these philosophical concepts.The story is padded with long pauses repetition and ultimately goes nowhere leaving us with no real feeling for Miyazawa. The character designs are ugly and inconsistent  these anthropomorphic felines lack all of the charm and beauty of their counterparts in Night On The Galaxy Railway also based on the works of Kenji Miyazawa.Anime fans can often be selfdelusional with regards to shows that feature weighty concepts and artsy pretensions but I find it impossible to praise something so shoddy and hollow as Spring  Chaos.".

	schema:headline " Everything that The Beatles' Yellow Submarine should have been";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people wouldn't like it. My wife has never seen it and when I just rewatched it last night I waited until after she went to bed. She might have been amused by a couple small snippets but I know she would have had enough within ten minutes.Head has nothing like a conventional story. The film is firmly mired in the psychedelic era. It could be seen as filmic surrealism in a nutshell or as something of a postmodern acid trip through film genres. If you're not a big fan of those thingspsychedelia surrealism postmodernism and the acid trip aesthetic assuming there's a difference between them you should probably stay away from this film. On the other hand if you are a fan of that stuff you need to run out and buy Head now if you haven't already.Oddly the film has never received much respect. That probably has a lot to do with preconceptions. After all it does star The MonkeesMicky Dolenz Davy Jones Michael Nesmith and Peter Torkand The Monkees were a musical group of actors put together by producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider to be a kidfriendly bubblegummy Beatles for a television series. In their era they had as much respect as say Menudo New Kids on the Block The Spice Girls and so on. As a fellow IMDb reviewer rightly notesPerhaps people in 1968 thinking of the Monkees as a silly factorymade pop band ripoff of the Beatles refused to see Head.The Monkees and Head have never been quite able to shed that negative public perception. It's a shame because there was a lot of talent both musically and otherwise in The Monkees. It's probably odder that Rafelson who directs here and coproduces with Schneider and Jack Nicholson yes that Jack Nicholson who wrote the script and also coproduces decided to take The Monkees in this unusual direction. It's as if New Kids on the Block suddenly put out an album equivalent to Pink Floyd's Ummagumma 1969 or Atom Heart Mother 1970. In fact the songs in Head written by The Monkees and frequent collaborators such as Carole King and Harry Nilsson have a Floydlike quality somewhere between the Syd Barrett era and the immediate postBarrett era. This is much more prominent than any Beatles similarity. Some people have complained about the music in the film but to me all the songs are gems. For that matter some people dislike Barrett era or other Floyd which is just as difficult for me to empathize with.But what is Head about? The basic gist is just that The Monkees are taking a trip through various film genresthere are war scenes adventure scenes horror scenes comedy scenes drama scenes western scenes scifi scenes romance scenes and on and on. Except in the film's reality this turns out to be happening primarily if not exclusively on a studio lot. At root we're watching The Monkees shoot a film. Of course all of the scenes in the various genres have something surreal and selfreferential about them and they and individual shots within a scene tend to lead to one another using dream logic not dissimilar to the Monty Python television show. As a dream Head tends to vacillate between a good dream and a nightmare while often being one that would cause you to laugh in your sleep something that I frequently do by the way.Technically Rafelson uses a wide variety of techniques to realize the above. There are scenes with extensive negative images there are a lot of very fast cuts including a great sequence that features Davy Jones and Tony Basil dancing alternately in a white and a black room wearing a combination of white and black reversed in each that occasionally toggles back and forth as quickly as two frames at a time there are a lot of bizarre segues there is an animated cow mouth there are odd editing devices and so on. For my money I wish this stuff wasn't just a relic of the psychedelic era. This is the kind of artistic approach I relish. It seemed like a good idea back then and I still think it's a good idea. I'd like to see films like The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou using 2004 using these types of extended techniques.

	onyx:emotionText "This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people wouldn't like it. My wife has never seen it and when I just rewatched it last night I waited until after she went to bed. She might have been amused by a couple small snippets but I know she would have had enough within ten minutes.Head has nothing like a conventional story. The film is firmly mired in the psychedelic era. It could be seen as filmic surrealism in a nutshell or as something of a postmodern acid trip through film genres. If you're not a big fan of those thingspsychedelia surrealism postmodernism and the acid trip aesthetic assuming there's a difference between them you should probably stay away from this film. On the other hand if you are a fan of that stuff you need to run out and buy Head now if you haven't already.Oddly the film has never received much respect. That probably has a lot to do with preconceptions. After all it does star The MonkeesMicky Dolenz Davy Jones Michael Nesmith and Peter Torkand The Monkees were a musical group of actors put together by producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider to be a kidfriendly bubblegummy Beatles for a television series. In their era they had as much respect as say Menudo New Kids on the Block The Spice Girls and so on. As a fellow IMDb reviewer rightly notesPerhaps people in 1968 thinking of the Monkees as a silly factorymade pop band ripoff of the Beatles refused to see Head.The Monkees and Head have never been quite able to shed that negative public perception. It's a shame because there was a lot of talent both musically and otherwise in The Monkees. It's probably odder that Rafelson who directs here and coproduces with Schneider and Jack Nicholson yes that Jack Nicholson who wrote the script and also coproduces decided to take The Monkees in this unusual direction. It's as if New Kids on the Block suddenly put out an album equivalent to Pink Floyd's Ummagumma 1969 or Atom Heart Mother 1970. In fact the songs in Head written by The Monkees and frequent collaborators such as Carole King and Harry Nilsson have a Floydlike quality somewhere between the Syd Barrett era and the immediate postBarrett era. This is much more prominent than any Beatles similarity. Some people have complained about the music in the film but to me all the songs are gems. For that matter some people dislike Barrett era or other Floyd which is just as difficult for me to empathize with.But what is Head about? The basic gist is just that The Monkees are taking a trip through various film genresthere are war scenes adventure scenes horror scenes comedy scenes drama scenes western scenes scifi scenes romance scenes and on and on. Except in the film's reality this turns out to be happening primarily if not exclusively on a studio lot. At root we're watching The Monkees shoot a film. Of course all of the scenes in the various genres have something surreal and selfreferential about them and they and individual shots within a scene tend to lead to one another using dream logic not dissimilar to the Monty Python television show. As a dream Head tends to vacillate between a good dream and a nightmare while often being one that would cause you to laugh in your sleep something that I frequently do by the way.Technically Rafelson uses a wide variety of techniques to realize the above. There are scenes with extensive negative images there are a lot of very fast cuts including a great sequence that features Davy Jones and Tony Basil dancing alternately in a white and a black room wearing a combination of white and black reversed in each that occasionally toggles back and forth as quickly as two frames at a time there are a lot of bizarre segues there is an animated cow mouth there are odd editing devices and so on. For my money I wish this stuff wasn't just a relic of the psychedelic era. This is the kind of artistic approach I relish. It seemed like a good idea back then and I still think it's a good idea. I'd like to see films like The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou using 2004 using these types of extended techniques. Now that would make that film surreal.Interpretationally some folks who aren't so in tune with the acid trip aesthetic have complained that it's basically b.s. to offer meanings for something intended to not have any.

TV shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first than to entertain. That The Monkees broke out of the box for a short time to make Head is a testament to the group's popularity and importance in pop culture despite where your head's at. Get one thing straight Head is not The Monkees TV show.So what we have here is a psychedelic documentary about Western pop culture from a source that has authority on the subject. Head is a movie that could only come from those inside the box. By 1968 The Monkees' cast and crew were seasoned and weary professionals who had seen their share of promise and disappointment. The movie was a deliberate attempt at market repositioning. So it did three things Make a film the way The Monkees envisioned. Most importantly reinvent the group to one not subservient to it's old bosses  and yas hipper than before. Make a film that exposed American attitudes of information dissemination.Head therefore really is about media manipulation and its net result deception. The mass media is supposed to inform educate us on the happenings in the world at large and ultimately asks us to form opinions of these events that can shape thought into positive action. Thus we assume the information we absorb to be complete and unbiased  otherwise how can one establish a valued conclusion on any one idea presented by a book newspaper or TV show? In one of the street interviews in Head a guy admits I haven't looked at a newspaper or TV in years. Is he lesser or better the man? Even the drug parallels are a soft veiling of Things are not as they seem. Remember the old joke Everything you know is wrong? The screenplay starts with The Monkees' public admission of it's own manufactured image and runs with the football  literally. Is the football scene in the movie a visual manifestation of the whole idea behind Head? Is the film a streamofconsciousness exercise? Is the film the culmination of pot smoking marathons? There are too many coincidences that occur in the film that suggest otherwise. My guess is that Head is the culmination of motivations somewhere between intended and unintended.Largely the insiders responsible for Head seem to enjoy themselves in the revelries that take place in the film but there is anger  anger at the chaos that characterized the late '60s and anger at the way the media television especially had changed culture in negative ways. Drugs and violence were strong negative forces in the late '60s and still are but the producers of Head want you to know that poor information is a far greater danger.Wars have been attributed to hoaxes and lies. What perfect way to spread disinformation than through TV? Repeatedly the mysterious black box is seen as an obstacle to The Monkees and seemingly all of us as well. In one scene Peter is sullenly sitting in a saloon holding a melting ice cream cone and is asked by a fellow Monkey What's wrong? I bought this ice cream cone and I don't want it. The movie suggests that the first purpose of the media is NOT to inform but to sell en mass blindly. Head goes further put any idea into someone's head and merrily goes he.The filmmakers know this and the danger is real. Head is either a movie that creates itself as we go along or is a deliberate statement. Perhaps perhaps not. Maybe it is just Pot meets advertising as critics scathed in 1968. The jokes are on The Monkees and us. Be careful what you ask for you may get it.Cheers A true guilty pleasure. Very funny. Intelligent. Will please the fans. Find the substance it's there. Unabashedly weird. Bizarre collection of characters. Good tunage. Length is appropriate. Lots of great one liners including my all time prophetic favorite The tragedy of your times my young friends is that you may get exactly what you want.Caveats Dated. Drugs. No plot. No linear delivery of any thought in particular. At least twentyfive stories that interweave in stopand go fashion. So may easily frustrate. May seem pretentious to some. People who can't stand The Monkees need not watch though that in itself is no reason to avoid it. The psychedelic special effects may kill your ailing picture tube or your acid burnt out eyeballs.Match cut.".

	schema:reviewBody "This allbutignored masterpiece is about the Monkees becoming aware that they are fictional characters in a movie Head and that everything they do or say had already been written in an unseen script they seem to be following. Head was written by Jack Nicholson Rafelson and Peter Tork during a threeday LSD trip in a suite at an expensive Hollywood hotel. The other three Monkees only acted in it.They fight this every way they can by doing things not in the script. They deliberately flub their lines walk off sets tear up scenery punch other actors for no reason and ultimately commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. For instance in the rapid flashes of a psychedelic party scene if you watch framebyframe you can see Rafelson sitting next to the camera and cameraman very deliberately shooting into a mirror. He is revealing that the party is actually fake and is being shot in a studio with actors who suddenly drop out of character and walk away in the middle of a conversation when the Director yells cut!The Monkees however never drop out of character because those characters are also who they really are. That ends up being the core of the Revelation soon to come.At every turn they realize their increasinglybizarre actions were exactly what they were supposed to do in the scripted film they can't escape being in. You say they went crazy and walked through the sky which turns out to be painted on paper and hung from the ceiling as the set's background? No problem! Hey hey they're the Monkees and those wacky guys just keep monkeying around! In the end even their deaths did not set them free. That was how the movie was supposed to end and their motionless waterlogged bodies are fished out of the river put in another box and stacked in a film studio warehouse until the characters are needed again for another studio production.This is made all the more poignant by the fact that the Monkees really ARE fictional characters who forced themselves into the real world. They did it through the power of their music.Ironically near the end Peter Tork has what he rightly sees as a hugely profound revelation that solves their problem but unfortunately no one listens. Peter realizes It doesn't MATTER if we're in the box the film. He means that it doesn't matter if will is free or illusory and that the only important thing is that you just let the present moment occur and occur... You need to just let 'now' HAPPEN as it happens without analyzing or evaluating or judging whether the experience is valid by some abstract definition.When you can't even tell the difference will being free or not doesn't mattertying to figure out if you are the real you is just a pointless waste of time.I saw this film at a very important time in my life. I was trying to figure out how to escape being just that geeky creepy nerd girl by thinking about it intensely instead of just having fun i.e. sex like everyone else did. But the revelation in Head broke my selfimposed recursive trap and helped me more than Rafelson or Nicholson or Tork will ever know.For decades I've watched Head and wished I could thank Pete.Was this a good movie?Uhh how about like...

Basically it's a crazy mixed up pastiche of various unrelated sequences. But it IS interesting AND entertaining in its own peculiar way once you get onto its wavelength. In short it was a classic cleverly conceived and well crafted example of late '60s experimental cinema. It contains some good songs some ultragroovy cinematography and plenty of other worthwhile ideas in terms of film technique.I give it 8 out of 10 for several reasons. First it took a lot of courage to make such an unorthodox movie in the commercial mainstream where both its stars and its producers were firmly ensconced at the time whether they liked it or not. It seems that almost everyone who was associated with the project with the exception of Columbia who paid for it knew that it was probably not going to be a big money maker. Their reasons for wanting to do it were as unorthodox as the film itself. Secondly it was for the most part a creative success. And finally as already mentioned it is unquestionably a classic of the genre and as such it is now historically important.Unfortunately Head came too late in the Monkees career. But there again they wouldn't have been allowed to make it earlier on because it was essentially a very pointed and cynical satire of their own image. Clearly the members of the group knew only too well that the whole Monkeemania thing had pretty well run its course when they started work on this movie. In a way it was to be their swan song and they were determined to let it all hang out. They were tired of being treated like mere pawns in the high powered corporate game in which they had been manipulated and exploited over the preceding few years. In short they wanted out and they were going to say a few things before they left.History however has vindicated the band. Let the critics be damned. The Monkees left behind some of the best most polished and successful pop records of the decade. Yes they had plenty of help. But at the end of the day THEY stood in front of the studio mikes THEY fronted the movie and TV cameras and THEY did the concerts. They were fun and just a little bit crazy. But unlike some of their contemporaries they were never threatening. You could safely introduce a Monkey to your elderly aunt.Head probably borrows a bit too heavily from the Beatles Hard Day's Night but it's still worth another look for those who were around at the time or for younger retro fans who can appreciate its significance.Enjoy!".

Their inventive and comedic series sort of an American Idol of their day took four unknown actors and formed a manufactured supergroup around them.This is their take on their manufactured image and status as the 2nd tier Beatles. They always felt they were in a box trapped and unable to find credibility despite their talents.It is also a hell of a musicaltrippy inventive I have the soundtrack and full of surprises.See it with an open mind.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Beatles had just done 'Magical Mystery Tour.' There was the general feel that performance peace and drugs went together naturally. In LA there was a film subculture that knew something was up. Nicholson was in several of these gangs.Before he decided to seriously become an actor before 'Easy Rider' before 'Pink Flamingos' before 'Day for Night' there were several experiments with what to do about this. An important one is 'Saragossa Manuscript.' This is another.Jack writes. He plays with circular narrative selfreference film reference performance selfloathing the pain of creation all on the outskirts of safe kiddiepop. You must see this if only to know something about Jack.Certain actors act by digging into themselves. It is a common technique. Some dig deep but after a while they become boring because they are incredibly shallow people. There isn't just enough stuff in there to sustain a career. Think of DeNiro and Hackman.Others are pretty interesting people who seem to become more interesting over time. When they dig into the barrel they put stuff back in because of the pain of the digging. Think Sean Penn and Jack. At the bottom of Jack's barrel at the end of the thread he spins as the base of every character is this experimental risky writerfilmmaker.Who cares if it is a bad movie? It is bad because it took risks. Watch when a tear is wiped from Annette's cheek by the director. It is a loving goof on the whole Brando thing something that I heard Marlon laughed about. That is one of the richest moments in Hollywood film history.There's another reason to watch this. Music in film is has a strong root in dance. Revolution in film often relies on music. Whole cultures are thus swept along.An unsung giantess in inventing how billions now dance is Toni Basil. She was as influential in pop choreography as the Beatles were in music. She was already well into her career when called upon to work on this. But this is one of her earliest screen appearances. You can see her work throughout and she herself in the pretty cool 'Daddy's Girl' segment over one of Nilsson's better songs. Followed by the Frank Zappa cameo. McCartney would reference this scene in his TeeVee special years later.A third reason to watch is early about 6 12 minutes in the film a character named 'Lady Pleasure' kisses each Monkey in a long continuous shot and then dismissively departs. She is credited as I. J. Jefferson but is really Mimi Manchu Nicholson's lover at the time and LSD partner. Red hair psychedelic demeanor. Lovely. That scene says it all for me about how Jack feels about the boys.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

I was expecting a Monkey movie that was similar to the television show but instead I was given... well I didn't know what I was given to be honest.However after finally watching this film I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts I also found myself watching it over and over again. It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings. And just when I think I've figured out something in the film it's answer is destroyed once I watch the film again. Brilliance indeed.It seems that most people who disliked this film are wanting to watch a film with primarily a clear plot. They want everything explained and all questions answered in the finale. Well sorry if that's what you're wanting this is not the movie for you. But if you liked movies like The Matrix and better yet their sequels I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you.Think of the film being like a dream. In our dreams things make no sense things we expect to happen don't people places and things don't speak act or function in the same way they do in reality. To complain about Head is like complaining about a dream you've had that you felt you could not understand. The mind is a complex system and being that a film titled Head is just as complex is it that difficult to relate the two?The music and musical numbers really stand out especially Peter Tork's two compositions which remain the best tracks in the film Can You Dig It? and Long Title Do I Have To Do This All Over Again?This film proves that The Monkees were much more than just four zanny guys in a 'prefab' group as their critics called them on a television show but that they are actually much more intelligent and talented than the world would give them credit for. There's so many messages that can be derived from the film both in regards to The Monkees and to the 'entertainment industry' in general that it stands as a masterpiece of filmmaking that was far ahead of it's time.I feel had this film been released as an independent piece at this point and time it would actually garner the respect and admiration it deserves.And one finale noteOne could compare this to The Beatles Magical Mystery Tour film since The Beatles film appeared to be just as strange and bizarre. However in my opinion Head stands far above anything The Beatles put on celluloid.".

Sure Jack  Bob get the sole credits but in reality they got a big helping hand on that script from the Monkees who were also in that smokefilled room.it is absolutely impossible to spoil this film Head is very highly symbolic. Among the more memorable elements is the black box which was actually based on 2 things the Monkee image that the boys were bound to and the real black box on the Screen Gems lot where the band was kept between takes. There's so much more symbolism in the movie that I'll just let you watch it and figure it out.The music is awesome. Circle Sky is one of Papa Nez's best tunes ever and Porpoise Song  As We Go Along will have you enthralled. If you'd rather be weirded out then Ditty Diego Can You Dig It? and Long Title should be satisfactory great songs that they are. And then there's Daddy's Song without a doubt a homage to Davy's Broadway days and the editingcolor scheming for that sequence is superb. At least for '68.Oh For those of you who won't watch a 'PG' film you're missing out. Especially since Head was originally rated R in 1968. The rating was lowered about TWENTY years later!Now where was I? Ah yes We were speaking of beliefs. Beliefs and conditioning....".

To be sure the promotion was virtually nonexistent but did they not recognize how angry how downright depressing how selfdestructive this film actually is?! I mean this film is a trip  on bad acid  to the suicide ward of a mental hospital. The only film I know to be this depressing is Terry Gilliam's Brazil and like Brazil this film reveals why life in the later 20th Century was almost unbearable  if you were lucky. It's not simply that Western culture was suffering from serious informationoverload but the information itself was just bad bad more bad and dismal. In fact it was the overload effect itself that kept people going since this allowed people to keep distracting themselves with one crisis or another  if news from Vietnam became too much to bear they could turn the channel and watch a documentary on the rising unemployment rate.The positive response to the reality revealed in Head was Woodstock  three days of peace and love and nudity and mud and bugs and bad food and dirty drink and poop and pee and bad acid and Peter Townsend almost killing Abbie Hoffman. All taking place behind a steel fence under the lovingly watchful eyes of a veritable army of NY State Troopers  meaning that the freedom of Woodstock Nation was as illusory as the song John Sebastion thought he was singing while so strung out he could barely speak. 500000 assholes too stupid to come in out of the rain was one critic's judgment on Woodstock I think it was Andy Warhol. The one good thing occurring there was Jimi Hendrix's Star Spangled Banner. Two years previously the Jimi Hendrix Experience had gone on their first National tour of America as the warmup band opening for  the Monkees.

I agree with some of that but disagree about the overall presentation.I found the songs were the highlight excellent stuff. These guys were not just fluff. they could sing and sing well and their instrumentation isn't bad either. They are definitely underrated in the music department.In the humor department I would say the opposite. This film is a compilation of small comedy bits. There really is no story which I knew before I saw it. I didn't mind that but I was expecting some things that would really make me laugh. I wound laughing very little as most of it is just dumb humor....almost embarrassingly bad.This 1968 movie which wasn't released for three years which wasn't fair to the guys. Their TV program had been off the air so their popularity was waning. I don't know why the delay as there is nothing controversial in here. There is no profanity either. It's pretty clean stuff....just not that entertaining.".

To say that I eagerly awaited the VHS release of their single long lost feature HEAD back in the mid80s is an understatement. I was pestering video clerks for a solid year until it appeared on the shelves. And when I finally watched it... I found myself confused disappointed and bored. The music was different from the more familiar popfriendly tunes on the show  darker lyrically and musically  but that was okay. Musical groups evolve and change. The movie lacks a coherent story line and often makes no sense whatsoever but part of the appeal of their show was its scattershot approach to anarchic comedy. The individual vignettes which often spoof classic Hollywood warhorses and which make up most of the movie's length are silly and don't really go anywhere but then the show was not exactly a storydriven affair either. Ultimately what made the show irresistible was the individual appeal of the four Monkees themselves and their chemistry as a group and the movie simply doesn't give us any of that substituting instead a bizarre parade of unrelated images and events that lacks for any coherent or unifying viewpoint. It's much ado about nothing and when it's over the viewer finds himself wondering Is that it? Was that the best they could come up with given Bob Rafelson as director Jack Nicholson as head screenwriter and two months of studio time? Ultimately HEAD's a harmless trifle but it's one of those late 60s movies like CHE or HIERONYMUS MERKIN that just leave you wondering when the clowns took over the circus. These movies came out while the Hollywood old guard who were still in charge of the studios were greenlighting stuff that they hoped would appeal to a youth audience whose tastes were beyond their understanding. The movie might appeal to Monkey fans or maybe not but keep your expectations low.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well after viewing this film dozens of times I am a huge fan of the Monkees I believe I have finally come to grips with it. The film can be taken on several levels. It is on its face a psychedelic romp with the Monkees in an endless cascade of set pieces in a seemingly plot less melange with time out for six new songsmusic videos. It is on that basis that firsttime viewers should approach it letting the fun sights groovy music and seemingly nonsequitor humor wash over them.But really Head is so much more than a colorful drugfueled weirdness. At its core Head exposes the price of fame the vacuousness of pop culture and the isolation of the individual in modern society. Do you think I'm overreaching here reading in meaning where there really is none? I believe that Jack Nicholson and The Monkees writers of the film though only Jack was credited took a carefullyapplied scalpel to their situation in particular and society in general dissecting and laying bare their frustrations in an artful manner. Ultimately HEAD is an allegorical tragedy that metaphorically and with panache tells the story of the Monkees' rise and their ultimate disillusionment with and revolt against the starmaking machinery that gave them fame and fortune. But what did it take away from them?I can hear your objection now where's the tragedy? What could be worse than famous rich people complaining about their situation?Well at the end of the whole affair the group realizes that they have entered into a Faustian bargain where there is no winning. Ultimately they are not Free Men they are merely human puppets. Their roles as Monkees have them trapped in a locked black box from which there is no escape. Even their decision to kill themselves cannot give them succor and release. They remain trapped in a sealed box never to see light again carted away at the end of the day like some giant studio prop. A dark brooding existential fate to be sure trapped beneath a psychedelic candy coating. The 1960's countercultural views informing this modern fairy tale may have been by this time largely discredited and perhaps almost seem quaint. But there can be no doubt that in HEAD these views are expressed artistically and subtly and with great songs to boot which is an achievement that not every film can boast of. In spite of the scoffing of others I firmly believe that repeated viewings of this film will provide ongoing rewards for the thinking viewer.".

	schema:reviewBody "If I could select one movie that seems out of place out of time and out of any category it could be placed in it would be Head. But then that is the entire point of Head as much as I am able to understand it. The boys the Monkees were continually trying to break out of the box they had been placed in by the studios their fans their relentless critics and everyone else  only to find themselves stuffed back into the box again. The movie is like a metaphor of their entire experience with the show and their identity. The problem is that noone understood the inside story of their struggle or much cared. The movie baffled and angered audiences. But the movie didn't stop there. After shredding their own manufactured image in a sharply cynical and extremely funny way the group proceeds to demolish everything else phony about America in the 60s it's grasping materialism our obsession with security our identity with name brands literally blown up in the movie the country's need to be insulated from the world despite the ongoing war and protests at home and the deepening cynicism the average American had towards just about everything at the end of the 60s. The movie was inaccessible to its young fans because it was rated R probably because of violent images edited in from the war who would have hated it if they saw it because it made fun of their heroes. It was equally inaccessible to older audiences who weren't fans and didn't understand the Monkees or their history. The only ones who got the movie were the ones who made it! And eventually the next generation who stumbled across it and saw it in the context of the 60s. There were to be fair a few people at the time who saw it and understood its brilliant lampooning of the times but those few people were probably from the counterculture and weren't films critics. The movie is at once a distorted reflection of the 60s and the 60s itself. I do have one quibble with the director Bob Rafelson who also produced the t.v. series After the movie bombed he has repeatedly stated I am paraphrasing that he made the movie to 'bury the Monkees. He wasn't talking about their image he was talking about the performers themselves. By this point the honeymoon if there ever was one between him and the Monkees was over. He actually stated that he intended the movie to bomb so it would bury their career. Really? Bob Rafelson was not a pleasant man to work with as many performers including the Monkees have attested to many times. However he was a shrewd producer and went on to be very successful. Would he really put his name on something he planned to not just fail but bomb? I don't think so. It was his way of covering his professional rear when the movie tanked. However despite his demeanor Rafelson produced a success not a failure. Its problem is that it was too successful and ten years ahead of its time. The movie is not a coherent storyline it's a collage of images sounds and feelings from the 60s both innocent and deeply bitter dark and cynical. It is a real oddity out of time space and cannot be categorized. The ending leaves me feeling strangely sad probably because of the comments it makes and because of the promise left unfulfilled of four very funny very talented performers and musicians. Who knows how far they could have gone? Ten stars as it is in a category by itself..Oh no! We're back in the box!".

The unedited news footage included the infamous execution of a Vietnamese soldier we see a closeup of his fearful face as he is held with a gun to his head the trigger is pulled he is killed and falls down dead. How this movie got a G rating is hard to understand. Beware it's not what you would expect a G movie to be.".

It's merely a string of nonsense and it's frequently painful to watch them flail about so desperately.The other thing that sinks the film are the Monkees themselves. They're not great actors they're not great comedians and they're certainly not great musicians so the fact that the entire movie is the Monkees doing those three things it's just no good. They all sort of look like they could be funny but Davy Jones is the only one that has even an ounce of charisma and he's relegated to lame physical humor puns and compared with its main inspiration A Hard Day's Night subRingo blas.

All in all Head is like watching a documentary about great movies instead of actually watching a great movie this movie just made me want to round up a bunch of friends and make my own silly nonsense flick but unlike Bob Rafelson  the Monkees I know that my movie would be of no interest to anyone not in on the joke something of which the Monkees could take note as they needed to make this and then JerryLewis it into their own personal vaults.Grade 410 C  24 of 28 of 1968".

Discussions about who were better The Monkees or The Beatles were common on school yards but the critics well they never quite bought into it. Despite recording some very catchy classic pop tunes the Monkess did not receive much respect for their albums. Sadly a similar fate was met by their one movie vehicle despite the fact that it stands as the best band film ever. Beatle fans may argue that Hard Days Night was better and I am sure that many of the kids think 8 Mile was superior but none of these films were as daring and inventive as Head and that is probably why it failed.If Head had told a direct A to B type story perhaps it would have appealed to the bands young fans but by pushing the envelope and using the movie opportunity to mock their own image they really sabotaged the film with their fans. Could you imagine Eminem turning to the camera and actually talking about how sad it is that he is the best selling guy in a genre in which only 5 and I am being generous of the acts are white. If you can picture that than you have an idea how daring it was for the Monkess to sing Hey Hey we are the Monkees. You know we like to please. A manufactured image with no philosophy. When you have a film in which Frank Zappa tells Davy that he should focus less on the dancing and more on the music its clear that there is a lot more going on then you expected.The story what there is concerns the boys trying to flee their manager who at one point forces them to play dandruff in a commercial but every time they run away they end up inside a box. I don't think you need to be Fellini to figure out the symbolism of that bit. Some neat little comedy bits follow with Davy as a boxer who has to give up playing the violin to take a dive in the big match and Peter refusing to throw away a ice cream cone he does not want because there are starving children so its wrong to waste food but the real selling point to this film is the music and its some of the best the band ever recorded. Even if you are put off by the story you can sit back and enjoy some terrific music.Any film that begins and ends with Mickey attempting suicide by jumping off a bridge at the end the band follows him is never going to be a mainstream classic but if you are a fan of either the band or experimental cinema of the era than you will enjoy this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Even though the movie They Made Me A Criminal is nowhere as good as the later John Garfield antihero classics like Body  Soul in 1947 Force of Evil in 1948 and his last and very underrated He Ran All The Way in 1951 it's the film that defined his career from that point onward until his untimely death on May 21 1952 at the young age of 39. Garfiled plays the part of light Weight Champion Johnnie Bradfield and later the fugitive from the law Jack Dorney who's innocent of the murder that he's charged with even though he's been declared officially dead. Jonnie's manager Doc Ward Robert Doc Gleckler who during a drunken victory party killed reporter Charles McGeeJohn Ridgely who was going to expose to the public his fighter Johnnie Bradfield lies about him being a one women guy as well as non drinking momma's boy. Doc Gleckler smashed a bottle over McGee's head killing him as Jonnie was almost dead drunk with a number of women partying in his hotel suite. Doc was later killed in a car crash with Johnnie's girlfriend Goldie Ann Sheridan but Doc burned to a crisp and with Johnnie's watch on him was mistaken for Johnnie. Told to stay dead and buried by his lawyer Malvin Robert Strange who took 9750.00 of the 10000.00 of Johnnie's money that he had for this great piece of advice. Malvin told Johnnie to take on a new identity and call himself from now on Jack Dorney and get the hell out of the state of New York talking about sleazy shysters. Johnnie now Jack Dorney travels the rails from New York down to Arizona ending up at the Rancho Rafferty Date Farm where most of the film takes place.If it wasn't for John Garfield in the lead role as both Jonnie Bradfield  Jack Dorney the movie would have long been lost and forgotten. Garfield who was only 26 at the time brought the best out of everyone in the movie. Even the transported Dead End Kids I guess we can call them The Arizona Kids here acting were notches above what you would have expected from them and they came across as real and sensitive persons not a bunch of slap stick clowns like in almost all of their movies. All that due to being on the same stage or filming location with John Garfield. They Made Me a Criminal is a good story that has the undercover champ acting like anything but not to draw any attention on himself and end up not only behind bars but in the electric chair. In the end Jack showed just what kind of man he is by not fighting the big fight and against all the odds dramatically winning at the last moment but by going four brutal rounds to get the money for his new found family at the date farm including his girl Peggy Gloria Dickson to open up a gas station with it. Giving the European champ Gaspar Rutchek Frank Riggi the fight of his life and getting 2000.00 thats 500.00 a round for doing it Jack showed everyone who looked up to him like the Arizona Kids that sometimes taking a punch is far braver and more courageous then throwing one.The fact that Jack could have easily clobbered Rutched but didn't in order not to expose himself to the police as on the loose killer Johnnie Bradfield. But instead went as far as he could taking everything that Rutchek could throw at him to help out his friends showed more then all the fights that he won in the boxing ring put together. I for one didn't find the ending of the movie contrived at all but fitting right in with the story. The cop Morty Phelam Claude Rains who came to Arizona from New York to arrest Jack had to live with for years the fact that he once sent an innocent man to the electric chair. We were told all this right at the start of the movie. Why knowing that JackJohnnie was innocent of the murder that he's charged with and not knowing for sure if he'll be found innocent of it in a court of law would he want to make the same terrible mistake again? I can easily see this happening in real life why not then in the movies.".

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS Even though the movie They Made Me A Criminal is nowhere as good as the later John Garfield antihero classics like Body  Soul in 1947 Force of Evil in 1948 and his last and very underrated He Ran All The Way in 1951 it's the film that defined his career from that point onward until his untimely death on May 21 1952 at the young age of 39. Garfiled plays the part of light Weight Champion Johnnie Bradfield and later the fugitive from the law Jack Dorney who's innocent of the murder that he's charged with even though he's been declared officially dead. Jonnie's manager Doc Ward Robert Doc Gleckler who during a drunken victory party killed reporter Charles McGeeJohn Ridgely who was going to expose to the public his fighter Johnnie Bradfield lies about him being a one women guy as well as non drinking momma's boy. Doc Gleckler smashed a bottle over McGee's head killing him as Jonnie was almost dead drunk with a number of women partying in his hotel suite. Doc was later killed in a car crash with Johnnie's girlfriend Goldie Ann Sheridan but Doc burned to a crisp and with Johnnie's watch on him was mistaken for Johnnie. Told to stay dead and buried by his lawyer Malvin Robert Strange who took 9750.00 of the 10000.00 of Johnnie's money that he had for this great piece of advice. Malvin told Johnnie to take on a new identity and call himself from now on Jack Dorney and get the hell out of the state of New York talking about sleazy shysters. Johnnie now Jack Dorney travels the rails from New York down to Arizona ending up at the Rancho Rafferty Date Farm where most of the film takes place.If it wasn't for John Garfield in the lead role as both Jonnie Bradfield  Jack Dorney the movie would have long been lost and forgotten. Garfield who was only 26 at the time brought the best out of everyone in the movie. Even the transported Dead End Kids I guess we can call them The Arizona Kids here acting were notches above what you would have expected from them and they came across as real and sensitive persons not a bunch of slap stick clowns like in almost all of their movies. All that due to being on the same stage or filming location with John Garfield. They Made Me a Criminal is a good story that has the undercover champ acting like anything but not to draw any attention on himself and end up not only behind bars but in the electric chair. In the end Jack showed just what kind of man he is by not fighting the big fight and against all the odds dramatically winning at the last moment but by going four brutal rounds to get the money for his new found family at the date farm including his girl Peggy Gloria Dickson to open up a gas station with it. Giving the European champ Gaspar Rutchek Frank Riggi the fight of his life and getting 2000.00 thats 500.00 a round for doing it Jack showed everyone who looked up to him like the Arizona Kids that sometimes taking a punch is far braver and more courageous then throwing one.The fact that Jack could have easily clobbered Rutched but didn't in order not to expose himself to the police as on the loose killer Johnnie Bradfield. But instead went as far as he could taking everything that Rutchek could throw at him to help out his friends showed more then all the fights that he won in the boxing ring put together. I for one didn't find the ending of the movie contrived at all but fitting right in with the story. The cop Morty Phelam Claude Rains who came to Arizona from New York to arrest Jack had to live with for years the fact that he once sent an innocent man to the electric chair. We were told all this right at the start of the movie. Why knowing that JackJohnnie was innocent of the murder that he's charged with and not knowing for sure if he'll be found innocent of it in a court of law would he want to make the same terrible mistake again? I can easily see this happening in real life why not then in the movies.";

Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is horribly miscast as a pugilist. John Garfield with his background and style steps into a part he was born to play.They Made Me a Criminal was directed by Busby Berkeley who Jack Warner believed in keeping busy in between musicals. Berkeley in fact would soon be leaving Warner Brothers for MGM. Berkeley does do a fine job here keeping the action flowing at a good pace. I particularly like the scene where four of the Dead End Kids and Garfield are swimming in a water tank and get stranded there when the water level goes down. They get it out of it quite narrowly and with some good ingenuity.Other performances besides Garfield and the kids to remember are May Robson who runs the summer camp for the kids and Claude Rains as the obsessed detective on Garfield's trail.".

The Dead End KidsBowery Boys found themselves in a lot of uneven films and usually did better when in a support role as in Angels With Dirty Faces. Here their presence as a backdrop to the story of a boxer framed for murder gives them a lot of screen time without distracting from the main action.John Garfield is light heavyweight champion Johnny Bradfield a southpaw hitter who's a lot different from the image he portrays to the sports world and the press. When a newspaper reporter inadvertently learns that Johnny's a party loving womanizer his plans to spill that information in a column is interrupted by a whiskey bottle to the head from Johnny's manager Doc Ward Robert Gleckler. In turn Doc talks Johnny's girlfriend Goldie Ann Sheridan into running off with him to avoid the legal hassle of dealing with the reporter's death. As both flee a police chase winds up in a fiery car wreck and Doc's body is misidentified as Johnny from the gold watch he was wearing.Claude Rains adopts an Edward G. Robinson sneer that doesn't quite work as a detective who's been reassigned to morgue detail after a bad arrest years ago. His character is Monty Phelan and he has a pretty good hunch that the body in the car crash wasn't Johnny. He pesters his boss to hand over the closed case to him and is given the assignment to get him out of town and out of the way.Meanwhile Johnny looks for advice from his lawyer and winds up being screwed even worse when he gets conned for most of his ten thousand dollar savings. Making his way cross country Johnny winds up at the Rancho Rafferty Date Farm in Arizona run by a crusty Granny Rafferty May Robson. The farm is the legacy of Granny's brother a deceased priest from Brooklyn and is now the home of a band of rag tag street boys The Dead End Kids who work the farm. Billy Halop is the nominal leader of the boys in this one and his sister Peggy Gloria Dickson becomes the romantic interest for Johnny now going by the name of Jack Dorney.I get a kick out of the historical perspective offered in these preWar era films. When Johnny and the boys take a joy ride in the farm's truck they fill up at a gas station for a 1.28! Tommy Halop gets the idea that a gas station on the farm would be a good way to earn some extra money and with that thought Jack Dorney decides to take on a barnstorming boxer offering 500 a round to anyone who can stay in the ring with him. The clichd premise is turned on it's ear somewhat when Jack gets knocked out in the fifth round but by then he's earned enough to give the fruit farm a fighting chance of it's own. Maybe Grandma Rafferty should have been in the ring she just about took out everyone sitting around her at ringside. As JohnnyJack comes around in the locker room Detective Phelan is on hand to take him into custody. Knowing that he can redeem his reputation with this collar it's a toss up as to whether Phelan follows through on his arrest  you'll have to watch the film to find out.I like the Dead End films where Leo Gorcey's in charge but he doesn't have a lot to do in this one. However he does a great flimflam on the ticket taker at the gate of the boxing match. Another thought  wouldn't it have been great if the ever present picture on the wall of the priest had been that of Pat O'Brien?All in all this is a pretty good entry in both the John Garfield and Dead End Kids filmography and an entertaining way to spend an hour and a half. If there's one downside it's not enough screen time for pretty Ann Sheridan. The film might have wound up even more satisfying if the roles of Sheridan and Gloria Dickson were reversed as the on screen chemistry between Dickson's Peggy and Jack seemed more forced than natural.".

Too bad.All the Dead End Kids do their jobs beautifully in this 1939 entry. It is odd to watch them in a Western setting with their Brooklyn accents  I guess that should be Bowery . They even show some swimming abilities.I think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxinglovecrime story. My favorite right now is in the fight scene near the end of the film. Busby Berkeley shows his dance movie expertise when John Garfield shifts his feet and as we watch that move the camera moves up to his face. I will not give away why or when but the look on his face at that point probably brought the 1939 audience to its feet in the theaters.Some will think John Garfield looks a lot like Frank Sinatra in many scenes. Just his face. Actually Frank was not yet making movies so maybe Frank looked like John. The boxer named Smith in the movie looks like a clone of Ed Begley Jr.Now I must tell you something that is not a spoiler but if you watch the movie watch Grandma's hands. May Robson does her part well. She seems to have hands that wander a bit. In a scene where she and a crowd go into the boxer's John Garfield dressing room watch where she touches the reclining John Garfield while he is wearing only his trunks.A great ending. Lots of wonderful characters.Best line might be at the gas station ...eight gallons that's a dollar twentyeight... Tom Willett".

Celebrating a ring victory in a jammed locker room boxer Johnnie Bradfield emotes about his love of mom rejection of booze and clean living style to fans including cops who eat it up.  Later in the evening he's plowed and tussling with his bimbo gal while his manager in on the con shares the evening. And the whiskey.A problem develops when another couple arrives.

The lawyer later gives Johnny 250 and tells him that the balance is his fee for giving him professional advice get out of town fast and go far away. I would never charge a client more than 5000 for such pithy succinct and wise direction. Johnny now a freight train hopping hobo winds up conveniently passing out at an Arizona date ranch where he's nursed back to health by beautiful Goldie West Ann Sheridan a fine actress whose career was in the ascendancy.  Taking Jack Dorney as his moniker the pugilist loses some of his rough edges as he falls in love with Goldie.  He becomes a mentor and pal to  The Dead End Kids.  Familiar screen characters to prewar moviegoers.A chance to make money arises when an exhibition boxer shows up challenging any suckers to last several rounds in the ring with him.  It's a natural temptation for BradfieldDorney but there's a fly in the ointment.  Who should show up but New York detective Monty Phelan the laughing stock of the department?  He's been on morgue duty for ages because of a slight mistake early in his career that sent an innocent man to Old Sparky we all make mistakes don't we?  Phelan recognized Bradfield from a news photo and he's there to watch the fight and make the pinch.

That film had one of the best love songs ever How Deep Is the Ocean as a background to the love scenes.

The ever superb and I feel also unrated Leo Gorcey says it all with his body language and that face as the tough mug with a ice cube for a heart. He is wonderful. As for the rest of the Bowery BoysDead End Kids  they are also fabulous.

At this point she was considered an actress on the way up but ended up spending most of her brief career in low budget films before her death in a fire at 28.

He was always a fantastic actor and gives a professional performance but the part doesn't play to his strengths of urbanity and wit.

It's noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and appeal of it's star John Garfield.Garfield plays Jack a boxing star who is framed for murder. He must go on the run and ends up out in the sticks with Gloria Dickson and the Dead End Kids. Here is offered a chance for redemption yet will the past catch up with him yet? Garfield was an actor ahead of his peers. Before the term 'Method' was even coined and before Brando ever screamed 'Stella!' he brings 'natural' to the screen. His earthy quality and amazing acting talent dominate this production. Also interesting is that his role here as a boxer has shades of that 'Golden Boy' role he so desperately wanted to covet on screen. Garfield looks the type and goes the distance as a boxer proving his acting worth.Ann Sheridan is here in a small role at the beginning as Jack's trampy girl Goldie. I haven't ever thought much of Sheridan but I liked her here. She plays well off Garfield. Dickson's' performance is a little tired and she does not share good chemistry with Garfield. The Dead End Kids are here and Garfield seems their natural idol even more so than Cagney. Claude Rains is miscast and he looks uncomfortable in the role in many a scene. Strange as he always was such a reliable actor.Also interesting to note is the director Busby Berkeley best known for his early musicals with dancing girls and kaleidoscope images directs a different genre here with remarkable ease. He maintains a gritty atmosphere throughout admirably.A very good film that deserves greater attention 810.".

I'd be surprised that the kids didn't recognize the Garfield character. After all he is the world champion not just an unknown contender. He runs is cheated by those he trusts this part is believable in the fight game and those that know him turn their backs on him. He hides under an assumed name and makes his way to the South. One part that bothers me is that he has a hard time keeping a low profile. If he doesn't want attention he doesn't go about it very well. One might say it's the girl but he has already strung himself up before she seriously comes into the picture. The Dead End Kids are more believable in these movies. They don't have the silly Three Stooges kind of persona that the Bowery Boys later had of course those were formula films. They are the real starts here but still have too much schtick to be that appealing. The final scene is nice but it really is contrived.".

They don't have the silly Three Stooges kind of persona that the Bowery Boys later had of course those were formula films. They are the real starts here but still have too much schtick to be that appealing. The final scene is nice but it really is contrived.";

There he hooks up with tough blonde Dickson and her juvenile delinquent date pickers Gorcey et. al.. Trouble is that Detective Phelin Rains won't give up the chase and now Johnnie's in a pickle he can't fight his way out of.Okay nothing unusual about the plot except maybe the setting. Nevertheless director Busby Berkeley manages to blend the elements into a good gritty little tale. Well that's except for the fight scenes which prove Berkeley was better at arranging dancers than boxers. Even so he makes maybe the best use of that ragamuffin outfit that would become the Bowery Boys that I've seen. Even the usually buffoonish Huntz Hall is under firm control. But maybe the biggest challenge was getting aristocratic Claude Rains to impersonate a street wise New York cop of all things. Fortunately that excellent actor pulls it off better than expected. And of course there's the great Garfield showing why his brand of feisty urban grit was so perfect for the times. Then there's the one scene that still has me sweating. Johnnie and the boys are cooling off inside a big waterfilled irrigation tank. Okay no problem. Except farmer somebody decides his date trees need water and before they know it the boys are clawing at the bare metal sides trying to escape the ten feet of water he's left in the bottom. Sure they're okay but only so long as they keep swimming and swimming trapped like flotsam in a fish bowl. It's a sweaty doomsday setup that comes out of nowhere.Anyway this is the type of film that made me a fan of hardscrabble Warner Bros. of the 1930's. So catch up with it if you can.".

	schema:reviewBody "When someone refers to the independent cinema realm in the United States it's often inferred that it means the filmmaker or people behind the project had much more creative freedom and did what they wanted. This today is not really always the case unless someone is a solid auteur and creative freedom still comes with the caveat that one has to find distribution with one of the independent divisions of major studios or by getting picked up somehow for some kind of lowlevel deal at a worthwhile film festival. But Putney Swope Robert Downey Sr's film about a toughasnails AfricanAmerican accidentally promoted to head advertising guru at a production company is independent cinema the kind of work that went right along with the likes or Romero's Night of the Living Dead and Cassavetes Faces at the same time of getting no real typical studio distribution but causing waves kicking ass and taking names in the cinema world. For all its moments that are rough and crude it's unforgettable.It's also a film that is funny very and excruciatingly funny. Sometimes the sense of humor is just so ridiculous it's nearly impossible not to laugh from the mere appearance of the President Mimeo with his wife to lines of dialog from the advertisements Swope's team puts together like I can't eat an air conditioner in a real soul voice. It is as smart as the audience it is aiming at which is anyone with two brain cells to put together who can see that this work isn't offensive or too shocking because it's meant to rattle the cage and it does this pretty well in the first five minutes. Once that's past Downey Sr goes on his blitz of sorts as far as being a filmmaker with nothing to lose his protagonist is part Fidel Castro part Isaac Hayes circa 1972 and yes it's 1969 in the film and part hardassed ad exec with a firing streak to make Mr. Spacely on the Jetsons look kind. And don't forget those side characters dear God.There's so many memorable lines and moments that it's hard to keep track. From maybe the most hilarious botched assassination attempt in any movie to the one ad for FaceOff skin cream that includes lines that would give South Park a run for its dirtymouth money to just little asides with the one guy from Jack Hill's movies playing the Muslim who keeps giving lip to Swope and that one boy with the the nun who curses up a storm and impresses Swope in a swift stroke. It's a pretty direct message about media and advertising but there's also a lot of powerful moments where it just hits the nail on the head about racism in America sometimes without having to do more than a gesture and sometimes with doing something HUGE like having black panther types going this way and that around Swope's advertising regime. And for a lowbudget production I mean super low hence the comparison to Night of the Living Dead and Faces Downey got some really good actors all nonunion and it's hard to imagine that some of them might have had their first time on camera here.It should be mentioned that Downey's style doesn't make it perfect it is crude and sometimes too crazy and dated for its own good and I'm sure I didn't get some of the underlying humor of a couple of the ads since I'm from a full generation after these ads were aired albeit the Miss Redneck Jersey was definitely not lost on me.

	schema:headline " Putney Swope Is A Passionate Piece of Cinema History";
	schema:reviewBody "Putney Swope is a unique low low low budget gem from the late 1960's which probably would have been forgotten in time if it hadn't been for two things Paul Thomas Anderson who named Don Cheadle's character in Boogie Nights Buck Swope after the eponymous hero of this film and the limited DVD release. Watching Putney Swope is like listening to hardcore punk rock it may not make a lot of sense at least to me it didn't upon watching it for the first time but you have to respect the film for its passion and unabashedly rebellious message. I didn't understand a lot of things about Putney Swope but for the most part I liked it. The more I think about the movie the more it grows on me.The film is advertised as a parody of New York's Madison Avenue best known in the 1960's as the advertising capital of the world. Members of Generation X and Y may be lost on this concept but fortunately Mad Men is on TV to provide us with this otherwise lost piece of U.S. History. What you need to know before watching this movie is that these ad agencies were largely male and even more largely white establishments.With this premise in mind the movie opens up with an ad agency board meeting. The members are predominantly white except for Putney Swope Arnold Johnson who bears an uncanny resemblance to Dick Gregory in this film the token AfricanAmerican on the board. The board members are so selfabsorbed and soulless that when their chairman falls dead in front of them their only concern is who will become chairman next. Without even removing the body from the boardroom they begin a paper ballot to elect the next chairman.Putney Swope is elected by a landslide but not because the other members think Swope is qualified. Voting for Swope was an illfated attempt for these board members to sabotage any other member's chance of being elected chairman. With their plans backfired Swope takes charge and sinks the boat firing all but one of the original members and hiring all people of color in their place .After this point the film became for me very weird and hard to follow plotwise. There may not have even been a plot really. The whole idea of the film seems to be a what if scenario with the result being that the new Truth and Soul Inc. firm would be unconventional but successful nonetheless. The firm ends up making so much money that the members build a huge glass case to keep the cash in for unexplained purposes. It could be because Swope doesn't trust banks although that point is not touched upon or explained in the film. It could also be metaphoric in some way but who knows.Most of the movie takes place inside the ad agency with occasional scenes in the White House with a president who for some unknown reason is a midget. My assumption is here that some political joke was being made but I can't figure out what. Were the filmmakers saying that the president is a small insignificant part of American life? Were they saying that the latest elected officials Nixon at the time were insignificant candidates? I don't know. I found it a bit eerie however that the man playing the president bore a striking resemblance to future president Ronald Reagan. It is funny to make that connection 40 years after the movie was made.What this film may have benefited from is showing how consumers outside the ad agency reacted to the new ads. Of course the ad footage possessed a strange funny appeal for its unconventional creativity but did these ads convince people to buy the product? If so how? The movie hinted on the idea that the new ad campaign was successful through client interaction and the calls from the White House. However it would have been revealing to see average people since that demographic has always been most profitable for advertisers.Although the parodies and political messages this film may have made probably didn't stand the test of time this film still had a lot of unique qualities. Arnold Johnson had a magnetic X factor to him that benefited him greatly in this film. Swope's rough voice was actually director Robert Downey Sr.'s voice dubbed in sometimes poorly but fit the character so well in being an authoritative outsider. He hires and fires workers at random but earns the respect of all but one of the employees for revolutionizing the ad agency and seeking out new ideas.The premise of the film was and still is incredibly risky especially since the film was written and directed by a white man Robert Downey Sr.. However this film declines to fall victim to negative black stereotypes which would lead to the rise and fall of the blaxploitation genre years later. Although some of the sex scenes may be a bit offputting for some viewers the main message is that a black owned and operated business can thrive through innovation and risk taking. Many people may not take a positive message away from this movie but I just did.Putney Swope remains an overlooked movie from a strange era and Downey Sr. even despite his son's recent comeback never quite got the recognition as a director he deserved. However if you find a DVD of this movie buy it and watch it. If it's on Netflix ditto. It's a movie that can be confusing at times but is worth watching for its gusto ambition and its nonconformist stature even by today's movie standards.".

	onyx:emotionText "Putney Swope is a unique low low low budget gem from the late 1960's which probably would have been forgotten in time if it hadn't been for two things Paul Thomas Anderson who named Don Cheadle's character in Boogie Nights Buck Swope after the eponymous hero of this film and the limited DVD release. Watching Putney Swope is like listening to hardcore punk rock it may not make a lot of sense at least to me it didn't upon watching it for the first time but you have to respect the film for its passion and unabashedly rebellious message. I didn't understand a lot of things about Putney Swope but for the most part I liked it. The more I think about the movie the more it grows on me.The film is advertised as a parody of New York's Madison Avenue best known in the 1960's as the advertising capital of the world. Members of Generation X and Y may be lost on this concept but fortunately Mad Men is on TV to provide us with this otherwise lost piece of U.S. History. What you need to know before watching this movie is that these ad agencies were largely male and even more largely white establishments.With this premise in mind the movie opens up with an ad agency board meeting. The members are predominantly white except for Putney Swope Arnold Johnson who bears an uncanny resemblance to Dick Gregory in this film the token AfricanAmerican on the board. The board members are so selfabsorbed and soulless that when their chairman falls dead in front of them their only concern is who will become chairman next. Without even removing the body from the boardroom they begin a paper ballot to elect the next chairman.Putney Swope is elected by a landslide but not because the other members think Swope is qualified. Voting for Swope was an illfated attempt for these board members to sabotage any other member's chance of being elected chairman. With their plans backfired Swope takes charge and sinks the boat firing all but one of the original members and hiring all people of color in their place .After this point the film became for me very weird and hard to follow plotwise. There may not have even been a plot really. The whole idea of the film seems to be a what if scenario with the result being that the new Truth and Soul Inc. firm would be unconventional but successful nonetheless. The firm ends up making so much money that the members build a huge glass case to keep the cash in for unexplained purposes. It could be because Swope doesn't trust banks although that point is not touched upon or explained in the film. It could also be metaphoric in some way but who knows.Most of the movie takes place inside the ad agency with occasional scenes in the White House with a president who for some unknown reason is a midget. My assumption is here that some political joke was being made but I can't figure out what. Were the filmmakers saying that the president is a small insignificant part of American life? Were they saying that the latest elected officials Nixon at the time were insignificant candidates? I don't know. I found it a bit eerie however that the man playing the president bore a striking resemblance to future president Ronald Reagan. It is funny to make that connection 40 years after the movie was made.What this film may have benefited from is showing how consumers outside the ad agency reacted to the new ads. Of course the ad footage possessed a strange funny appeal for its unconventional creativity but did these ads convince people to buy the product? If so how? The movie hinted on the idea that the new ad campaign was successful through client interaction and the calls from the White House. However it would have been revealing to see average people since that demographic has always been most profitable for advertisers.Although the parodies and political messages this film may have made probably didn't stand the test of time this film still had a lot of unique qualities. Arnold Johnson had a magnetic X factor to him that benefited him greatly in this film. Swope's rough voice was actually director Robert Downey Sr.'s voice dubbed in sometimes poorly but fit the character so well in being an authoritative outsider. He hires and fires workers at random but earns the respect of all but one of the employees for revolutionizing the ad agency and seeking out new ideas.The premise of the film was and still is incredibly risky especially since the film was written and directed by a white man Robert Downey Sr.. However this film declines to fall victim to negative black stereotypes which would lead to the rise and fall of the blaxploitation genre years later. Although some of the sex scenes may be a bit offputting for some viewers the main message is that a black owned and operated business can thrive through innovation and risk taking. Many people may not take a positive message away from this movie but I just did.Putney Swope remains an overlooked movie from a strange era and Downey Sr. even despite his son's recent comeback never quite got the recognition as a director he deserved. However if you find a DVD of this movie buy it and watch it. If it's on Netflix ditto.

	schema:reviewBody "1969 was the year. New York City was the place. Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film to achieve some recognition. The first was Chaffed Elbows 1966. Putney Swoope achieved a much wider release. Pound 1970 and Greasers Palace 1972 were even more profane and obnoxious. Those 2 films were mean spirited to the point that they actually stalled the Prince's feature film career for several years.The subject at hand is Putney Swoope. And it is a mad farcesatire that has to be seen to be believed. I'm not going to go through the plot here. What Plot?? People looking for a plot are going to be scratching their heads. Keep Scratching!! This film is not about PLOT! One could compare this to a Mel Brooks movie only without the Hollywood parody party that Mel always threw. I also see a little bit of Monty Python in this. By the way This film was shot before Monty had debuted on the BBC!!! I notice that the Gags and Lines that are drop dead hilarious DO NOT transfer well by word of mouth. You have to see them within the context of the film. There are some flaws in the film but even the flaws are unique. For instance Actors often repeat the SAME LINE over and over again and somehow it works. How Many Syllables Mario? Putney Says the Borman Six Girl Has Got to Have Soul! etc...The BW photography is outstanding. The SoundScore is even better! The editing is only soso. The acting is above average. The script is priceless. The jokes are as unPC as you can get MR. Bad News says Sonny Williams just got caught in a motel with a 13 year old girl Putney says Well at least He's not superstitious Uptight conservatives beware. The AntiEstablishment mindset of this film will drive you straight out of the room. Nothing is sacred.There are many things in this film that pertain to today NO SMOKING!!! Reverse Racism with African Americans treating Caucasions like trash. The manipulation of Mass Media over the masses Madison Avenue Deroit Hollywood intentionally pedaling something that any 8 year old can tell is pure garbage The Internet I'm talking about the drum Interracial dating I could go on and on....I should also mention that there is about 8 min of this film that was shot in 16 mm Color. These are the commercials shot by Putney's agency. The spots work fairly well the first time around. They get tiresome though on repeated viewings. The real magic here is within the BW sections of the film. It's the nonscenically lines they stay with you Rent Yourself A CHORT Schmuck. I love You I Love You I love You... did you take your pill?. anything that I have to say would just be redundant. And a host of others. I also really like the bit with the mounted minnow up on the wall The game warden wanted me to throw it back... I put up such a fight I decided to have it mounted! Standouts in the cast include Buddy Buttler as Putney's bodyguard 1. He should have been a much bigger star. Antonio Fargas as the Arab. He did go on to stardom on TV and in Films. Arnold Johnson has the right look as Putney Swoope. Robert Downey used his Own voice instead because Arnold couldn't remember some of his lines. Also Downey realized that He could fill in any additional dialogjokes later on if he dubbed his Lead actor. The film does have some shortcomings. The short run time is one. I wish the beginning with the White board members would have been extended. Stan Gotlieb and Allen Garfield are outstanding. The ending seams to have been thrown together as if he just couldn't think of any more gags. All in all this is one of the Best lowbudget independent films of it's time. A time when very few indys' played outside of New York Chicago San Francisco and L.A. Anyone who loves satire and comedy should see this at least twice. Downey's Putney Swoope is Ahead of and Beyond it's time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Writer  director Robert Downey Sr. a pioneer of the underground film movement in the 1960s satirized the New York Madison Avenue advertising world with his avantgarde comedy Putney Swope. Downey doesn't confine his ridicule to advertising but tackles black militant culture the dynamics in Hollywood's portrayal of race the elite white power structure and character of corruption in any power struggle. As audacious and ambitious as Putney Swope strives to be it qualifies as a terrible film amateurishly made on a shoestring budget with a noname cast and humor that lacks hilarity. Everything about this movie reeks with improvisation. Putney Swope stirred up controversy during its initial release with its politically incorrect handling of race issues and consumer culture. Like most Marx Brothers movies the plot is thin providing an excuse for Downey's anecdotal gags most of which are terrible.The chairman of a prestigious Madison Avenue ad agency dies during a board meeting. Before the body has been removed the board holds a secret ballot vote to determine who will replace him. Each member understands that they are forbidden to vote for himself. Sheer accident occurs when everyone votes for the token black member Putney Swope Arnold Johnson since none thought anybody would cast a ballot for him. Swope pink slips all but one of the white executives surrounds himself with black pistol packing employees and renames the firm Truth and Soul Advertising. Swope decides to alter the face of American advertising. He refuses to accept clients whose products are alcohol tobacco or war toys. Swope's clients stage an exodus after he becomes the CEO and grandstanding attracts a new lineup of clients that show up at his office lugging bags of money and prepared to suffer abuse from Swope's militant employees. Swope exploits his AfricanAmerican staff too ruthlessly appropriating their ideas after he fires them and conjures up a number of offensive advertising campaigns all of which are hailed as a 'new wave' of marketing genius. Incredibly Swope's conservatism proves successful but the agency becomes the target of government operatives who argue Swope's advertising tactics constitute a threat to the national security. The high point of this black  white 85minute comedy are the television commercials shot in color. Unfortunately Downey doesn't know when to cut off these ads that consistently start out cleverly but wear out their welcome. The funniest part of Putney Swope involves our eponymous protagonist's dealings with U.S. President Mimeo in Washington D.C. Pepi Hermine a marihuanatoking midget with a Kissingerlike Teutonic adviser Larry Wolf spouting tasteless jokes while trying to convince Swope to come up with an advertising campaign for his new car the Borman 6.".

Movie ratings were not yet a reality so any teenager could walk into any movie. Imagine what it was like for a kid my age to see both Midnight Cowboy and Putney Swope in the same year. Imagine the times. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King has just been killed but the following summer had a man walking on the moon and Woodstock. Putney Swope was the Woodstock nation's chance to stick it to the man. You'll see where Robert Downey Jr. got his sardonic brilliance. His old man was an instant hero to kids like me. No punches are pulled in this classic and aging hippies will rejoice when they relive this era. Hopefully new flower children will be emboldened by it and this current era of fascism will come under the same scrutiny my era was subjected to.".

The jokes are either unfunny the president is a midget. HOW is this funny? cruel or obvious and the film is full of unlikable characters. It's done in a very experimental way which makes it even harder to take...or understand. The movie just gets more bizarre and surreal as it goes along. The ending comes out of nowhere. To make it worse with the sole exception of Johnson ALL the acting is bad. Antonio Fargas a regular in these types of films is especially annoying as the Arab. This gets three stars because the commercial parodies done in bright color ARE amusing and there's a rare good line here and there. I heard this was a cult classic but this is more interesting than good. Skip it...unless you're in experimental 1960s films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sure the film is full of black militant stereotypes and much of the jargon of the time. In that sense the movie has indeed dated. But as a satirical look at America's number one parasitical industry advertising it's still on target. But just as important is the counter message namely the effect of big bucks on those who would make the industry more socially responsibleno promoting war toys alcohol etc. Thus the movie's also about the allures of capitalism. Note for example how Putney's garb suddenly changes to resemble ThirdWorld revolutionary Fidel's just before he pulls out of the firm. For a moment it looks like Swope's minirevolution has succeeded among his staff and he's moving on maybe to spread the movement. But then the former militants succumb to the allure of big bucks and he departs shaking his head perhaps to hijack a plane to Cuba. Downey's final word however is an ironical one as the Arab I believe burns down the money tower leaving the metaphorical structure of advertising capitalism a smoking ruin. To me this looks like change can only succeed as a cleansing act of destruction and not as a process of reforma message consistent with the radical spirit of the time.Whatever the subtext there are some genuinely funny moments especially with the commercials that play as well now as they did then. Those who compare the anarchic style to that of the Marx Bros. make a good point. The throwaway lines fly thick and fast along with the outrageous setups. Forty years later it's still a hard movie to get a consistent handle on. Despite the crudities however the film remains a work of daring originality with some genuinely telling moments.".

Lenny Bruce started the ball rolling against our cherished beliefs and institutions in this country and he paid dearly for it. Downey picks up the cudgels would you believe I ordered a dacron cudgels last week and it still hasn't arrived and does Lenny Bruce one better. Nothing and no one is safe. Jews Blacks the Presidency advertising all are decimated with I don't want to use the cheap metaphor a rapier like wit so I won't use that tired expression I'm too advanced for that. The story is meaningless. It's like walking into an insanity ward where nothing rational is going on and trying to make a coherent narrative of it. The President of the US is a midget with a yiddish accent the only Black man on the board of directors of an advertising agency is elected CEO because the whites all hate each other. Running through the picture at the CEO's side lilke a Greek chorus the great Antonio Fargas is a ghetto Black street kid wearing  an Arab headress contstantly chiding Putney the CEO to start the revolution. Gimme a date man I mean when does it start. Tell me the hour and the date of the revolution man. There is a scene in a lavatory where Fargas and another brother are sitting in stalls talking about their Johnsons which is superior to any rapp I've ever heard. There is a scene where the now very wealthy Putney and his wife have a white maid. She is an inept hopless recent Polish immigrant and they treat her like well like many whites treated Blacks in the good old bad dayswith complete contempt.The interesting part of this is the part of the maid was played by Elzbieta Czyzewska who WAS a recent arrival to this country. She did not do well here but she took care of a fellow immigrant who turned out to be Supermodel Pauline Porizkova. A movie was made of this story Anna 1987. It contains a remarkable performance with Sally Kirkland as Elzbieta. There was only one problem. The people who made the movie never heard of Elziet Czyzewska. No recognition no royalties no nothing. It is a very sad story.".

They believe in a better world a world where people can think and say what they want  without being aimed at. But are their beliefs of having the possibility of changing the society realistic? I think not.This documentary gives us enlightenment in the issues of greed capitalism and the future it might bring. It is a great documentary that is not propaganda because it is not shown as what they say is right. Everything it shows is what some individuals think and it is up to the viewer to decide if what they do and stand for is right or wrong.I have heard many people that labels this a propaganda and therefor chooses not to view it I think they are making a bad decision because even if you sympathize with the police or the demonstrators belief all you get is more facts to rely on for example the kid that got shoot says that he thinks that it is good to throw a brick through a McDonalds window because it is the step between thinking and acting as you think.Overall this movie freaked me out because you cannot really dismiss the facts that the few policemen that fought violence with violence did not get convicted or even detained in custody even however the proof of them throwing bricks at the demonstration march and in some cases beating people with truncheon even though they are lying on the street without making resistance where as good as it gets.Rating 810  Very good but not best!".

	schema:reviewBody "Although this film is set amongst the sophisticated English upper classes it is a simple story of a couple torn asunder. It has a slightly dated air being an adaptation of A Way Through the Wood a 1950 novel by Nigel Balchin once hugely popular and now forgotten. Julian Fellowes who despite an academy award for the script of Gosford Park has a somewhat anachronistic persona himself wrote the script and directed the latter for the first time. With the DVD version I saw there is a most illuminating audio commentary by Julian. His primary focus was on getting his characters right and by and large he has succeeded. In this he was helped by two outstanding performances from Tom Wilkinson as James the stitched up City lawyer and Emily Watson as his attractive wife Anne. He also kept it short the running time is only 80 minutes.James and Anne have a town house in Chelsea and a comfortable former vicarage in Buckinghamshire. Anne is some years younger but they are childless. Outwardly they seem happy but James one of nature's moralists unusual for a city lawyer is a control freak. Just down the road is the aristocratic the Hon. William Buel who is not one for middleclass morality and he is more than happy to take advantage. But there's a complication a road accident in which an elderly cyclist is knocked over in a country lane by a ruthlessly driven Range Rover just like the Hon. Bill's. Soon James Anne Bill and the victim's widow who happens to be James' and Anne's cleaner are drawn in to a conspiracy to conceal what really happened. The primary focus is on the corrosive effect of all this on James and Anne's relationship.The third person in this mnage a trios Bill is played by Rupert Everett. From the point of view of casting his languid superior manner is right for the part yet somehow he doesn't quite get there. Partly this is because he is supposed to be sick for some of the time and he looks well when he is supposed to be sick and viceversa. The part seems underdeveloped. It is interesting that John Neville as Bill's father who has only one significant scene manages to establish his character beautifully in the time he has.The world of five star hotels and superior restaurants is nicely evoked. As Julian Fellowes says in the audio commentary these people are able to convince themselves that the Edwardian age still exists. At bottom though the film is about what draws a couple together and what tears them apart. Nigel Balchin was going through a marriage breakup when he wrote the book and Fellowes has made a good fist of conveying the atmosphere. As he says his is a fairly free adaptation but the central theme is the same.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nigel Balchin's mazelike novel 'A Way Through the Wood' has been adapted by Julian Fellowes who also directs this 'terribly British' drawing room suspense piece. It is a film whose effect relies on the cast portraying the varyingly benignmalignant characters and it is here that Fellowes' directorial choices are superb. The story has a linear line that is easy to follow but the beauty of the film is the metamorphosis of each player as a single incident ignites a minefield of disasters.James Manning Tom Wilkinson is a successful business obsessed solicitor in London married to Anne Emily Watson who needs more in her life the couple being childless live in the country in a beautiful estate assisted by their long term 'cleaner' Maggie Linda Bassett. They attend social outings and meet among others William Bule Rupert Everett the passively lazy wealthy neighbor. Anne decides they should entertain their neighbors and against gruff James' protestation Anne proceeds with planning James arranges to 'not attend due to business'. On the night of the party there is a hit and run accident in which Maggie's husband is accidentally killed by someone in a Range Rover she observed. When James returns home he sees a scratch on William's Range Rover and suspects William to be the perpetrator. Anne discourages James from going to the police with the information 'what possible good can it do but ruin Bill's life as a socialite and father and son of an important scion?'. From this first 'lie' the virus spreads James confronts Bill who talks James out of going to the police Anne confesses it was she who was driving Bill's Rover and is the one responsible James convinces Anne to keep it quiet because it would ruin his reputation Anne confesses she is having an affair with Bill and the three of them concur that they will stick together on their big lie for the sake of the greater good. Anne eventually succumbs to the guilt of not telling her beloved Maggie that she is the one responsible and Maggie herself guilty of a previous theft whose life was saved by Anne's mercy to hire her anyway is the agent who draws the story to its surprising conclusion. Lies begat lies that begat lies et cetera.The major impact of this intrigue is the manner in which the isolated tragedy impacts each of the characters involved. Each changes in a dramatic way. Tome Wilkinson gives the finest performance of a career filled with brilliant performances he is able to say more with his posture and facial expressions than about any actor before the audience today. Likewise the gifted Emily Watson adds yet another fine role to her repertoire as does the surprisingly smarmy Rupert Everett who despite being yet another wealthy British 'gentleman' gives us a man both arid of spirit and yet ultimately needy. And the alwaysfine Linda Bassett takes a small role and finesses it making her character quietly central to the chaotic web of lies.The cinematography by Tony PierceRoberts and the musical score by Stanislas Syrewicz add immeasurably to the multiple atmospheres the story encounters. This is ensemble playing at its finest which always means that the director Julian Fellowes has a fine grasp on the piece. The interplay of these fine people makes the dodgy story work very well indeed. Grady Harp".

I also liked his attention to detail and the subtle nuances of his actors notice his choice of location and props which are all a relevant part of the scenes. I must further add that the authentic locations are quite breathtaking.He has wisely chosen gifted actors like Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson to play the key roles. Wilkinson is at his best while the sublime Ms. Watson downplays her part with grace and complete ease. Hermione Norris has an effective presence. The always dependent Linda Bassett stands out. Rupert Everett looks a little awkward but is quite adequate.At first glance 'Separate Lies' may not appeal to all as it's quite easy to miss some of the important details and misinterpret the nuances of the actors. However on second viewing I was able to appreciate the film on a much deeper level. On an additional note the director's commentary is a brilliant bonus.

	schema:headline " Stiff Upper Lip Drawing Room Drama But Wilkinson is Dynamic";
	schema:reviewBody "Separate Lies is a veddy English take on Unfaithful and Crash crossed with a Ruth Rendell mystery about guilt and responsibility.The setting is very smoothly established of a highpowered solicitor who works in the City has a country house and an in town apartment and has everything ordered beautifully and under control including his wife. The surroundings completely capture the mood. A sense of portent and uneasiness is only introduced with fast flashbacks to a car accident until Emily Watson as the wife starts showing some out of place hairs and breath.The coincidences are a bit claustrophobically theatrical so that it almost feels like a stage play. For the first half the suspense and revelations keep our attention but then the film just ducks it all and deteriorates into relationships that are so civilized as to be devoid of emotion or reason. I haven't read the book so don't know if directoradapter Julian Fellowes changed it. This is the best Tom Wilkinson performance since In the Bedroom. He holds the film together. He's used so often in films to fulfill the stereotype of a selfsatisfied suburban or aristocratic executive that one forgets it can be done with subtlety and verve. This may be the first film that he gets to use so many four letter words with his own accent.Rupert Everett is so distant and even repellent to every one that it's hard to see his appeal that is critical to the plot. I kept thinking who else could have been cast for at least some magnetism. While it is amusing to see him as a Milord in casual jeans explained disdainfully that he's been living in America so long that he's practically become an American a line I've heard in a couple of other Brit movies lately.While we get a frisson of background on relationships that is supposed to help it's not enough. All the background and relationships are revealed off screen through talky explication. We certainly can't tell in terms of how people relate. We have to take revelations for their word for it. The injection of oldfashioned Movie Star's Disease makes the characters' interactions get even phonier. And then suddenly there's narration that's unnecessary and jarring. While there's flashes of some action and emotion this is drawing room drama. That stiff upper lip just gets plain annoying.There was probably some symbolic significance to a Paris interlude that included a rendezvous by the Guy de Maupassant statue but if so it was a long time coming for a not worth it punch line.There's an amusing inside joke of a character watching Monarch of the Glen on the TV as Fellowes was featured in that series.".

Outstanding performance as usual by Tom Wilkinson but good turns by all concerned including supporting actors Linda Bassett and John Neville. Our audience was engrossed by this film which includes a couple of shock incidents which really make you 'jump'. A good tight production at around only 80 minutes probably produced on a very limited budget but a success which should see Fellowes directing again for the big screen. Some publicity for the film seemed to suggest it was set in the 50s as per Nigel Balchin's novelbut obviously this is not the case. Recommended viewing.".

His mouth has become the center of attention and not the kind of attention one would expect. It belongs to the villain in a horror movie. I noticed that already in his comedy with Madonna.

Because some years ago Maggie had been convicted of stealing from her former employer the local milord. By hiring her Anne had restored Maggie to reputation dignity and a respectable place in the village community c. c and Maggie's gratitude goes far enough to forgive not only Anne's accidental killing of her husband but also her employers' repeated lies to her about it. As far as the movie tells us Maggie's forgiveness and complicity are freely offered and even forced upon a guiltridden unwilling Anne. Anne and James don't even have to write her a thumping cheque in compensation for her loss. It all seems implausibly Vera Drake for a story set in the present day.".

Directed by Julian Fellowes it's the story of a married couple James and Ann Manning where the husband Wilkinson believes he and his wife Watson are happy together. An accident near their house on the night they have a party brings the police around. It is a hit and run that killed their maid Maggie's Bassett husband. James becomes suspicious of a neighbor Bill Bule Everett when he sees some damage on his car. He confronts Bule who admits he did it and promises to go to the police the next day. When James arrives home Ann is angry that he is making such a big deal out of it and states that she was driving the car. Of course James then isn't so eager to rush to the police. She suggests that they call Bule and tell him their decision. Oh f Bule James says. Well that's just it Ann says. I am fing Bule. James' devastation is just the beginning in this wellcrafted drama. Without giving the plot away this is a good example of how gender switching changes a story. Example of what I mean Susan Smith drives her car into a lake and her children drown. She gets life in prison. What if the father had done it? The chair. You'd be surprised how often the outcome would be different. The same is true here  if it had been James having the affair and doing the subsequent activities viewers might feel differently about the story. If Ann were in James' place it would be shattering.

Rupert Everett as Bule is very effective  indolent uppity and ultimately in need. Everyone here is very civilized in their dealings with one another and no one is all good or all bad.There are separate lies  James that his marriage is happy Ann's as listed above  and there is one uniting lie  the accident about which all parties keep quiet.

Yet at the heart of it all each character maintains a streak of decency  moral conscience held up in spite of obvious contradictions. Contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life. How true these words are. Watson's Anne Manning is at the core of this intrigue  she's the central conscience that the other three latched on. She is the decency undeterred. The circumstances of lies are to each its own one to defend one's professional name one to hold back due to familypartner pressure one simply don't want to face the consequence one ironically can't believe the truth and lies to save friendship. These are all precarious situations. There lies the intrigue  fascinating to watch how each tackles truth and lies. Contradictions indeed. In spite of the seeming dishonor decency and heart remain strong. The treatment of the subject involved and how each of the character behaves are masterfully delivered simple with clarity. It's not sensational or complex as another film Where the Truth Lies 2005. Credits due to Fellowes' writing and the nuanced performances of both Watson and Wilkinson. There is warmth somehow that comes through the seemingly boldface or frustratingly hidden lies. Beneath it all human frailty not excluded they meant well. And following along with the story the turn of events provided satisfaction and smiles to how the two Manning's seem to have grown and matured in their relationship. You might say there's no obvious action drama or thrilling scenes in Separate Lies yet the intrigue is there and it will hold your attention. The deserving production efforts include cinematography by Tony PierceRoberts a veteran to the MerchantIvory films and music by Stanislas Syrewicz with mood and tone reminiscent of composer Zbignew Priesner of filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski's Trois Couleurs especially Bleu 1993. This is a British film you just might not want to miss.

James associates the scratch on the car of his acquaintance Bill Bule Rupert Everett with the accident and forces him to confess and promise to go to the police on the next morning. When he arrives home Anne tells him that she was driving the car further Bill is her lover. James changes his opinion and decides to support the lie while a persistent detective is investigating the case and the list of guests.Separate Lies is not a bad movie but the behaviors and the way of life of the characters are too British at least follow the stereotype. It is almost unbelievable the way and fairplay that James Manning accepts his situation of cuckold no matter how much he loved his wife. Further he lies what would be unacceptable for his ethical standards and rules of living. Anne Manning is a real bitch betraying a man that loves her for a crook. I cannot see this story with Italian Brazilian or any other Latin people. In the end the truth the betrayal the corruption the moral are blurred in a hypocrite dirty lie. My vote is six.Title Brazil Mentiras Sinceras Sincere Lies".

James associates the scratch on the car of his acquaintance Bill Bule Rupert Everett with the accident and forces him to confess and promise to go to the police on the next morning. When he arrives home Anne tells him that she was driving the car further Bill is her lover. James changes his opinion and decides to support the lie while a persistent detective is investigating the case and the list of guests.Separate Lies is not a bad movie but the behaviors and the way of life of the characters are too British at least follow the stereotype. It is almost unbelievable the way and fairplay that James Manning accepts his situation of cuckold no matter how much he loved his wife. Further he lies what would be unacceptable for his ethical standards and rules of living. Anne Manning is a real bitch betraying a man that loves her for a crook. I cannot see this story with Italian Brazilian or any other Latin people. In the end the truth the betrayal the corruption the moral are blurred in a hypocrite dirty lie. My vote is six.Title Brazil Mentiras Sinceras Sincere Lies";

Maybe you ignore your loved ones' lies. That can wear a lot of people out. American movies on this theme are abundant but they usually go much further by involving the use of firearms which are not a part of everyday life here in Europe.

In my eyes a suspense thriller for British movies is like something out of a Ruth Rendell novel something that has a lot of dark twist and turns and leaves the viewer with an ending that is unlikely to be forgotten anytime soon.This movie started out with the promising note of being such a film. We have our main character that suspects a man that he does not like of being involved in a hit and run that killed the husband of one of his servants.His notions prove to be right but the idea that his wife might be involved does not occur to him until that she confesses to him that she was a part of the crime.The elements of a good suspense thriller were in place at this point but from there I felt that the film took a different direction and became almost some sort of a mild soap opera about who wants to be with who and what the love of a real relationship is. The film might have been enjoyable to me if the outside box had talked of a twisted lover's triangle and had not been labeled as suspense thriller.This seemed to be more of a soap opera story and the beginning setting seemed to be a mild distraction to the true content of the film. I felt like this film could have done a whole lot better than it did. I felt like it kept leading the viewer up to a big event that never materialized. So I have to give it a lower rating than I would have liked to and say that it fell short of my expectations.".

The incident an accidental hitandrun killing of an elderly neighbor man on a bicycle unleashes behaviors of the major players in the movie. They are the wife Anne who is the driver and who causes the death of the bicyclist. Her husband played by Tom Wilkerson a notparticularlyattractive middle aged London solicitor. A playboy who is the secret lover of Anne and who was in the car with her when she ran into the bicyclist. And Anne's maid an older woman who was the wife of the killed bicyclist.The gist of the movie is that the husband learns eventually that the hitandrun driver was his wife Anne who is also having an affair with the playboy. Both Anne and the playboy have mixed feelings about owning up to the police that she caused the man's death. But after discussing things with Anne's husband as well as the maid it was decided that Anne should not be punished for the accident and each character then lies to the police to save Anne.Anne although the culprit controls each of the other characters. Her husband loves her even after being told of her affair and even after she ultimately leaves him to be with the playboy when he succumbs to cancer.The playboy loves her and was even willing to tell the police that he was the driver not her so she could remain unpunished. The playboy's father loves her and tells the husband that through her love his son's life was extended to 15 months instead of a matter of weeks as the doctors forecast.And finally the maid loves Anne because Anne hired her even though she had previously been incarcerated for shoplifting from a previous employer.Yet I am writing this review because I am flabbergasted by the overvaluing of Anne by the others. This woman Anne first causes another's death not merely through negligence which might be bad enough but by driving wildly through the London streets without having a care in the world about how her idlike behavior might harm another. When it does she continues in her mememeandonlyme attitude by continuing her wild and crazy driving rather than be stopping to render aid.Everyone on Earth has a duty to not cause physical harm to others. This woman causes another's death fails to stop and render aid or even check on the injured cyclist and later continues to exhibit her wild driving giddyasaschoolgirl because she's found a carefree lover. So why is everyone lie and go to extraordinary lengths to protect this woman who couldn't care less about anyone but herself? She dumps her husband who has always loved her. She later dumps the lover to return to the husband merely for convenience. And she cares so little for the maid that she kills her husband through willfully speeding and driving erratically and not even bothering to help him after she's knocked him off his bike. This woman is in essence all id. She has few deep loving qualities but loads of superficial ones. She is therefore way overvalued as I see it. And the movie correspondingly is way off.".

The too brief scenes in which he portrays a languid infinitely entitled worthless son of a rich Lord are spoton and entertaining. But for a love triangle there was remarkably little chemistry to speak of between anyone. The music was annoyingly movieoftheweek quality and the voiceover jarring and totally unnecessary. Clearly the work of a firsttime director with a small budget who either lacked or didn't sufficiently heed good advice. Too bad.I can appreciate how the people you kind of hate at the beginning are the ones you kind of like at the end and viceversa so there is some sort of character arc at least in terms of perception. For example Watson's character while refreshingly honest to her husband about her feelings for another man began to grate on me near the end particularly when she announced to her husband that she simply had absolutely no control over her actions and later when she simply declared that she would be moving back into their marital flat with no asking of permission no apologies offered. And I went from disliking Wilkinson's control freak  moral relativist character to sort of understanding him and not really wanting him to change unlike his wife.This movie awkwardly morphed from a whodunit to a Love Story or Steel Magnolias illness drama without sufficiently informing me of the fact so I was left distractedly guessing what the next plot twist might be long after they had all been revealed Was it the Lord driving the car? The Lord's dog?. The scene where the Lord visits Wilkinson and relates how brave Watson is the bestest nurse any dying boyfriend could ever ask for Florence Nightingale incarnate etc. was OK until he started overthetop sobbing like a baby. Good God! If you ask me she's just another flitty rich person with way too much time on her hands and so she drives her hard working well providing spouse crazy with unnecessary drama. Her screwing around was just another way to occupy her empty life the dying guy thing was an added bonus for her as it somehow made her previous actions completely above reproach.Look everyone would have been better off if Wilkinson had just left her for his secretary who seemed to appreciate him for who he was. Instead he acted like an abused dog his open craving for his wife's affection increasing with every kick she gives him. I'm not anti PC or anything it just didn't ring true even after taking into account all of the harsh realities of middle age we all tend to face. The ending for me was and not the director's intention I am certain depressing. The movie spent the last 80 minutes convincing me that these two people just don't belong together so I found no joy in the promise of their relationship continuing. I'm not above wanting my emotions manipulated by a story it just has to be somewhat plausible and not hackneyed. Is that asking too much?My score 410".

	schema:reviewBody "The basic genre is a thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menageatrois. Fellowes has tried to make a lot more out of this using the lies of the title in order to bring about all manner of small twists invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audience.It's really rather messy though. Fellowes doesn't seem interested presenting the thriller elements in a fashion that will keep us seatedged. Rather his focus is on the moral predicaments themselves.The dialogue is inconsistent stagey here vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional clichlandmine. Though there is no fussing over the locations so that the actors can get on with existing in their space the dreadful score can't create a further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of given set pieces. There's also a very prosaic dare I say it British feel to the filming. I didn't want to see a document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation I wanted to see some sort of artful recounting of the story.Finally it is in fact the story which lets the rest down. Just as the elements of suspense are rather flat so the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes woven as a vehicle for character examination. Wilkinson and Watson support this metaessay with good performances and John Warnaby's ebullient colleague Simon to Wilkinson is a welcome foil for much of the browfurrowing.I'm disappointed not that it's bad but that it could have been much better. 310".

Fellowes has tried to make a lot more out of this using the lies of the title in order to bring about all manner of small twists invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audience.It's really rather messy though. Fellowes doesn't seem interested presenting the thriller elements in a fashion that will keep us seatedged. Rather his focus is on the moral predicaments themselves.The dialogue is inconsistent stagey here vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional clichlandmine. Though there is no fussing over the locations so that the actors can get on with existing in their space the dreadful score can't create a further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of given set pieces. There's also a very prosaic dare I say it British feel to the filming. I didn't want to see a document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation I wanted to see some sort of artful recounting of the story.Finally it is in fact the story which lets the rest down. Just as the elements of suspense are rather flat so the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes woven as a vehicle for character examination. Wilkinson and Watson support this metaessay with good performances and John Warnaby's ebullient colleague Simon to Wilkinson is a welcome foil for much of the browfurrowing.I'm disappointed not that it's bad but that it could have been much better. 310";

The humour is at times quite subtle at other times blatantly in your face  and often crossing the border to offensiveness. To give an example in the postcoital chitchat with a prostitute our hero Max Mller encourages her to reveal who was responsible for a recent murder using the words Schiess los!. Literally this phrase means Shoot! in German and that is exactly what a hidden assassin does in response. In other words  this beautiful lady was sacrificed for a pun.Mllers Bro is also one of the very rare examples of films with funny sex scenes. Larry's romance is accompanied by the song Ich will mehr I want more  while the song perfectly underpins the action the meaning of its words changes a couple of times hinting at the end at Larry's inability of providing any further service. The film's main love scene between Max Mller and Bettina Kant lacks such subtlety  this is jawdropping stuff especially when Bettina's singing slowly transgresses into moaning of course all in the rhythm of the music.Unmissable unless you are one of the easily offended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mllers Bro or Mller's Office is an Austrian Germanlanguage movie from 1986 which means it has its 30th anniversary this year. The writer and one of the directors is the late Niki List who also plays a supporting role in this one. There is no denying that this film is a pretty creative work. But I must still say that the longer the film goes the less I liked it. The suspense and music and story as a whole only works for so long. and everything over an hour especially 105 minutes may have been far too long for this one to be a success. List was at the age of 30 here approximately and it was still early in his career but he wasn't a rookie either. The cast includes actors Schmidt and Vitasek who are still known today in Austria in particular and the central female character still only supporting is played by the late Barbara Rudnik. Her presence adds a nice touch of film noir to the film and this is definitely one of many genres and areas that this film is about and even sometimes pays tribute too. So yeah there is a whole lot in this film and you will probably recognize something new every time you check it out but this doesn't mean it is a good movies. Laack of focus has destroyed many films and this is one of them. It's perfectly fine how absurd and surreal the movie is on many occasions even if it goes so strongly against realism more and more the longer it goes.But the characters and eventually also the story become pretty stupid eventually and all the good premise from early on is sacrificed for this overthetop approach. I also think the music gets a lot worse during the film. Early on it is pretty great. The acting is mediocre maybe but this film never was about performances anyway. I myself wish I could give this one a thumbsup but there is just no way. However I can see why it is still famous because it is such a different film and nothing you'd expect in an Austrian film from the mid1980s. Different is not good though in this very case. Watch something else instead.".

The remaining two baddies then begin the systematic destruction of everything these poor schmoes hold dear including their fastdwindling sanity. Phaedra Video's DVD sleeve features a critic quote calling the film A paranoid street crime freakout! or some such and the term more than applies here. Brooding tense very violent and lowkey but still pretty slick shot largely at night with many deliberately vague moments and character motivations that keep the audience guessing right along with the besieged protagonists who to some degree deserve everything they get!. I give it a 10.";

	schema:headline " A bad night for 3 Japanese guys turns into a good movie for everybody else";
	schema:reviewBody "This Japanese film takes the sort of noirish 80s thriller that might have starred Michael Douglas or William Hurt and blends it with some hyperviolence and sociological alienation. Believe me it's a lot better than that sounds.Three friends who work at a Tokyo advertising agency are out at a bar one night when they run into a trio of icy strangers at the next table. A fight almost breaks out right there and the three strangers later beat the snot out of the timid Konishi Hideo Nakano. The hotheaded Nanbu Riki Tekeuchi wants to get revenge but after a futile attempt to track down the strangers the repressed Taki Masaya Kato talks him into letting it go. However when the run into one of the strangers alone in a tunnel the three friends beat the holy hell out of him in revenge. Rather than end things Taki Nanbu and Konishi find themselves targeted by the strangers for death. At first the three friends think they've accidentally tangled with Yakuza Japanese gangsters. Then they suspect the cold deadly trio are actually cops. It turns out they're something even worse and none of the friends may survive.Nobody is a quiet creepy and stylish little foreign film. It's a bit minimalist when it comes to dialog and relies a lot on long meaningful stares but it keeps you on your toes and never sure what's going to happen next. There are a couple of twists at the end that seem to belong in some other movie and there are certain moments that don't resonate in American culture they way they must have in Japan. Quibbles aside this story about what happens when ordinary life turns out not to be so ordinary will grab and hold your attention all the way until the end.The acting is also quite good for an Asianlanguage film. Not that acting in Asian movies is typically bad but it often has a different emotional rhythm and cadence that can be off putting to Western viewers. That's not the case with Nobody. Taki Nanbu and Konishi are very relatable both in normal situations and when their lives take a turn for the brutally unusual. Konishi is the quiet somewhat wimpy friend who tags along. Nanbu is the macho friend who's still somewhat adolescent in his attitude and outlook. Taki is the friend who sort of straddles the middle between the two extremes. Without him Nanbu and Konishi probably couldn't stand each other but without them Taki would probably lead a dull colorless existence.Nobody isn't a martial arts flick and it's not some art house film. It's the Japanese version of psychological suspense the sort of thing Brian De Palma did pretty well before his talent seemed to evaporate on him. Unless you have a deep aversion to subtitles I think it's worth a look.".

	schema:reviewBody "Death Wish 3 is the year of Rambo one of my all time favorite classic action films from Charles Bronson and it is really underrated. I love good action movies and I love the third sequel way better than the original! Charles Bronson is the best in this movie! I watched this movie more as a kid than the first two movies. I love this movie to death I have it on Bluray and I have a VHS tape still. There are a lot of people who hate this movie like actor Alex Winter mentioned it is one of the worst movies made in the 80's from Cannon I disagree. Charles Bronson was disappointed with the film I wasn't. This movie it is not for everyone it is more for action junkies like my self it is for fun and entertaining.To you this is underrated misunderstood prototypical good action movie  intense violent gang war on a streets perfectly executed original action shown to the tune of a forgettable and occasionally insulting story.This movie was filmed the same year as Rambo First Blood Part II and honestly Charles Bronson is Rambo in the urban jungle defending innocents on the street and fight evil in New York City. New York a city pushed to edge people pushed to the limit and no one's got the guts to stop them. But there is one way one man who want be pushed Charles Bronson and now he is in the middle of a war. In a world gone mad there is only one law is Charles Bronson Death wish 3! Bronson is back in New York bringing justice to the streets... Death Wish 3.1985 sequel Paul Kersey aka The Vigilante finds himself battling street punks in order to bring peace back to a once quiet New York neighborhood. Despite the New York setting the film was actually made in England.It's blisteringly fast paced brutally violent the characters from the cops to the punks to the citizens do overthetop unrealistically illegal things that they would all be arrested for in real life but go unnoticed in the world of the film and the whole movie has a goforbroke feel.I love The character development Paul Kersey is a hero in this movie helps defends old people and week people who can't defend them self's.Kersey buys an ice cream to a kid he shots and fights off the rapists twice in this movie. He supports and stands by Rodriguez site when his wife is raped and murdered.There is a war on the streets with punks and gang territories. I wish they would make movies like this today I really do wish that.The acting decent from everyone but a lot of the fashion is hilariously 80's. There's nothing too disturbing in this movie so the tone is lighter than the first two films. It's also well paced and moves along quickly no need for character development just shoot the baddies! Charles Bronson does amazing job playing his character I really do miss him. Deborah Raffin did a great job and she was really cute and likable in this movie. Martin Balsam as Bennett was beautiful at acting. Gavan O'Herlihy is really perfectly bad guy I really get to hate him and you wish he will be die already. Ed Lauter as Richard Shriker is a good cop who becomes Charles Bronson's alley.The script and the plot is alright and there is plenty action we have a lot of guns and automatic weapons and they are been used well.Paul Kersey and his neighbor Rodriguez use a Browning M1919 machine gun to kill several gang members before it runs out of ammo. Paul looks with the machine gun like Rambo in the 80's the jungle streets. Both the Browning 1919 and MG42 belonged to Kersey's late Korean War buddy Charley who apparently acquired the weapons during his stint in the Military.Paul Kersey's Charles Bronson uses Wildey Hunter with an 8 barrel in the movie in real life the gun was Bronson's personal pistol.I love the music score by Jimmy Page and I really love all the characters in here.10. years ago I wrote Murphy's Law is Charles Bronson best movie but my personal favorite Charles Bronson movie will always be Death Wish 3.Michael Winner did really good job directing his third and final Death Wish movie.Paul Kersey uses a rocket launcher M72 LAW and blows Fraker in to pieces and bringing justice to the streets once again.Death Wish 3 is a 1985 American action film starring Charles Bronson as vigilante killer Paul Kersey and is the third film in the Death Wish film series. It was written by Don Jakoby under the pseudonym Michael Edmonds. This is the last Death Wish film to be directed by Michael Winner.R.I.P. Charles Bronson Michael Winner Deborah Raffin Ed Lauter Martin Balsam Ron Hayes John Gabriel Mildred Shay Menahem Golan rest in peace I really miss you all and I enjoy Death Wish 3 to death. 1010 my favorite childhood classic action film I love it more than the original.".

I must have watched this movie dozens of times yet each time it is just as ridiculously funny. From the outset the movie explodes with laughs. Kersey's trip to jail where he is threatened by some thug who apparently high on goof balls decides to attack the most giant guy in the jail for no reason and is bloodily beaten down. At this point he turns back to Kersey and curses him like it is his fault! Make no sense? Don't let that stop you there is more where that came from. Next the police inspector beating Kersey up then abruptly out of nowhere saying you see I'm a big fan of yours'! . There are so many other hilarious plot inconsistencies. Mr.Kaprov saying Mr.Kersey it's 90 degrees outside!' as he is wearing a full shirt and thick sweater! Or Kersey's friend Charlie who somehow managed to smuggle back two massive machine guns from Korea. Did he take that in his carryon luggage on the trip back? Add to all this lame romance that Kersey and the public defender have and you have the making of a masterpiece. For whatever reason the desperate woman wants a date with Kersey. The romance that ensues is epic until unfortunately like all women that Kersey dates she is horribly killed.  The final piece of the puzzle is some of the best one liners in any movie. Some include it's your wife she is sick or... something' Fraker bulletproof just like yours asshole' Fraker they call him the giggler he laughs when he runs' Bennet I'll kill a little old lady for you. Catch it on the 6 o'clock news! Fraker. I could go on and on. You owe it to yourself to rent this extraordinary film. Truly one of the greatest ever made!".

	schema:reviewBody "I think it definitely is. The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language should model their conversations after its dialogue. For example the exchange between Paul KerseyBronson and Ms. Kathryn DavisDeborah Raffin more about this character later is extremely clear and to the point Ms. Davis says I hope you like chicken. It's the only thing I know how to make to which Kersey deftly responds Chicken's good. I like chicken. If that's not English Grammar 101 I don't know what is.Another thing about this Ms. Davis character Kersey sleeps with her on the second date after she practically throws herself at him and tells him she wants to see him one last timethis being only the fourth time they've ever met before she moves to her sister's house in BinghamtonNY to get away from the creeps then he really doesn't even bat an eye while her corpse is burning in the street only minutes later. Kersey never even says her first name through the entirety of the film. Not once. Never a Get over here Katy or a That's a nice dress you wearing Kathryn or a Be careful Katie or the creeps'll get ya!And while this 'love' is developing between the two FrakerGavan O'Herlihy keeps his everwatchful eyes on them. It's almost as if Kersey is using her as bait to get to Fraker much as he uses the camera or the car. Sure enough when Fraker bites Kersey bites back hard...in the most incredible sequence of events ever caught on film! The final fifteen or so minutes are possibly rivaled only by the final thirty minutes of Delta Force in their brilliance. And that's giving Delta Force a lot of credit. In what other film can you see Ed Lauter take out Alex Winter in order to get Charles Bronson's back a troubled gang leader seemingly calling a hotline to summon neonazi bikers to come to his aid and nimble Broadway dancers wearing mesh haltertops posing as street punks all laid down to a soundtrack written by none other than Jimmy Page. If that's not the highest of high comedy then nothing is funny.Truthfully speaking there are a thousand ways to state the unintentional comedy of Death Wish 3 but the only way to truly understand it is to watch it and judge for yourself.".

Why bother with laws why bother with a constitution and why bother with a police force  they only get in the way. What you really need to keep the streets safe is a big gunand lots of bulletsand maybe a machine gun and perhaps a rocket launcher too. Because hey if those liberal pinkos have their way there will only be anarchy.Paul Kersey's day starts off really badly. Not only do synthesisers weeping saxophones twangy guitars and a smarmy piano accompany his trip to New York but by the time he gets there his best mate has been killed. How unlucky can you get? Well to make matters worse one of the people that kills his best mate is Bill S. Preston Esq. Oh and when he gets there just as his friend is dying in his arms he gets arrested for his murder. Damn. But then after getting beaten up by the police ramming a fat porker's bulbous head through prison bars and enraging the head of a local gang he gets unofficial approval from the stupid chief to go on a one man killing rampagewhich is nice.Death Wish 3 is a guilty pleasure. After all it's dumb it's fascistic and it's badly filmed but a number of people greater than the population of San Marino get brutally killed so it rules. I mean how can you not dig a film where people are set on fire thrown off buildings and shot at point blank range with a rocket launcher? Anyone with a penis should enjoy this. So if you don't like it you're probably either a woman or Dale Winton.Where do I start when it comes to the best death in Death Wish 3? The rocket launcher killing is a classic but the firebombing is probably even better  the punks firebomb the flat of an elderly couple and they come running out in flames and then get mowed down with Uzis. But then there's death by broom and all the machine gun slayings. However I also dig the bit when a bunch of bikers in leather daddy gear get blasted to pieces by a bunch of disgruntled neighbourhood residents. An armed society is a polite society.But this praise for other characters takes away from the Bronsoninator's contribution. Never before has one man killed so many people. He mows down punks with his mate's Browning and then he blows them away with his unfeasibly huge Magnum  normally I'd suggest that Bronson was making up for certain shortcomings but there's no way the man wasn't hung. And it's his Magnum technique that impresses most. He can dodge a hail of bullets simply by slowly crouching down on one knee. Genius! And then there are the people he kills. One man who's trying to rape a black woman is the spitting image of Freddie Mercury. Another who he throws off a roof is Frost out of Aliens. And he even kills The Giggler! They killed The Giggler man! They killed The Giggler! But perhaps the best Bronson killing is the one where he coolly kills a couple of punks who are trying to nick his car. At the time he's having dinner with a Jewish couple but he politely excuses himself shoots the punks and finishes his grub. What a gentleman.But it's not all fun and games. Bronson's lady gets killed. But the woman should have known better. Any woman that gets close to the Bronsoninator is immediately doomed. It's the James Bond rule. I mean we can't have our bloodthirsty heroes suddenly become happy and content can we? So she has to die. And at least she goes out in style. She gets a headbutt for her troubles and then succumbs in a car crash. Of course just in case she might survive the car spontaneously blows up. You've got to make sure.Not that any of this seems to bother Bronson. He merely goes along with his bloodthirsty rampage squinting at the targets he's going to blow into bloody pieces. And what of his targets? Well the gang he takes on is isn't especially formidable. In fact they're rather camp. They wear bandanas headbands string vests fingerless gloves sleeveless shirts leather jackets chain belts lots of studs and one even wears a cute little cut off vest so that he can show off his rock hard abs. Actually now that I think about it they dress and prance like a bunch of failed Fame auditionees. Perhaps that's why they're so mad. They just want to be in a chorus line but they can't get a gig. Maybe that's why they kidnap rape and kill the Mexican lady. They want to get their own back on any tang they can get their hands on. The way they emerge from their hiding place  the bushes of course  certainly suggests this. They leap out like cokedup ballerinas. But they all get brutally killed so their Broadway ambitions go unfulfilled.But hey who cares about the punks? Not I. Indeed Death Wish 3 has made me see the light. All we need to keep the streets safe are viscous vigilantes dispensing their wonderful brand of arbitrary justice. Only then will we be free from the tyranny of punks hoods and lowlifes. I never knew that a Jewish food critic could be so delightfully fascist.".

Bronson at least the older version is truly at his best.I'm not saying DEATH WISH 3 is a classic. Indeed to the discriminating eye it has a plethora of imperfections. The characters are generally made of cardboard. The violence is over the top. A man well into his 60s outruns and outspooks dozens of young punks. But in the tradition of the original DEATH WISH and later films such as FALLING DOWN with Michael Douglas it has a definite crowdpleasing charm. Who doesn't want to see gangbangers get their due? There are also some great cheesy moments and oneliners so common in 1980s films. When a tenant of his apartment building sees Kersey setting up a booby trap for instance the vigilante lightheartedly says he's thinning the herd. A line only Bronson can truly make work.So you see the key to enjoying DEATH WISH 3 is to accept it for what it is. It ain't Spielberg and it ain't art.

All sense goes out the window and the angry vigilante's original reasons for revenge fade slowly into the bulletridden background.You get exploded thugs burning cars bodies through glass dozens of bulletriddled corpses and a lurid directing style that is perfect for the material.Not as fine as DEATH WISH 2 but fine nevertheless.";

In my opinion this is the best Death Wish movie. Tons of nonstop action! And keeping with the classic 80's bad guy vs good guy movie  this movie is about anything but the norm and all about guns and CREEPS! We see Bronson mowing down thugs and CREEPS with a 30 caliber Korean War heavy machine gun! A HEAVY MACHINE GUN FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! When Charlie runs out of ammo for the Heavy Machine gun he runs back to his crib and takes up arms with his long range high caliber pistol! This pistol can stop a freakin ELEPHANT and Charlie is putting holes the size of hub caps into bad guys with it! And if that is not enough Charlie is also packing an anti tank grenade launcher which by the way is only good if he can get the CREEPS clumped together.The acting in this movie is ha ha great and a lot of off the wall actors mainly playing CREEPS appear throughout the movie! The film is loaded with memorable one liners and scenes! Heck my favorite sceneline is where the CREEP leader confronts Broson in Jail and calmly explains to him Tell you what I am going to do ...I'm gonna kill a little old lady ...just for you! ...catch it on the six o'clock news.Is this film violent? Heck yes! But you'll laugh and cringe all the way through!!!!".

I do so love the violence when the East New York neighborhood awakes and throws off the rule of punks.After roaming the streets of New York in the first film and going back to Los Angeles in the second Charles Bronson as the legendary urban vigilante Paul Kersey returns to New York to visit an old friend who is found murdered. He's questioned but let go but the police captain of the beleaguered 75th precinct which in real life does include the East New York area of Brooklyn Ed Lauter let's him go with a promise to unofficially do his vigilante thing in that neighborhood. It's getting so that the punks are seriously challenging the citizens in population growth.Back in the day the East New York area was this middle class neighborhood of homes and churches that so typified Brooklyn. It became a prime example of urban decay. I well recall a local Assemblyman Vito P. Battista who also ran for Mayor of New York several times declaring that it looked like London after the Blitz. Vito wasn't far wrong. And that is the real East New York you are seeing lots of blocks of abandoned buildings and empty lots.As in all Death Wish 3 films Bronson gets himself a woman and it's her death that galvanizes him into action. In this case it's Deborah Raffin who the punks set up in a fiery car crash. That last half hour of Death Wish 3 is an urban fantasy when the whole neighborhood becomes a battleground as Bronson leads an aroused populace to clean up the neighborhood. Can't describe it you've got to see it to believe it. More urban slime gets eradicated here than in all the other Death Wish films put together.You have to see Death Wish 3 it's trashy it's one of the most politically incorrect films ever made and great fun.".

	schema:headline " This Movie is a good definition of over the top";
	schema:reviewBody "By the time the third Death Wish movie came out in 1985 a basic formula was in place which varied little from the second Death Wish movie onward. First Charles Bronson's character Paul Kersey would have a relative or close friend murdered by street scum. Further mayhem would befall ancillary characters so as to goad Kersey into a righteous killing frenzy. One significant variation that this formula allowed is that in each succeeding movie the weaponry Kersey will use to blow away assorted miscreants will get more and more elaborate. From the hand pistol Kersey used in the first Death Wish movie we now get enormous elephantine hand guns that could actually kill a real elephant as well WWII Browning machine guns as well as grenade launchers by the third film. Also the criminals Kersey is up against aren't just assorted street punks as in the first Death Wish film but now a criminal army with enough firepower to take on the Iraqi insurgents in Baghdad.What is truly striking in the last 30 minutes of the movie is that with the mayhem going on the government didn't force the issue and send in the US Army to restore order as the Union Army did do in New York during the Draft Riots of 1863 while the Civil War was going on. Another priceless moment in the film is the ease with which Kersey is able to receive serious ordinance through the US mail. If it really was as easy as shown in the film Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations really missed an opportunity in arming themselves in the US.Like I said the film defines improbable to extremely unlikely. It's a revenge fantasy of truly baroque extremes and frankly enjoyable on that level. In the Death Wish world there is no moral ambiguity. There are good decent people and then there are street scum. Here the street scum harass maim and kill the decent and the police are oddly helpless. Even though the criminals are dressed so garishly and distinctively from the characters who are good and decent no one seems able to obtain any evidence against them. So the only solution is just to shoot them dead. It's nice that the criminals in these films are all unredeemable psychopaths who dress quite distinctively so even a child could kill them with a clear conscienceas a few do in one of the many disturbing scenes at the end during the big shootout. In sum not total trash not really good fascistic in a really simpleminded way for a more complex profascistic perspective I recommend viewing the Depression political fantasy film Gabriel over the White House from 1933 that doesn't go beyond offering shooting street scum like turkeys as a way to solve crime but undeniably exciting.".

By the way this giggler is so fast that Bronson's regular pistol can't even catch up to him he needs to order a special one just to get this elusive creep. He gets cleaned up just so he can eat a REALLY smelly meal stuffed cabbage in a rat trap with a couple of old people who like to wear heavy clothing in 90 degree weather. He goes into the dentistry business. He always seems to find a crow bar when he needs one and its the same one!. And last but not least he always seems to have a rocket launcher at his disposal just in case he needs to blow away Richie Cunningham's older brother Chuck who is now strung out and in dire need of a makeover.

This movie doesn't take itself seriously because the filmmakers knew that all the social commentary that was necessary was put across in the first film. Golan and Globus made this film for Bronson fans not for the critics and it works.  DW3 has been unfairly criticized as trash and a weary entry in a worn out series.  These statements would be true if the film was made to be taken seriously or to spread a statement but it wasn't.  If you take it as what it is DW3 is just a fun action packed romp with Charlie doing to street punks what we all wish we could do.  The action is non stop the atmosphere is great and the movie is just out and out the best Bronson flick ever made.  You can tell that the penny pinching Cannon group spent a lot of money on this one.  It is believed that Bronson thought this film was too violent and that was the reason why Winner didn't direct any of the following entries.  I can understand his concern but as is always the case of sequels you have to push the envelope even further to pass a previous entry.  In any case this movie was no more violent than any other movie made during this time.  What makes DW3 the best of the series and my favorite film ever not the best just my favorite is the action Charlie's presence memorable villains and it's ability to get the viewers to jump on the bandwagon.  The first film may be the most technically well made but this one is the most fun.  For once Charlie actually has some clever lines although he doesn't say muchand a halfway interesting story photography action and direction to back him up.  Charlie has never been more intense or super cool than in this one.  Yes it's exploitive maybe it does promote stereotypes and maybe it is the same story as before but Bronson's films always have and always will stand for defending the common man and giving his audience what they want to see.  Many argue that the DW series manipulates its' audience my reply is that the movies don't manipulate us the fans are the ones in charge.  We demand that Bronson blow away deserving scum and in turn Winner and Co. deliver the goods.  And for those of you who still want to put it down remember a few things.  DW3 was the 1 movie in America when it came out and was among the viewing favorites of millions of people on video and television because they realize that not all films have to be epics they just have to be fun. 10 You can't get any better.

This is by far and way the best of the Death Wish series.The directing is superb particularly the scene with Charles and Ed Lauter patrolling the streets shooting punks to a funky 70's soundtrack.Winner builds up just the right amount of tension action humour and emotion at exactly the right moments. There is a high standard of acting on display here. Apart from Charles's flawless performance there is a career best from Ed Lauter here as the vigilante cop. The plot is superbly written the only drawback is it was too short! I hope they bring out a DVD version with extra scenes soon Best Bit Hard to choose there are so many classic scenes. Lookin for trouble ma'an? You'll know what I mean when you see the film Best Line Tell you what I'm gonna do. I'll kill a little old lady just for you. Catch it on the 6 o'clock news!".

	schema:headline " Reasons why this movie rules";
	schema:reviewBody "This simply wondrous work of pure celluloid art deserves much better than the usual synopsis and critique format. So instead I'm just going to list reasons why this picture rules. 1 Charles Bronson as the everunflappable Paul Kersey is the very epitome of stoic laconic and unflappable vigilante cool this guy not only kills countless lowlife criminal scum with a winning mix of style and ingenuity but also sports one hell of a snazzy mustache to boot. 2 The street gang featured in this flick is a pretty mean and colorful bunch Gavan O'Herlithy as vicious leader Fraker you just have to love his gnarly reverse Mohawk haircut a preBill and Ted Alex Winter as the sleazy Hermosa Ricco Ross as speedsnorting psycho Cuban and best of all the incredible Kirk Taylor as swift maniacal chortling klepto the Giggler. Moreover the gang is multiracial which enables the filmmakers to treat us to the touching and inspiring sight of various whites blacks and Hispanics gleefully engaging in rape murder robbery extortion destruction of private property and other such nocount nasty antics. 3 The dialogue is sheer cuttothebone terse and eloquent poetry. Martin Balsam as tough World War II veteran Bennett Cross bellows the following heartshattering lines as he watches his beloved place of business go down in flames My shop! My shop! That's my shop! 4 Deborah Raffin as feisty public defender Kathryn Davis supplies some mighty fetching eye candy. Alas after Raffin becomes romantically involved with Bronson the poor gal gets bumped off by the bad guys. Boy now isn't that a shocking and unexpected plot development? 5 This noholdsbarred fierce and unflinching flick declares open season on everyone pretty young women are raped including foxy future Star Trek The Next Generation TV series regular Marina Sirtis little old ladies are brutally butchered countless evil street slime are blown away folks are set on fire and Fraker even gets blasted into the next dimension with a rocket launcher. If raw savage and overthetop violence is your thing then this movie is your crack baby! 6 The acting is truly Oscarworthy. Special kudos here to Joseph Gonzalez as Rodriguez the scene with Gonzalez punching a table with tremendous angst and fury after he's told that his wife has just died is positively gutwrenching in its stark poignancy. 7 Bronson packs plenty of heavy artillery. Besides the aforementioned rocket launcher Charlie also uses a Wildey automatic and a vintage Browning machine gun to waste the villains left and right. 8 Legendary rock musician Jimmy Page whips up an exceptionally funkyjammin' jazzrock fusion score. 8 Director Michael Winner treats the laughably ludicrous material with deliriously misguided seriousness thereby ensuring that the cartoonish carnage rates as often sidesplitting and always entertaining high camp at its alltime most gloriously absurd and wildly implausible. The last third with the already cruddy urban cesspool neighborhood degenerating into an allout war zone is the hilarious stuff total kitsch is made of. A true 80's action masterpiece.".

Kersey gets accused of the murder when the police arrive and he sits in the cell for a while. Although the chief of police realises who he is and decides to let Kersey bring justice to this untamed part of town that they can't seem to control. So Kersey takes up residence in his late friend's apartment befriends those living there starts seeing the public defence attorney and goes to work to finally rid this neighbour of their outofcontrol mugs.Talk about overthetop! The first two films were searing thrillers that realistically exploited its leering material with scathing pot shots or gritty intensity. Instead this addition which would be director Michael Winner's final outing in the series goes for an allout action romp that's excessively cheesy and outrageously delirious. With that on mind. Most of the fun is to be had with this particular item of the franchise. The seriously dour nature of the earlier films don't really evolve within this one because Winner favoured more of a tongueincheek style of mayhem that basically parodies don't know if it was intentional though what he done before. Suspenseful thrills are replaced by bigot action looking for nothing more than a large body count. This really does let loose in the film's cracking climax where no one is safe from the colourfully cartoonish onslaught. What can one say? It's an urban jungle out there for some but Kersey sees it as a shooting parlour. And his well equipped carrying a Wilbur Mangum and holding onto a rocket launcher this time to take out the trash! Sadly though Charles Bronson is looking terribly downtrodden in the role. He might be sleepwalking it but what he brings to the table a resourceful character that you can't help but cheer on. Even though the feeble script doesn't emotionally pull you into his compassionate plight like the previous two. The contrived story is pretty much bare bones and very stereotypically like the multirace living in the apartment building who finally stand up for their rights as citizens plotted. The police really do get a touch up in their incompetence of how they do things and their lack of actions. It really does leave a sour taste in your mouth which I'm sure that's what it was aiming to do.While the obligatory romance subplot is beyond forced and only there to give Kersey more motivation when needed. An adorable Deborah Raffin plays Bronson's love interested but with her talent she's wasted in a throwaway part. Ed Lauter trumps in with a quality performance of the cutting hardnosed NY detective. Gavan O'Herlihy perfectly cooks up a storm in his nasty role as Fraker the gang leader. With features like his striking hairdo and coldstare he managed to reek of brute fear and be sufficient in leading the chaos. Making an appearance as one of the wild punks is a young Alex Winter who'll be best known for Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. The rest of the supporting cast are reasonable. Winner's direction is durably crafted and tautly laid out in its nobars framework to shove it in your face. Again for such a lesser sequel Winner makes it look reasonably up to par despite it being a flawed technical production. Although it is being set in NY it was basically shot in London. Its stays on a few locations and at times they come across as purely sets. An impressive array of camerawork is on the ball by John Stainer. Attached to the music score was Jimmy Page again. Instead of the sickening riffs presented in number 2. It's oozing with a more sweepingly funky and overpoweringly scorching rhythm.A different breed that might be considerably toned down in its rough exploitative nature but the gungho violence does run freely and you got Bronson walking the walk of death. For a quick fix you can't go wrong with ultrachaotic and downright brainless Death Wish 3.".

But in this one he used a variety of military grade weapons including the .475 Wildey Magnum surely one of the most iconic handguns ever which he made famous with this movie to this day he is featured very prominently on Wildey's website. He also used a beltfed Korean War era heavy machine gun and mail order rocket launcher among others!! Pure '80s takebackthestreets fantasy but it's oh so fun. New York was a virtual war zone in the '80s so the desire to simply blast the creeps and clean up the neighborhood was very attractive to many. Since you can't really do that just let Paul Kersey do it!! By all conventional means a terrible film but I love it! Between the comically stereotyped characters such as the cartoon gangsters the elderly Jewish couple etc and numerous cheesy lines there is no way to justify liking this other than pure BRONSON. Bronson's unflinching delivery is so simple and direct and he has no moral objection whatsoever for example to baiting two punks that were trying to steal his car into a deadly showdown which he wins of course.Highly recommended for Bronson fans!".

	schema:reviewBody "Now here's the thing the Death Wish series started out with a pretty good crime drama that didn't really have too much action and took itself pretty seriously. Charles Bronson was excellent and it was altogether a pretty decent movie. Then the 80s happened. This movie is nothing like that movie was for it has simply become a brainless 80s oneman army action BMovie. But that is just why I love this film so much. It's just plain awesome. Ridiculous and cheesy? Hell yeah. Completely over the top? Definitely. But a blast to watch? Oh yeah! It starts out with good ol' Paul Kersey visiting a friend in New York City only to arrive and find him dead with the police arriving and arresting him as a suspect. He is allowed to go free in exchange for one thing he must return to his old vigilante ways and clean out a neighborhood gang before they tear the city apart. After that the plot doesn't matter much it's the same as the rest of the Death Wish movies. But none of that matters. He moves into the neighborhood makes some allies gets some guns and from then on it's just senseless ridiculous violence. The film has a crazy high body count mercilessly killing easily over a hundred people He even kills the Giggler! He killed the Giggler! and the film just keeps getting steadily more violent until the ridiculously overthetop ending with the practically invincible Pail shredding his way through any and every member of the gang with weapons he bought by mail Where exactly do you order a militaryclass rocket launcher from anyway?. This movie is completely ridiculous and overtheto but I would recommend it to any action movie fan. Even if you can't enjoy it like I did you can always find ways to laugh at it's overall ridiculousness.".

Ridiculous and cheesy? Hell yeah. Completely over the top? Definitely. But a blast to watch? Oh yeah! It starts out with good ol' Paul Kersey visiting a friend in New York City only to arrive and find him dead with the police arriving and arresting him as a suspect. He is allowed to go free in exchange for one thing he must return to his old vigilante ways and clean out a neighborhood gang before they tear the city apart. After that the plot doesn't matter much it's the same as the rest of the Death Wish movies. But none of that matters. He moves into the neighborhood makes some allies gets some guns and from then on it's just senseless ridiculous violence. The film has a crazy high body count mercilessly killing easily over a hundred people He even kills the Giggler! He killed the Giggler! and the film just keeps getting steadily more violent until the ridiculously overthetop ending with the practically invincible Pail shredding his way through any and every member of the gang with weapons he bought by mail Where exactly do you order a militaryclass rocket launcher from anyway?. This movie is completely ridiculous and overtheto but I would recommend it to any action movie fan. Even if you can't enjoy it like I did you can always find ways to laugh at it's overall ridiculousness.";

It's hard to believe that Bronson is supposed to be the same character that he played 10 years earlier in the original classic Death Wish. In that movie he realistically became physically sick after murder while here he casually kills everyone with a heavy machine gun from the Korean war and a rocket launcher that he receives through the US mail! The total absurdity of the plot is absolutely incredible and the dialog is so bad that its hilarious 'Chicken's good. I like chicken.' But in what other movie could a man in his sixties successfully fight a war against a huge gang of Fame rejects and Nazi bikers without suffering any injury whatsoever? A woman half his age also desperately throws herself at him for some unknown reason and is promptly killed by spontaneously exploding cars. The movie also features Richie Cunningham's older brother as the evil nemesis a naked Lt. Troi from Star Trek and Bill taking some time away from his excellent adventure. All of this and a finale that's so outrageous that it has to be seen. A truly memorable masterpiece of a movie!".

The 'climax' is just a laugh riot. It's an all out war zone in New York full of explosions and total chaos...so ridiculous you can't help but chuckle at the sight of it. Other hilarious moments The scene with Kersey and the cop running side by side like 2 cowboys against the whole Wild West was so cheesy it was funny.It killed me how the bad guys could be shooting at Kersey and he could even drop down on one knee taking eversocareful and slow aim and not get hit LMAO. Of course with him it was one shotone kill with his elephant handgun LOL.Another hilarious scene was the end when he finally killed the leader of the gang....with a ROCKET LAUNCHER lol...destroying the whole side of the apartment building with it.It's apparent that Kersey is all but used to losing loved ones...when his new girlfriend is quickly disposed of after only a few dates. The acting is so bad that you can't blame anyone that could only think that Kersey is mad at the destruction of the car lol....he runs down looks at the carnage and just walks away.Again so bad it's good. out of  stars.".

Penicillin changed that but at the time of this film I think arsenic was the only cure and iffy at that with risk of death. See Out of Africa. Not well written or acted but historically interesting. They couldn't say syphilis but managed to get venereal disease and syphilitic past the censors. I also found it very interesting that an obviously partAfrican woman Diane Sinclair played a wealthy white woman who marries a white man! Since this was of course absolutely unheard of I can only guess that the fact she was foreign allowed her to be viewed as exotic and perhaps Indian rather than black. She would have been a good candidate to play Peola in Imitation of Life but Fredi Washington was a far better actress.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a typical early 1930s film warning about the dangers of unprotected sex and the diseases one can contract. The film was directed by Dwain Esper who made several films in this drama. The film involves a young executive with an important job and a long term girlfriend. His boss insists that he go out with him to a party and while out at the party he sleeps with a young wealthy woman and contracts syphilis from her. The girl is so upset that she commits suicide. He is convinced to go to a doctor played by Jason Robards father of Jason Robards Jr who displays poor people suffering from various infectious diseases. The young executive who out of guilt has married his girlfriend is upset when he finds out that his wife has syphilis too and that their baby might be infected. The wife in a state of depression tries to kill herself and her husband by opening the gas jets on the stove. There is a happy ending though.The film is entertaining and not quite as glum as it sounds. Played out in beautiful art deco sets and with above par acting for this type of film this public domain film available in VHS and DVD is worth seeing if only for its risqu subject matter.".

	schema:headline " Believe it or not this film handles STDs better than you'd expect from this sort of film!";
	schema:reviewBody "The DVD for this film is by Alpha Videoa company that almost always releases the poorest quality prints. In Alpha's defense often that is the only print available but the specialize in public domain and cheapo films. If you can find another print by a different company try it first as the print for this film is scratchy and faded. Still compared to most Alpha DVDs this one is excellentespecially since the sound is pretty clear and Alpha never seems to include closed captioningseven with films with horrid sound.A man has been dating a lady for a very long time. One night he's a bad boy and spends the night with another woman. Soon afterwords he comes clean to his fiance about this she forgives him and they marry.Very soon after the wedding he gets a frantic call from the other womanshe NEEDS to see him and has just tried to kill herself. When they meet he learns that she has an STD and she wanted him to know that he too might now have it. Then although there is a nurse there and they are treating her for the suicide attempt she somehow finds a gun and kills herself! The makes a HUGE mistake. He does not tell his doctor and he doesn't tell his new wife. Some time passes and now she and the baby are infected! At this point the doctor meets with the guy and tells him about the importance of getting treatment and they shows him rooms filled with horribly infected people actually these were just films of people with STDs that they spliced into the filmmost of whom have syphilis.In some ways the film is very progressive. It addresses a serious issue and it's interesting how the film encourages couples NOT to wait to get married but to marry fast and give in to those sexual urgesbut only with each other not bad advice at all. On the other hand the film never exactly says what it's talking about. They never use the terms STD VD or the like nor does it even name the diseases. Often it is referring to syphilis but at other times it's talking about herpes or other STDsthe information just isn't very clear or specifica VERY common problem with such films from this era. Audiences at the time must have felt quite confused about what they were seeing and many of the more naive probably needed to have some of their 'faster' friends explain it all to them! Speaking of such films in the 1930s50s lots of small and often sleazy production companies made films decrying the dangers of drugs and sex though often they really just wanted to promise a bit of cheesecake for audiences who usually could not see such racy fare in Hollywood films. Many of these are hysterically funny since they are so overdone and the information so inaccurate. The most famous examples are REEFER MADNESS and SEX MADNESS both by the same twobit production company and compared to how salacious and stupid those two films are this cheap film seems like it should be in the Criterion Collection!! Interestingly there are weirdos out there I would definitely be included among them that enjoy seeing the films because they are often so bad and so horribly made that they are great fun. This one however isn't THAT bad nor is the message that convoluted and the film of the victims isn't as grotesque as some similar films. While the message really should have been more explicit and useful for a 1933 film it's pretty gooddespite the occasionally poor acting and the ludicrous suicide scene. Remember kidsjust say 'NO' to suicide!Oh by the way the two years of treatment they talk about in the film was actually the norm for syphilis back in 1933. Nowadays it's a lot more treatableas are the rest of the STDs.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most of the time when you watch a vintage exploitation cult movie you can count it in being pretty shoddy. The writing the performances the production values and the directing are inferior. In fact everything is so secondrate you expect the film will be unintentionally funny perhaps 'so bad it's good.' Typically Poverty Row studios made these epics orin the case of director Edgar G. Ulmer's Damaged Livesa major studio under another company title produced it owing to the taboo nature of the subject matter. Damaged Lives concerns syphilis. Nothing funny or unintentionally funny occurs in this modest 53minute black  white film. The genuine medical footage inserted in the story is tastefully done. There is nothing either sensational or lurid about it that would appall most people. Several examples of individuals afflicted with the consequences of syphilis are shown in either long shots or medium shots. There is no nudity too. Unlike most exploitation movies the characters are welltodo upper class citizens and grimy criminals do not lurk in dark corners trying to persuade ignorant youth to engage themselves with women of questionable virtue. Ulmer and scenarist Don Davis treat the subject matter and the characters with more than a modicum of dignity. Sure the protagonist suffers the consequences but the consequences are not lifelong. Neither the protagonist nor his wife die from VD so Damaged Lives concludes on an upbeat note. No this doesn't qualify as a candidate for Mystery Science Fiction Theater.Donald Bradley Sr. George Irving of Crime Ring has given his son Donald Bradley Jr. Lyman Williams of The Eleventh Commandment a promotion to executive assistant to the president and placed him in charge of the operation of all his steamships. Evidently Don Junior had been working for his dad at sea because he shouts when he gives orders in the office as if he were yelling at a crew aboard a ship. Senior breaks Junior of this bad habit and Junior becomes integrated in the office. Later he breaks a theater date with his fiance Joan Diane Sinclair of Tomorrow's Children for a business supper date with Nate Franklin Harry Myers of City Lights but they conduct no business. Nate has brought along a lady Charlotte Merriam Elise Cooper of Alimony Madness but he abandons Donald and Charlotte and migrates to another table to flirt with another woman. Donald apologizes to Charlotte You see I don't quite know what I'm doing here. Donald and Charlotte get along with each other so well that they hit some other speakeasies. Eventually they end up back at Charlotte's place and things happen. Essentially Charlotte seduces Donald but Charlotte is no working class prostitute. She just enjoys having a good time. Donald is torn up about his affair with Charlotte and plans to marry Joan. Actually he wishes that he had married Joan earlier so he wouldn't have gotten trapped in this predicament. Joan dreams about having children and dotes on the child that one of their friend couples have. At one point Don's friend and physician Bill Hall Jason Robards Sr. of Code of the West suggests that they get married. After Donald ties the knot with Joan and the Justice of the Peace marries them for 2.00!Later about 23 minutes in the action Donald receives a call from Charlotte. She insists that he come see her and Donald reluctantly visits her. Charlotte is rather distraught and takes her time telling Donald what is wrong. She confesses that she has had sex with Nat on several occasions and that she has contracted an infection. Donald doesn't understand what Charlotte means and dismisses the entire situation. As he is about to leave he and Charlotte's maid hears a gunshot and the maid finds Charlotte dead in her room. Surprisingly enough the maid doesn't scream in shock. In a typical exploitation movie the maid would scream. This maid doesn't exhibit any hysterics. Afterward Donald visits Dr. Horton and he pays the quack a 100. Horton assures him that there is nothing to worry about. Before long Donald's family physician Bill persuades him to come downtown and visit a famous specialist Dr. Vincent Lennox Murray Kinnell of The Public Enemy who confirms that Joan has venereal disease. Of course Donald is aghast and refuses to believe it. Eventually Dr. Lennox explains that he can treat them over a twoyear period and everything will be okay. Lennox shows Donald a number of people who are suffering from syphilis. The worst example is a medium shot of a man's naked chest covered with pimples of some kind. Naturally Joan is aghast about the revelation of her disease too. She faints while they are at Lennox's clinic. Later when they visit Bill and Laura Hall Joan tries to kiss their little boy. Bill seizes his little boy before Joan can kiss him then he apologizes for his momentary display of hysterics. After they go home neither Donald nor Joan sleep with each other in the same bed. Joan tries to gas both Donald and herself but Donald awakens and shut off the stove. Donald tries to reassure Joan that they can live with this experience between them. Things take a turn for the better at the end when a friend called them about a problem. The friend is pregnant and due to give birth in a week and she freaks out about because she ate pickles with her husband on a diner date. Our heroic couple laughs off the friend's predicament and Damaged Lives fades out.Director Edgar G. Ulmer rarely made anything significant compared with other prestigious Hollywood helmers but every film that he directed was done with style despite their lowbudgets. Damaged Lives is not a film about debauchery but an intelligent depiction of a social disease and its nearly devastating effects on a young couple.".

Mr. Morales seems at home in thrillers and what may have looked promising on paper doesn't always translate very well onto film. The inheritance storyline is nothing new. But any fresh idea would have been a welcome addition to the plot here. Michael Ironside and a miscast Malcolm McDowell are also wasted in roles they could have phoned in. The action in the film is very tired and the plot absolutely predictable. I guessed the entire storyline nearly halfway through the film.

George Clooney is magnificent as the grease haired Everett Ulysses McGill a honest con on the run whose pompous linguistics and vocabulary are comical and endearing. O Brother Where Art Thou is easily the best Coen film to date as well as Clooney's best effort.

Clooney is good enough to warrant a best actor nomination as is Tim Blake Nelson's portrayal of the dimwitted friend Delmar while the film itself is deserving of a Best film nod.";

OBWAT is certainly those things but it also has a heart as big as..well..as big as Mississippi. It is one of the most plainly enjoyable movies to have come out in recent times intelligent wellcrafted clever and superbly acted.Characters are delivered in their myriad shades by a group of marvellous actors. George Clooney winning me over completely with his Clark Gableish looks and character. Having only ever seen him in Three Kings and his Thin Red Line cameo I am now a fan. More comedy please George.John Tuturro and Tim Blake Nelson ably assist especially Nelson. If ever The Simpsons is made into a movie then he must be a natural to play Cletus the slackjawed yokel. I don't think there is a performance that falls short of excellent from the entire cast. My special favorite is Stephen Root as the blind Radio Station Man.Great oldtimey music a jiggy type dance by Clooney that I am trying to learn and a feel of depression era southern US enhanced by sepialike photography make this the best movie I've see  so far this century. The only drawback to the film is that it has almost sent me broke buying the soundtrack the DVD and a DVD player to play it on....it's THAT good!".

	schema:reviewBody "I have walked out of a Coen movie before and not quite known how to feel. The two best examples of that are The Big Lebowski and Fargo. Lebowski was so ridiculously original and so filled with strange humour that I had to like it. On the other hand there were some unnecessary reveries with flying people and killer bowling balls that just didn't seem to fit the mold of the film. Still I liked the film and now own a copy of it. Fargo made me howl with hysterics sometimes I wasn't sure why I was laughing so hard that it made me cry but nonetheless I was. There were many seemingly strange characters in Fargo but upon further investigation they were really just real people talking about real situations. That is why the man with the shovel  or was it a broom  was so sidesplittingly funny when he was telling the police officer about some funny looking man down at the bar the other night. And that is also why the theater erupted in laughter when he then says that there are some funny looking clouds coming in. I own a copy of this film too The Coen's have a way of masking their film and their characters as being somewhat eccentric and perhaps a little off the wall. But if you look closer at some of those same characters that seem zany you will always find that in some strange way they all ring true. That is what is quite exceptional about O Brother Where Art Thou? This is a film that is out there. I mean it is not even in the same ballpark as a traditional film. I reviewed the film Shaft this past summer and in it I said that Shaft was an okay film that I have seen a thousand times before. But you can not say that about a Coen Brother's film and you most certainly can not say that about this one.This film has everything in it from a jail break crooked southern politicians muses references to what I can only assume are historical figures riverside baptisms bank robberies violence towards animals singing flocks of religious fanatics KKK lynch mobs and so on. There are obviously many references to Homer's Odyssey in here as well but I wouldn't know that because I have never read Homer's Odyssey or even knew one thing about it. Every other newspaper reviewer seems to know all about it and they think that this cynicism and almost spooflike quality towards it makes the film that much better. Well coming from a guy who doesn't know anything about it I can tell you that it is still an entertaining film. There were times when again as is usual for a Coen film I wasn't sure why I was entertained or laughing but I was.This is a road picture where three men travel along the way to find a hidden treasure that Clooney says he has hidden to his two other cell mates. He has to take them along because they were also chained to him when they had their chance to escape.I like all the principal actors in the film and many of them are Coen cronies. It was nice to see Goodman again. It was nice to see Hunter and especially Turturro who seems to have a place in every Coen film. It's too bad they didn't find a place for Steve Buscemi but that is a different story all together. But back to Clooney. The man just has charisma. He is a one hell of an actor as well and here he is not quite as zany as the others but even he has his own idiosyncrasies. His work here is quite awesome and I really hope this shows that he is capable of playing any range of character.Now after heaping all this praise on the film let me just say this as well. I didn't really enjoy the film at first. I found it to be quite tedious and a little boring. There were too many ideas in here and not enough care went into harnessing them for all what they were worth. But then the film began to grow on me. It took a while but it did grow on me. I don't think this is their best film but it is still a good one and I am giving it a 8.5. But the reason that I do recommend this film is for one reason only.Every day you can go look into the paper and look at the films that are playing and say to yourself seen it seen it oh seen it last year that is the same as this film and that is the same as that film. Most films have been recycled in some form or another. Not the Coen's films. They have not been recycled and if they have I don't know about it. That is reason enough to see something that they put out. Originality counts for a lot in my books. The Coens are original and they are good. And that is not common in todays cinema. Enjoy them while they are allowed to make films. Because you don't get vision like this in many films so when you do enjoy it!".

I haven't read Homer so other than a few obvious nods to the classic author the cyclops for instance I missed many of the parallels I'm told are there. It's difficult to pinpoint what makes this such a magnificent movieprobably because there are so many details that add up. The first thing that sold me like so many others was the music. The album sales alone stand as a testament to the quality of the soundtrack I realize album sales don't always equal good music but here they do. It feels like the movie was made during the Great Depression. If you watch movies made during the time they were all feel good flics. Several reviewers here have drawn the savy comparison between OBWAT and It Happened One Night and specifically between Clooney's and Gable's performances. There are so many things that make this movie worth seeing. My only complaint that sticks is that it could so easily have been made PG. As it stands it is one of the most harmless PG13 films in a long time and I wish the filmmakers hadn't opted to put in the extra dammits to elevate the movie into the more profitable bracket. Even the famous siren scene seemed tasteful and sweetly seductive rather than racy. My point? This movie has the potential to make you smile.".

As it stands it is one of the most harmless PG13 films in a long time and I wish the filmmakers hadn't opted to put in the extra dammits to elevate the movie into the more profitable bracket. Even the famous siren scene seemed tasteful and sweetly seductive rather than racy. My point? This movie has the potential to make you smile.";

With his hillbilly mannerisms walleyed expressions and perfect delivery George Clooney gains redemption from the dreadful Batman and Robin and Solaris.  I'm the paterfamilias he proclaims when he sees his daughters.  Priceless.This film's defenders are those who find genius in things that are merely different.  For example watching John Turturro yodel is startling but then so is watching a homeless man urinate in a bottle genius lies in context not in eclecticism.  After listening to the wonderfully original music that permeates the score the viewer is then treated to an audience singalong of You Are My Sunshine a song even more loathsome than Disco Duck.The subplot about dueling politicans made no sense and contributed nothing to the storyline other than as a convenient way to wrap up the ending. Is there any politician in the world who would storm into a crowded music hall and proclaim I am a member of a secret society?  It was a very weak and very lame way of disposing of the subplot villain.  Why would a man who was so careful and crafty with his campaign throw it all away by raising the ire of a roomfull of people?  So stupid and made no sense.  This is very sloppy writing by the Coens.John Goodman is not a very good actor.  Although he was brilliant as Dan Connor on Roseanne he just doesn't have the range to play different characters.  He delivers his lines as Dan Connor would little wonder then that the character is named Big Dan.  Fred Flintstone Babe Ruth King Ralph  he plays the same character time after time just like Morgan Freeman does.  However he has a good screen presence so it's understandable that he's a Coen brothers staple.  Holly Hunter normally a firecracker is icecold and it's difficult to understand what Everett sees in her.  John Turturro is as always on the edge of mania ready to fall off the deep end at any moment.  His howl of lust when he sees the women at the river is one of the funniest things he's ever done.  Looks like Pete's got the itch Delmar deadpans in his philosophical way.My main problem with this movie is that there is no point to any of it. There is no goal and no storyline.  You can't identify with any of the characters and it's difficult to accept Everett's longing to be back with his frigid wife.  Villians pop up right and left but they are just temporary.  This film is like a series of halffinished thoughts or halfremembered dreams all leading up to a whole bunch of nothing.  The ending fizzles out like a dying candle with Everett begging Penny to take him back.  Hmm we're back where we started.With better writing this could have been a great film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Coen movies are easy to spot. They have that feel the feel of originality and oddity the crazy story lines and characters. Oh Brother has all that. The toned down dustiness of the movie feels less like a gimmick and more like it's supposed to be there adding to the already thick Southern filter the movie's viewed through.The storyline is imaginative and totally impossible to predict. Giving credit to Homer is a bit silly since the references to the Oddessy are made for fun and could easily have been discarded without changing the story.Characters are the usual bunch of misfits and crazies you expect.

The toned down dustiness of the movie feels less like a gimmick and more like it's supposed to be there adding to the already thick Southern filter the movie's viewed through.The storyline is imaginative and totally impossible to predict. Giving credit to Homer is a bit silly since the references to the Oddessy are made for fun and could easily have been discarded without changing the story.Characters are the usual bunch of misfits and crazies you expect.

Along the way they must deal with sirens a bible selling Cyclops Babyface Nelson a campaigning Governor a Klan lynching party and a blind prophet.This is another of the Cohen brothers different' projects  basically meaning that nothing will make a great deal of sense and won't always follow logical paths but will be full of imagination and energy.  The story won't always be gripping unless you know Ulysses' original adventure.  If you do then the story will be a joy as you recognise the parallels between the two tales.  Even if you don't there is plenty to enjoy here the story is so full of funny imaginative and original characters that you can't help but be drawn in.  From Badalucco's Babyface Nelson Oh George not the livestock' to Durning's Pappy everything is handled with such an edge of surrealism that it's captivating.Clooney has never been better and is truly excellent here with his eccentric hick character with a taste for hair cream.  Turturro is also excellent but Nelson's childlike Delmar is the best character and a great performance. Hunter is as good as she usually is in Coen stuff and the support cast of Durning Goodman Badalucco etc are all great.  The music is fantastic even if you not a fan of this type of music it still fits so totally with the mood of the film that it all works well together.This is a wonderful film  yet another from the Coens.  It has it's slow moments and the episodic nature of the story can sometimes give it an aimless feel but overall this is significantly better than the sum of it's many great parts.".

	schema:reviewBody "Oh Brother Where Art Thou?'  is ostensibly based on Homer's The Odyssey' but I have no reason to doubt the Coen Brothers when they say that they've never actually read it.  The film really has nothing to do with that epic poem other than the fact that the filmmakers throw plot elements from the original haphazardly into the mix every now and then.  Need a Cyclops? Dress John Goodman up in an eye patch to no point or purpose.  Sirens?  Have the main characters stumble across three beautiful women singing and washing clothes by a riverside even though the scene seems totally contrived and arbitrary in the context of the story.  The Coen Brothers' lack of familiarity with the original is only too apparent.Actually this is one of their worst films no doubt about it  slow arch disjointed and heavyhanded in both its plotting and its humor.  The original Odyssey' was an epic tale filled with adventure high drama and great themes involving issues of courage pride commitment and love.  Oh Brother' is none of these.  It is in fact silly cramped and trivial.  The role of Ulysses has been assigned to George Clooney as the leader of a trio of convicts who escape from a chain gang in the Depression Era Midwest.  As they roam the countryside they encounter a myriad of bizarre eccentric characters some derived loosely from The Odyssey' and some not.  None of it really works partly due to the arbitrariness of the plotting and partly due to the fact that the humor is not very well executed.  In fact most of the wit consists of having the actors overplay their facial expressions and accents.  As a result of these two factors the strain never ceases to show.So are there any good things to be found in Oh Brother'?  Well the movie does look good thanks to fine cinematography and art direction which beautifully capture the look of the dusty rural countryside of the 1930's. And there is of course the occasional joke or idea that actually does work despite the fact that the film as a whole is a major disappointment. Perhaps in the case of this particular Coen Brothers film the title is inadvertently symbolic.".

	schema:reviewBody "The opening static shot of Joe sleeping for a full 4 minuets was very reminiscent of Earlier work done by Morrissey's Quasipartner Warhol on the movie Sleep which is  a static shot of some guy sleeping for 6 hours. But Unlike Warhol's work Paul Morrissey put the narrative into the Warhol aesthetic principalsby giving the actors more substance to each scene and then  moving around the camera and following the actors actions more closely with a omnipresent eye that doesn't inhibit the actors in sometimes highly improvised situations. unlike in Warhol's work actorsactresses were aware of the camera at all times and didn't allow them to lose themselves in the moment on screen.Yes there is allot of Improvisation in this film which is what gives it the feeling of watching something that is real. The movie was not scripted before every scene Paul Morrissey told each actor what he wanted from each scene and the actors were left to their own devices improvising dialogue and advancing the narrative. Choosing the subject of Hustling for a living selling your self for money and pairing it with an actor that knows about the lifestyle is what really gave Joe the opportunity to make the character believable. In fact after the movie was shown around the world people actually thought Joe was Like that in real life Just like in TRASH everyone really thought Joe was a junkie. One good scene has Joe picked up by an older gentleman who wants Joe only to pose for some artwork. Joe tells him he wants to earn 100 bucks to pay for his wife's girlfriend's abortion one hundred dollars! you'll have to take off all your clothes for that the old man tells him.  The old man  is in fact hiding his homosexuality Pretending to be an artist. Back at his place He tells Joe to take off his clothes saying that that is the hardest part for anyone to do when posing for art. But Joe's not shy He takes off all his clothing and starts posing in various olympiadic poses. While the old man rants on about the different artworks in contemporary society the aesthetic of greek statues philosophizing on the beauty of human skin and how people are obsessed with it  It's too much for Joe Joe interrupts him asking him for the dinner he promised him. The aesthete's rationalization is paralleled by Joe's last customer of the day Louis Waldon playing a guy Joe knows from the gym. He pretends that their sex is for the friendlier motive than the money Joe always requests and that despite their sex we're not queers. The pretense to friendship is undermined when the customer shifts from the passive suggestions to brusquely ordering Joe about. The client's delusions show his need for purity in a relationshipsuch as glimpsed in Joe's scene with the baby where he is nude on the floor feeding the baby bits of muffin. Only with the baby is Joe shown in a relationship were he is not a commodity. Joe runs into some other hustlers on the street younger ones who sorta look at Joe with respect because he's the more experienced Hustler and they being ones who want to learn more. One of the boys asks him if he's straight Joe say's Hey nobody's straight. What's straight? It's not a thing of being straight or being not straight. It's just...you just do whatever you have to do and about the johns he only says they only wanna suck your peetta! In another memorable scene With Geri Miller Candy Darling Jackie Curtis and Joe. Morrissey pans from Candy and Jackie transvestites in real life sitting down on a couch reading from an old Hollywood magazine      The trannie's quote stuff from the magazine and then Geri's goes into her dramatic story of her rape meanwhile Joe emotionless listens to it all. Later Geri does a topless dance at Joe's request but he ignores her. The film ends like it begins but with a difference.Again Joe is Naked on his belly on the bed. Reversing the opening order the fulllength view is followed by the profile closeup. But now Joe is no longer alone. His wife is asleep beside him but between them lies her new lover the women's legs ardently intertwined. We see him in the relationship from which he is excluded. Joe's naked solitude is redefined as an alienation within a relationship. The film went on to gross over 2000000 dollars making it a very profitable considering it was done on a budget of only 1500. It was banned from England for a while and in Germany 3000000 people saw it making it one of the top movies in Germany in that year. It was the first underground film that was accepted on a wide scale basis and made Joe a very well known person all over the world.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the most sublime of American masterpieces Morrissey opens the film by sexualizing Dallesandro with his open mouth snoring on a pillow. We wonder is he coming off a heroin high? We just see his face then flash his body flash his naked rear. I can't think of another film that used this flashblip form of editing so well to create a hypnotic druggy mood an editing method that works wonderfully as both pacing and style. After that introduction when Dallesandro opens his mouth his accent is jarring  we expect him to be some kind of softspoken androgyne instead he's got the voice of a street thug  Morrissey isn't comfortable letting our assumptions go unchecked. The lengthy opening is very sexy and playful  it's a combination of martial troubles Dallesandro's fascinating liprubbing kisses and early morning sexual escapades it all kind of flows together if not always smoothly then emotionally realistically.What I got from this was the same as what I got from The 400 Blows when I first saw it  this is like a 20something continuation of that story. There's a sense of camaraderie between the flesh sellers and the buyers when Dallesandro walks the street looking for men to fund his wife's abortion there's the feeling of a secret handshake as boys make deals with each other. I never found it boring though nothing happens  nothing happens brilliantly the boys hanging around as they do waiting for tricks. The main trick that Dallesandro finds is fascinating to watch using Greek descriptions and only touching his back a form of aesthetic body worship on the man's part. It's also dreadfully funny I'm not talking to an empty bed am I?. It's one of the most revealing scenes in the movie  in any movie I think certainly any movie dealing with sex and sex for sale. When Dallesandro's eyes seem red and swollen we can't tell if it's because he's drunk ashamed embarrassed or all.The conversations in the film are cutup  they don't matter. The film is silent in a few scenes some of the most poignant and beautiful you may ever experience. Yet when Morrissey chooses to include one the way he includes it we sort of piece it together it's startling such as one conversation between Dallesandro and a newbie hustler  and neither of them ever mentioning the word gay or hustler. What follows is a scene where we listen to a pair of transvestites as Dallesandro gets serviced  this just after explaining to the newbie getting used to the job.Dallesandro is a subject worthy of the attention paid to him both by his clients and Morrissey. He's less than effective as an actor in the sense of acting as performing but as far as revealing something he's incredible  he's someone we immediately want to feel above yet we go through his experiences with all their complexities and we're forced to try and know him. He's the kind of blank slate that we're drawn to but can't get a hold on. And of course he's incredibly striking  forgetting everything else this is partially a testament to the beauty of the male body Dallesandro's gorgeous torso and permanently erect nipples.The movie has one devastating scene but like everything else you can't really master it  a girl says that she's been raped and her only selfdefense is in saying that had the rapist only asked for sex wooed her he would have gotten a better lay. It's shattering. The movie has feeling for everyone but even better than that it's not merely sympathetic it actually attempts to help us understand human beings  and without ever dictating what it is we're meant to be understanding. It neither looks down on nor glamorizes the people within the film. It feels inclusive when we see Joe's arm around a transvestite. When he reads a letter he talks about not getting past grade eight at one point he's utterly charming as he pauses on a word...then says woteva and continues.You can learn something more profound from the interaction between Dallesandro and one of his clients in terms of gaystraight relationships than you can from any case study. Here we have the young boy who smiles his top lip disappears as he does so when a 30something gym bunny Korean war veteran runs his fingers through his hair it's a scene that feels very profound this adult man sharing something with a younger version of himself  it's not two gay men together or a gay man paying a straight man it's something else you can't put your finger on questions of sexuality are beside the point. Never before has popping a pimple seemed as affectionate. After sharing something with each other emotionally though with Dallesandro since he's there for money it's never apparent why he's there though he's never less than sincere which may be his most disarming quality So...can you help me out? The man says sure. I don't mean my pants! 1010".

	schema:headline " Flesh... the First of the WarholMorisseyDallesandro Trilogy";
	schema:reviewBody "I was a junior in high school when Flesh hit the big screens but had the good fortune to see it at midnight movie houses in NYC just two years later.Flesh is the first part of a socalled trilogy of films featuring Joe Dallesandro as an object of desire. It bears the Warhol name but is more the work of Paul Morissey. Essentially the story concerns itself with the exploits surrounding one day in the life of a streetwise male hustler played by Joe Dallesandro. Joe is young beautiful and a bit naive... but he manages to bring home the bacon to his wife for reasons which should not be explained to appreciate the film fully.Of special note to film buffs is that this film along with the remaining two of the trilogy had no script per se. Warhol's superstars were given simply a premise... and the words and actions which the viewer sees are quite natural even at times ridiculous or nonsensical. But all in all it works... Rolling Stone noted in its review that the film was better than Midnight Cowboy a film of the same year more polished by Hollywood An Academy Award winner for Best Film  with big name talent I equally admire the film... but FLESH being improvised was somehow more gut wrenching and realistic without the need for complex subplots and any cause de celebre .. or for that matter any cause at all!The film grossed more than 3 million dollars and was an absolute sensation particularly in the German market which ironically thought they were given a censored version of the film because of the postediting....see note below.Curiously the film is very much cut and paste with pops. clicks flashes and dialogue literally cut off midsentence. It is almost as if WarholMorissey are stating a simple truth that it is a day in the life of a superstar snippets for your voyeuristic tendencies. Far better than earlier Warhol works of 8 hours of sleeping and the statue of liberty as a 20 hour movie.FLESH in my opinion is the first of the Warhol films that actually is digestible given a wide pallette and Warhol'sthe Factory's first legitimate response to the Hollywood phenomenon of stardom.As the first of a trilogy it portrays a young desirable male icon naive sought after responding to invitations to please his family. Subsequent films would show the same character with a differing set of values. See Trash and Heat".

	schema:reviewBody "A heap of human flesh lies asleep on a red pillow. This is the hunk of naked meat that is Little Joe a New York hustler who lives with his bisexual wife and baby child. The film follows a day in his life after he's woken from sleep by his wife demanding that he go out and do the traditional male thing  be a breadwinner. But the use she wants to put the bread to is to pay for her new girlfriend's abortion. We certainly aren't in the traditional family unit here...After playing with his child Joe hits the streets to cruise for johns. The clients come thick and fast the ordinary gay man who wants to meet him again because they work well together the old English classical scholar who pays 100 to see Joe pose like an ancient Greek athlete the female topless dancer who blows Joe then boasts about being raped the ageing gym bunny who doesn't think that what he and Joe do together is queer. After a hard day's work Joe returns home exhausted only to be put down by his wife and the girlfriend. He goes back to sleep as they harp and undermine him.Flesh is fascinating as it takes what is a traditional classical mainstream structure  it has an inciting incident the money for the abortion and setup a confrontation and a resolution albeit a very downbeat one even a protagonist with a strongly motivated goal and then proceeds to concentrate on the details of the day to day routine of these people who are perfectly ordinary to themselves but extraordinary to most mainstream people. It all seems very authentic and natural  it's hard to see the acting the actors are so fully being their roles  but yet the whole thing is a piece of cunning artifice  a beautifully drawn portrait or an intricately carved statue. Director Morrissey carefully plants every incident every encounter around his theme of human flesh become packaged commodity but with such cunning slight of hand that you almost don't notice him doing it. The wife packages Joe's sexual organ the old Englishmen laments a long gone order of classical beauty which created art and poetry from human fleshly beauty the transvestite friends of the stripper package themselves as women whilst reading a Hollywood magazine in which real women are packaged as products the gym bunny buys Joe's friendship and affection thinks artificial porn is real and can't tell as we can't that Joe is performing his friendship and intimacy for the cash. The film itself presents itself as the ne plus ultra of cinematic realism but what we might as well be dealing with here is fine art or an early example of concept art.The genius  a word not lightly used  of Morrissey was to find a way of taking Warhol's arty pretensions to filmmaking which were interesting sure but boring as hell and making them into saleable products which remain amongst the most intriguing works of cinema art ever made  commercial cans labelled Flesh and Trash and Heat with a product label  Andy Warhol  which sells an idea about the product as much as the product itself. Yet just as you reel from Morrissey's cynicism you are spellbound by his ability to still maintain the highest of standards and depth of meaning. The constant what seem like camera flashes continually draw attention to the filmic nature of what one is witnessing yet you get drawn into the illusion all the same  Flesh is surely one of the most extraordinary pieces of cinema magic to ever spellbind an audience.".

	schema:headline " A refreshingly different approach to filmmaking";
	schema:reviewBody "Snap crackle pop! The jarring sound of every change in camera angle. And that's not to mention the white flashes and the clipped endings to almost every spoken sentence. What on earth were they up to in the editing room? Or could it be that this approach was intentional? Surely not. What purpose could it serve? Despite all its technical shortcomings this is an interesting film depicting a day in the life of Joe a hustler determined to earn 200 for his wife's pregnant girl friend.

What on earth were they up to in the editing room? Or could it be that this approach was intentional? Surely not. What purpose could it serve? Despite all its technical shortcomings this is an interesting film depicting a day in the life of Joe a hustler determined to earn 200 for his wife's pregnant girl friend.

Anyway for those so inclined the film features extensive male nudity and Joe Dallesandro understandably became an underground  and gay  icon! The episodic structure showing the daytoday routine of the hustler protagonist offers a couple of mildly interesting scenes his meeting with and eventually posing for an eccentric elderly artist the one where Dallesandro expresses his views on his unusual line of work and delineates his particular modus operandi to a couple of prospective 'colleagues' including perhaps the unlikeliest of hustlers  a bespectacled nerd! Perhaps mercifully the film ran for only 89 minutes against the IMDb's claim that its complete length is 105 but the latter could well be a mistake! I had watched a few other of Warhol's 'movies' and this one is decidedly not as satisfying as the most tolerable example I've run into yet BAD 1977 and only slightly better than the likes of MY HUSTLER 1965 which were mostly a strain to sit through. The fact that this was only the first part of a trilogy did not augur well but as the saying goes you gotta to do what you gotta do and the other two 'chapters' had to follow in quick succession... Despite my generally negative reaction to it FLESH is nevertheless still valuable as a 1960s time capsule and as a prototype of the Underground scene of that era both cinematically and in real life. For the record an image of Dallesandro from this film adorns the sleeve of The Smiths' selftitled 1984 debut album and transsexual Candy Darling who appears here rather unremarkably was immortalized in Candy Says the opening track of The Velvet Underground's eponymous 1969 album. Although the latter band is my alltime favorite and one of the reasons for this is that through their sheerly unique and groundbreaking music they described a lifestyle so utterly different from my own this is truly a case where I'd much rather experience something aurally instead of visually!".

What you get when you watch this film is tons of the beautiful masterpiece that is Joe Dallesandro all over the screen. It is a day in the life of his character a married bisexual prostitute and how his life ties in with all the people around him and all the people he does business with. It is a very interesting and well done film for how well the actors play it out. They act as if it is just an ordinary day and they don't even know a camera is filming them which makes it seem so real. Joe Dallesandro is another reason why this film works out well.Now I'm not saying that the main purpose was to make us want to jump into the screen pull him out and play with him but goodness was that boy beautiful and I certainly wanted to do just that. It might be just for his looks that the reason we care to watch his character's day play out so much is because he's so incredibly gorgeous but in any matter it still makes us care what happens to the character which is something any film should try to do. It becomes an interesting tale because of how we see what amazing things he's able to do with his body and how amazing his body looks doing them such as the Greek pose photoshoot and how him playing with and feeding his child in the nude is still sweet and charming whilst being devilishly mouthwatering.The movie is not meant to be a landmark among film history. It's a runofthemill film about an average day that is made into an excellent story and an excellent movie overall because of how much we enjoy seeing the actors and actresses take part in it. The dialog keeps your attention the story keeps your attention and Joe Dallesandro's existence keeps your utmost attention. I suggest you see it in the right sense and you'll be able to have fun with it and enjoy it.".

It is certainly quite daring for a movie made during the late 1960s tackling a lewd subject with copious full frontal nudity throughout. Viewed nearly half a century on though much of the content seems tame and the film does not have a lot going for it shock value aside. The technical aspects are very very poor and while it can be rationalised that some of this is due to budgetary constraints any such knowledge does not make it any easier to sit through the dozens of jump cuts and audio blips throughout. The performers also have a tendency to mumble their lines then again what dialogue can be made out is not especially well scripted. The film has scattered strong moments such as a humorous bit in which one of the hustler's clients moults him into various naked athlete poses but humour is unfortunately not generally at the forefront of the film. The film does attempt to offer something in the way of character growth with the protagonist gradually coming to realise that everyone only wants him for his flesh hence the title and there is something fitting in how the filmmakers themselves also only value him for his body spending so much time on nude shots and so little on developing his character... however all this is far more interesting to analyse afterwards than it is to endure. And given the slimness of the content it is perhaps inevitable that the film overstays its welcome though it is a curio for sure.".

The acting is hard to judge because it's like watching real people it is almost like a voyeuristic look into the life of one man and the people he encounters. It is amazing this was filmed in 1968. I am sure there was nothing else like it back then and it would be considered a racy even by today's standards. This is the first movie of a total of three that Paul Morrissey did in collaboration with Andy Warhol.".

The actor who plays Joe spends about half of the screentime completely naked and yes Morrissey doesn't shy away from showing everything and basically through a series of scenes and conversations in the streets and cheap apartments of New York you get a pretty interesting though somewhat draggedout portrait of the sexual underground populated entirely by passive unintellectual people who live John to John and are ultimately unable to even think about what they'll need in the future. Though the acting is poor and made worse by the editing which cuts off some of the dialog in parts there's a sense of realism here that goes beyond the likes of Midnight Cowboy and Dog Day Afternoon more mainstream movies that can use the crisp production values and stronger acting as a sense of removal and distance between the subject and the audience after all it's just a movie. The dialog in its meandering and mumbling glory is actually really well written making it a shame that it's so poorly delivered because it really does provide a gateway into understanding these characters.

	schema:reviewBody "Flesh 1968 Director Paul Morrissey 12outof Review After just reading The Andy Warhol Diaries I then proceeded to seek out his films and apparently all he did was fund this and raise its publicity. So I shall leave out my interest in Warhol for the sake of this review. I watched this twice just to see how I really felt the first time I felt nothing towards it. I felt the second time that the movie has an indistinct quality that makes you want to keep watching I can't deny that. The movie is virtually plot less and really is a camera put on actors while they most likely improvise most of their lines. At least it really felt that way.The movie is choppily edited the lighting is murky the film is grainy and the sound is horrendous. The actors are the main joy in this movie well actually only a few. Seeing Joe Geri the awesome Candy and funny Jackie all hanging out and talking was the main highlight for me. I found Candy simply endearing and the characters were all comfortable together like Joe nonchalantly putting his arm over Jackie and it made it an effortless watch.From reading some IMDb reviews about this it seems that a lot of the stuff went over my head in this movie as I rarely picked up on of the undercurrents of deeper meanings. Nothing really clicked it wasn't that I didn't get it I mean mostly it was people standing around and talking what's the meaning towards that? The scenes of ambient design were the films main flaw. Too much of nothing I know this is underground art house stuff but seeing long shots of people sleeping simply staring or stretches of no plot or dialog is extremely hard to sit through for me. If I want art I'll watch Argento or David Lynch. The art here was curiously out of my grasp. More just like a flimsy documentary as maybe that's what it really is. So investment in visual design is out of luck for me. Still the movie has a compelling current about it.From the plot I picked up it's basically Joe trying to make 200 dollars to save up for his girlfriend's lesbian lover's abortion. We get to see him wake up and then the film ends with him sleeping. So basically a day in the life of Joe the hustler and the people he encounters.As expected with a MorrisseyWarholDallesendro production I expected nudity and got it. The movie loves Joe's body but from my perspective the male and female nudity was somewhatclinical to make it fully erotic. Usually full frontal nudity will make people uncomfortable for some reason but I watched this with 3 teens and none of them were annoyed by it signs of a good approach or self confident teens? Some people will write this off as art house porn but there's something about it that wasn't raunchy like most porn's tend to be. It didn't come off as art either. So I'm not sure what I would label this as. Is it simply underground or experimental film making? I first discovered Warhol at the age of 13 were I watched Mary Harron's I Shot Andy Warhol the movie was a pure gem and quite authentic from the research I did about the factory. I'd prefer watching that movie countless times then the actually Warhol deals. All these movies are somewhat forgettable but that's' just my opinion. Obviously this will appeal to the real purists who probably were aghast when reading my preference to Warhol and not for someone born right before Warhol passed away. Still I gave it a chance and still found it quite original in places.Praise must go to Candy Darling. She had me sold she seemed so nice and warm a easy going person and it's a shame she passed away. She was simply awesome! I also found Joe's performance quite interesting he seemed naive sardonic and withdrawn all at the same time his facial acting really told me what he was thinking or not thinking all the time.The movie didn't change my world and definitely is more Morrissey's work then Warhol. So take it in stride and see if you like it. On to Heat and Trash I go.".

	schema:headline " Raw funny moving and rather sweet film for those who are cinematically adventurous";
	schema:reviewBody "The first film in the Paul Morrissey trilogy Flesh tells the story of a male hustler Joe who lives with his lesbian wife Geri. Joe also has a son whom we see Joe feeding a muffin to very early on in the film. Geri in the opening scenes of the film forces Joe out onto the streets so that he can obtain money to pay for her girlfriend's abortion. The film details the various deformed twisted perverted and addicted people that he is forced to deal with and sleep with on a daily basis. In the end Joe is left feeling drained warped and vulnerable to every perversion and the audience is forced to confront the provocative nature of what it is truly like to be comfortable and happy in one's own flesh.This film is a revelation and I think it's one of the best and most emotionally raw films of the 60s. It has nothing to do with the quality of the film itself but rather the imagery it summons and the way it presents itself. This is not a good quality film for those who are just looking for a film to watch. This is the sort of film that you need to allow yourself to be emotionally invested in before you make any calls on what it is. To be frank it's very tough to describe what the film is exactly. It's a very unorthodox film. As a matter of fact the subject matter of the film the camerawork the performances and the dialogue in this film are all very unorthodox. This film wasn't intended to exactly be viewed as a film but rather to bring about a world that the audience can witness and get involved with in an emotional sense. I thought that despite the crap quality Morrissey was seriously onto something here. As a film it obviously isn't that good but as an exploration of sexuality and of emotional disconnection it's a serious pleasure to watch. It is funny unusual sad and incredibly sweet. It's probably the most erotic film about hustling I have seen as well as the most tastefully innocent.I have neglected to highlight what helps the film really come together. That is Joe Dallesandro. This man has a body unlike anything I have ever seen and a face of completely unpardonable beauty. What makes this film so deeply frightening in a way is his naive and gentle nature and as a result we don't feel any internal fear from looking at the images but rather a sense of helpless fear. When you watch the film it becomes more and more clear that Joe has lost whatever wisdom and whatever ideas of security he has and yet he has changed as a man because of it. If anything it has allowed him to revert to a state of abused selfconfidence that really make what happens to him over the course of the film a lot more interesting. Joe Dallesandro is naked throughout about 80 of the film but this obviously isn't done to titillate or to be shocking or risqu but rather for the viewer to drop whatever preconceptions they have about seeing the male body and just accept it as part of the character's personal self doubts being put out and left in the open. The viewer no longer feels like a voyeur and instead feels closer to the subject of the film. This is one of the least brave things that the film does and yet when it ends it is the one thing that I thought about the most. This film likely has more male nudity in it than any other film ever made and yet it's impossible to feel dirty or perverted as a result. Instead we feel rather taken aback by the style and editing of the filmor the lack thereof which is strictly amateur and impossibly inept. This is how we come into the film and it is because of Joe Dallesandro that we leave the picture feeling that we didn't just watch what was merely a film made by a bunch of yuppies nerds and junkies.Ultimately the film is definitely not for everyone. It will be impossible for some folks to accept the fact that the film is as poor quality and as badly made as it is. It will also be impossible for many folks to appreciate the fact that someone as seemingly sweet as Joe Dallesandro is so fearless and so ready and eager to completely put himself into constant vulnerable positions both emotionally and physically. Flesh is STRICTLY for people who have a desire to be emotionally and visually involved in a film that digs into the darker and more repulsive aspects of the streets of New York and refuses to place any sort of judgment. Forget that the film is about a miserable man who prefers to use himself endless to further add to the desecration of the lives of the people around him and concentrate on the humorous horrible and varied imagery. This film doesn't have much to say but damn does it leave you feeling raw. Very few films have this much honesty in their imagery and even fewer of them are nonjudgmental.".
