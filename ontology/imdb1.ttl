She falls in love but leaves him when his protestations of love appear to cover a desire for her to be his mistress rather than his wife.

Viewers may find themselves rooting for him against the feckless Hartwell! The tone of the film wavers however between lighthearted romance and a much darker side especially in the depiction of a dance marathon and a rather horrific accident at Bill's garage.The cast is rounded out by the dependable Jane Darwell as Kitty's mother an impish but not yet thoroughly obnoxious Mickey Rooney as Kitty's younger brother and Spencer Charters as Kitty's ne'erdowell father.".

He seems to be in the film for comedic and homey family values. Jane Darwell again plays the strongwilled mother just as she had in Grapes of Wrath and the Oxbow Incident. Ann Sothern is Kitty who has been dating Bill Paul Kelly but meets up with rich Bob Hartwell played by Neil Hamilton who may or may not be better for her. You can certainly tell that this was made at the very beginning of the Hays production code  at one point Kitty says she can't be up there alone with him if there isn't anyone else in the house...what a change from just a year or two prior when anything and everything was OK. Good solid plot but a whole lot of conversation and mushy love talk. It raises the question over what a girl should be searching for in a man should she hold out for a man with integrity who treats her nice or just find a man with big bucks as most of the movies from the previous 20 years had advocated...? and how do men change when their situation changes ? watch out for some violence in the strange dance marathon scene. TV viewers from the 1960s will recognize Hamilton as Commissioner Gordon from Batman..... Also some weird drama in the offscreen lives for some of the cast in this one Paul Kelly had gone to jail for being accessory to murder in a love triangle. Mickey Rooney had an affair with Norma Shearer who was 20 years older Rooney ended up being married eight times. Tyler Brooke Emory and Spencer Charters Pa both knocked themselves off in real life. The title Blind Date has been reused many times for films TV series and even cartoons but none of them seem to have the same plot as this one.".

Also some weird drama in the offscreen lives for some of the cast in this one Paul Kelly had gone to jail for being accessory to murder in a love triangle. Mickey Rooney had an affair with Norma Shearer who was 20 years older Rooney ended up being married eight times. Tyler Brooke Emory and Spencer Charters Pa both knocked themselves off in real life. The title Blind Date has been reused many times for films TV series and even cartoons but none of them seem to have the same plot as this one.";

Columbia signed her to a contract in the mid thirties and she made a series of light hearted programmers with costars such as Edmund Lowe and Gene Raymond. Even though Harry Cohn often boasted that by changing Harriet Lake's name to Ann Sothern he had made her a star Columbia didn't really seem interested in promoting her and it was up to MGM to come up trumps with Maisie.Kitty Sothern is the bread winner of her improvident family  as well as keeper of the peace and advice dispenser and she is getting pretty fed up with it. Especially her full of beans boyfriend Bill I have never seen Paul Kelly so animated before!! who puts work before romance!! When he stands her up on her birthday she listens to her friend and goes on a blind date where she meets debonair Bob Hartwell Neil Hamilton. She starts to live the high life when he gets her a job as a model in his department store but when she dismisses his cave man tactics she suddenly finds herself out of a job. Of course the thing is Bob is completely in the dark about things  his father has sacked her during cutbacks but requests the news be kept from his son. Bob goes on a cruise with his mother not knowing that Kitty is desperately looking for a job. Bill comes to the rescue with a job for her father and the pressure is now on for Kitty to patch things up with Bill  even though she doesn't love him.Bob comes back but Kitty is determined to stick by Bill  he has been involved in an awful accident at work  courtesy of Kitty's father and a blow torch!!! Flora Joan Gale Kitty's sister over hears Kitty and Bob's tearful parting and wants to make it right for them. This is a really nice way to pass an afternoon with the little actors you get to know if you watch enough old movies. Matine idol Neil Hamilton most people know him from the Batman TV show as Commissioner Gordon but he had a huge career starting in the 1920s  he was a D.W. Griffith discovery. Mickey Rooney showed that even during his awkward age there were always roles to be had!!!".

How all this is finally resolved is not too difficult to predictjust suffice to say that in the end everything works out just perfectly.This is a very modest little film from Columbia Pictureswith a relatively small budget as well as secondtier stars. It's clearly a Bmovie despite there being small roles played by a Mickey Rooney and Jane Darwellas both had yet to become famous. Now this is NOT to say that these are bad actors or the production isn't any good. In fact given the production values this is a pretty amazing film as everything seems to work so well despite having a pretty ordinary and somewhat predictable plot outline. That's because the actors and director did a really good job putting the story across. Plus the writers did a good job of humanizing the characters and making you care about them. The ending in particular is really sweet and practically had my tear ducts flowing! Because of these factors the film earns a 7 of 10.".

Bob buying Bill's shop to give Bill and Kitty money and then Bill being a jerk in order to reveal Kitty's true feelings. However all of it kind of fell flat for me. Ann Sothern didn't have chemistry with either of her leading men. I just couldn't believe that she would date let alone consider marrying either one of them. One reason I love classic movies is seeing the fashion and cars of days gone by. Blind Date did not disappoint in this regard. Sothern's dresses were all quite stunning although a bit fancy for a working girl specifically the dresses worn before she met Bob. While I enjoyed this movie it would have been much better with some chemistry between the leading lady and her leading men.

All this family seems to do is bicker over nothing and makes no effort to resolve any conflicts.While this is certainly a good looking film there isn't enough to recommend it past that. Ann Sothern is certainly a lovely heroine but even though she had been in films for several years mainly as a chorus girl she was still too green in her acting to hold together an entire movie when everything else around her was mediocre. While Kelly tries to add some softer dimensions to his character he never fully hits the mark. Hamilton seems to be just stuck in the rut of playing less than noble wealthy men sort of a poor man's Ralph Bellamy who never got the girl even though he used every dirty trick in the book.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is good in it's genre and that genre is naturally action with a littleaverage budget. Looks like Van Damme delivers greatly better performances when he has a good director guiding him. There is your basic bar brawl alley scene and mostly a lot of gun fighting. Some basic drama but nothing too deep. Isaac Florentine directs an OK action flick if you ignore the weak plot and the holes in it. But the person who steals the show is Scott Adkins. How come this guy isn't a massive Arnold Schwarzenegger caliber action star that I don't know. Director Isaac Florentine has made a movie with Scott Adkins before called Special Forces 2003 which has some unbelievable martial arts talent that will satisfy the most demanding kungfu enthusiastic. Another amazing Scott Adkins feature is Undisputed 2. Check this guy out and make a noise this guy needs to get super action star status and he needs to get it now!What else can I say about the movie? It's Van Damme stepping up a notch from some of his most recent work. No Oscars here for sure but you already knew that. But never the less it has a nice little town feel and I could find worse ways to spend my time. So I'm giving this a solid 7 out of 10 in it's genre.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film is good in it's genre and that genre is naturally action with a littleaverage budget. Looks like Van Damme delivers greatly better performances when he has a good director guiding him. There is your basic bar brawl alley scene and mostly a lot of gun fighting. Some basic drama but nothing too deep. Isaac Florentine directs an OK action flick if you ignore the weak plot and the holes in it. But the person who steals the show is Scott Adkins. How come this guy isn't a massive Arnold Schwarzenegger caliber action star that I don't know. Director Isaac Florentine has made a movie with Scott Adkins before called Special Forces 2003 which has some unbelievable martial arts talent that will satisfy the most demanding kungfu enthusiastic. Another amazing Scott Adkins feature is Undisputed 2.

The Shepherd is a throwback to his 90's films where plot was minimal and fights and other action scenes took centre stage where everyone knew they were making a pot boiler and had fun doing it. And thank God because while no biggie plot wise this movie delivers everything you'd want from a Van Damme movie.

It's also well directed starting with a great sense of humor then turning dead serious when it needs to.

Like Forrest Gump might have said about his movies a JCVD film is like a box of chocolates you just don't know what you're going to get though you most likely have have some inkling and there are more than a few turkey flavoured ones in his box.With perhaps the lamest title of all his films and a dubious 'Steven Seagal' like premise not to mention some cringe inducing dialogue fair share of implausability and plot holes nice to know they have a full time bomb squad and short notice standby in a little border town of 1800 this could be called something of a coin toss or even something to avoid for the more discerning film fan who can't stand the guy or who feels the urge for more intellectual stimulation.For those with enough of that in their other pursuits and who just want to kick back and be entertained you may be pleasantly surprised. On a night I was expecting to fall asleep in front of anything I watched It kept me interested and awake something 'The Godfather' didn't do last week.As an out and out action vehicle I found this pretty entertaining. It keeps moving along with several spectacular and hard hitting ass whipping scenes sufficient gunplay thrown in and a score reminiscent of 'Once Upon a Time in the West'.As far as his recent films go I would compare this to 'Wake of Death' in terms of quality and while it didn't quite nail it like most of his films for the reasons mentioned previously it wasn't without some quality moments.510 as a 'movie'  710 for the bits you watch this sort of film for  610 overall a good pass mark.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the best directtoDVD effort from Van Damme that I have seen yet. Van Damme plays a border patrol agent who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross into the United States. The action in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with Van Damme's best. Costar Scott Adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre. For further evidence check out Undisputed 2. Adkins is so good in fact that before I watched The Shepherd I thought that Van Damme might not look very believable in defeating him on screen. Van Damme holds his own though and although he isn't quite as athletic as Adkins is he can still kick with the best of them. All of the fight scenes in this film are very well done and the gun battles are above average for this type of film as well. The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that the story is a little underdeveloped. I think Van Damme's character's motives should have been presented earlier in the movie especially in regard to why he carries around a rabbit. The reason he does is very cool but you don't find out until the very end. There are a couple of other things that are never really explained either but this is a Van Damme movie so you know where the priority lies in making this kind of movie and it ain't character development. Overall though this is a solid action movie that I recommend. So run for the Damme border!".

	schema:reviewBody "After seeing Undisputed 2 I knew what to expect from Isaac Florentine.The Shepherd Border Patrol is a decent flick not Van Damme's best but definitely not his worst. There is some bad acting from VD's supporting cast but it makes sense.The storyline and plot has all been done before so it's nothing new. I mean this is Van Damme. We don't really expect much of an amazing plot do we? So lets talk about what we all want to watch this movie for anyway the fighting.Without giving anything away I thought the way the fights were filmed and shot were well done way better than a few of VD's recent movies such as Second in Command in which the entire end fight is HORRIBLE. With Florentine behind the camera and if you've seen Undisputed 2 he seems to know how to photograph fights and enjoys it. A few of the fights in The Shepherd reminded me of VD's older stuff which is what we all want to see. The fights were good and i said hah awesome out loud a few times. But I was hoping for just a bit more considering how good I thought Undisputed 2 was.Something I found intriguing was VD's daughter in the film I thought wow she's kinda hot come to find out its Bianca Van Varenberg JC's real life daughter. I have never seen her before so that was a nice treat.All in all this movie is not half bad. Yeah the story has been done before but at least JC was attempting to make a good movie. Next time though add more hand to hand combat! I think He still has what it takes to do another big budget movie...his acting has improved since he's been doing DTV's and he really is in great shape at 47. I don't know about you but I'm one of the ones who thinks that most of his DTV's are actually good with the exception of Derailed. All he needs to do is get back into bloodsport shape and make a martial arts movie...and I think people would respond well even though he's not jet Li. This movie is definitely worth the rental. ".

His latest films have been more acting oriented but in The Shepard JCVD is back to dropping the bad guys and looks to be in excellent shape. There are some impressive fight scenes and Van Damme shows he can still pull out the old famous 360spinning heel kick. For being a lowbudget action movie it does have good sets and great stunts. Van Damme says some humorous lines and shows that he's improving as an actor. I'm glad he's back to dealing out some Van Damage...i've been let down by the lack of fighting in his recent films. Scott Adkins is great in his role and Van Damme and him have a 1 on 1 showdown at the end. Overall it's one of Van Damme's better films and it will keep you entertained. A must rent for JCVD fans. I'm just keeping my fingers crossed for another martial arts epic like Bloodsport or Kickboxer. Nok Su Kow!".

I have nutting against DTV movies ... i love cheesy action movies anyways they should have just called it border patrol.... because that is what the movie is about..Why is it called the Shepard?.. plus it sounds much better as a van damme movie title..he has some hilarious titles I really tried to find things about this movie that I liked but its below average unfortunately........... the town thats supposed to be some Texas town .. is jokes.. its a ghost town........ most likely in some country across the world.. and van damme might say a total of 50 WORDS in the entire movie........SERIOUSLY!!And van damme's pet rabbit... and all of the flash back stuff is wack!! so is his partner........ the female boss was o.k what can i say about this movie...... its pretty bad.. it had no budget  it looks cheap .........

The Sheperd Border patrol is a good action flick with some really great actionfight sequences. It's good to know that Van Damme still knows how to kick seeing as his last film Until Death had no martial arts in it at all!!!That being said this film is significantly inferior to Until Death which was a really good turn for Van Damme. Until Death lacked the overthetop action of most Van Damme films but was dark and gritty and Van Damme's performance as an actor was surprisingly good in that film. Still The Shepherd is definitely a film worth checking out especially for Van Damme fans or just action movie fans in general but if you're looking for a film with a bit more story line.....you may want to skip this one!I do believe that this film was done well enough especially on what little budget it would have been shot on. The only real problem I have with this film is the title The Shepherd? I don't get it! I suppose Border Patrol just doesn't have the same ring to it without the word Shepherd in front of it!!!My rating for this film is 7 out of 10 but that's by Van Damme movie standards not in any other film category.i.e. It's good for a Van Damme film.".

JCVD rocks!!Other stuff after reading other commentsNo music in the dungeon fight? At first I didn't like that at first either but then I thought it was interesting because it threw me off balance a bit by giving us something that we didn't expect. Made it seem more real.I also always get a laugh when directors cry like 2 year olds that their film was stolen from the studio. Directors are paid to do a job. The studio is the boss and they want the product that they want. Very few directors have absolute final cut on a film. In this case JCVD is THE talent and the only reason anyone is watching this film. I am sure he got a film that he was happy with. I have a relative who works at a post house who knew a little of the story. PRESUMABLY the director worked on and delivered his cut of the film. Everyone who saw it said it was a disaster...then JCVD and the studio re edited the movie. This stuff happens all the time. He also did see the final cut which he claims he didn't and his delicate genius ego was severely bruised because they hated his delivered cut.

Haunted by memories of his past it is up to Jack to put an end to a group of ExNavy Seals from smuggling illegal drugs into the U.S. that killed his daughter.Overall I found this film to be very good Van Damme is in very good shape for 48 years old and can really move. The action scenes are very intense and the movie even throws a couple of plot twists in to keep you guessing. Unfortunately Van Damme does not have the same intensity as he did say 10 years ago regardless The Shepherd Border Control is the 3rd straight solid film that Van Damme has made possibly opening the door for a larger project.I definitely recommend this movie to a Van Damme fan or fan of action movies in general The Shepherd Border Control is a great movie not as good as Until Death but better than the Hard Corps.

This movie has an easy enough plot to follow and Van Damme gives a good humorous performance through out but the movie owes all of its credit to the fight scenes involving Van Damme Scott Adkins and the final one of them together. The editing and camera work for most of the film is pretty terrible but Isaac Florentine can definitely film a good fight scene.

A lot of the times the dialogue doesn't match the characters mouth and the stunt men fall down dead a split second before even being shot. The end fight is one of the better Van Damme fights except the Director tries to go a bit too John Woo and fails also introducing flashbacks which no one really cares about just gets in the way of the action which is the whole point of a van Damme film.Not good not bad just average generic action.".

I always look forward to these b grade action films and they keep getting better. keep them coming van damme.Watch this film if you enjoyed films like  Until death The hard corps and second in command.";

A Texas cop battles smugglers. This movie did everything a van damme movie should do which is martial arts and action. Van damme was never a good actor. I think this movie is better than van dammmes last 2. If you're looking for an Oscar winning performance you're not gonna get it here but if you're looking for action and martial arts then this movie is for you. Scott adkins is an amazing martial artist and unfortunately the public has gotten tired of martial art superstars but his movies in this movie are great. Van damme delivers strong kicks and it's good to see him performing martial arts again since he has not in his last 4 or 5 movies. This movie is definitely worth watching if you're a van damme fan.".

I was very well excited about the whole piece.By the time it was titled The Shepherd Border Patrol I was tapdancing in excitement for this flick. With Isaac Fluorentine at the helm of directing and JJ Perry pulling stunt coordination I almost peed me pants in anticipation. Pics were released of JCVD kicking 8 different kinds of arse as well as Scott Adkins playing what I thought was the villain and I was mindblown in excitement. I thought it was going to be another epic martial arts situation like Lone Wolf McQuade.Then it came out. I ordered it off Blockbuster online for 20 and was ready for anything. The reviews from vandammefan.net kinda had my ideas alittle altered but I braced myself. The mail came on day 4 and I ripped open the package. My initial plan was to rush upstairs rip the face off the cardboard packaging then smash the case in the proper dynamics so the disc would land in my DVD player. However I stared at the case for 10 minutes then placed the disc in my player and watched the film.By the time it was over I was cool as a fool in the pool. The Shepherd is certainly one of my alltime favorite directtovideo films ever and makes Derailed look like even more of the toilet mess that it is. Sure some of the fights ran a twee bit short but they were still VERY awesome. The shootouts were superb as was Scott Adkins who SHOULD have been the villain unlike the forgettable Steven Lord.I highly recommend this flick. Seriously.".

Add to the mix political intrigue revenge and romance you have the makings for a perilous journey.This is an okay little scifi adventure film that suffers from a leisurely pacing. Shot in India much of the film is the journey into the jungle which means that their is a great deal of travelogue footage. We see the landscape of India as well as several animal on animal attacks not to mention a troop of traveling performers. Its interesting viewing because its not the sort of thing we've seen before but at the same time it slows everything down.On the plus side this film doesn't really look and feel like most other movies. Its a weird mix of Western and Indian films the result of much of the crew being natives to India. I especially like the non Western music which includes several songs naturally integrated into the film as either entertainment numbers or sung by the soldiers traveling through the jungle.Worth a look for those who want to see a run of the mill story told with a different sort of style.".

	schema:reviewBody "The opening of The Jungle promises us a safari adventure with a science fiction element but mostly what we get is a travelogue with lots of stock footage and padding and the odd leopard attack. The movie is leisurely when you want it to be gripping and tries to inject interest into the proceedings with badly staged matches between various wild animals I had no idea that lions and wild boars were natural enemies in the wild did you? I thought the big cats stuck to hunting herbivores but apparently the producers knew better. As for the actors Cesar does his usual great job of rocking the mustache and Marie Windsor is reasonably believable as the progressively thinking rajah's daughter nice eyebrows btw!. However Rod Cameron is barely watchable as the hunter returning as the sole survivor of his expedition. I'm sure he was in demand in his day but here he comes off as a RentACenter Bogart  rough looking but with none of Bogey's range or timing. He spends the movie going back and forth from stoic anger to angry stoicism and any time the screenplay attempts to crank up some romantic sparks between himself and Windsor you just have to laugh. That crabbed knobby face isn't a good vehicle for tenderness. The screenplay is not entirely without merit although it does make some odd choices. Early in the first act the screenplay makes a point of spending several moments where the heroes decide to bring along the obligatory clever young boy and monkey mascot but then basically ignore them until SPOILER the monkey somehow gets hold of a live hand grenade during the mammoth scene and accidentally tosses near Windsor. This is so Cameron can prove his bravery by diving on it and saving her life at the cost of his own.END SPOILER. It's possible that the Indian version of this movie which I understand ran better than 2 12 hours might have given the kid and the monkey more to do. Another thing that makes the film show its age SPOILERis the issue of the woolly mammoths the plot device that sets the safari into motion in the first place. When they finally appear the way the scene is filmed it's obvious that the mammoths obviously elephants draped in shag carpeting aren't really attacking anyone or even moving all that fast and yet Cameron immediately sets to trying to wipe them out with hand grenades. These days the idea of destroying the last known specimens of a species thought to be extinct would be unthinkable especially when all they seem to do is roll through the jungle at a nice walking pace.END OF SPOILERSo IMO four stars which is pretty good for a Robert Lippert production normally Lippert hack jobs rate two or three stars at best. It's not a train wreck of a film or anything plus it seems to mean wellwith the rajah's daughter arguing for amelioration of the most repressive aspect of the traditional ways and the elements of mixed race romance that was pretty progressive in 1952. And there's some nice scenery and exotic spectacle. See it if someone offers to show it to you for free but don't expect much except an interesting historical chapter of early fantasy cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jungle The 1952  12 out of 4 Lowbudget nonsense about Princess Mari Marie Windsor who moves back to India where hunter Steve Bentley Rod Cameron and Rama Singh Cesar Romero fight over her. While all of this is going on villagers are being killed by stampeding elephants so the three love birds go into the jungle and discover woolly mammoths. The jungle film had been around since the silent days and when you hear jungle and lowbudget you typically expect all sorts of stock footage mixed in with the actors on a sound stage. It's shocking but that's actually not the case here because this film gets the added benefit of having actually been shot in India and these locations are certainly a major plus. Sadly the rest of the film is a major chore to sit through because the 73minute running time is pretty much all start and very little end. We know we're going into the film to see the monsters but they don't show up until around threeminutes left to go in the film so we have to sit through countless dialogue scenes that just go no where and it's clear the only reason they're in the film is to fatten up the running time. We get quite a bit of footage of local animals including several elephants as well as lions tigers and boars. We even get a pretty violent fight between a boar and a tiger that might be the highlight to many even though it never gets too graphic. Being able to see all this stuff was a bonus but the rest of the footage is pretty lame. The sight of the woolly mammoths are a real treat because they're just elephants with some sort of rug thrown over them. I will give the producers credit because they don't look too horribly bad but at the same time it's still very obvious at the trick they did. The three leads are decent in their parts but none of them are worthy of awards. I'd say it's a safe bet that all three were happy with their trip to India so we're lucky we got anything from them. Director Berke was a veteran of this type of film has he was behind the camera on several of the Jungle Jim movies but I can't say I'm impressed with his work as he brings no energy to anything we see.".

However the great American hunter called in to take care of it Steve Bentley Rod Cameron has just reported that everyone in his party but him got killed...and they were NOT elephants but Woolly Mammoths!! So the determined Princess Marie Windsor heads into the jungle with her trusted Rama Singh Cesar Romero to see for herself...and Steve accompanies their party. In addition to Woolly Mammoths the film also features something common in the era...white folks playing the leading roles even though they are supposed to be Indians. Romero can kinda pull it off but Marie Windsor looks about as Indian as Lassie! I think the film was sepia tinted to try to hide this but it doesn't work well. Nowadays such casting is seen as culturally insensitive and insulting. At least everyone else in the film appears to be Indian and the film DOES get the look and feel of India right and the animals seem to be more accurate than most Bmovies where you'd see rhinos and kangaroos and more in the Indian jungle!. Considering it's a lowbudget film I was also surprised that some of the film was actually filmed in that country. So culturally it's a mixed bag.So is it any good? Of course not! It really can't be! It's a product of its times but really isn't all that great...at best a slowpaced and very silly time passer. But when it comes to giant monster films it's better than most not that this is high praise!.By the way if you suffer from Ophidiophobia the fear of snakes skip this film. Trust me on this. Also animal lovers might also want to avoid it as there's a scene where a tiger and Sloth Bear fight and it honestly looks like they just tossed 'em together and let them fight! Fortunately it APPEARS neither animal was seriously injured. Later they toss a boar at a leopard! Great animal lovers they were NOT!".

Cameron was the lone survivor of an expedition where Romero's brother was killed and Cameron comes back with this tall tale about prehistoric mammoths.One thing is for certain. Mammoths were Ice Age creatures who died off when the earth's general climate warmed up. No way would they be living even in a remote area of the Indian jungle.

Cameron was the lone survivor of an expedition where Romero's brother was killed and Cameron comes back with this tall tale about prehistoric mammoths.One thing is for certain. Mammoths were Ice Age creatures who died off when the earth's general climate warmed up. No way would they be living even in a remote area of the Indian jungle. But I guess no one thought of that in making The Jungle.";

She pushes him to reveal the truth about the brutal murder of his mother but Don instead warns her of danger looming in the outside world including a mysterious and threatening man named Malachi. Don pleads with her to break him out of the hospital in order to bring the truth to the surface. But the student dismisses his claims as paranoia... until someone begins to follow her every step. Soon Don's delusions become her reality and she must determine what is real and what is merely the rambling of a madman. Teetering on the edge of sanity she is faced with one last decision  whether or not to take an extraordinary risk that could bring about a spectacular healing in Don's mind... and her own.";

She did not talk or act in the least like a medical doctor and so this automatically gives away the plot of the movie she's not the doctor she's the mental patient! Like we haven't seen that before. The reason for institutionalization and the way she is cured are stupid and not believable even for a movie. I mean if you're tired on a Friday and want a mildly entertaining film this might fit the bill. Just be prepared to be slightly disappointed.".

She hears voices in her room when she's by herself weird people come by in her apartment and one mysterious voice calls her on the intercom. The problematic patience tells her to look around and be careful about something he never specifies which catenate to an intriguing plot. Several scenes are tense and extremely entertaining due to the good directing and acting. Kelly Overton varies from good to bad depending on what the scene is requesting from her. In the end we have a surprise which isn't very understandable and a feel good ending mainly because of the photography direction and the beautiful last song. Considering the subject chosen and how original it was back when released this film deserves nothing less than a 7. Give it a chance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Breaking Dawn starts in a Californian college as Professor Simon associate producer Joe Morton tells his students that they have to perform an intensive six week study of a mental patient in Cape State Hospital as a crucial part of their education fail  they will never become qualified Doctors. A bright young attractive  intelligent student named Eve Kelly Overton is given a particularly difficult patient to study. His name is Don Wake James Haven  is a convicted killer he was found covered in blood besides the dead body of a woman Diane Verona  her young daughter Jenette McCurdy. At first Don won't even look at Eve much less talk to her but like the trooper she is Eve persists in trying to figure him out. Eventually Don begins to talk but what he says frightens Eve he says that someone is watching her  mentions the name Malachay. Eve then begins to see a dark shadowy figure at her every turn as Don churns out the conspiracy theories  bizarre statements Eve slowly begins to lose her mind as the line between fantasy  reality becomes more  more blurred. Is there something more to the supposed nonsense that Don talks other than being the insane ravings of a psychiatric patient...?Written  directed by Mark Edwin Robinson I have nothing but negative feelings towards Breaking Dawn. Now we all like a good twist ending the sort of ending which catches us unawares surprises us works well with the rest of the film  stays in our memory like the cool twist endings to The Sixth Sense 1999  Fight Club 1999 to name just two good examples  to a lesser extent the endings to films such as Scream 1996 where the identity of the killer comes a nice surprise  isn't that obvious. Then of course there are films whose endings spoil everything that has gone before  as an example lets take oh I don't know lets say Breaking Dawn because I have never seen such an awful ending to a film never. Breaking Dawn starts out as a decent psychological horror thriller with spooky things starting to happen to Eve it's not the most action packed film ever by any stretch of the imagination but it holds ones interest it's not the most absorbing film ever either but it is more than watchable  it's not that bad a film until the twist ending I have to keep mentioning it because everything else up to that point which was OK to be fair to it suddenly becomes irrelevant. I am sure there are people out there who think they have this muddled mess of an ending figured out down to the last detail all I can say is that no one will be able to explain this thing in a satisfactory way to me  as far as I'm concerned it doesn't make a bit of sense  never will. Breaking Dawn is crap  it's a waste of time watching it to be rewarded with the lamest ending in film history it's as simple  straight forward as that.Director Robinson doesn't half make a mess of what could have been a decent thriller maybe he thought what he had shot would play out OK or maybe it was ruined in the editing room but I'd imagine it was more likely down to a rubbish script as he tries to tie all the absurdities together within the space of a few muddled minutes  give us all a happier than happy final shot. He builds the tension quite well during the first 80 odd minutes but it's all for nought at the end of the day.Technically Breaking Dawn is fine  it is generally well made throughout. The acting is pretty good Overton is nice  easy on the eyes  puts in a decent performance. Was it just me or did the guy who played Don look like John Morghen star of such Italian sleaze classics as Cannibal Apocalypse 1980 City of the Living Dead 1980 The House on the Edge of the Park 1980 Cannibal Ferox 1981 Stagefright 1987  The Church 1989? OK maybe it was just me...Breaking Dawn is rubbish I hated it all because of the final few minutes. Don't get me wrong it wasn't exactly getting me excited up to that point but it was OK. Definitely one to avoid as far as I'm concerned although it seems to have it's fair share of positive comments on the IMDb...".

I watched this abortion of a movie in the middle of the night due to insomnia and it was absolute garbage. The plot was horrible. The acting was horrible. The movie was utterly boring. malachi looked like the Shadow with Alec Baldwin The Shadow is infinitely better than this as well The character Eve was so undeveloped and 2 dimensional she didn't even grab my attention. I didn't even know her name was Eve. Don was interesting when he kept his mouth shut. The TWIST if you can call it that was laughable and pathetic. When it came the movie had done such a horrid job of building suspense or attachment to any character that I simply thought Who gives a S. The only thing that made me even lift an eyebrow about this movie was the fact the med. teacher was Dyson in Terminator 2 Also a movie that was light years ahead of this motion picture massacre. Anyone who was involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves for wasting 90 minutes of countless people's time. It's no wonder no actor from this movie ever had a fruitful career. In summary.... This movie is so bad I feel dirty and need a shower. Worst movie in history Gigli was better Prom Night the remake was better and dare I say it Saw IV was better...........".

	schema:reviewBody "I've slowly been collecting the films available on DVD of both Catherine Deneuve and Francois Truffaut. Both actress and director have done some stinkers in their time  fortunately Mississipi Mermaid is not one of them.Next to The Soft Skin coincidentally staring Deneuve's sister the late Francoise Dorleac this would have to be my favourite Truffaut film.As well as directing Truffaut also wrote the screenplay. Something that always strikes me about Truffaut is his almost childlike innocence when presenting a story  one could almost call it naivety.There's a scene towards the end of the film where Belmondo returns to the apartment in Lyon with the remains of the loot. He rings the doorbell and Deneuve answers wearing a negligee. In the time it takes Belmondo to reach their room from the street Deneuve changes into her dress puts on her best pair of stockings and shoes then lies on the bed and pretends she is asleep. It's a scene that could almost come from the mind of a child  but that's Truffaut for you.Watching Catherine Deneuve in her films of the late 60's is indeed a sensory pleasure. She is so extraordinarily beautiful it is almost painful for us to watch. Incidentally for those fans there are a couple of topless scenes of her in this film  indeed a sinful pleasure.I disagree with previous posters. I see nothing 'Hitchcockian' about the film at all. As for the 'look' of it  i love the look of the older film stock used in the 60's. It certainly gives films of this period a unique look.Highly recommended for both Deneuve and Truffaut fans......".

This story is more familiar to new audiences who might have watched the horrendous Original Sin 2001 with Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas in the main roles. The only vantage that the remake has over Truffaut's film is the awesome sex scenes which makes voyeuristic viewers go crazy over the bold moments of a poor film.The French version has Catherine Deneuve and JeanPaul Belmondo in a more romantic story that breaks into a good thriller. It has some weak moments but still a good film that is directed by one of the most incredible and hard working directors of all time. The performers are elegant and the way both actors portray their roles in a mysterious and complex style makes of Mississippi Mermaid a very intriguing film where the next moment is the most interesting the most awaited it's full of surprises by the way the ending is different than the one unbelievably made in the remake.Watch it without creating too much expectations and you'll enjoy it. 910".

When Julie arrives in the island to get married with Louis he waits for her in the docks but Louis does not recognize Julie in the passenger vessel and finds that she is totally different from the picture she had sent to Louis. They get married and Louis shares his bank accounts with her. When Julie's sister writes a letter to Louis asking her sister to write to her Louis discovers that the woman is not Julie that is missing. Further he finds that the woman has cleared his bank accounts and left the island. Louis and Julie's sister hire an efficient private detective Comolli Michel Bouquet and Louis travels to France seeking the woman but he has a nervous breakdown in Nice and is submitted to an intense sleeping therapy in a clinic. He recovers and finds that the woman actually Marion Vergano Catherine Deneuve works in the Phoenix Club Priv in Antibes and lives in the lowbudget Monorail Hotel. Louis breaks in her room and when she arrives from the club she tells that she was happy with him but her former dangerous lover Richard had blackmailed her. Louis is still in love with Marion and escapes with her to the countryside. But Comolli is chasing Marion in France accused of murdering Julie.La Sirne du Mississipi is a filmnoir by the great directorwriter Franois Truffaut with an unconventional love story of passion murder and love that hurts. The femme fatale Catherine Deneuve is astonishing probably in the top of her beauty and is delightful to see her face and the topless scenes on the road and in the room. JeanPaul Belmondo is very athletic and the sequence when he escalates the wall of the hotel is impressive. Catherine Deneuve makes this film worth and gives credibility to the passion and lust of Louis. My vote is eight.Title Brazil A Sereia do Mississipi The Mississippi Mermaid".

	schema:headline " Love is An Illusion But a Grand Illusion";
	schema:reviewBody "I am surprised that nobody has yet pointed out that the ending in the snow is an homage to Jean Renoir's Grand Illusion. The film is dedicated at the beginning to Renoir.Jean Renoir was the great humanist director. For him all that matters is how we treat human beings. The same here for Truffaut. The film tells us that it does not matter if you're rich or poor male or female upholding the law or fighting it the only thing that matters is love. This is a romantic film that has occasional touches of a good mysterydetectivenoir film. The Hitchcock film that it most reminded me of was Marnie. There like here it is hard to know if crime or patient love will win out in the end.I did not care much for the New Wave style editing which seemed out of sync with the dramatic story at times. The many shots of Belmondo driving kept reminding me of the beginning of Breathless. The color seemed a bit dull and washed out.The locations are lovely but Truffaut seems to have only one thing on his mind the relationship between the lead characters Louis and JuliMarion. The characters and the audience think they know each other but the film keeps fooling them and us. We are constantly getting new information that makes us reevaluate who they are and they are constantly surprising each other. For example Louis has been telling JuliMarion how much he loves her and how beautiful she is and then suddenly he gets upset and tells her how there are many of her kind  she is not really a woman or a girl but a chick. The term chick is far more demeaning here then the term bitch or slut could ever have been. He tells her that her cold attitude actually makes her ugly. Watching the scene one thinks about how easily and naturally men can degrade women even women they love.The film is a bit long and occasionally meanders but it is emotionally intense at many points along the way. It seems that nothing is happening and then suddenly there's a surprise that makes you think Oh my goodness I didn't expect that. It may not be one of Truffaut's best films but secondrate Truffaut is still better than 90 of other directors' best stuff.".

	schema:reviewBody "Julie you are adorable says Louis Mahe JeanPaul Belmondo to his beautiful new mail order bride Julie Rousel Catherine Deneuve. Do you know what that means? 'Adorable'. It means worthy of adoration. Louis is a wealthy tobacco grower and cigarette manufacturer on the French island of Reunion in the Indian Ocean. When Julie arrived on the island she didn't look like the photograph she had sent him when she agreed to be his wife. She says she was timid and decided to send the photograph of her sister. Louis is enchanted by her beauty and understands her caution. They marry and Louis becomes a husband deeply happy. He tells her she is worthy of adoration just a day or two after he arranges to change his personal and business accounts into joint accounts. That evening Julie has disappeared cleaning out both accounts. Louis goes to France has a breakdown and then by chance sees Julie in a newscast about a new nightclub and the women there who are hostesses. Louis learns she is really a woman named Marion Vergano. Marion's history would lead only the most obsessed of men to think a happy ending could be in the cards. Most of the movie places us in France after Louis has found her and accepted her as Marion Vergano Mississippi Mermaid written and directed by Francois Truffaut is a movie of Louis' obsession of sexual psychosis of parasitic selfishness of stolen identity and of rat poison with a lot of selfrevealing some of it even true dialog thrown in. As much as I think comparing one director to another is usually pointless in this case Truffaut may have watched Vertigo Psycho and Marnie once too often. Still murder at the top of the stairs the star power of Deneuve and Belmondo and some eccentric passing opinions Louis thinks Johnny Guitar is a love story with lots of feeling in it. all handled with Truffaut's characteristic confidence isn't something to pass by. The downside is that Mississippi Mermaid despite all of its advantages at times veers too close to melodramatic parody. You mustn't cry my dear. It's your happiness I want not your tears. I'm learning what love is Louis. It's painful. It hurts me. It sounds better in French but the meaning is just as soppy. Truffaut adapted his movie from the pulp mystery novel Waltz into Darkness by Cornell Woolrich writing as William Irish. The movie didn't do too well the first time out but then underwent a rediscovery of sorts. Unfortunately that meant articles by people who teach film studies at universities. One such person wrote Mississippi Mermaid remains a fascinating exploration of the major themes essayed by movie melodramas of betrayal  a sort of distillation of the amoral nucleus of Double Indemnity and the wilder settings of Key Largo. Distillation of the amoral nucleus? I don't even know what an amoral nucleus is. The salient point for me is that films such as Double Indemnity and Key Largo are above all else tightly told stories. I think Truffaut with Mississippi Mermaid started with a nice nasty obsessional pulp tale but then tried to do too much with it.".

Though considered a 'flop' on its first release it has become a critical success and it is clear to see why. Deneuve's acting style suited the film brilliantly. she constantly gives the impression that she is holding back or hiding something and her character in this film is. I will not spoil it with saying what though it is divulged fairly early on. Belmondo is lovable as the fairly naiive but in love tobacconist. I would recommend this film to all Truffaut or Deneuve fans. It is a brilliant Hitchcockian style thriller with exciting twists and interesting relationships and characters that develop as the film does. The film is approx 2 hrs so you feel that you have not been sold short. Deneuve steals the show in this film and it is clear that at the time of making the film Truffaut was very much smitten with her. A definite must see for any cineaste or moviefan. 1010".

Deneuve's acting style suited the film brilliantly. she constantly gives the impression that she is holding back or hiding something and her character in this film is. I will not spoil it with saying what though it is divulged fairly early on. Belmondo is lovable as the fairly naiive but in love tobacconist. I would recommend this film to all Truffaut or Deneuve fans. It is a brilliant Hitchcockian style thriller with exciting twists and interesting relationships and characters that develop as the film does. The film is approx 2 hrs so you feel that you have not been sold short. Deneuve steals the show in this film and it is clear that at the time of making the film Truffaut was very much smitten with her. A definite must see for any cineaste or moviefan. 1010";

	schema:reviewBody "On the surface Francois Truffaut's Mississippi Mermaid is a taut well made Hitchcockian thriller that features good looking actors including the alluring icy blonde exciting chases and bizarre circumstances. However Truffaut gives the story his own twist by focusing on the characteristic of obsession and how it claws at the protagonist and affects his judgment. JeanPaul Belmondo puts aside his typical suave and cool demeanor to play a wealthy but lonely and somewhat naive tobacco plantation owner who puts in a request for a mailorder bride only to discover that she looks like Catherine Deneuve. Naturally he is taken under her spell and soon discovers she is much more duplicitous than he expected. Many film lovers may know this story better as it was remade in 2001 with Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie as Original Sin. Despite having not seen that film I am confident it cannot be better than this version for two reasons. First of all Truffaut is a much better director able to seemingly tie all these various strings together into a coherent and plausible story. Second there is no way Banderas and Jolie could match the sizzling chemistry between Belmondo and Deneuve. They are capable of being remarkably sexy and sultry without resorting to complete nakedness. This is a sign of true thespian abilities. While not one of Truffaut's stronger works such as his Antoine Doinel series or Jules and Jim it is still an entertaining romantic thriller that manages to be both romantic and thrilling. Given the status of many of these types of films recently there is plenty of reason to revisit this New Wave example.".

Okaythis is tough to believe but okay...but then he helps to hide her from a private detective by murdering him!!!! No one is that stupid! Yes the character Catherine Deneuve plays is quite beautiful but come on folksthis is just silly.

Part Hitchcock homage and part romantic melodrama the film takes so many turns that the characters' behavior becomes totally inconsistent and you can never get a handle on them. The film's attempts to say something meaningful about blind passion and devotion are hampered by Denevue's cold performance. And on top of all that it doesn't even LOOK very good. ";

A title like this makes a film flop even the French title is not much better. Too bad  Truffaut  Deneuve must have been enough to sell it..This is a long film but largely worth it. Clearly influenced by Hitchcock we have an intercontinental story about a personal ad bride her rich husband a theft an identity switch and obsessive love. The plot here is actually very good and takes us on an unexpected trip.The thing that works both for and against the movie is the focus on the relationship. It is an interesting study in how these plot developments are played out in real life relationship with these two people. Unfortunately this is what bogs the film down and makes it ultimately dissatisfying. We do like films to have a real sense of finality and that is missing here.It was the case in many of her films that Deneuve became a canvas for Directors to play their fantasies out on and this time it doesn't work as well. Messy here is the fact that the Director clearly just wanted to have Deneuve take her top off a few times. Deneuve is an actress who always seems very deliberate and thoughtful so these attempts to make her seem spontaneous fall flat. Basically the script needed to be worked out better before shooting began to make this film tighter and shorter and to snap. But Truffaut didn't snap did he? So  it wanders a bit but remains interesting.".

This was Truffaut's second attempt at a Hitchcock movie and I think The Bride Wore Black succeeds better than this one because Truffaut maintains the suspense throughout.

This doesn't take particularly long but the answer is not one he wanted to hear. Through prolonged flashbacks we learn why and the history of the swordsman and the assassin and of the revolution.The film is typically melodramatic for a Korean film and resolutely serious in tone  no HK style comedy moments to be found here. The story can be a little difficult to follow at first but all makes sense eventually. The film goes a bit wobbly at the end but no worse than a Chang Cheh film might do and for the most part I found it enjoyable. The production values are high with some good cinematography to capture it. The fight scenes aren't up to the calibre of the better HK wu xia films but perhaps they're not meant to be  the fights are more realistic in that they're less like choreographed dance routines but there's some wirework and occasional cgi that put the film in wu xia mode. The film doesn't have the best cast unfortunately with the leads being a tad lacking in charm and occasionally difficult to distinguish from each other. There's a young lady in the film that I don't think I've seen before but makes the best impression of any of the principle cast  not just because you see her nekkid... or perhaps it is p The film lacks the charm and grace of the better HK wu xia films and perhaps the beauty too but I only wish HK would make them half this good anymore  TWINS EFFECT 2 does not give me hope that that's about to happen any time soon though Tsui Hark surely still has it in him if he can get the funding and cast. SWORD IN THE MOON is not going to go onto my list of favourite wu xia by any means but it's a whole heap better than ROMANTIC WARRIORS or LEGEND OF THE EVIL LAKE  perhaps better than BICHUNMOO too though I did like that film quite a bit more on a second viewing.

Still the movie was solid thoughtful and visually intriguing. There were slightly jarring tone shifts from the dominant thoughtful and realistic tone of confused loyalties intrigue and blood versus the lighter more flamboyant martial arts sequences. It almost seemed as though the filmmakers couldn't make up their minds about whether the movie was supposed to be a martial arts flick or a historical epic. The story touches nicely on the issue about the need for loyalty versus the need to adapt to new situations. Is it really worth your life and those of your friends to be loyal to one's master or does there come a time when one must submit to the winds of change? Is there perhaps greater courage in leaving the old ways for new ones? How does one decide?

Before watching the movie i went on to IMDb to see what ratings and comments it received. I was worried when I noticed the low numbers and the negative ratings. Despite the hype I watched to movie and to my surprise I found it unbelievable. The story was great just pay attention and the characters and their relationships within the film is astonishing. I haven't seen such a good combination of leading characters in long time. I really felt for both characters and sensed a strong bond. As reading previous posts about this movie not being epic enough or a lack of martial arts I could not disagree more. This film is what it is its not Braveheart and its not Enter the Dragon but it is still a wonderful film that does an excellent job combining story both and action.While Sword In The Moon isn't perfect what movie is? it still is wonderful and moving. Just wait until the ending scene with the music and cinematography together its breathtaking. I only hope more people can see this movie to give it a fair voting.".

It wasn't as if these films were works of art. It wasn't as if these films all came from China Japan Korea or any country in particular if the story had to do with fighting  be it swordplay or fisticuffs  and if the fighting didn't resemble much of anything going on in any American gym class then that was good enough. It wasn't as if they were really even very good. They were just great action flicks with incredibly overdramatic music where the hero reaped his vengeance over a whole host of bad guys and then the credits would roll.Sword in the Moon is much like these films of my youth arguably a bit of a thematic throwback given a welcome twist by muddying the characters up enough that it becomes increasingly difficult to tell the bad guys from the good.Yun Cho Jae Hyun is known throughout the kingdom as 'the human butcher.' He kills quickly and mercilessly on behalf of the Chun Dynasty the chief bodyguard of an Emperor who spared his life and the life of his men in exchange for his service. However an equally merciless rebel and his lovely sidekick appear in the countryside and start murdering imperial ministers and Yun agrees to find these rebels and kill them. His task becomes one of personal discovery when he learns that the two rebels are Choi a friend from his past and his former love Shi Yeong.Sadly Sword doesn't have much to distinguish itself from other action films. Some stunning cinematography is nearly entirely wasted on shoddy editing with portions of the film put together so loosely its hard to believe that what inevitably made it to the film was what anyone intended. While the atmosphere and story tend to gravitate toward a dark mood the tone is almost sacrificed to the neverending parade of flashbacks as each of the main characters is given a healthy story arc. What should've been a quick and easy action film gets weighed down by far too much personal baggage and the film suffers as a result.I've read that this film marks Korea's first real foray into the world of arthouse action pieces along the likes of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Next time I'd strongly suggest that the producers stick with a little more 'martial' and a little less 'art.'".

	schema:reviewBody "Korea the late era of Joseon dynasty Gyuyeob Jaehyeon Jo is a brutal but skilled warrior who starts tracing a mysterious assassin who has been murdering the King's ministers. Soon clues point to the assassin being Gyuyeob's old military friend Jihwan Minsu Choi who he has fond but tragic memories of. What is the truth behind the revolutionary killer and his female assistant Shiyeong Bokyeong Kim?As can be expected from a historical epic the sets costumes and massive group scenes look authentic and the colours of the cinematography such as the green forests and blue night scenes are a joy to the eye. Still it's harder to sink into the world of the film than in say Yimou Zhang's masterpiece Hero largely because of the restless camerawork that would be better suited in an urban modernday action thriller than a historical warrior epic. The camera spins around the characters constantly tracks them shakes as if in the hands of an epileptic and even goes to very blurry slow motion for long periods of time making the already hectic fight scenes confusing to follow. The calmer more static shots in the peaceful scenes look very nice though I wish this approach would have been used more prominently.Technical direction issues aside the film's writing isn't really among my favourites of the genre either. As Gyuyeob is such a cold and aloof warrior it is difficult to relate to him and his emotions about his longforgotten friendship with Jihwan. Now the lengthy flashback scene detailing their time together interrupts the main plot for too long perhaps a traditional chronological structure or showing smaller flashbacks more evenly would have worked better. The longhaired Jihwan is a stylish character though and easily carries the scenes where he is in. The female Shiyeong receives less attention and her role doesn't come across a very significant one despite her implied importance to Jihwan.In summary I think Sword in the Moon is a visually goodlooking but not very effectively directed epic in which the nature of friendship is a major theme. A calmer style of presenting the action scenes would have benefited the whole significantly and suited the extravagant even pompous music better. I guess the characters could also have been fleshed out better but in spite of my complaints the film is not terrible and fans of historical sword epics should find it easily watchable  give it a chance if this type of cinema is your thing.".

It is much closer in spirit to the now very dated Just Jaeckin film from 1973 taking a pokerfaced look at malefemale relationships questioning such then hot topics as fidelity and jealousy all in luxurious exotic surroundings. Unlike D'Amato director Albert Thomas aka Adalberto Albertini who also made the hard to find YELLOW EMANUELLE actually a sexedup version of MADAME BUTTERFLY ! does not present us with predatory drug lords snuff movie makers or rampaging cannibals making for an admittedly less sensational yet far more erotic viewing experience.Photo journalist Mae Jordan aka 'Emanuelle' lovely Javaborn Laura Gemser in her first lead role following bit parts as a Thai masseuse in EMMANUELLE 2 and an 'unspoilt native' in Just Jaeckin's portion of the rarely seen COLLECTIONS PRIVEES flies down to Nairobi where she's to shoot the stills accompanying an article by noted British writer Anne played by the very Teutonic Karin Schubert with a butch haircut that takes some getting used to. Anne shares an 'open relationship' remember when this was made with her Italian husband Gianni Angelo Infanti meaning that both pretty much jump anything with a pulse. Contrary to her subsequent reputation Emanuelle appears positively reticent compared to her heavy breathing hosts smoldering seductively at Gianni by way of foreplay until the exquisitely tantalizing payoff. Okay so she does make up for this lack of wantonness at the end when she does an entire male hockey team on the train. I kid you not.Production on this sexploitation classic is quite impressive especially the superb cinematography. And Nico Fidenco's musical theme is a solid favorite of anyone with more than a passing interest in the genre a hilarious Eurotrash pop ditty try to make out those totally nonsensical lyrics and have a full evening's worth of fun with the family ! that turns up throughout the entire film in every conceivable type of rendition from slow 'n' sexy to hipgyrating disco.This is entirely Laura Gemser's show though. Billed simply as 'Emanuelle' as was another actress on the same director's elusive EMANUELLE NERA 2 she lights up the screen from start to finish. Not yet submitted to endless rape scenarios as she would be once D'Amato took over she seems much more relaxed than in later films even smiling from time to time a rare occasion as anyone who has seen some of the lady's work surely knows. A flawless Eurasian rather than as the title suggests black beauty she hails from Dutch India now Indonesia and is actually quite close in physical appearance to the supposed author of the novel Emmanuelle Arsan she projects a slightly passive even submissive sensuality which somehow detaches her from the 'depravity' her morally corrupted cohorts indulge in. Unlike the French film cheapskate moralizing is kept to a bare minimum almost thrown in as an afterthought near film's end when Emanuelle tells Gianni that he hasn't lost her as he never possessed her to begin with. I swear you could hear audiences of the Just Jaeckin version groan whenever Alain Cuny's supremely irritating Mario showed up on screen as it meant we were in for too many minutes of halfbacks libertine philosophizing as an alibi for getting the divine Sylvia Kristel now living in the Belgian capital of Brussels by the way... to disrobe the real reasons theaters were packed for years on end. Gemser's later husband Gabriele Tinti now deceased she has remarried appears on the sidelines as the constantly drunk 'Scottish' huh ? writer who forces himself briefly on Emanuelle amid the African ruins at some point but no real sex scene though.".

Whenever there was a new  popular trend at the movies whether it was in horror SciFi or drama Italian cinema would immediately cash in on it by rapidly creating their own equivalent. The story basics would be pretty much identical to the original product but the Italian version would distinguish itself with either more gore more violence or much more sleaze. Following the immense success of the French film Emmanuelle starring Sylvia Kristel bearing in mind that for once that film already is a ripoff itself Italy came up with its own insatiable sex nymph who ends every line she says by taking her top of. The gorgeously stunning Laura Gemser plays a photographer called Emanuelle notice how there's only one m in her name to avoid legal difficulties who travels to Africa for...no particular reason actually! No reason other than to have random sex with a bunch of rich males and females that do nothing all day but throw parties and lay down by the pool. The film itself is quite dull with the exception of several beautiful shots of the African wildlife but Gemser is pure candy to look at and the original music by Nico Fidenco is among the best I've ever heard. This first film in a series of 8 starring Gemser strangely also is the least eccentric and most common one! The directing would later be taken over by the infamous Joe D'Amato who transformed Black Emanuelle into a trashy sexguru that shows her sexual skills in all the corners of the world from Asia to America and even among cannibal tribes and inside female prisons! In this first film Emanuelle still is a sensitive and emotional girl whereas she's be a dominating shrew in the later films. No extreme sleazestuff happening here like horsemasturbating for example check Emanuelle in America which is probably why my national TVstation programmed it on Saturday night. However if you happen to have an original copy you should treasure it as this is an extremely rare and hard to find movie!".

Hardly a stroke of genius but very funny!Later entries in the series helmed by sleazeking Joe D'amato combined Genser's softcore romping with other exploitation subgenres making for more satisfying films as a whole. This one however is content to simply show as much naked flesh as possible without ever crossing the line into hardcore territory. It's just about worth catching if you're a big fan of Ms. Gemser andor very trashy films in general but probably of little interest to anyone else.".

	schema:headline " The start of one of the most popular cult series'";
	schema:reviewBody "If it was popular in America you can bet that there will be an Italian ripoff of it and obviously 'Black Emanuelle' is a ripoff of the successful French porn classic 'Emmanuelle'. Black Emanuelle would go on to become a very popular franchise in Italy with the insatiable Laura Gemser getting up to allsorts including an outing into the jungle with cannibals escaping from a women's prison and going to Bangkok under the direction of such trash film luminaries as Joe D'Amato and Bruno Mattei. This first outing is tamer than some of the later stuff but still should satisfy fans of this series. Naturally the plot focuses on Emanuelle a young journalist who travels to Africa on an assignment to have sex with as many people as possible I think. She gets herself involved with a couple named Ann and Gianni Danieli who are having marriage trouble and both turn to the young journalist for a bit of 'comfort'. Naturally things go a bit awry and Emanuelle is forced to flee Africa but with Gianni on her tail...In terms of plot this film is not all that exciting and clearly it's all just an excuse to show as much sex as possible. This actually isn't all that much of a bad thing as Laura Gemser obviously relishes this role and seeing her with her clothes off is what most people will be tuning in for anyway. The music is superb and the title track is absolutely pure seventies trash flick gold and is sure to delight fans of this stuff. Director Bitto Albertini is not a well known cult name but he has a background in cinematography and as such the film looks very nice which compliments the central theme nicely. While Emanuelle would go on to become something much less than innocent in all of the later series efforts this film focuses more on her losing her innocence than the actual sex and that works fairly well as that is basically what the original French film was about. Overall I cant say that this is one of my favourite films and I do prefer some of the later efforts in this series and the original French film but Black Emanuelle is certainly worth a look if only to see the start of one of cult cinema's most popular series'.".

The cinematography is breathtaking as is the sight of Laura Gemser. And we get plenty of both in spades.The plot is little more than a vehicle to transition from one sex scene to the other. Which is fine as all of the scenes have Gemser either participating or present. So no complaints here.Well actually I only have two complaints. The two male leads in the movie Look almost identical And sadly if you are following the story it makes figuring out who's who a nightmare. My second complaint is the Gangbang scene on the train It was shoe horned in and feels like it as it makes no sense at all even be porn standards.In the end It's worth checking out.

In this first installment Mae JordanEmanuelle is sent to Africa to photograph the people as well as the stunning landscape and wild exotic animals. Much like Sylvia Kristels character Emanuelle has not come into her own when it comes to being open and comfortable with her own sexuality. This first film is basically about how she becomes the Emanuelle that most exploitation cinema fans are familiar with. Filled with gorgeous cinematography beautiful people and an intoxicating 70's score from the legendary Nico Fidenco this one is sure to please. Those who enjoy the more storydriven style of the original french Emmanuelle should definitely like this as well. The main story here being an interesting cat and mouse tale of a womanizing playboy who comes to the realization that he has fallen in love with a woman who is the female version of him! Sexy fun and totally entertaining throughout a soap opera to be sure but one with enough skin and general eye candy to keep the male viewers entertained. For some reason this is the hardest one in the series to find on DVD. there has never been a legitimate DVD for this which is very strange. The bootlegs that sometimes appear online will have to do until someone gives this diamond of a film a proper release.".

Incredibly there were 16 Black Emanuelle films in total with the heroine even having the spelling of her name changed to avoid copyright issues!! Still Laura Gemser  the titular object of desire  became almost as much of an icon as the original Emmanuelle Sylvia Kristel although personally she's too skinny for my tastes! Here she's even billed as Emanuelle rather than with her real name  with the director likewise becoming Albert Thomas! In itself the film offers little of interest as a matter of fact one would do best to approach it as a travelogue with some decent footage of the African wildlife. With respect to the sex scenes I don't know how complete the version I watched was but while there was a lot of nudity none of it was very explicit  or even titillating the scene that came closest perhaps was when Gemser  who works as a photographer  and her companion Karin Schubert turn the camera on each other naturally sans clothes in the middle of the jungle! The film also features an artist made up to look like Salvador Dali but mercifully perhaps his scenes do not take much of the running time. The score by Nico Fidenco is typically bland 70s pop and really nothing to write home about.".

The ygen cops are basically match and alien two unconventional cops. Think great teacher Onizuka but more annoying. These two idiots always manage to save the day in the most unusual way. For example whilst on a stakeout they use a cellphone to call for backup only remembering in the nick of time they had accidently picked up the bomb phone. Thus destroying there ferrari. Both speak English well kinda anyway. They try to speak English throughout most of the movie but what they say just comes out as lame. As this was a chinese movie I was surprised that most of the film is English. Incredibly as far as I can tell it was not a dub!! Although when they do speak chinese it is subtitled well when the filmakers can be bothered to. Sometimes they speak entire sentences and no subtitles come up!Anyway getting past all this basically the R1 robot is to be sold to the highest bidder. The R1 is an almost indestructable machine which is loaded with weaponry. The hong kong police and the FBI want it back before any damage is caused. But this is ygen police I doubt thats gonna happen! What follows is a large number of action sequences which can be pretty thrilling at times. Especcialy the ending. If you just wanted a film that you could just sit down to and have a good time ygen cops is probably it. Although beware my the movie on my DVD came in full screen and not widescreen which can be rather distracting at times but by the end of the film you should be used to it.I find it hard to rate ygen me and this film have a lovehate relationship. The voices annoy me the action scenes excite me. So I'm going to give it a 6 out of ten".

	schema:reviewBody "Gen X Cops was an fun blend of drama comedy action and technology.  I was disappointed to see that only a couple of the original cast members came back for the sequel especially since it was the group of them that helped make the first film so appealing.The plot of Gen Y an armed American robot is kidnapped by its creatorprogrammer and used to commit chaos and revenge etc etc etc and consequent subplots are really second to the action.  There's quite a bit of humorous dialogue between the two Hong Kong partners though the character of Alien truly does overact in a number of scenes and his use of English slang is overdone.  For the most part though this is an action movie with an emphasis on technology not to be taken too seriously and is quite a departure from the first film.  I think it might have worked just as well as a movie on its own instead of a sequel but I didn't finance it.The special effects are amusing some well done and some not quite so well done the action sequences are well choreographed and the new cast members hold their own especially Edison.  He's cute got some good moves and I'm looking forward to seeing more of him in future films.  What in the world was a blonde Paul Rudd doing here though???Don't expect the most serious film in the world.  Just sit back relax be amazed cringe and wait to see what the next sequel brings us!7 out of 10".

I was disappointed to see that only a couple of the original cast members came back for the sequel especially since it was the group of them that helped make the first film so appealing.The plot of Gen Y an armed American robot is kidnapped by its creatorprogrammer and used to commit chaos and revenge etc etc etc and consequent subplots are really second to the action.

	schema:reviewBody "Review I lost interest in this film from the get go! The movie looked cheap and extremely dated and I wasn't impressed with the action. Its about a robot which has been made to be the ultimate fighting machine but when it gets stolen from an exhibition by a computer hacker a group of young cops who were hired to protect the machine fight to save the world. One of there fellow cops are drugged and used against the cops so the head of the FBI agents Ian Curtis Paul Rudd attempts to get back the robot and kill the agent who has turned to the darkside. The young undercover cops manage to find out that there fellow agent has been drugged so they try to prove his innocence by getting back the robot there own way whilst fighting against the hackers who have different plans for the robot. Personally I didn't find the comedic scenes that funny and the gun tooting cops weren't that interesting. The robot looked ridiculous especially towards the end but on the plus side it's quite short so I didn't have to put up with the movie that long. I wasn't a big fan of the first movie because it seemed a bit messy and this film isn't much better. The trendy young cops just didn't seem to take the whole situation that seriously even though there is a lethal robot on the lose so I have to give this movie the thumbs down. Disappointing!RoundUp Starring a young Paul Rudd who looked uncomfortable throughout the movie this supposed to be action movie wasn't that great and the scenes with Paul Rudd made me laugh because of were he is today. This film was directed by Benny Chan who brought you the first movie in this franchise along with Who Am I? New Police Story Divergence RobinBHood and the great Shaolin. This movie would have been much better if it didn't have so much comedic content which wasn't written that well and it feels like I'm beginning to sound like a broken record because I have said the same thing about a lot of the movies that I have seen recently. Anyway this film was produced by Jackie Chan who also produced the first movie and you can see that they used his style of action during the fighting scenes. Its just a shame that the movie wasn't that great!I recommend this movie to people who are into their actionscifi movies starring Paul Rudd Mark Hicks Edison Chen and Stephen Fund. 210".

The real star of the film is newcomer Edison Chen. He makes a great replacement for Nicholas Tse as...Edison. I also enjoyed Paul Rudd's performance of Agent Curtis...he seems to be the tough as nails smartmouth FBI Agent you'd love to hate...but soon you'd like his character.The fight scenes are a lot better in this one...even though there are very few but they are great courtesy of Jackie Chan stuntman Nicky Li.Look for a cameo from Ron Smoorenburg as a cage fighter who has a teeny little fight with Match.

Here you have some of the cast no Nic Tse? from the first movie trying to stop a Transformers reject from shooting people.  Why were there robots to begin with in this movie?  For the most part robots in movies haven't even been cool since 1988.  On top of that you have Match and Alien from GenX cops walking around talking street jive.  What'supmyman? Plus there's Edison  or as I call him The Asian Marky Mark because really after watching him you feel like he should have said Feel the vibration!  He has the look... the Funky Bunch look.Paul Rudd well I dunno.  He's just there being an Angry American Government Agency Guy A.A.G.A.G. who becomes a friend over the course of.3 seconds.  There's a story of Edison's old friend being the one who madesabotaged the robot and made it kill but does it matter?  Does it really matter?Nope.So really all we're left with here is Stephen Fung Sam Lee and the Asian Marky Mark having to fight Megatron while Paul Rudd struggles to keep up. Oh that and they speak English for a good portion of the movie  which they do considerably well if you overlook how obnoxious it is.  By that I mean you hear WHOOOOOOAAAA MAAAAAN! every 15 to 45 seconds usually Alien Sam Lee's fault.In my opinion the only redeeming quality this movie had was the music it played on the DVD menu.  Other than that there's really not much to it. Stick with GenX Cops.  That's all you need.".

I think the newcomer Edison is really a hit in the movie but I really find Sam's 'Alien' stupidly annoying with English.  Although the movie had some flaws with the robot graphics and the silly dialogue the action always keeps it strong. The action setup is much stronger than the 1st.This movie is getting more of an American feel since 60 of the movie is in English from the Cantonese.  This movie will not disappoint you. I recommended this for young 'uns that care about pure actionpacked fun.".

It was a successful film that got by on its youthful excesses and energy alone but this followup is something else entirely.Only Stephen Fung and Sam Lee return from the first movie but this time around they're joined by another prettyboy Edison Chen and a plot that seems to be a mash up of ROBOCOP and a dozen other robotthemed movies. In a nutshell a young computer hacker manages to win control of a police robot that's been designed to subdue criminal elements with maximum firepower it's up to the young heroes to put a stop to his plans.GENX COPS II METAL MAYHEM is a cheesy film to be sure and also very funny with it. So many scenes are played for laughs particularly anything including Sam Lee's character that at times I suspected that Benny Chan was making an outandout comedy. Everything involving the robots is particularly entertaining with wild anythinggoes effects work and a real zeal when it comes to destroying the scenery. The plot is slapdash and all over the place but the action is ladled into the mix thick and fast so that it all becomes very effortless and entertaining.Of the cast the central duo of Chen and Fung are merely required to look cool and kick ass which they do at frequent intervals. Maggie Q appears in a minor nexttonothing role before she got famous and American comedian Paul Rudd appears as a typically wooden westerner. Best of the bunch is Lee whose humour helps to make this movie a great deal of fun.".

He steals it back and will sell it to some Arabs. But the FBI are working with the Gen X Cops of the Hong Kong police and the job is up to them to stop this from happening. But things run hot between the FBI and the Gen X Cops.Storywise then Gen X Cops 2 Metal Mayhem was sort of stupid and they tried to incorporate a lot of really bad comedy that just didn't work out in any possible way. If anything then the attempts at comedy just made the movie even worse than it initially was.What impressed me was that they had managed to get Paul Rudd to participate in this movie. And honestly then I must say that he was actually doing a good job and it was a nice change to see him in an action movie and not in the usual romantic comedies that he usually stars in. And another treat was seeing Anthony Wong make a short appearance a cameo much like Jackie Chan's cameo in the first movie. But still despite Paul Rudd and Anthony Wong then it wasn't really worth it to sit through this movie.There was a good amount of action in the movie that worked well in the favor for the movie however the fighting was stunted and halting and the special effects weren't anything to applaud. And this really brought the movie down a couple of notches.And what was up with the lame part about using Edison Chen and Sam Lee's actual real life names as the names of their movie characters as well? That was just ridiculous.Do not watch the first one and then watch the sequel immediately after because you will be sorely disappointed.".

Stan a Scotsman wearing a kilt loses his underwear. A blast of air from a grated vent raises his kilt. It is clear from the reaction of the crowd including fainting women that Stan's manhood has been exposed! One of the oddest moments in all of silent comedy has to be the scene in which a tailor attempts to measure Stan's inseam so that he Stan can be provided with a pair of pants. The virginal Stan is terrified as the tailor repeatedly attempts to place the tape measure up near Stan's er manhood but fails because Stan in his infinite shyness keeps jumping away. Finally Ollie takes over and after chasing Stan into the dressing room presumably succeeds in taking the measurement offcamera Ollie then emerges from the dressing room disheveled but successful.Now the truly bizarre part Stan slowly emerges next from the dressing room and it is completely clear that his reaction to the ordeal is meant to be that of one who has been raped the horror on his face is unmistakable. Within 15 seconds he goes through the several stages of survival devastation followed by anger and resentment and finally uncontrollable grief.Perhaps the funniest thing about this movie is a repeated gag in which every time Stan escapes Ollie's presence he apparently causes such a scene that 100's of people immediately flock from all directions to see what has happened. That such an immense number of people would repeatedly fly from everywhere to converge on a single point when they could not possibly have any idea what has happened is quite funny.A very entertaining 19 minutes of Laurel and Hardy made in the days before they were officially teamed up as the pals we remember them to be.".

Yeah overall i must say this one did not feel really that clever or interesting and I have seen many funnier works from the duo also from the same year already. I do not recommend checking this one out and I am actually glad it was that short as I did not find it memorable at all. If you plan on taking a dive into the duo's filmography I encourage you but do not start with this one here. Thumbs down.".

At this point Laurel was much funnier and more interesting while Hardy in most of the previous outings had too little to do. 'Putting Pants on Phillip' is still worth watching and is an improvement on some of their previous short films to me it's easily one of their best at this point of their careers and one of the first to feel like a Laurel and Hardy short rather than a short featuring them.Personally would have liked more sly wit that made their later entries better though the slapstick does entertain and is timed well if a bit too far on the simplicity.The story is a bit busy at times and both slight and formulaic. Laurel however is very funny and sometimes hilarious. Hardy is at least not wasted and he does give one of his funniest and most interesting appearances of his pairings with Laurel up to this point and has much more to do in comparison to their previous outings. The chemistry is certainly much more here than in previous outings of theirs namely because there's more of them together if still evolving. Support is nice.A good deal of the humour is well timed hugely energetic and very funny with everything going at a lively pace and there is a lot of charm and good nature to keep one going as well as a surprising bizarre one that doesn't feel too much. 'Putting Pants on Phillip' looks quite good still.To conclude decent and far from pants. 710 Bethany Cox".

I thought that was a pretty risqu idea to offer movie viewers of the day  Stan or in this case Philip with nothing on underneath his kilt!

Once things got going though we never heard another word about it. It doesn't matter the boys make it entertaining enough in this early team up of theirs although a couple of the bits seemed over done like Philip's argument with the ship's doctor Sam Lufkin and the extended measuring tape scene. I guess once they had an idea back in the day they milked it as much as they could.Getting back to StanPhilip's underwear did you notice this? When he set down the kilt for the young lady to cross the street the shorts he was wearing were longer than the ones he started out with! I also noticed that the Hal Roach crew liked to recycle their story ideas from picture to picture. This is the third time I've seen Ollie as J.

The first film they appeared in was a comedy starring Laurel with Hardy in support The Lucky Dog from 1921. The second film they made together at the Hal Roach studio Duck Soup not to be confused with the Marx Brothers film of the same name nor the Edgar Kennedy short actually has humor more typical of their mature work. If you can get past the unusual characterizations in Philip Stan is a kilted womancrazy Scot and Hardy is his American uncle fearful of being embarrassed lest someone find out he's related to this eccentric young man the film offers some solid laughs. It's beautifully paced and edited do try to see this in a theater with an audience where it really comes to life. The credited director is Clyde Bruckman known best as a gag writer for Buster Keaton and later Harold Lloyd and still later The Three Stooges. He only made 20 films as a director but they include Keaton's The General Laurel  Hardy's The Battle of the Century Harold Lloyd's Movie Crazy and W.C. Fields' The Man on the Flying Trapeze each of these titles being among the best films their respective stars ever made.

In light of this it's not surprising then that Ollie and Stan are playing such unusual roles.In this case they are NOT friends nor do they know each other when the film beginsa highly unusual situation for any of their films. Plus Ollie appears to be a successful mana big departure from his usual role and Stanley a nephew visiting from Scotland. Talk about a different Laurel and Hardy plot!! The rest of the film concerns the hilarity ? that occurs when Ollie takes his kilted nephew through the city. Again and again huge crowds gather to laugh at the sight of a guy in a kilt. While as an American I do find the idea of a man in essentially a skirt funny it certainly was not as funny as the film tried to make it seem and was certainly not enough to sustain an entire comedy short! Now there were some funny moments here and there but laughing at a kilt and laughing as Stanley chased women much like Harpo Marx in later films just isn't that thrilling. As a result of this and the bizarre chemistry I think this one earns a 6. For devoted fans of the team like myself it's a mustfor most others its a film best not seen until you see their better films as this one might give you the mistaken impression that their films weren't that funny.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so I am happy to see any of their films. It is 1893 and J. Piedmont Mumblethunder Hardy is meeting his Scottish nephew Philip Laurel wearing a kilt at the port with a note from someone saying to make him feel welcome and guard him well. After having a physical examination mouth heartrate temperature coughing head lice which Piedmont watches laughing he only stops when he realises he is Philip. They sit down for a moment and Piedmont asks Philip what he's interested he answers wimmen jumping kicking and chasing at the sight of them. They start walking Piedmont wants to Philip to be behind at a distant and a confused crowd follow and stop when Piedmont instructs. They stop and have the crowd plus a police officer Charles A. Bachman laughing at Philip as he jumps and kicks following the woman Dorothy Coburn and having that same crowd gather round him with Piedmont having to pull him out. They keep walking and Philip has his kilt blown up by the subway grating and when he sneezes making his pants fall down women faint at the sight of whats underneath. After getting out of another crowd Piedmont takes Philip to go and get measured for some pantstrousers and obviously this isn't happening quickly with Philip fidgeting. When he eventually gets his size Philip escapes from the curtained fitting room out the window seeing that woman again and Piedmont gets him out of another crowd outside. They then get onto an open top bus and when Philip jumps and kicks to chase after the woman again another man in the same Scottus clothes delays Piedmont from going after him again. Eventually Piedmont says he will help Philip meet the woman only to get a flick on the nose from her so Philip tries his luck. He helps her walk well jump across a puddle placing his kilt over it she walks away jumping and kicking like him and Piedmont walks over the kilt covered puddle plunging in and soaked. Filled with good slapstick and all classic comedy you want from a black and white film it is an enjoyable silent film. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians' Comedian. Worth watching!".

At first Ollie is laughing it up with everyone when this strange little man unboards and draws a great deal of attention to himself by the way he's behaving during his medical exam but is quite humiliated when it turns out that this is the fellow he's supposed to be greeting. He has been told that Philip is a good boy but he has one weaknesswomen. Mumblethunder and Philip set off to go home but their journey there is continually interrupted by Philip breaking into a little dance every time he sees a woman then chasing after the woman. Huge crowds gather each time this happens not so much because he's chasing skirts but because Philip himself is also wearing a skirt a kilt. Finally Mumblethunder manages to drag Philip into a tailor's shop to be measured for a proper pair of pants but Philip escapes from there as well to chase more skirts. There are lots of laughs all around. It's also nice to see a short like this because the boys aren't exactly the characters we know and love. Ollie is pretty much his usual character but it's such a joy to see Stan acting so differently from his usual manchild character. It shows he wasn't a onetrick pony and excelled in other types of roles when he got the chance. With a run time of 19 minutes its short and sweet providing classic one liners which still have me in stitches.".

In the film Hardy plays an American who is highly respected and dignified in his town. He receive a letter telling him to pick up his nephew Laurel at the dock and when he gets there he's shocked to see him dressed in a kilt. Not only is he dressed in a kilt but he also doesn't know how to act when he sees pretty women. This is a pretty good short and certainly a lot better than the duo's first movie. The movie has plenty of funny scenes but the highlight has to be Laurel's silly jump whenever he spots someone he's attracted to. He does this jump at least ten times in the film and I laughed at each and every one of them. The two's comic timing together is also worth noting as it's obvious the two are learning to work next to one another. Other funny moments include a preMarylin Monroe sequence where Laurel walks over some vents which raises his kilt up for everyone to see what's underneath.".

Also there was no English audio or subtitles but I don't think I missed much because of that... Two people are brought in to make a porn video. They do their thing for a while of course all the hardcore action is pixelated... and then they take a break. When they come back they tie up the girl and have some BDSM type of play but the chick isn't really digging having dildos shoved in her ass. When they try to give her an enema she flatly refuses. They take another break and when she isn't looking she's hit in the head with a baseball bat. When she wakes up she's tied to the bed. Someone cuts her foot off and then her arm. They cut her tongue up with some sort of shears then cut a hole in her stomach and play with her intestines. The male porn actor then f!cks her in her gut wound. Then they smash her in the face with a meat cleaver. When that's done one of the film crew hits the guy over the head and knocks him unconscious also. They cut his nuts off and that's pretty much it.This film won't really appeal to any normal person as entertainment. It is definitely sick and disgusting and is the whole reason I sought this film out so on that level I was not disappointed. The fact that there is no story at all makes it less enjoyable. I know it's supposed to come off as a snuff film but it's obviously not real. The tongue scene is obviously fake as are the other gore scenes but the special effects are decent and it is still VERY rough. Only recommended to fans of AUGUST UNDERGROUND or perhaps FLOWER OF FLESH AND BLOOD or DEVIL'S EXPERIMENT from the GUINEA PIG series. 610".

It's never been on DVD and what I got from Ebay was a very good quality DVDR which I'm quite satisfied with. The movie is I believe the most extreme example of torture porn with an emphasis on porn. A woman responds to an ad for a porn movie and goes with the producer to a place where it is filmed. The porn is definitely real with the annoying Japanese pixelation to try and hide the hardcore shots without much success most of the time. After the porn movie is shot and the actress is ready to leave she gets clubbed over the head with a baseball bat and taken back to the room and savagely dismembered in slow shots and in one of the most disgusting scenes the male porn guy screws her in an open wound in her chest. This is after both legs have been severed her arm and a few other niceities. This movie outdoes the Guinea Pig series by a long shot in fact they are not even close to the realism although cheap gore effects shown in this movie. This is indeed one of the best fake snuff films I have ever seen if not the best. Now I must warn you that if you are not into this stuff you should stay far far away. This movie is very strong and with the real sex it is in a very sick way erotic to an extent. And I mean in a very sick way. But wherever you come down on this subject material this movie brings the goods home and I would definitely recommend you seek it out. After reading about the movie I was expecting something very strong but it exceeded that by a bunch.".

Don't expect much in first 30  40 minutes . There is some dialog  if you don't speak Japanese it's not going to mean much to you  that seems to be an occasional chatting between the girl and the crew  performer  then there is some porn  straight sex   and after the scene is finished the performers and the crew take a break .

After watching  Niku daruma  it looked like a fairytale to me .This movie is so sick  so depraved  so twisted  so disgusting that the harshest words pale in comparison to it's finale .

She's soon beaten unconscious and then tortured for the remainder of the movie. It's a pseudo snuff film done right essentially. Unlike my last review on August Undergrounds Mordum this movie actually had a story which really helped the progression of it as a whole. Unfortunately there isn't to my knowledge a copy online with subtitles so I did have to watch it in full Japanese. I understood around 25 of the dialogue but it's not essential to fully understand it as you can gather what is being said through the general tone of the scenes which adds a massive plus to this movie for me. I think what gives this movie the disturbing factor is that all the sex scenes within it are completely real. The only fake parts are the gore which still actually look real in my opinion. Naturally this isn't a film for the family or for the weak stomached folks out there as there is a lot of sex violence and extreme gore including stomachwound rape. The characters and the scenes out of the main plot are so mundane which I feel makes it a lot more believable because it genuinely looks like something a couple of amateur snuff film makers have put together. We're also treated to a storyline so we fully understand what we're watching and whereas the production value is low the concept and the execution are fully on point. The fact that there is no remorse for what they are doing really adds in bonus points for it seeming like a genuine snuff film too.Think of me what you will for endorsing this movie but out of all the pseudo snuffs out there Niku Daruma is the one to watch. It is 18 and can only be found online so don't go into this with the heart of a Disney character. It's dark it's disgusting but I found it to be better than most shock horrors out there.".

	schema:headline " Fun if overthetop comic fantasy";
	schema:reviewBody "Big Fat Liar' offers a lively contemporary spin on the Boy Who Cried Wolf legend.  Jason Shepherd is a 14yearold inveterate liar who spends most of his time devising elaborate yarns to keep himself out of trouble with his parents and teachers.  One day through an amazing fluke he meets up with a nefarious movie producer named Marty Wolf who steals Shepherd's story idea  a composition he wrote for his English class entitled Big Fat Liar'  and proceeds to make a movie out of it.  When Jason's parents refuse to believe their son's outlandish tale the youngster heads out to Hollywood to confront Wolf and make him verify his story.  When Wolf refuses to do this Jason concocts an elaborate scheme to make Wolf's life a living hell until he relents and helps make things right back home.Kids will love Big Fat Liar' for the simple reason that it works as pure adolescent fantasy wishfulfillment on several levels.  First it shows a youngster getting the rare opportunity of turning a major studio backlot into his own personal playground the film sometimes feels like a 90minute commercial for Universal Studios' behindthescenes tour.  Second it feeds the desire we all have to watch the tables being turned on a certified rascal.  And third like any good fantasy for children it puts the kids in a position of power over the adult world.  Jason and his pretty cohort Kaylee get to call the shots and pull the strings that eventually get the grownups to pay attention and listen to them.Big Fat Liar' might actually have been a better film had it resisted the tendency to overdo so much of its comedy.  In fact the best parts of the film occur near the beginning when Jason and his adventures stay connected to the real world.  Once he gets to Hollywood the film loses a bit of its edge.  The cleverness and wit of the film's opening stretches give way to overwrought plot mechanics and overthetop slapstick.  The film has a great deal of undeniable energy but subtlety can be a virtue as well and we miss that sense of sly fun that defines the film's ambiance early on. Still Big Fat Liar' has more to recommend it than the average teen comedy. First of all it stars the marvelous Frankie Muniz Malcolm in the Middle' who has energy and charm to spare in the role of Jason and who literally keeps the film bouncing along even when the comic setups don't always pay off as well as they should.  Muniz is one child actor I will miss when he grows too old to still play these parts.  Amanda Byrnes is equally likable as Jason's conspiratorial companion Kaylee.

	onyx:emotionText "Big Fat Liar' offers a lively contemporary spin on the Boy Who Cried Wolf legend.  Jason Shepherd is a 14yearold inveterate liar who spends most of his time devising elaborate yarns to keep himself out of trouble with his parents and teachers.  One day through an amazing fluke he meets up with a nefarious movie producer named Marty Wolf who steals Shepherd's story idea  a composition he wrote for his English class entitled Big Fat Liar'  and proceeds to make a movie out of it.  When Jason's parents refuse to believe their son's outlandish tale the youngster heads out to Hollywood to confront Wolf and make him verify his story.  When Wolf refuses to do this Jason concocts an elaborate scheme to make Wolf's life a living hell until he relents and helps make things right back home.Kids will love Big Fat Liar' for the simple reason that it works as pure adolescent fantasy wishfulfillment on several levels.  First it shows a youngster getting the rare opportunity of turning a major studio backlot into his own personal playground the film sometimes feels like a 90minute commercial for Universal Studios' behindthescenes tour.  Second it feeds the desire we all have to watch the tables being turned on a certified rascal.  And third like any good fantasy for children it puts the kids in a position of power over the adult world.  Jason and his pretty cohort Kaylee get to call the shots and pull the strings that eventually get the grownups to pay attention and listen to them.Big Fat Liar' might actually have been a better film had it resisted the tendency to overdo so much of its comedy.  In fact the best parts of the film occur near the beginning when Jason and his adventures stay connected to the real world.  Once he gets to Hollywood the film loses a bit of its edge.  The cleverness and wit of the film's opening stretches give way to overwrought plot mechanics and overthetop slapstick.  The film has a great deal of undeniable energy but subtlety can be a virtue as well and we miss that sense of sly fun that defines the film's ambiance early on. Still Big Fat Liar' has more to recommend it than the average teen comedy. First of all it stars the marvelous Frankie Muniz Malcolm in the Middle' who has energy and charm to spare in the role of Jason and who literally keeps the film bouncing along even when the comic setups don't always pay off as well as they should.  Muniz is one child actor I will miss when he grows too old to still play these parts.  Amanda Byrnes is equally likable as Jason's conspiratorial companion Kaylee.  And even though Paul Giamatti seems to be doing a Jim Carrey impersonation through large sections of the film this fine comic actor hits heights of magnificent manic madness as the putupon hissable villain of the piece.  The movie also has a fun time ribbing many of the elements of Hollywood culture  from the unemployed actors' working as chauffeurs to the hasbeens looking for that big career turnabout to the insipid material that often serves as the basis for big studio productions a movie about a cop teamed up with a crimefighting chicken is the example here.

Title indicates one factor gaining higher level of denial. Frankie Muniz may have to attend summer school if a particular report isn't passed in. It ends up in the hands of greedy filmmaker Marty Wolf who makes a film out of its contents. To prove his innocence Muniz and Amanda Bynes go to Hollywood to obtain the report and sabotage Wolf's career. Mean spirited comedy where the villain's only friend is a stuffed monkey without indication as to why. Screenwriter never examines possible hurts of Wolf but stages him for juvenile sight jokes. Directed by Shawn Levy with Paul Giamatti as the scheming Wolf in a variation of his role in Private Parts where he was much more rounded. Muniz and Bynes become virtually unlikable. Jaleel White spoofs his sitcom role in what appears to make him a good sport but ultimately his leaving his famed Family Matters role left him with bigger matters and this film doesn't solve those. Donald Faison plays a limo driver and struggling actor and after this film he will likely be struggling much more. Honesty theme isn't the focus particularly when one examines the dreadful marketing. This leaves the biggest lie told by the ads. Score 2  10".

To prove his innocence Muniz and Amanda Bynes go to Hollywood to obtain the report and sabotage Wolf's career. Mean spirited comedy where the villain's only friend is a stuffed monkey without indication as to why. Screenwriter never examines possible hurts of Wolf but stages him for juvenile sight jokes. Directed by Shawn Levy with Paul Giamatti as the scheming Wolf in a variation of his role in Private Parts where he was much more rounded. Muniz and Bynes become virtually unlikable. Jaleel White spoofs his sitcom role in what appears to make him a good sport but ultimately his leaving his famed Family Matters role left him with bigger matters and this film doesn't solve those. Donald Faison plays a limo driver and struggling actor and after this film he will likely be struggling much more. Honesty theme isn't the focus particularly when one examines the dreadful marketing. This leaves the biggest lie told by the ads. Score 2  10";

Because this flick is super lame and cheesy and doesn't have a sense of direction. It seemed like an average 12 year old wrote the script to the whole thing in one sitting. Actually even that 12 year old could probably write a much better script than this. It makes the Captain Underpants books more readable as an adult than watching through this childish movie. All the acting in this movie is uber childish even for a kids movie. Maybe I am being a bit too harsh on this suppose to be family flick but this movie is just childish fantasy so again it might work for kids under 10. The message is about telling the truth but the direction and journey to get to telling the truth is a real headache. This is a definition of a cardboard movie. The main reason I was able to get through this flick is because I was doing my homework while watching this. And guess what? I enjoyed doing the homework more.2.310".

Along the way he meets up with a director who happens to be filming a movie where Urkel is a cop with his partner as a chicken. The kid leaves his paper in the limo of the director and he turns it into a movie. Jason then goes to Hollywood and steals vandalizes and lies more in order to learn that lying is wrong. Oh and instead of planning how to get the director to admit he stole the film from Jason he and the girl have a 2 minute montage on them trying on clothes. They eventually find everyone who hates the director and ruin his career. So remember kids lie vandalize and steal and someday you too can have a bad movie yourself!".

	schema:headline " Decent teen comedy with a bit of Hollywood satire.";
	schema:reviewBody "My Take Harmless yet funny enough to sit through.BIG FAT LIAR is nearly a throwback to an old 1960's comedy frequently released by Disney. Surely it ain't much different from a teenageoriented TV show released by Nickelodeon. But despite being just another simpleminded nottoodeep comedy I found some fine and consumable about BIG FAT LIAR. It's plain simple fun enjoyable and frequently energetic. The laughs are definitely aimed at kids to older teenagers and would deem too harmless for even the most easygoing of adult viewers but the film has no too little energy and innocent charms that entertained the nottoocritical side of me.Here's your first clue that the film is a teenage TVshow extended to movie length The lead star is MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE's Frankie Munez stars. He plays Jason Shepard a averageordinary teenager who can't live a day in his life without stretching the truth in short terms he really is a big fat liar. He also wrote a story something he needs to pass his class. Inevitably it falls in the hands of selfcentered moneymongering Hollywood producer reminds you of anyone? Marty Wolf Paul Giamatti who finds it his next big mustsee. Now Jason who has no one who believes in him but his best friend Kaylee currentNickelodeon graduated Amanda Bynes they set off to the bigstreets of Tinseltown to get back his script and at the same time give good ol' Marty a little jolt a little payback.The gags are frequently physical humor which means discard all your thoughts for some biting sense of humor or sarcasm. The satire on Hollywood producers are just among the closest we'll ever get to sharp nonphysical humor. Other than that prepare for frequent messups wild slapsticks and other humor you'd expect from a wildly hyperactive 60's Disney comedy. But the difference with BIG FAT LIAR is it is quite funny. Giamatti makes an agreeable costar even if I yearn for him as frontandcenter amongst costars Munez and others but seeing him as a moneyhungry tycoon of Hollywood producer is fine with me. Kids and tweens will find the slapstick humor nonetheless suitable for them. Adults might crave for more but as it is BIG FAT LIAR is decent and passable.Rating  out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jack Bender's The Tempest is an adaption of Shakespeare's play The Tempest. Bender transports the plot from medieval Italy to Mississippi during the time of the American civil war. He includes the slavery problem and the role of revenge in wartimes.Prospero renamed Gideon Prosper is not the Duke of Milan but a landowner in Mississippi. He learns voodoo magic from the female slave Mambo Azaleigh. He saves her son Ariel who thus accompanies him into his exile. The island is not situated on the sea but in a swamp near the banks of the Mississippi. There lives an Alligator hunter a socalled GatorMan who later tries to rape Prospero's daughter Miranda. During the time of the civil war Ariel wants to join the Union troops to help fighting against slavery. Prospero does not care about the war. He is only interested in his personal revenge on his brother Antony. When Antony and his bookkeeper Willi Gonzo Gonzalo try to cross the river Prospero raises a storm. The Union soldier Frederick gets lost in the swamp and finally comes to the island. He and Miranda fall in love with each other but Prospero won't accept that. Meanwhile Ariel transformed into a raven by Prospero finds out that Antony has feigned to ally with the Union but plans to betray them. Antony and Gonzo meet Gator Man in the swamp and conspire with him against Prospero. They kidnap Miranda and Ariel but Prospero freeze them and helps the Union defeat the Southern army. In the end Ariel is free Frederick and Miranda are bound to marry Prospero returns to the plantation and Gator Man gets back the island.Peter Fonda represents Gideon Prosper powerfully and convincingly while the character of Antony stays rather flat. It was no bad idea to perform the Tempest before the background of the civil war but perhaps the director has risked too much. In some parts the story seems constructed or comical. Gator Man for example does just appear without any explanation. That it needs a kidnapping to bring Prospero to his mind and that he loses confidence in his power shows that Bender tried to make Prospero more human but only made him a weak old man without his magic. Prospero's original authority and wisdom is not made clear.End of Part 1".

The movie refers to the Shakespearean play The Tempest which was published at the end of the 16th century. The director tried to create an modern version of this play but failed. At the beginning of the movie the plantation owner Prosper gets in a conflict with his brother Antonio about the treatment of their slaves. Antonio sets his brother a trip and tries to kill him but with the help of a witch Prosper is able to escape and flees with his daughter and a slave called Ariel to a small island nearby the Mississippi river. For over twelve years he has lived isolated on this island till a lucky chance enables him to take revenge on his brother....If Prosper will be lucky you have to find out by yourself.In my opinion this film is really a bad try to create a modern version of the original play by William Shakespeare. The story of the movie is confusing as well as the characters. Prosper doesn't have the same powers as in the tempest..... END OF PART I".

For someone who comes from such a talented family it's a mystery to me why Peter Fonda can only play Peter Fonda trying to play someone else.  And that's the good news in this disappointing dog of an adaptation of The Tempest.  A string of loosely connected ideas that only suggest a relationship with the Bard's great play is what we're served.  The setting is the Civil War and Prospero's here Guideon's evil brother looks like an 1890's melodrama villain complete with Snidely Whiplash moustache.  I kept waiting for him to go Uh ha hah! which would have been a high point in this dreary presentation.  None of the supporting cast was memoriable and Peter Fonda's lack of expression and wooden body movements made the lackadaisical story drag on and on. The Tempest is the Bard's statement about the rage of man's unjust treatment of man.  The only believable character was the Gator man the Caliban counterpart.  The transferrence to the swamp had possibilities but the Civil War setting just didn't make it.  All in all a very disappointing production.  I saw it on video and would advise if you want a Willy Shakespeare fix save your money on this one.  Rent something else like Branagh's Much Ado about Nothing or Kevin Kline in Midsummer's Night Dream.".

Dont expect to see an epic however you should find it moving enough to enjoy. By the way on a side note don't compare this or any other movie for that matter to the original work.  Movies aren't supposed to transfer a book to the screen but rather take the general idea of it a then adapt a story from it. When people say the book was so much better they're usually wrong anyway what they are really trying to say is the book was so different.".

She's working as a singer whilst he's churning out scripts for government propaganda films and living off the last in a long line of infatuated women. The two former lovers feel the thunderbolt once more but Thomas is now married to the adventurous Caitlin. Despite their loverival status the women form a surprising friendship. Caitlin indulges in her own infidelities and recognises a similar adventurous spirit in her husband. But she knows his connection with Vera is something different not to mention dangerous.

Do not get me wrong there are many good things in The Edge Of Love. It just did not touch my heart the way that Atonement did.The acting is uniformly fine. Tabloid darlings Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller especially proved that their performances in Atonement and Factory Girl respectively were no flash in the pan. They were both excellent. Cillian Murphy is also good as Keira Knightley's war traumatised husband and Matthew Rhys got to the heart of the indifferent drunken selfish chancer that was Dylan Thomas.The Edge Of Love looks fantastic. Contrast and compare the cinematography of the 'London during the blitz' setting of the first half with the bleakness of the Welsh coastal town of the second half. The first half of the film presents almost a fantasy world Dreamy and just out of focus. Smoky pubs soft lighting and shadows. The second half of the film presents a hard reality Harsh pebble beaches and wide open spaces. Rain grass pain and small town mediocrity. In the former romance flourishes amid the cigarette smoke and the alcohol in the latter romance fractures and there will be a reckoning for bad behaviour.I will say at this juncture that most critics have written that the film loses it's heart when it moves out of London. I disagree. I think the film becomes real and true once it moves to Wales. The second half is my favourite half of the film.But sadly and whisper this very quietly The Edge Of Love is just a little bit too dull. Mood movies and The Edge Of Love is definitely a mood movie have to walk a very fine line between immersion in atmosphere and the demands of plot to keep the punters interested. Too often The Edge Of Love falls into the former. It needed more story.Not a bad film just one that could have been better.".

While it may prove boring to some the movie does have a particularly dangerous edge to it.At one point my heart was racing towards the end as the movie hits its climax. It really does feature some poignant moments that are handled with skill by the four main actors. Cillian Murphy is on fine form here as is Matthew Rhys. Both are polar opposites and it makes for an interesting watch. The relationship formed between Sienna Miller and Keira Knightley's characters is wonderful and we have the acting to thank and watch out for a cameo by Suggs of 'Madness'. Despite all of this it's a rather slow movie. Coupled with the fact it's just shy of two hours it's quite a slog to get to the conclusion.Overall it's a solid nonfiction war movie with many wonderfully crafted moments that were no doubt helped by the splendid number of wellknown British names behind the scenes. But it really does drone on for too much at times. Still a worthwhile watch. 710".

Some people may find it too much a biopic but it s mostly a romantic story even though it consequently follows the life of Dylan Thomas and the triangular relationship which is steeped by joy and jealousy. London gets visualized from another angle for once the bohemian life of Dylan during the bombings of the Germans is set in a floating atmosphere of small bedrooms pubs and bars. The independent women the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly swept in both feelings of love and anger. Maybe the end is too twisted and hangs somewhat loosely to the rest of the film but all in all this is a great romantic story.".

London gets visualized from another angle for once the bohemian life of Dylan during the bombings of the Germans is set in a floating atmosphere of small bedrooms pubs and bars. The independent women the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly swept in both feelings of love and anger. Maybe the end is too twisted and hangs somewhat loosely to the rest of the film but all in all this is a great romantic story.";

I realise that Dylan Thomas was not meant to have been an overly pleasant man but I failed to see why the seemingly likable headstrong character of Vera Phillips ever fell in love with him. He came across as completely selfish and sleazy with virtually no redeeming qualities and it frustrated me that there seemed to be no explanation for every woman fawning over him. Characters made choices out of the blue and eventually I just grew to dislike all the characters I have loved in the first half.What also grated about this film is that sometimes I swear I could have been watching 'Atonement' the amount of time Keira Knightley said Come back to me. I really hope she wasn't trying to relive the glory of 'Atonement' through this film because I am afraid she will be sorely disappointed. Even though I personally did not enjoy 'Atonement' I can recognise that it is a marvellous film and sadly The Edge of Love just cannot compare.".

I know that the war isn't the focus of the film and they had to be shooting on a tight budget but the grainy newsreel bits just don't cut it. Nor especially does a flashback sequence toward the end shot to look like an old home movie and where I wondered did they get the color film stock for those home movies when color film was being rationed even to the major studios? which comes off as saccharine and desperate. Killick waging war in a Greece that looks exactly like the shale quarry used in any thousand old Doctor Who episodes doesn't fare much better but the shock and resolute terror in Murphy's extraordinary blue eyes lend a jarring reality to the material.Another shortfall There's no story really no arc.

Performances are possibly the best by these actors in their careers. As a lush love story it's pretty good. As an insight into Dylan Thomas and the reality of poetry in all our lives not bad at all. And as a tribute to a great man inspiring.The production has been at pains to project the spirit of Dylan Thomas without compromising historical accuracy too much. Dramatic tension involves a pull between artistic freedom and conventional morality. Audiences looking for an experience based on the latter may be disappointed. And it will play less well to audiences whose boundaries are those of Albert Square.Sharman Macdonald seemed aware of the headstrong nature of artistic freedom and its limits when she spoke to producer Rebekah Gilbertson granddaughter of the real William and Vera. Think of all the things that you don't want me to write about she said because I have to have carte blanche. For Macdonald the limits were if she should cause offence to Dylan's memory. But for many artists especially men the limits are those which wife and family could set on them. A woman is not going to let lofty ideals interfere with practical common sense issues and will even put her children's interests before her own This occasionally happens the other way round as when towering genius Virginia Woolf refused to let loving Leonard bring her down to earth  in The Hours.In spite of the tension between Caitlin and Vera these two women become closest buddies.

Shortly after meeting Vera's litupinlights stage persona we encounter Caitlin through her searing blue eyes sparkling in a darkened railway carriage. Her dramatic red coat cuts a dash through streets of colourless homogeneity triumphing on a beautiful staircase as she reunites with Dylan. But Vera's lipstick red brightness is less enduring. For her marriage is secondbest even when she has become possessed with genuine love for her husband.Outstanding cinematography extends to using montage to juxtapose images in a manner similar to poetry's juxtaposition of unrelated words to create further meaning. Horrific war scenes in Thessaly are intercut with screams of Vera in pregnancy. Giving birth or is it abortion? We are not told immediately. Pain is universal and goes beyond time and place to our present day.Constant echoes of Dylan's poetry throughout the film lead us beyond earthly opposites. It reminds me of Marlon Brando reading TS Eliot in Apocalypse Now. A light beyond the horrors of the world. A different way of seeing things.

Elsewhere Caitlin recalls childhood with Vera We're still innocent in Dylan she says.There's a time to leave your knickers at home or share a universal cigarette. Not literally perhaps.

	schema:headline " Portrait Of An Artist as a Bad Man";
	schema:reviewBody "From the start of The Edge Of Love the viewer is transported to the striking world of WW2 London. We follow the lives of four people who might have been created just for this movie an exploration of female friendship and the strains caused on it by marriage and infidelity. Except one of the characters is named Dylan Thomas perhaps the greatest English poet of the 20th century. And his reactions to the world around him were not only selfish but at times truly despicable. This movie is based on Thomas' writings about love and romance. These were adapted with a sharp screenplay by Sharman MacDonald Keira Knightley's mother. The director John Maybury does claim that the three other lead characters were actual people. All four are performed very strongly. Sienna Miller is Dylan's wife Keira Knightley is the cabaret singer Vera Phillips. Matthew Rhys is Dylan Thomas and Cillian Murphy is William Killick. The first section of the movie takes place in London during the Nazi air raids with Vera being pursued by Willaim a soldier waiting for deployment. By a chance encounter Dylan meets with his first love Vera. From there Vera meets Caitlin Dylan's wife. While the three are drinking William successfully breaks Vera's guard. The film follows their lives as Vera and William are married and he is sent to war. Vera has become pregnant and returns to Wales with Dylan and Caitlin. There they face a gritty existence with Vera supporting Dylan and Caitlin with her husband's war pay. Through these times Vera's and Caitlin's friendship grows. So does Dylan's infatuation with Vera. She gives in. This creates the first test for the two women. When William returns from war he barely recognizes his wife and has no bond with his infant son. Things get worse as Dylan idly watches his friend struggle with battleground fatigue post traumatic stress disorder. William realizes something has happened between Dylan and Vera and in a drunken rage shoots up Dylan's house.Edge Of Love starts as a stylish romance in war torn London and ends in the stark gritty life of motherhood infidelity and attempted murder in Wales. The treatment of PTSD is well done and should speak to an American audience. Some day see ending.Each star has a great moment. Miller when she is yanking out stitches in her head in response to her abortion of another man's child. Knightley and Murpy when he finally bonds with his son. Oh hell almost all their scenes are awesome. And Rhys when he purgers himself on the stand to get Vera's husband sent to jail. Yet the real star of the movie is Jonathan Freeman's cinematography and John Maybury's direction. They seem to understand that no matter how good the story or how historical Thomas is this is a film dominated by two great actresses of our time. And they cherish their scenes with stunning shots. While this isn't best picture material it is a very good movie much more engaging than The Dutchess. It has a visual lyricism that accentuates the use of Thomas' poetry. Also this is clearly Knightley's second best performance of her career and perhaps Miller's best. I have always had a weakness for the Artist in struggle whether it's Hulce's Mozart or Hoffman's Capote. But I was stunned at how little sympathy I felt for Dylan Thomas. His struggles with alcohol are well known. But his antagonism of William and Caitlin to gain possession of his first love Vera makes him out to be.....a bad man.So is this Academy Award Worthy? Clearly no. At least not this year. It will be released state side in March 2009 making it ineligible for the Academies. This is 9 months after it was released in Britain. Between Atonement Miss Pettigrew and Brideshead Revisited the US has had its fill of WW2 British period pieces. Too bad. This film is better then the other ones except Atonement. But in this one Knightley's soldier does come back but as a shell of the man who left her.".

We follow the lives of four people who might have been created just for this movie an exploration of female friendship and the strains caused on it by marriage and infidelity. Except one of the characters is named Dylan Thomas perhaps the greatest English poet of the 20th century. And his reactions to the world around him were not only selfish but at times truly despicable. This movie is based on Thomas' writings about love and romance. These were adapted with a sharp screenplay by Sharman MacDonald Keira Knightley's mother. The director John Maybury does claim that the three other lead characters were actual people. All four are performed very strongly. Sienna Miller is Dylan's wife Keira Knightley is the cabaret singer Vera Phillips. Matthew Rhys is Dylan Thomas and Cillian Murphy is William Killick. The first section of the movie takes place in London during the Nazi air raids with Vera being pursued by Willaim a soldier waiting for deployment. By a chance encounter Dylan meets with his first love Vera. From there Vera meets Caitlin Dylan's wife. While the three are drinking William successfully breaks Vera's guard. The film follows their lives as Vera and William are married and he is sent to war. Vera has become pregnant and returns to Wales with Dylan and Caitlin. There they face a gritty existence with Vera supporting Dylan and Caitlin with her husband's war pay. Through these times Vera's and Caitlin's friendship grows. So does Dylan's infatuation with Vera. She gives in. This creates the first test for the two women. When William returns from war he barely recognizes his wife and has no bond with his infant son. Things get worse as Dylan idly watches his friend struggle with battleground fatigue post traumatic stress disorder. William realizes something has happened between Dylan and Vera and in a drunken rage shoots up Dylan's house.Edge Of Love starts as a stylish romance in war torn London and ends in the stark gritty life of motherhood infidelity and attempted murder in Wales. The treatment of PTSD is well done and should speak to an American audience. Some day see ending.Each star has a great moment. Miller when she is yanking out stitches in her head in response to her abortion of another man's child. Knightley and Murpy when he finally bonds with his son. Oh hell almost all their scenes are awesome. And Rhys when he purgers himself on the stand to get Vera's husband sent to jail. Yet the real star of the movie is Jonathan Freeman's cinematography and John Maybury's direction. They seem to understand that no matter how good the story or how historical Thomas is this is a film dominated by two great actresses of our time. And they cherish their scenes with stunning shots. While this isn't best picture material it is a very good movie much more engaging than The Dutchess. It has a visual lyricism that accentuates the use of Thomas' poetry. Also this is clearly Knightley's second best performance of her career and perhaps Miller's best. I have always had a weakness for the Artist in struggle whether it's Hulce's Mozart or Hoffman's Capote. But I was stunned at how little sympathy I felt for Dylan Thomas. His struggles with alcohol are well known. But his antagonism of William and Caitlin to gain possession of his first love Vera makes him out to be.....a bad man.So is this Academy Award Worthy? Clearly no. At least not this year. It will be released state side in March 2009 making it ineligible for the Academies. This is 9 months after it was released in Britain. Between Atonement Miss Pettigrew and Brideshead Revisited the US has had its fill of WW2 British period pieces. Too bad. This film is better then the other ones except Atonement. But in this one Knightley's soldier does come back but as a shell of the man who left her.";

	schema:reviewBody "Where would Hollywood have been without Fredric March as Robert Browning or Dennis Price as Lord Byron famous lovers in their day? Even an actor as normally straitlaced as Michael Redgrave once brought some moody charm to a portrayal of W.B. Yeats. Writers' lives are an endless source of inspiration.But of all poets it was Dylan Thomas the roistering freeloving Welshman who enjoyed a pint or two and drank himself to death in New York at the age of 39 who was closest in spirit to the film industry. During World War II he produced scripts for British propaganda documentaries. He even wrote the screenplay of a vapid melodrama called The Three Weird Sisters in which three old maids in a Welsh village plot the murder of their rich halfbrother. All that is now forgiven.In John Maybury's The Edge of Love Thomas is played by the Welsh actor Matthew Rhys. It's not a fullscale biopic. The film covers four years in the poet's life during World War II when he lived with two women his wife Caitlin Sienna Miller and a former lover Vera Phillips Keira Knightley whom he met again by chance during the war. It seems he loved them both. The relationship of these extraordinary women  to Thomas and to each other  is at the heart of Maybury's absorbing film.How it came to be made is a story almost as remarkable as that of the lovers themselves. Rebekah Gilbertson the film's producer is the granddaughter of Vera Phillips and William Killick. William a war hero played in the film by Cillian Murphy married Vera while she was still in love with the poet. Gilbertson was inspired to make the film when she discovered a book about her grandparents Dylan Thomas A Farm Two Mansions and Bungalow by David Thomas describing their tangled lives. Sharman Macdonald who wrote the screenplay is the mother of Knightley. The part requires Knightley to sing and her mother included songs especially for her. Surely no film with such felicitous family connections deserves to do other than succeed.We begin in London during the Blitz. Bombs are falling sirens are wailing and Phillips is singing to sheltering crowds in an underground Tube station. In a pub by chance she meets Thomas and discovers after all these years that he has a wife and child. Phillips and Caitlin form a friendship untroubled by jealousy or rancour and are soon sharing beds and bathtubs listening to Thomas read his poems exchanging intimate secrets and smoking their heads off as everyone did in wartime. Caitlin turns out to be more experienced in the ways of the world My first was Augustus John he seduced me when I was 15. But it's the refined and soulful Phillips who stirs Thomas's deepest responses and eventually succumbs to his charms. In the meantime she has reluctantly married Killick who has seen her in the Tube station and been instantly captivated by her beauty if not her singing.It is an intense and strangely beautiful film though Thomas himself may be its least impressive character. He is best remembered for Under Milk Wood his verse radio play about a day in the life of the mythical Welsh village of Llareggub whose name spelt backwards was not something polite English teachers drew attention to. I once had a vinyl recording of Richard Burton reading the poem he appeared in a film of Under Milk Wood in 1971 and I've never forgotten the creamy seductive quality of his voice. The legendary charisma the magnetism of the man is something I missed in Rhys's performance. Thomas comes across as a strangely pallid even secondary figure compared with the women in his life.In his previous film Love Is the Devil Maybury explored the turbulent life of painter Francis Bacon and his sadomasochistic relationship with his lover and model George Dyer. The Edge of Love seems to me a richer and more satisfying film. If you ask what insights it offers into the springs of Thomas's creative inspiration I would have to say Llareggub. But as an insight into his egotism his smouldering moods and his general indifference to the feelings of others it is wonderfully sad and revealing.Thomas had a good war boozing and writing while other men including Killick were being traumatised by the horrors of battle. In one scene near the end Thomas's behaviour towards his friends seems unforgivably callous. But this is not after all Thomas's film. Murphy gives us a magnificent study in doomed passion and the emotional debilitation of war. Miller is charming and pathetic as the wife. And Knightley looks almost too exquisitely delicate to be real as she did in Pride and Prejudice. But this is probably her finest performance. And in every respect the film is worthy of her.".

What am I supposed to get excited about? There is a definite problem that there is no clear protagonist. It's very easy to be sniffy about McKie and Hollywood story structure but on the other hand it's very hard to make a film unless you have a protagonist who is in jeopardy and who changes as a result. Vera KK probably gets the most screen time but she doesn't really change much. William Cillian Murphy is the character who faces the greatest danger but we don't see the film through his eyes. Overall I think the performances and the filmmaking generally are good enough there is also plenty of adequate dialogue and texture in the writing but the story isn't really strong enough. It's really a Sunday evening one hour made for TV drama which fits very well with the remit of BBC television but I can't see why it should be on the big screen. Re Sienna Miller as Caitlin I heard Mark Kermode deliver a spectacular condemnation before I saw the film. I sort of agree that the accent is all over the place but that for me wasn't the real problem I just don't think she is mad and bad enough. The gooey ending with KK and SM struggling to part and sort of promising always to be friends is absurd.

She did not even like him when they married end only her own letters made her romantic toward him. The warscenes looked like they were copied from Atonement and were not very realistic.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is about the complicated friendship romance and deceit between two men and two women during the World War II.A lot of effort has been put to make The Edge of Lovelook the right period. However I find this effort too excessive particularly in terms of the tone of the colours. Most of the first half of the film is processed so much to have a strong bluish tone. It's hard to make out who's who in this tone.Another detrimental point is the fancy use of image splitting lens. There are many scenes that have three or four images of the same thing such as three Keira Knightley smiling face or four pairs of arms in embrace. That simply makes the film confusing and hard to follow instead of being artistic.As for the plot it is plain boring. The way the story unfolds is not engaging at all. Sienna Miller's unstable character is annoying. In fact all the main characters are annoying and unlikeable. Keira Knightley's accent is impossible to understand making it a further impediment to understanding the plot.I strongly advise avoiding The Edge of Love unless you watch a film only to appreciate great costumes nice sets and lighting.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE EDGE OF LOVE. I even found the title intriguing. Can the edge of love grow in many strange directions? Does madness live beyond this edge? At times it feels like the film seems to be missing something. It's hard to describe. It's either that or it's just that sometimes you feel strangely disconnected from the characters which somehow makes it even more difficult to stop watching and just turn off. You just can't seem to turn away from this private little world in which one man and two women live. John Maybury definitely has his own unique grammar in film which he himself makes fun of along with actor Matthew Rhys in a commentary track which is as much fun as the movie itself.THE EDGE OF LOVE is set in WWII London and Wales and is based on the life of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas played to perfection by Rhys who obviously had tons of fun doing it capturing the poet's childish yet magnetic vibe. Sienna Miller an actress who deserves to be known for more than just her personal life splashed in tabloids plays Dylan's charismatic sexy yet formidable Irish wife Caitlin with extreme skill.There are other women in Dylan's life of course but only one poses any real threat to Caitlin a Welsh woman named Vera Keira Knightley a gorgeous creature who sings cabaret in the underground pubs of London as bombs shake the ground above. Vera is Dylan's childhood friend and soulmate. The bond between the two is inexplicably vibrant on screen. Again it's like a private world that you are only ever afforded a glimpse into yet cannot resist. It's like visiting aliens. Dylan loves Vera passionately yet he is married to Caitlin and honestly loves Caitlin too. Caitlin grows to love Vera as a best friend though she does give Vera fair warning that if she messes with Dylan behind Caitlin's back there will be hell to pay. It's so bizarre to see these two young women having so much fun together enjoying each other's companionship while this undercurrent of jealousy seethes. Dylan of course loves the attention of two women at once but there is this palpable lack of malice. All you feel is this childish wonder in him.Just a tip for those who might be curious There are no threeway sex scenes or situations other than Dylan loving both his wife and his childhood lover at the very same time while the three live in the same house.Early in the film Vera as much a modern free spirit as Caitlin meets an English soldier named William Cillian Murphy who falls in love with and marries her. Does she return the love? Vera doesn't know. She tells him that only after he comes safely home from fighting overseas will she let him know. He is only gone for a year give or take but he has seen enough horror to scar him for life and William is still so disturbed by the mysterious bond between his wife and Dylan Thomas that what happens next is inevitable. Murphy's acting is top notch as per usual and William becomes the one character in this foursome dynamic that you can actually relate to on any level. You can become William and then again it's like you're among aliens childishly innocent and idealistic aliens who are also extremely narcissistic shameless samplers of everything life has to offer regardless of who gets hurt or destroyed yet never truly meaning to hurt anyone. Theirs is the belief that you can love many people in your life that you can have be involved sexually with many people without it affecting your capacity to love your spouse. Dylan Thomas has plenty of poetry groupies. Caitlin also indulges in sex on the side with various men. Again the only true threat to Caitlin is Vera if Vera and Dylan sleep together. Because then it means something. The threat to William is obvious as well.It is only after Vera has William's baby that she begins to realize that there is something to be said for having someone love you actually love you for real in the real world. The dreamy little universe she has shared with Dylan no longer sparkles like it used to because the unexpected love she feels for the husband she has taken for granted has changed her. Dylan however is not quite so ready to give up the notion that Vera's heart is his. When Vera reads Dylan his pedigree and tells him that William makes her real it redeems her character defines it. Ultimately the threeway bond between Dylan and the two women has to be cut. This means the end of the fragile friendship between Vera and Caitlin but it leads you to ask Was it really a friendship? Was anything between these three real? Or was it all this world of ignorant bliss and sexual freedom?Like this review THE EDGE OF LOVE is strange and hard to describe. You can call it a highly unusual romancehistoric war dramaperiod piece very quirky with memorable visuals and great acting by all four leads. One thing's for sure it's different.".

And all sort of crazy fun that comes with it. It was hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing. I haven't had so much fun in ages. Rumors say it will come a number two but I do not know. It will be hard beating this one. recommended to everyone! It is a must see film. I was suppose to see it at the cinema but I had work at the times it where shown. And been trying to rent it for a month but all the time rented out. Got it today on DVD. Well worth it.".

Harald Zwart is the producer known for films like Agent Cody banks and of course One Night at McCool's.It is about Norwegian crazy fans going to the world cup in Soccer in Germany 2006. And all sort of crazy fun that comes with it. It was hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing. I haven't had so much fun in ages. Rumors say it will come a number two but I do not know. It will be hard beating this one. recommended to everyone! It is a must see film. I was suppose to see it at the cinema but I had work at the times it where shown. And been trying to rent it for a month but all the time rented out. Got it today on DVD. Well worth it.";

You start off disliking the characters mildly and by the end of the film I think it's about 90 minutes long although it feels like 4 hours you have a strong desire to hurt somebody to get your mind of these annoying stupid guys! It should be impossible to find this movie's attempt at humor successful unless you're actually yourself like these stupid hickeys.

	schema:reviewBody "In a way this is one of the great iceberg crashes of the movie industry en par with Waterworld in terms of failed hopes. If you're interested not just in movies but also in the stories behind them then this is a most worthwhile film. It represents the effort of a Hollywood studio 20.th Century Fox to cut in on the highly profitable Emmanuelle franchise which was so profitable that it has been credited with saving the entire French cinema industry. Instead of pulling off another unlicensed Emanoellle ripoff they dug into their pockets and put some serious money on the table and hired Emmanuelle herself to do the writing acting and directing. What this meant in practice was that the actual author of the Emmanuelle books LouisJacques RolletAndriane ! would write the script and direct while his wife Marayat under whose pseudonym Emmanuelle Arsan the Emmanuellebooks had been published and who had consequently become an icon of eroticism would appear extensively in a supporting role. And as a little extra for the American market none other than porn legend Linda Lovelace would star in the title role.But it all sort of went horribly wrong from there on. First of a drugaddled Linda Lovelace became a bornagain Christian after signing on and consequently refused to do any nudity. In fact she even took umbrage against a statue of Venus de Milo on the set because it had exposed breasts. Not a good stance to take if you're going to star in a softcore movie. Poor Linda this was the chance of her lifetime her single possibility to finally cash in a bit on her notoriety by doing a nice harmless movie and she illadvisedly threw it out of the window.Instead of Linda the producers hired French actress Annie Belle which was clearly a lucky stroke. Annie Belle in contrast to Lovelace could act and despite her young age had the brain of a seasoned erotica producer trapped inside her pneumatic body.Unfortunately now it was author and codirector LouisJacques RolletAndriane who played up. He didn't just want to make a sexy movie like Emmanuelle which is exactly what the were expecting of him but wanted to forge a visual pamphlet of his swinging philosophy which the backers had no interest in. Eventually he withdrew his name from the project which is why direction is credited to anonymous which in turn really impeded its marketing. Since the movie is visually first class I bet you that consequently a lot of money went down some river in the Philippines.After all this I expected a conker of a movie but I was pleasantly surprised Laure is in large parts a very sexy movie and had the potential to be a lot better than Emmanuelle. Annie Belle is absolutely stunning and she is well matched byAl Cliver her then reallife boyfriend who gives the ladies in the audience something to ogle at.Laure's advantage is that unlike Emmanuelle it does not try to create the image of an extremely libertine woman who is ready for anything once the lalamusic starts. In particular there are practically no scenes of penetrative sex filmed as softcore i. e. without showing more than nipples and a few pubes like in Emmanuelle  which in my opinion always looks a bit silly and tedious and never really works.The cinematography and settings are absolutely stunning and make Apocalypse Now look like Married With Children. Same for the actors. And some of the music is actually firstrate which in an erotic movie is rarer than hen's teeth. They obviously spent a lot of money on Laure this is not just another cheap Emmanuelle ripoff.Unfortunately like in Emmanuelle there are some very extended scenes of gibberish philosophy which really drag on and make your brain bleed.There is also one pretty tough scene in which Laure and her boyfriend go to their hotel room. A member of their expedition asks Laure to join him in his room and before her boyfriend's eyes she agrees. While she's having noisy sex with the interloper her boyfriend then elaborates that her pleasure is my pleasure. This movie is a lot about swinging and the correspondent mentality which I guess many viewers will find hard to stomach. I certainly did.And there are admittedly some snags in the movie. There is one very surreal and completely incoherent scene in which a transvestite pilots a helicopter over Manila LouisJacques clearly had a thing for intheairsex. They pick up his girlfriend and then he suggests to put the helicopter on autopilot so that she and Laure can get it on. This is Ed Wood stuff. And at the end of the movie they clearly ran out of money and  or ideas so it ends with a hastily throwntogether dream sequence.So I hear you beg of me what's Marayat the chick who supposedly wrote all the Emmanuellebooks under the pseudonym Emmanuelle Arsan like? Seeing her is a bit like having the real Superman appear in a Superman movie. She has a pretty extensive role as Myrte a foxy oriental babe who is in a threesome relationship with a blonde chick naturally and a professor. She is a very sexy woman and it is no surprise that her husband according to the producer was besotted with her. She has several erotic scenes which somewhat softer than other scenes in the movie you can however tell that she is less of an actress and more of a model because her timing and delivery are a bit lackluster.My bottom line is still that Laure is definitely worth checking out. Sorry for being so verbose but I hope you enjoyed my review. My account of the making of this film is based on the statements included in the extras section of the 2007 DVD release.".

Annie Belle is absolutely stunning and she is well matched byAl Cliver her then reallife boyfriend who gives the ladies in the audience something to ogle at.Laure's advantage is that unlike Emmanuelle it does not try to create the image of an extremely libertine woman who is ready for anything once the lalamusic starts. In particular there are practically no scenes of penetrative sex filmed as softcore i. e. without showing more than nipples and a few pubes like in Emmanuelle  which in my opinion always looks a bit silly and tedious and never really works.The cinematography and settings are absolutely stunning and make Apocalypse Now look like Married With Children. Same for the actors. And some of the music is actually firstrate which in an erotic movie is rarer than hen's teeth. They obviously spent a lot of money on Laure this is not just another cheap Emmanuelle ripoff.Unfortunately like in Emmanuelle there are some very extended scenes of gibberish philosophy which really drag on and make your brain bleed.There is also one pretty tough scene in which Laure and her boyfriend go to their hotel room. A member of their expedition asks Laure to join him in his room and before her boyfriend's eyes she agrees. While she's having noisy sex with the interloper her boyfriend then elaborates that her pleasure is my pleasure. This movie is a lot about swinging and the correspondent mentality which I guess many viewers will find hard to stomach. I certainly did.And there are admittedly some snags in the movie. There is one very surreal and completely incoherent scene in which a transvestite pilots a helicopter over Manila LouisJacques clearly had a thing for intheairsex. They pick up his girlfriend and then he suggests to put the helicopter on autopilot so that she and Laure can get it on. This is Ed Wood stuff. And at the end of the movie they clearly ran out of money and  or ideas so it ends with a hastily throwntogether dream sequence.So I hear you beg of me what's Marayat the chick who supposedly wrote all the Emmanuellebooks under the pseudonym Emmanuelle Arsan like? Seeing her is a bit like having the real Superman appear in a Superman movie. She has a pretty extensive role as Myrte a foxy oriental babe who is in a threesome relationship with a blonde chick naturally and a professor. She is a very sexy woman and it is no surprise that her husband according to the producer was besotted with her. She has several erotic scenes which somewhat softer than other scenes in the movie you can however tell that she is less of an actress and more of a model because her timing and delivery are a bit lackluster.My bottom line is still that Laure is definitely worth checking out. Sorry for being so verbose but I hope you enjoyed my review. My account of the making of this film is based on the statements included in the extras section of the 2007 DVD release.";

	schema:reviewBody "I finally saw LAURE and I have to say that I equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it. What's great about it is the atmosphere the music the location the cinematography and the beautiful cast. The story is nonexistent for sure but with these movies it doesn't really matter. The pace in languid and the settings are exotic. The film has a lot going for it. Unfortunately it also has a few things going against it. The first thing is that the gorgeous Annie Belle and the handsome Al Cliver have no chemistry whatsoever. Because the two are playing a couple and are on screen for almost the entire length of the film the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite liability. According to IMDb Al and Annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie. They sure kept their attraction to each other from showing on screen.The other problem with LAURE is that some sex scenes are just ineffective or even ridiculous. There's one sex scene that stands out as one of the silliest I've ever seen in any soft porn flick our young blonde couple are pickedup by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a crossdresser! The pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend ! and they have an orgy of sorts in the helicopter in midair. And Al Cliver is filming all of this with his 16mm camera! I kid you not. Ridiculous. We later see that 16mm footage being edited on a moviola. While the footage rolls Al and Annie start making out. This scene is actually good but the footage on the screen behind them was at times too much. Watching the footage of the crossdresser getting it on with his bimbo while piloting the helicopter almost had me rolling on the floor laughing out loud. Is this supposed to be erotic or believable in any way? The last thing I want to see is a woman pleasuring a man in drag certainly when the man in drag makes for such an ugly woman while piloting a helicopter no less. Al and Annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene. I just wish the footage on the editing screen wasn't so silly.Speaking of drag another dull plot point in LAURE which really drags the movie to a crawl are all those moments with the great Orso Maria Guerrini and his two wives. A married threesome is an interesting idea but it hardly registers here as hot or even interesting. The two women are sorta dull and we rarely see the three having sex. In fact Orso keeps his clothes on for almost the entire film even when he's with Annie Belle. This is another minor complaint about LAURE there's nudity but it's not as much as other films of the same era. It just needed more skin to punch it up.Except for those minor complaints and the drag queen moments LAURE is actually very watchable. I love these kind of softcore films from the 1970s when the attention was set on mood and atmosphere not the crude stuff we see today.p.s. make sure to watch Emanuelle in Egypt which stars Annie  Al but also another famous screen couple Laura Gemser and Gabriele Tinti. The music in that movie is also great.".

The other director however is the primo Italian trashmeister Ovidio Assontis who was responsible for The Exorcist ripoff Beyond the Door and the Jaws ripoff Tentacles. Here he's basically ripping off Jaeckin's Emmanuelle in collaboration with the original female author. The strange result of all this is a film that is as allegedly arty and laughably pretentious as the official French Emmanuelle series but every bit as lowrent and derivative as the many Italian ripoffs of that same series although unfortunately it's not nearly as entertainingly sleazy as the Joe D'Amato Black Emanuelle films.The movie concerns a miniskirt clad underwearaverse young woman Laure Annie Belle who is traipsing about the Filipines on some halfass anthropological expedition to find a lost native tribe. If this were a d'Amato film the tribe would turn out to be cannibals and eat everybody but don't get your hopes up here. She is encouraged by her photographer boyfriend Al Cliverto have sex with anybody and everybody older men women local natives and even at point a transvestite helicopter pilot! usually while he films the encounter.Belle was a very pretty French girl with a fantastic body who always looked incredibly sexy despite the bleachblonde crewcut Annie Lennox hairdo she always wore. She was starring in and sometimes even writing movies like this from the time she was barely 18 years old She also appeared in Jean Rollin's Lips of Blood Masimo Dallamano's End of Innocence Ruggiero Deodato's House by by the Edge of the Park and with Laura Black Emanuelle Gemser in Velluto Nero. Emanuelle Arsan herself also appears in the movie and she too has a plethora of nude sex scenes. Strangely she actually looks a lot more like the Black Emanuelle Laura Gemser than the official Emmanuelle Sylvia Kristel. The real problem though as others have said is the lamebrain plot of this movie which is pretty boring and really adds nothing at all to the eroticism. I guess I'd recommend this to my fellow 1970's Emmanuelle completists. But while it's not terrible it's not that great either.".

This serious tale has the beautiful Annie Belle playing Laure a young woman who goes around the Philippines on a anthropological expedition to find a lost tribe. Her boyfriend Al Cliver wants her to be free so he recommends she have sex with every man and woman that she can. Also known as FOREVER EMMANUELLE this is yet another sexploitation film that features nonstop sex and nudity but at the same time after the first few scenes you can't help but get bored. This movie here is a complete bore from pretty much start to finish because there's nothing ever going on that makes any sense nor does anything happen to make you feel as if you're using your time for a good thing. This movie is so incredibly pointless that after the first thirtyminutes or so you begin to wonder why you're wasting so much time with so many movies like this. Joe D'Amato would end up making countless Emanuelle films and the majority of them were bad but at least they had some sort of exploitation going for them. When the group enters the jungle to locate the tribes nothing happens except it gives Laure more people to sleep with. At least D'Amato would have had some people either eaten or killed. There's no question that Belle is a beautiful woman so seeing her naked and in countless sex scenes is going to be the main draw. Cliver is always fun to watch even when he sleepwalks through a part as he does here but that might be unfair to say since whoever is dubbing him does such a poor job. The sex scenes are never very erotic and the dumbest sequence has to come when a transvestite picks Belle and Cliver up in hisher helicopter and an orgy breaks out in the front seat. The film runs 91minutes and if you want nothing but nudity then this might work for you but if you demand at least a somewhat interesting plot then you're going to be sitting through some pretty boring stuff that never adds up to much. As to who really directed this thing is still up in the air but Arsan gets credit for it and if she was the director then it certainly wasn't her field as she never brings the material to life and things just come off rather cold and bland.".

The film runs 91minutes and if you want nothing but nudity then this might work for you but if you demand at least a somewhat interesting plot then you're going to be sitting through some pretty boring stuff that never adds up to much. As to who really directed this thing is still up in the air but Arsan gets credit for it and if she was the director then it certainly wasn't her field as she never brings the material to life and things just come off rather cold and bland.";

Stanwyck's forte is really heavy drama but here she displays a light enough touch to make her scenes with Morgan and Greenstreet delightful to watch. She gets great support from Una O'Connor S.Z.

Barbara Stanwyck stars as Elizabeth Lane a popular Martha Stewart' type magazine columnist who writes about life on her beloved farm in Connecticut always with the latest recipe at the center of the story.  One of her biggest fans is Alexander Yardley played by Sidney Greenstreet the publisher of the magazine for which she writes.  Yardley has never visited her farm and in response to an idea expressed to him in a letter from a nurse Mary Joyce Compton he decides to spend an old fashioned Christmas with Elizabeth her husband and child and as a special guest a certain Mr. Jefferson Jones Dennis Morgan a sailor just recovered from spending fifteen days at sea on a raft after his ship was torpedoed.  Elizabeth of course cannot refuse her boss but there are problems not the least of which is the fact that she has no farm and writes her column from the comfort of a highrise in the city.  It makes for a precarious situation for her as well as her editor Dudley Beecham Robert Shayne as the one thing Mr. Yardley demands from his employees is total honesty.  What follows is a charming and delightfully romantic comedy that transports the audience back to a seemingly more simple time and place to share a Christmas Past where a warm hearth good food and kindness prevail.Barbara Stanwyck absolutely sparkles as Elizabeth with a smile and presence warmer than anything the grandest hearth could provide and totally convincing as a city girl entirely out of her element on the farm.  Morgan also fares well as the somewhat naive sailor whose trust in his fellow man is admirable.  Even with the deceptions being played out around him he's the kind of guy you know will somehow land on his feet and in the end it's Elizabeth you really feel for.  One of the true delights of this film however is Sidney Greenstreet.  His Yardley has a gruff exterior but beneath you know without a doubt that this is a man with a heart as big as Texas.  It's a straightforward honest portrayal and it's a joy to watch him work the most memorable scenes in the movie belong to him.The supporting cast includes Reginald Gardiner John Sloan the terrific Una O'Connor Norah Frank Jenks Sinkewicz and Dick Elliott Judge Crothers.  A feelgood movie that plays especially well during the Christmas Season though it would work any time of the year Christmas In Connecticut' is a memorable film that never takes itself too seriously is thoroughly uplifting and will leave you with a warm spot in your heart and a sense of peace that makes the world seem like a good place to be.  It's a true classic and one you do not want to miss.  I rate this one 1010.".

It would certainly lift one's spirits by just letting go. The movie would make a perfect gift in the form of a DVD or a VHS tape. Christmas in Connecticut was directed with great panache by Peter Godfrey based on a story by Aileen Hamilton. The best thing in the movie is the felicitous pairing of two of the most popular stars of that era Barbara Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan. Barbara Stanwyck always played strong willed women obviously this was a change of pace for her. In this film as well as Lady Eve Ms. Stanwyck displays a knack for comedy. She and Mr. Morgan who played in a lot of musical comedies make a winning combination.There are no weak performances in the film. Sydney Greenstreet an actor notorious for playing 'heavies' is a delight to watch as the rich and fat Alexander Yardley the man who owned a media empire and who knew a good thing when he saw it. Reginald Gardiner an accomplished English actor adds luster to the stellar cast behind the two principals.S. Z. Sakall is another source of continuous mirth he plays the Hungarian chef Felixwho has a hard time with his own version of the English language. Also Una O'Connor makes a perfect Norah the housekeeper in the Sloan perfect Connecticut farm.In reading other comments in this forum it's sad to learn that the glorious black and white cinematography is not appreciated by some people. After all color was not widely used in the 40s and most of the classic movies have to be seen in its original format because what would be accomplished in 'coloring' them?This film should be a requirement for anyone looking to spend almost two hours of uninterrupted fun at Christmas time because total merriment is assured. Watch it with an open mind and heart an maybe you'd like to see Christmas in Connecticut every year.".

Reginald Gardiner and Stanwyck have no chemistry at all obvious to all but Reggie and he's funny in his stuffed shirt way.Most people remember this film as one of Sidney Greenstreet's few ventures into comedy.

Christmas in Connecticut gave him a rare opportunity to burlesque his own image and he made the most of it.In a biography of Barbara Stanwyck she mentions she enjoyed making Christmas in Connecticut as a welcome change from some villainous parts like Double Indemnity she'd been doing recently.

However to me it is the ultimate Christmas movie.The fact that it is in BW is irrelevant  although I often wonder what it would be like in colour. You can just get that warm glowing feeling watching the Christmas events unfold. Stanwyck and Morgan are perfect together and Greenstreet is the antithesis of his usual character Sakall is a blustering joy to watch.It is light relief and certainly does not tax the brain but leaves you feeling glad that you saw it.I can't wait for it to become available on DVD in the UK.

However to me it is the ultimate Christmas movie.The fact that it is in BW is irrelevant  although I often wonder what it would be like in colour. You can just get that warm glowing feeling watching the Christmas events unfold. Stanwyck and Morgan are perfect together and Greenstreet is the antithesis of his usual character Sakall is a blustering joy to watch.It is light relief and certainly does not tax the brain but leaves you feeling glad that you saw it.I can't wait for it to become available on DVD in the UK. I shall certainly be at the front of the queue to buy it.";

She moves with ease in an almost all male cast. The holiday theme is almost incidental it definitely takes a sideline to the charade in the house of her being a domestic goddess. Barbara Stanwyck carries the movie right through to the end. Her extra slim figure is pleasing in very simply tailored clothes. Your heart almost sinks for her when she is going to be married to the very droll architect. The actual farm setting is fun and makes it more believable. Not very well known but not to be missed.".

She has seldom been more appealing and is pitch perfect. Morgan is the essence of the nice guy. Because his part is the least splashy there is a tendency to overlook his skill. Just the fact that he could hold his own surrounded by such distinct character actors is an accomplishment in itself but he too is absolutely perfect as Jefferson Jones.

Arbutny ExSuperintendent Grodman Count Fosco Titus Semple it surprises many of his fans to learn that originally Sidney Greenstreet made a name for himself in comedies in the West End and Broadway. He was usually such a total villain or serious actor to the public that his comic talents were ignored. In fact he actually did make four comedy appearances one a spoof of his villainous portrayals with his villainy partner Peter Lorre in a cameo appearance. His best total film appearance in a comedy was probably that of magazine publisher Alexander Yardley in Christmas In Connecticut although his autocratic halfmad soap tycoon in The Hucksters is a close second. Despite some problems with the screenplay it is a good film and usually revived in the Christmas season.Elizabeth Lane Barbara Stanwyck writes a column in American Housekeeping magazine for Yardley where she gives household tips and cooking recipes. She is the 1945 version of Martha Steward except that Ms Steward is a cook and houseowner and can vouch for trying out and testing what she advocates. Stanwyck can't. Her cooking recipes are those of her friend Felix S.Z. Sakall a gourmet chef and restaurateur. The house she describes as her home a model farmhouse in Connecticut belongs to her unofficial boyfriend architect John Sloan Reginald Gardiner. Gardiner really would not mind marrying Stanwyck but she is not fully ready to consider a final commitment to him.As the film begins an American is shipwrecked by the Nazis. This is Jefferson Jones Dennis Morgan a sailor. He spends two weeks in a raft before being rescued. Sensing publicity value Greenstreet decides to grant Morgan's wish to have a genuine old fashioned Christmas in Connecticut. He basically tells Stanwyck that she will entertain Morgan and himself at her farm for the holidays. Stanwyck is unable to explain that the columns image of herself complete with her ability to flip flapjacks and raise a baby she supposedly had with her husband is a lie  if she does she will be fired as will her immediate boss Dudley Beecham Robert Shayne. In a moment of depression she accepts Gardiner's proposal of marriage and then Gardiner finds his Connecticut home is dragooned into becoming the actual home of Stanwyck and himself and their baby.Of course aside from putting off Greenstreet's meddling curiosity Stanwyck and Morgan find that they are falling in love much to the annoyance of Gardiner  he does actually expect that Stanwyck will still marry him. Complication following complication occurs as lies piles on lies and as neighbor's babies succeeds neighbor's babies before Greenstreet begins to wonder if he is missing something. But it is a comedy so everything works out well. Even Greenstreet at the conclusion is amused by the entire madness  his celebrated hearty chortle mirroring that of Santa Clause for a change. This is not a classic comedy certainly not a great one but amusing enough for the season to be worth watching in December.".

The other cast members effectively complete the story and include Dennis Morgan Jefferson Jones Reginald Gardiner John Sloan and Sydney Greenstreet Alexander Yardley.Elizabeth Lane is a journalist who writes food articles portraying herself as a happily married country homemaker with children. In reality she is a single woman living in a New York City apartment and cannot boil an egg. Her recipes are borrowed from her Hungarian chef friend Felix. Elizabeth gets away with her deception until the publisher of her magazine Alexander Yardley decides he wants a nice old fashioned country Christmas and invites himself to visit her bringing with him a returning war hero Jefferson Jones a sailor who had been shipwrecked. Yardley demands total honesty of his employees. To get out of her predicament and save her deception based career Elizabeth borrows the Connecticut country home of her longtime architect suitor John Sloan a dull fussy chap who has long sought marriage. She also borrows a neighbour's baby actually several to pass off as her own and her 'husband' Sloan's.Of course this scenario makes for much merriment. It's a screwball comedy and a charming romance with the added attraction of a Christmas atmosphere. Whenever I think of this movie I picture the snowflakes falling the tree beautifully decorated the fire roaring in the hearth the turkey roasting and Christmas cookies baking.Why did Hollywood feel compelled to do a remake? I understand there is a 1992 version directed by Arnold Schwarzenegger and starring Dyan Cannon Kris Kristofferson and Tony Curtis. I have not seen this modern adaptation nor do I wish to. This old favorite is perfect just the way it is and a holiday 'must see' along with It's a Wonderful Life White Christmas Miracle on 34th Street and of course all the versions of A Christmas Carol.".

	schema:reviewBody "Barbara Stanwyck is a sheer delight in this wartime comedy about a sailor invited to spend Christmas with a popular magazine writer's family at her farm in Connecticut. The problem is she has no husband baby or farm as she writes about in her column and she can't even cook her wonderful recipes being provided for her by her good friend  Uncle Felix owner of a Hungarian restaurant in New York City.Things get even more complicated when her strict publisher boss invites himself along for Christmas. A scheme is hastily planned with her stuffy fianc providing an actual Connecticut farm neighbors providing a borrowed baby and a quick wedding planned when the publisher isn't looking. But when the handsome young sailor arrives on Christmas Eve romantic complications ensue as the supposedly married author falls like a ton of bricks for the nice guy Navy man and vice versa.This is a charming warm film that deftly balances humor with sentiment and is a wonderful showcase for Barbara Stanwyck to display her considerable comedic talent aided by such marvelous character actors as Sydney Greenstreet Una O'Connor S.Z.Sakall and many others. A Christmas night dance at the town hall is a toe tapping delight to see and the unexpectedly sweet and feminine side of Stanwyck is a wonderful surprise for viewers who have seen her mainly as tough bitchy women in femme fatale roles. Truly a wonderful film that has stood the test of time.".

In addition Mr Yardley who's going to be alone for Christmas invites himself up to the farm for the Christmas party.

There is nothing religious or Santa Claus related about it although there is a prominent Christmas tree in the living room and Elizabeth Lane Barbara Stanwyck has trouble decorating it also the war hero Jeff Dennis Morgan sings a Christmas song at one point. It is definitely winter though in all its Hollywood splendor. There's realisticlooking snow galore and horses and sleighs to glide through it.The event sequences are pretty incredulous but this is a farce and farces are not supposed to be believable. What I like most is the acting  all of the actors are perfect for their parts  and the dialog. The dialog sequences fit together like a perfect puzzle. There is one hilarious scene after another and the fast pace never stops until the end. While the final result is not surprising the way it's carried out is.Besides Stanwyck playing off Morgan there's an interesting relationship between Uncle Felix S.Z. Sakall and Alexander Yardley Sydney Greenstreet two outstanding actors who also played in Casablanca. Sakall is an excellent character actor who is not that well known but I hope to find him in more movies.Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide only gives this movie 2.5 stars but I think it is worth at least 3.5 if not 4 stars as one of the most hilarious 40's comedies and an excellent Christmas season film.".

Yardley is the modern equivalent of Dickens' Scrooge in the way he exercizes control over his employees  until the Christmas spirit overtakes him. The role is a 'walk in the park' for Greenstreet who had been one of the stage's great Falstaffs when he was part of the Lunts' company. Greenstreet had only entered films five years earlier when at age 61 he was featured in what was to become a film classic the first and best film John Huston ever directed 'The Maltese Falcon'. 'Cuddles' Sakall was probably never better in his traditional role as the embodiment of middle European gemutlicheit. The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem.".

The role is a 'walk in the park' for Greenstreet who had been one of the stage's great Falstaffs when he was part of the Lunts' company. Greenstreet had only entered films five years earlier when at age 61 he was featured in what was to become a film classic the first and best film John Huston ever directed 'The Maltese Falcon'. 'Cuddles' Sakall was probably never better in his traditional role as the embodiment of middle European gemutlicheit. The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem.";

Reportedly drawn from over 500 hours of footage the good news is that Nossiter will be releasing not only a theatrical cut but a tenpart ten hour series of the film on DVD by next Christmas ThinkFilm is distributing it. The bad news is that it's still a bit of an unwieldy beast. When it was shown in Cannes it was close to three hours long. For Toronto he's cut about half an hour but it still clocked in at 135 minutes. Now for me that's fine. I love wine and I love hearing about the controversies raging in my business. But not everyone wants that much.Nossiter flits around the globe from Brazil to France to California to Italy to Argentina talking to wine makers and PR people and consultants and critics about the state of the wine world. The theme that emerges is that globalization and the undue influence of wine critic Robert Parker are forcing a kind of sameness on wine. Small local producers are either being bought up by larger conglomerates American as well as local or are being pressured by market forces to change their wines to suit the palate of Mr. Parker who dictates taste to most of the American and world markets.It's a complicated subject and I can understand why Nossiter wants to let his subjects talk. There is Robert Mondavi patriarch of the Napa wine industry and his sons Tim and Michael whose efforts to buy land in Languedoc faced opposition from local vignerons and government officials. There is Aim Guibert founder and wine maker of Daumas Gassac iconoclastic opponent of Mondavi's plans and crusader for wines that express local terror. There is Robert Parker himself expressing some discomfort with his influence while refusing to stop writing about the wines that he favours. There is flying wine maker Michel Rolland consultant for dozens of wineries all over the world advising them how to make Parker friendly wines. There are many many more fascinating personalities in this documentary.If you are a wine lover you will want to seek out the tenpart series as well as the theatrical version of this film. But even if you're not into wine the film is an interesting look at how the forces of globalization are changing many of the world's oldest and most established traditions.

	schema:reviewBody "Mondovino is an extraordinary documentary. It's selfindulgent quirky opinionated and overlong but it's likely to be indespensible because it's a devastating anatomy of the growing conflict between authentic local production the French key word is terroir and the globalization of wine by which family origins are forgotten and the emphasis is on quick satisfaction forward flavor and standardized tastes.The maker of this film is Jonathan Nossiter polyglot sommelier happy tippler photographer director and star interviewer in his documentary film  which began as a quickie but wound up taking four years to make. Nossiter appears as fluent in Italian as he is in French and perhaps in Spanish and Portuguese too. He's often on screen addressing everyone in their native language but it's his camera that's obsessed with sometimes annoying details above all dogs.Never mind though he manages to get everybody to open up to him including many of the leading players of the international wine market including those who come off the worst in Nossiter's documentary. And even those dogs turn out to have meaning. Isn't one's dog the clearest metaphor for a person's true nature? It's obvious Nossiter likes Battista Columbu in Sardinia and Hubert de Montille in Volnay best  and it's obvious why. They're different sorts of men Columbu is radiant and serene de Montille querulous and acerbic. But they stand equally for what may be a vanishing world  one where winemaking is authentic personal local humane where it's identified with place of origin not brand done for pride of craft not profit or  what the Michel Rollands and Mondavis want  for worldwide nay universewide market domination. Both dream openly on camera of making wine on other planets and of selling it to everyone.De Montille comes across as mattering more than the Mondavis or any of the other aristos and plutocrats. He has only a few hectares. He makes wine that's severe edgy not for everyone  like himself  and longlasting. He's true to himself. A big focus of Mondovino is how the California Mondavis  who've already collaborated with overblown first growth bordeaux Mouton Rothchild to produce a pricey California hybrid Opus One since the Eighties  recently tried to get hold of a big slice of burgundy. But a communist mayor took over the town from a socialist one and the sweetheart deal was off. The Wine Spectator becomes as Nossiter shows one of the manipulators and manipulation is an essential aspect of globalization. So too is Robert Parker of Monkton Maryland who gets interviewed and his flatulent bulldogs thoroughly photographed. Parker has always been independent but his wine ratings and his taste have come to wield too much power over the world wine market. French winemakers are terrified of him and that situation has undermined their independence. Parker it turns out has long been very friendly with Michel Rolland a superstar French wine consultant whose Mercedes limo we get to ride around in and it turns out that the kind of heady forward fastdeveloping wine Parker likes is also what Rolland encourages winemakers to produce  and globalization means not only eliminating small producers but homogenizing wine styles. Hence Rolland's ebullient charm is suspect but so are Parker's socalled authenticity and independence. The richness of Nossiter's picture comes out in the way he delineates wine families and their different sometimes squabbling members  most of all the de Montilles the stubborn feisty and wise old Hubert his energetic son Etienne who works for the powerful negociant Boisset and his daughter Alix in personality closer to Hubert who decided to leave Boisset because they want her to lie  to put her seal on wines she hasn't supervised the making of. Nossiter's eye and ear can be devastating. The rich Staglin family in Napa Valley emerges as selfcongratulatory and selfdeceiving nouveaux bores. Their and other ruling wine families' condescension outright racism and covert or past links with the fascists and even the Nazis is another of the persistent filmmaker's gradual revelations. As one Nossiter interviewer has said don't get him on the subject of Berlusconi and Bush but Berlusconi is just fine with the wealthy Italian winemaking families.Another sympathetic dissenter to the globalizing bandwagon is New York wine importer Neal Rosenthal who knows the importance of terroir and the inroads against it.

One doesn't want to stop and one sees why Nossiter's film is too long. Because it's all there in the details this is what the controversy is about. Little things matter.

	schema:reviewBody "Mondovino is a dense rich and complex documentary on the power struggles and major players of the wine world elite. It depicts the endless struggle of the old world versus the new global capitalist order. On one hand we have the older aging independent grapegrowers and wine makers of Burgundy and Tuscany. They have a philosophy of wine as a symbol of civilization. It's not simply a commodity to them. The production and consumption of wine is a religious experience between man and the earth.On the other side of the war are the major wineproducing conglomerates such as the Mondavi family of Napa Valley or the producers of Ornelliai wine in Italy. No these aren't bad people. They simply have a different philosophy on wine production and they eagerly embrace the new technologies and innovations in wine fermentation such as the New Oak barrels that speed up production. They also hire Michel Rollan a worldfamous wine consultant who tells people how they can better the quality of their wine through different production processes. But the smaller more independent wineries see wine consultants as harmful to diversity because they worry that consultants seek to make all wine the same. Just because one consultant likes or doesn't like a wine does not mean that every pallet will agree.Mondovino also shows the dark histories of many of the world's most powerful wine producers. Some of the most successful wine makers in France collaborated with Nazi Germany in World War II and most of the major wine producers in Italy supported Fascism and Mussolini. There are still racist and elitist undertones in much of the wine world today. Mondovino carefully weaves together the web of land power politics and wine.This film is a lot a great bottle of wine. It's complex multifaceted and can't be rushed. I'm not going to lie  Mondovino is not a short movie. It's over two hours long. But like a great wine gets better with age so to does this movie get better as time progresses.If you've ever wanted to know more about wine and the people who make it this film is a great resource to learn from. Wine people are going to love it. But for the average Joe who just wants a good time at the theater this probably is not the best selection for him. It's not entertaining as much as it's educational and if you're not in the mood you're not going to feel it. Just like how you can't enjoy a savory glass of Pinot Noir if all you want is a beer.".

	onyx:emotionText "Mondovino is a dense rich and complex documentary on the power struggles and major players of the wine world elite. It depicts the endless struggle of the old world versus the new global capitalist order. On one hand we have the older aging independent grapegrowers and wine makers of Burgundy and Tuscany. They have a philosophy of wine as a symbol of civilization. It's not simply a commodity to them. The production and consumption of wine is a religious experience between man and the earth.On the other side of the war are the major wineproducing conglomerates such as the Mondavi family of Napa Valley or the producers of Ornelliai wine in Italy. No these aren't bad people. They simply have a different philosophy on wine production and they eagerly embrace the new technologies and innovations in wine fermentation such as the New Oak barrels that speed up production. They also hire Michel Rollan a worldfamous wine consultant who tells people how they can better the quality of their wine through different production processes. But the smaller more independent wineries see wine consultants as harmful to diversity because they worry that consultants seek to make all wine the same. Just because one consultant likes or doesn't like a wine does not mean that every pallet will agree.Mondovino also shows the dark histories of many of the world's most powerful wine producers. Some of the most successful wine makers in France collaborated with Nazi Germany in World War II and most of the major wine producers in Italy supported Fascism and Mussolini. There are still racist and elitist undertones in much of the wine world today. Mondovino carefully weaves together the web of land power politics and wine.This film is a lot a great bottle of wine. It's complex multifaceted and can't be rushed. I'm not going to lie  Mondovino is not a short movie. It's over two hours long. But like a great wine gets better with age so to does this movie get better as time progresses.If you've ever wanted to know more about wine and the people who make it this film is a great resource to learn from.

But Nossiter managed to give his movie a consistency all along. A great achievement of this movie is revealing all the characters involved in the wine industry as they really are avoiding a clich Good against Evil. This could be the main difference between Mondovino and Michael Moore's documentaries Nossiter's point of view appears in a subtle way through opinions expressed by his favorite characters. The richness of this documentary relies mainly upon the characters the history of longtime winemaking families such as the De Montilles the Mondavis the Antinori and the Frescobaldi. Nossiter lets the spectator discover that wine is somehow related to families rather than just being a business and an industry. This movie doesn't make you want to drink wine but certainly make you want to discover vineyards and winemakers.I watched this movie as a student in Enology and let's just there are many ways to learn. I give this documentary 10 out of 10 despite his technical particularities.".

Spoilers Examples include zooming over a woman's shoulder as she talks to the presumably more interesting goldfish in the background zooming in on the nostril of a winegrower waxing eloquent of winemaking as art whilst considerable mucus oozes from his nose. Allowing a California couple to provide an in depth tour of their stucco 'mcmansion' while sounding like they are describing Versailles is also hilarious.

Spoilers Examples include zooming over a woman's shoulder as she talks to the presumably more interesting goldfish in the background zooming in on the nostril of a winegrower waxing eloquent of winemaking as art whilst considerable mucus oozes from his nose. Allowing a California couple to provide an in depth tour of their stucco 'mcmansion' while sounding like they are describing Versailles is also hilarious. All of which are kind of mean and a lot of work for their relative contributions to the story.";

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this documentary because it said that it is about the globalization of wine and how this is impacting different wine regions of the world. My interest in wine is rather new and I am still in the initial research phase so I thought that this would be something educational for me. Instead it brought me mostly frustration.Basically the movie is about this in Nappa valley there is this guy named Bob Mondavi a real power player in the wine world. He tried to buy in his way into a french wine producing village to extend his domain. He failed. He goes to Italy instead where he has more success. Oh and he has set up shop in other parts of the world as well mainly south America.In detail 34 of the documentary is about the french affair where the locals are presented the small players the big players Mondavi is being presented some fancy wine consultant is presented and a guy named Parker who is a wine critic that can make or brake wine companies worldwide. The french bicker amongst themselves and lament about how Mondavi Parker and the consultant has changed the way of doing business and these 3 in return say that there is nothing wrong with their way. In the last quarter of the documentary the focus is shifted towards Italy how they came in contact with Mondavi and have found that everything is OK. At the very end there is about 10 minutes of shots from south America not that it matters anyway.This documentary bothers me. First it doesn't knows what it wants to be. It is not about globalization because it covers only one business deal and its consequences barely. Its scope is not global it doesn't even mentions the emerging Asian markets hell it doesn't even covers Europe just some parts of France and Italy... Also it tries to give an insight into the way of life of the wine makers on a personal level but does so in a manner that is totally distracts the focus about the main theme of the documentary. However the main problem with this documentary is the low technical quality that make its weak substance even worse. Whoever shot the movie had no idea what it is doing. The camera shakes the angles are all wrong and the focus is all over the place. Some wine maker is being interviewed and the camera just zooms in on hie eye or his mouth so I can see how bad his teeth are. Or it zooms in on the fat old guy in the background that is going down a latter. The dialog still goes on but all I can see is Santa coming down from the roof. The editing is also abysmal. Every dog that the crew encountered during the making of the documentary gets a good 5 seconds of close ups in the movie. I know now that the worlds most influential wine critics french bulldog farts... Why is this important? Why was this not cut out? I know that the wine consultant sends out his driver to buy him newspapers and cigars. The maid comes in sees the camera gets shy but eventually asks if anybody wants to have a drink or something. Some guy passes trough the room where a woman is being interviewed than passes back a moment later both times they have a brief chat that has no value to the documentary whatsoever yet everything makes it into the documentary. Some kid is being washed in a sink on a porch in south America I can see clearly that its a boy. An uglyold piano player woman puts up makeup at a dinner event.There are countless such distracting elements that have no relevance no added value no contribution for the subject whatsoever. They should have been cut out. Highschool kids could achieve better production value with their cell phones. And even if this movie is from 2004 I expect better quality from somebody that has the budget to travel around and the access to talk to VIPs. Over all this is a mediocre at best shoddy narrow view documentary that does not worth your time and effort.".

Nobody would deny that the standard of wine has improved. Nobody would deny the French have been too arrogant for too long. However it is to be regretted that the American public as a whole is so sheep like in following the taste of Robert Parker. He know what he likes and the great American public which doesn't is happy to say Yeah and I like it too. Unfortunately what you will end up with is less choice. Look at what passes for cheese in America and compare it with the wealth of choice that is available still in the Old World. Do you really want wines that will be like Kraft slices compared with Brie? Trust me not all wines have to be big tasting reds barrelled in new oak and giving endless unchallenging easydrinking.

The movie completely ignores the fact that in blind tastings French critics who dismiss the pretensions of the Napa vintners and claim to prefer the pure natural taste of terroir choose the American wines. This movie is about hype all right but it's not Mondavi its about the pretentious claim of many a traditional winery that only centuries of winemaking culture and knowledge of terroir can lead to a good product. This is about as ridiculous as the claim that good bread can only be produced in certain traditional locales i.e. that a Parisian baguette can only be good if it is from Paris. I'm glad to say that both good bread and good wine can be found in many many places and more every year. And speaking from experience the Chilean and Argentinian wines of 30 years ago were dreadful! Nothing has been lost in adopting international standards for their wine industry.".

The wife joins a insurance fraud racket which eventually gets her husband fired from his job but instead of lying down he decides to bring the racket down himself. This is yet another B film Reagan did at Warner and this one here actually kept me entertained from start to finish due to the rather interesting story and a nice performance by the young star. The movie is pretty much one note as we see the hot shot get torn down and then we see him built back up as he takes down the bad guys. What I enjoyed most was how we got to see the various scams play out. We see the characters brought into play we see the wrecks and then we see how the claims are paid off. All of this was rather fascinating even though the movie never goes too deep into things. The film runs just 62minutes so it's fast paced and right to the point. I really enjoyed Reagan here as he manages to be quite good in his cockiness early on and he is able to show the strength of the character in the second half. Gloria Blondell and Duck Purcell add good support as does Bromley who plays a great villain who you can't help but hate. If you're not a fan of B movies than this here will probably be a bit too shallow for your taste but those you do enjoy this type of thing will find themselves entertained throughout.".

But it was a bit weird to see her laying there on the stretcher in the middle of the courtroom. I wonder if that's ever been done before.Well it was just the thing to bring down the whole insurance scam and take down the bad guys.

So she stupidly takes out a loan and defaults on it apparently not realizing that the folks giving her the loan were the same people who were behind the insurance fraud cases! Well appearances are deceiving and it turns out Mrs. Gregg knows EXACTLY who these people are and she plans on making life easy on herself and the fraudsters! In essence she goes into business with the crooks! When will Eric wake up and see who his wife really is?! And what's next?! Will Eric be able to have the last laugh?!Although there were a lot of crappy Bmovies made during this era Accidents Will Happen is of a higher caliberand much of it was because a big studio like Warner Brothers could make a much more polished B than tiny outfits like Monogram and PRC. The script is quite good as is the acting and the entire production has the nice polish that you'd expect from Warner. Overall unusually good for a Band better than many of the 'better' more expensive pictures!".

	schema:reviewBody "I still remember watching Satya for the first time. I was completely blown away. Here was a movie that was very different so from the other Gangster films that I had seen. So realistic so Mumbaiyya and so believable. Despite Company which was a very good effort and Vaastav more focused on the journey of the protagonist which came close no underworld movie could ever live up to Satya.When I watched Ab Tak 56 for the first time I said to myself Indian Cops have their own 'Satya' now. The quote by Nietzsche in the beginning itself tells you that this is no ordinary film. What strikes you about the encounter at the start of the film is the relaxed manner in which it is carried out. There is a cold and scary feel to it cos you realize that it is part of their routine.Ab Tak 56 is not the story of an honest cop or a corrupt cop but of a cop who is ready to do what it takes to get rid of the criminals when all lawful means are exhausted. With simple shots and camera angles director Shimit Amin manages to capture the essence of the characters and gives a realistic and rough feel to the movie. Editing seems nonexistent and hence effective. The music is also impressive and haunting and stays with you long after you've left the movie hall.But for me what really takes the cake are the dialogues and the superlative acting from each and every character. Sandeep Srivastava has done a brilliant job as the dialogue writer. If I start listing my favourite dialogues I'm afraid I'll end up rewriting the entire script of the movie.The movie boasts of some stellar performances. Yashpal Sharma is detestable as SubInspector Imtiaz Siddiqui and so is Jeeva as Joint Commissioner Suchak. Revathi Hrishita Bhatt Mohan Agashe and Kunal Vijaykar have small roles which they play to perfection. Nakul Vaid as the rookie Jatin Shukla was a revelation. The scene where he has to hesitantly shoot the wounded gangster  Oh My God! He learns under the tutelage of Sadhu Aghashe and firmly believes in him.Prasad Purandhare as Zameer Zafar is impressive. His conversations with Sadhu are real jewels of dialogue writing. Never before in Indian cinema has any film brought out such a beautiful relation between a cop and a gangster.Not that I have not been a fan of Nana Patekar before this film but this film pushed me from a fan to a devotee. Nana as Inspector Sadhu Agashe gives the performance of a lifetime and one of the best I've ever seen in Hindi cinema. From the way he talks to his expressions from the way he taps his cigarette to the way sips his tea  it's almost as if Nana can do no wrong. He is at his best in each and every scene especially when he's teaching Jatin about how the police force functions. His cool and composed manner of doing things is scary at times. His dialogue delivery and body language had me convinced that he is one of the finest actors in the country. It's a shame that he did not win any popular awards for this one.Last but in no way the least Shimit Amin does a brilliant job of bringing all this talent together and exploiting them to the fullest to come up with a modern masterpiece of Indian cinema. In an industry that is sickeningly accustomed to lifting stories from here and there Amin takes an original script and brings it to life with a beautiful treatment. I just hope that he continues the great work and doesn't give in to Bollywoodisation! If he can do that I'm sure he'll be a force to reckon with in the coming years.".

The cast is really damn good but seriously the one liners are funny as hell though i dont know if the subtitled version will appear as funny The producers are trying for a Cannes release which is interesting. Made by debut director Shamit Aman i think thats his name.Again 55 y.o. Nana Patekar is brilliant away from his silly shouting roles of the past just shows what a good director can do with a good actor. Really good stuff. If you are interested in Indian movies and are disgusted by the nonsense some of our guys dish out then this is definitely a relief.Again Patekar is the guy who happilly carries the movie on his shoulders and epitomises the style of the movie relaxed funny intelligent and calculating.

The adaptation of the story and characterization was exceptional good.You should watch this movie for Nana Patekar. based on the life of Mumbai cop Daya Naik this movie deals in a more realistic way.

The adaptation of the story and characterization was exceptional good.You should watch this movie for Nana Patekar. based on the life of Mumbai cop Daya Naik this movie deals in a more realistic way. The film delves into the life of the common man which he has apart from being an encounter specialist. I rate this as one of the best movie of the year";

The editing is tightly paced and there are no annoying songs to distract from the story.Along the same lines as the modern day cult classic Company the movie is well acted directed and should have a long shelf life on DVD.The final ten minutes that see Nana and the main villain talk at his offshore haven are bound to be part of Hindi cinema classics.

This game becomes more interesting and engaging when you get to know thinking behind every move played by the players. This is what director Shimit Amin achieved with his brilliant direction in this film by portraying each character and their role in main story which makes the movie one of the best crime drama movie. When you first see the poster and Nana Patekar in it with a tag line like If I have to think about what's right and what's wrong just like you guys addressing to the readers then Who will do it the killing u get the feeling that you will get to see something very interesting on the screen. The fearless encounter specialist with very supportive commissioner of Mumbai Police Department to perform his duty without any restriction to clean the underworld and at the same time struggling to keep himself away from becoming a victim of jealousy of his own department member faces difficulties while doing his job when a new commissioner is appointed. And execution of new orders from commissioner about an encounter leads to set a chain of incidents which create a gripping mind game. The depth in the character of Sadhu Agashe is wholeheartedly portrayed by legendary Nana Patekar with nuances and little detailing. The dialogue delivery body language and attitude of this actor is perfect for fearless Encounter Specialist. At the same time Nana Patekar portrays a loving family man a protective father frustrated cop. His facial expressions were outstanding while having a dialogue with his colleague about how cops are puppets of the politicians and system. All the other supporting actors play their role very well. Special mentions are Yashpal Sharma and Nakul Vaid.The character theme for Nana's character created by SalimSulaiman suits that character. The editing is tight and doesn't lose the hold and pace. Story and screenplay are awesome. Dialogues given to Nan's character are quirky and help build the character strongly. Dialoges between Nana and Don also add some humor in scenes. Cinematography is OK. Overall a good crime drama with magic touch of Nana Patekar is what Ab tak Chhapaan can be well described as. And yeah it is worth having along shelf life on DVDs.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ab Tak Chhappan is a fictitious story surrounding a police department in Mumbai India. Sadhu Agashe is a hard working hardedged cop heading up a plain clothed crime squad who makes a name for himself by killing dangerous criminals in staged police encounters rather than locking them up in prison. His loyal officers obey him without question but a rift forms when one of his officers Imtiaz becomes frustrated by Sadhu's high ranking status and is secretly competing with him for criminal kills and status. A new recruit is also pushed into the fraternity and Imtiaz is angry when Sadhu allows him to take the lead on his first case. Further change comes in the form of a new police commissioner who disapproves of Sadhu's tactics and everyone gets caught up in internal politics.I was surprised to see such a well directed action thriller coming from India. The camera work is excellent the story is well told and the tension is high when the drama unfolds. The acting pace and political subterfuge convinces the viewer that they are a fly on the wall witnessing the blood sweat and tears from a close up and personal view and that the events are based on reality which is no doubt why we are told that it is not at the beginning of the film although it is likely that the director Shimit Amin has taken liberties with factual accounts. Nevertheless Ab Tak Chhappan is an extremely polished piece of filmmaking.".

	schema:reviewBody "Once again I must play something of the contrarian. Most of the reviews for Ab Tak Chappan have been extremely positive. Mine is positive but only slightly. A 7 out of 10 is equivalent to a C letter grade from me.It seems that a lot of the praise is rooted in two factors One that Ab Tak Chappan is more realistic than the typical Bollywood film and two that it is trying to do things differently.The first point I couldn't care less about. I'm not looking for realism in films and so I do not score higher for a film that shows a story and characters closer to how I believe the real world to beI'm a big fan of surrealism fantasy absurdism and so on although I do not dislike realist films merely for the fact that they're realist.For the second point I agree that it is commendable to try to do things differently. However I don't think originality versus formulaicism makes for a better or worse film in itself. A film can be original and poor just like a film can be formulaic and excellent. What matters are how well the film does whatever it sets out to do and how enjoyable or aesthetically rewarding that is to the viewer.Ab Tak Chappan is based on the true story of a Mumbai cop named Daya Naik. Naik was an encounter specialist. Encounter specialists who could be said to be early instantiations of real world Judge Dredds are trained to operate like the criminals and gang members they pursue and they're basically given a license to killeffectively acting as policeman judge jury and executioner in a matter of moments. Ab Tak Chappan follows the story of Sadhu Agashe Nana Patekar the encounter specialist based on Naik. We see him at work interacting with his fellow encounter specialists and engaging in violence. We see him at home trying to live a normal life in his lessthanluxurious surroundings. We see him trying to adjust to a new commissioner halfway through the film. And we see his odd relationship with a notorious Indian gangster Don Zameer Zafar Prasad Purandhare.All of this has the potential to make a fabulous gritty film. I agree that it's nice to forgo the typical Bollywood musical numbers and romancesnot every film needs that stuff Ab Tak Chappan producer Ram Gopal Varma is famous for leaving music and romances in the background or by the wayside in many films that he's directed or produced. Additionally Ab Tak Chappan has some good performancesPatekar almost gives off a Death Wish 1974era Charles Bronson vibe. It also has admirable cinematographythe handheld stuff near the beginning of the film was particularly effective for example. It has a great score that mixes more of a moody Hollywoodsounding actioncrime score with traditional Indian instruments and modalities. The violence is well done and gritty.There is also decent exploration of subtexts including the morality of having encounter specialists the idea of following orders and so on. The encounter specialists are shown having to largely divorce themselves from ideas of right and wrong. More poignantly the film questions the merit of blindly following orders. Parallels are drawn between the encounter specialists following orders and say members of a country's military and we're shown what a corrupt situation this can lead to.But you just knew there was a But coming didn't you? director Shimit Amin and his scriptwriters have created a story with far too many characters far too much sprawl and that moves a bit too slow. All of these problems may be due to Amin and crew looking at the Godfather films which Ab Tak Chappan has some at least superficial resemblances to although from a policeman's perspective.Most of the encounter specialists we do not get to know very wellthese are shallowly drawn characters to say the least except for Agashe and Jatin Shukla Nakul Vaid. For one Narayan I didn't know who he was until at least halfway through the film. His name is mentioned a number of times but I'd only get glimpses of him until the scene would change. Then everyone would change clothes by the time they appear again and I'd have to start all over figuring out who Narayan was.The same thing happened with Agashe's first commissioner. The film was already far into the new commissioner before I could figure out the relationships. It seems like there are new characters in every scene. We never learn the stories of most of them. While that might have some artistic merit in that the encounter specialists are mostly killing people they do not know anything about because they're mostly doing so on orders since we do not learn much about most of the encounter specialists either it's difficult to find characters to care about and that doesn't exactly make for a gripping film.The primary villain is Zameer. But until about halfway through the film there's no indication of this. He doesn't get much more screen time than the other villains parading through the film and he's literally phoning his performance inhe's in another location Dubai communicating only by telephone for the majority of the film. We don't actually see Zameer doing much. To an extent the film depends on a couple twists that necessitate not showing Zameer doing a number of things but we could see him do other things and a lot of the other villains could have been left out.That would have tightened up the film a bit making it more focused and about a halfhour shorter both of which would have benefited its impact. This is not an actionpacked film by any means. For at least the first 45 minutes or so I found myself admiring Ab Tak Chappan's considerable style but saying Okay get on with the story already.".

Written and directed well by Shimit Amin a director who writes well and directs the same superbly this was his debut and how? Taking a well treaded path and make it more interesting and exploring a few niche things. The plot isn't original but the taking is. The way the climax is held and even 5 minutes before that I did not expect it to end so menancingly as it is done I must applaud the director here. The cinematography is too very stereotypical and follows its predecessors like Satya and others. The art direction the costumes and the background score are good and simple background went a bit overboard at times yet its just there aptly.Now Sadhu Agashe is a character that was as said 'inspired' from real life encounter specialist Dayanak just that the whole plot is fictionalised to take us through an engaging ride. Sadhu Agashe and for that matter most cops here are shown as sensitive and humane like the Commissioner of police asking Sadhu how is your son's fractured hand?. Not sure if police are so humane but I will give in to most of such eccentricities in a plot that is a cold blooded revenge act. It has got a psychological thing as Sadhu Agashe tells his story through the induction a new cop into his team. More psychological would have more it less accessible and more interesting though I liked it still the way it stands out now. Had production values been enhanced this was for sure then been a better watchable film.I will go with 35 for a good movie that could have been so much more. Watch it for Nana Patekar nevertheless".

Some pretty interesting cinematography thru the wooden camera I'm not sure if it was culturally correct but it definitely widens you're view of south Africa. The actors were good for 1st timers most of them anyway i especially liked Estelle character which made this movie pretty enjoyable. What is interesting though was that it makes you ask about your own life. Are you really doing what you really love? Or do you consent to the norm the conventionalism around you.

The young actors are quite good and well directed in their approach to the core material and the dialogue is natural and interesting. The film is very rich in visuals providing a frame by frame study of deeper understanding and fulfillment without falling into iconic stereotypes and clichs.

She starts off with attitude but soon warms up to the hero and they make The beast with two backs in a very stylish fashion.The fight scenes are good in the American tradition NO Hong Kong acrobatics here! with added realism from having Benny The Jet Urquidez playing himself as John Larson's Jacklin trainer.All in all this film seems to have more sub plots than most in its genre so you get MORE of a story.".

	schema:reviewBody "For our 400th review celebration we thought we'd invite a few friends over  namely Matthias Hues Richard Lynch Jorge Rivero Ian Jacklin Renee Ammann Martin Kove Benny The Jet Eric Lee and the rest of the large cast of Death Match. A special effort seems to have been made to get as many of the DTV actors of the time as possible in this production. Castingwise it truly was The Expendables 2010 of its day and inevitably it means that some cast members can only receive small roles. Due to time restrictions of course. Unless you think Death Match should be a fourhourplus epic.John Larson Jacklin and Nick Wallace Hill are just two bluecollar dock workers trying to make their living the oldfashioned way  by working hard. Their longshoreman jobs take them all around the country and they end up in L.A. where Nick tries to make some extra bucks fighting in...wait for it...illegal underground punchkickfighting cage matches to the death! Did you think it would be some sort of computer game contest? Anyway Nick starts fighting for the evil unscrupulous fight promotergangstergunrunnerlover of geodes and Twizzlers Paul Landis Kove and his associatemain fighter Mark Vanik Hues. Unbeknownst to Nick these guys are well evil and unscrupulous and they expect the winners of their fights to kill and the losers of their fights to die. Seeing as Nick is a nice guy and doesn't have that killer instinct he refuses to kill his opponent in the ring. So naturally after a brutal punch to the face by Vanik they imprison him on their personal boat.Seeing as how Larson and Wallace are best friends to the end when Larson gets word that his buddy hooked up with Landis' organization and is now missing he goes on the hunt for him. Of course this means that he has to join Landis' group and fight in order to get closer to the truth. Luckily he was a former kickboxing champion that gave it up years ago. With help from reporterlove interesteye candy Danielle Richardson Ammann scrappy street kid Tommy Michele Krasnoo and of course his Cosmo Kramerlike manager Lionel P. Bigman AKA Big Man Bob Wyatt will Larson find and rescue his friend? Death Match is one of the better punchfighters out there and has a little more substance than most. Thanks to the sprawling cast  there are even more Bmovie names we didn't mention  Lisa London John Sjogren Brick Bronsky Marcus Aurelius Sheila Redgate and more  as well as the fast pace of the film things never get boring. Also in the good news department this is by far Ian Jacklin's best role we've seen. He actually does a good job carrying the movie and as the lead role must have the usual barfights and torture scenes and you care about him and his friend. Despite all we've seen before we really liked Jacklin here.But the real Big Man in this production isn't Lionel it's the great Matthias Hues. He turns on his typical charm and wears a gigantic suit with a bolo tie. If he starts to take off his shirtbolo tie  watch out. You are in trouble. Also whatever you do don't call him goldilocks. Lynch steals the one scene he's in as the gangster Jimmy. Benny The Jet appears as himself in one of his own gyms as Larson's trainer. His advice comes in handy. Interestingly in the female reporter wanting a storyhero teaming up with an L.A. street kid angle Death Match resembles Streets of Rage 1994 of all things. Weird.We really can't go through all the many characters and their ups and downs due to space restrictions and there are some of the prerequisite silly moments such as the Chicanos with nunchuks scene but honestly this is an action Bmovie fan's dream come true  and one of the better killfighting movies we've seen to date.Note Death Match is available in the U.K. on a twoforone DVD with strangely The Robert Chapin classic Ring Of Steel 1994! Go Figure.".

Same for its producers there are people that have loved and loathed both Moffat and Davies both have given us some excellent and not so excellent episodes.The format and premise of the show remains its key strength he can literally go anywhere and do anything most shows are faced with multiple constraints that isn't the case here the possibilities are endless.We've had episodes that are widely loved some of my own favourites include Blink Silence in the LibraryForest of the Dead and Vincent and the Doctor. Others have positively split opinion Love and Monsters is a good idea personally it's one I enjoy. I can appreciate an attempt at doing something different it's a show that could become tiresome if it became to formulaic.I like the format of the two part serial it allows a greater character development sometimes with the single episode there's sometimes a feeling that some characters are a little shy of screen time.They have been guilty of using some of the Doctor's foes too often the Daleks for example they've popped up a few times too many once they were the adversary I desperately wanted to see not it's a feeling of indifference.

	schema:reviewBody "Doctor Who just works. However you watch it as a fan or casual viewer there is something there for you and if there's not well try a different era. It helps that it's got 52 years currently under its belt and so there is and has been for a long time an element of nostalgia to the show recurring villains references companions or placesplanets that get revisited just to please the people who've been watching long enough. But that's not all there is to it because every year there's some kind of hidden gem of an episode that's a shining example of great television along with the scary funny tense episodes we have all come to expect from this show. One of its strongest merits is its constant adaptability. There are different writers almost every week different companions every other series different doctors different locations directors genres threats and ideas. For every one abysmal episode and there are a few of them there are some absolutely stunning ones too. I'd recommend Heaven Sent Bad WolfParting of the Ways The Empty ChildThe Doctor Dances Blink The Pandorica Opens A Good Man Goes to War Asylum of the Daleks Flatline and The Day of the Doctor. It's a show that never dies. Of course it will get cancelled at some point maybe just as it did before and then it will live on. It will get picked up again. TV just isn't the same without it. If you're new it's best to start with some classic standalone stories to get into them. Maybe try a few from each series to work out who your favourite Doctorcompanion combination are. 'Smith and Jones' is a lovely episode to start with it's where I startedthe season 3 opener with a new companion a reintroduction to the Tenth Doctor and a wholly entertaining episode. Other great places to start are Rose although there's a lot of catching up to do The Eleventh Hour a completely brand new start perfect if you know absolutely nothing about anything in the show and Deep Breath an introduction to the current Doctor with a few entertaining characters who have already been in the show before. Generally starting with a Series 14 episode will be much easier with simpler stories a new companionDoctor each series and some enjoyable if upsetting season finales. Series 69 are harder to start at with characters carried over from previous seasons and plot lines and mysteries also carried on with. The individual episodes within the seasons however need no foreknowledge at all for Season 6 be sure to try The Doctor's Wife and The Girl Who Waited Season 7 try Asylum of the Daleks Dinosaurs on a Spaceship and The Bells of St John Season 8 try Flatline Listen or Kill the Moon and Season 9 try The Girl Who DiedThe Woman Who Lived The Zygon InvasionInversion and Heaven Sent which is absolutely incredible. It's a lot of episodes which for some seems too much. For me however it's never enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "In all honesty all I can say about Doctor Who is positive. It might have inconsistencies here and there but as a franchise it's the best television series ever produced. Doctor Who is thrilling action packed emotional funny and dramatic and it does this in a way that makes it fun to watch while not being too heavy like The Walking Dead or Breaking Bad. The main reason why Doctor Who is my favorite show is because it encapsulates everything good and bad about humanity to create a feel good series. It's plain old fun yet its scary surprisingly emotional and thought provoking. The acting the music and the script writing as a whole are phenomenal especially as the show progresses. I strongly recommend that if you do want to watch start from Series 1 in 2005. Starting from Series 5 is a quicker way to catch up to the upcoming series as the show gets a minor reboot and a much bigger budget but in my opinion Series 1 does a much better job at introducing the show the mystery it builds is fantastic the arcs are phenomenal and the characters are incredibly fleshed out. The earlier series look dated but it's really the characters and the story that hit home. I have loved every series I have seen especially Series 1 3 4 and 9. I think the best aspect of the show is how it has an overlying story that develops across each series and every episode but most episodes have enough to be self contained stories themselves. I highly recommend that everyone watch Doctor Who especially with their families. It has themes that adults will love and enough adventure action and silliness for the kids as well. While Doctor Who isn't perfect its as close to perfection as any series I have ever seen.".

	schema:headline " Doctor Who works better as a 50yearold franchise rather than just choosing one episode!";
	schema:reviewBody "I have been a fan of this series since almost the beginning of Series 2 my first proper episode was School Reunion however I had seen the last 20 minutes of Dalek back in 2005 but I didn't remember to tune back in the next week! Ever since then I've pretty much caught every episode on its broadcast except for the odd one where I've been away or indisposed. In 2007 I decided to take a look at the Classic Series  my first story was Genesis of the Daleks and I've loved it ever since. Slowly I've collected and watched almost every Classic episode available following the junking back in the 60s and I've come to love Doctor Who as part of my life like a dog or a cat something I can be with from time to time and have a smile on my face. In 2008 I even started scouring for Big Finish Audios novels and comics and I'm still collecting them to this day. By now of course we've had thirtyfour series with the New Who batch included twelve Doctors thirteen with Hurt 812 episodes 252 stories and 50 years of history. In many ways with the extreme amount of miscellany as part of the franchise you could compare Doctor Who very nearly to the Star Wars franchise and has its own culture and everything.What really gives this television show ten stars though is the continuity. This may be hard to explain because not many people usually comment on it. What I mean by continuity is that every single episode of Doctor Who is linked in some way or another by threads of storyline that cross the 50 years it has been in existence! Whether it's a returning nemesis an item of clothing or a passing reference there's always something to look out for and shout Ooh another easter egg for the Whovians!A simple example for you was back in the 5th series following Amy and Rory's wedding the Eleventh Doctor has just received a phone call in the TARDIS from someone claiming there is an Egyptian goddess loose on the Orient Express. Whilst there are a few slight changes to the context which could also have been a ploy three series later the Twelfth Doctor finally replies by visiting the Orient Express and discovers that it was a computerized identity known as Gus who had brought him there in the first place. It's simple yet in my mind it allows me a pause of nostalgia as I think back to how I watched the 5th series.The greatest example I've ever seen was again quite recent. In Moffat's polarising episode Listen Clara tells the young Doctor what she heard from his twelfth incarnation. One part of the speech springs to mind however Fear makes companions of us all. Not many will have perhaps realised but this was in reference to what the First Doctor once said to Barbara Wright in the Cave of Skulls in the third ever episode of the television show. In a very sublime way the series is never far away from reminding us about the past.As a recommendation I would give this show an openmind especially the New Series starting 2005. Some episodes are superb but others drop to the very bottom of the mediocre barrel. What I love about it though is its timeless story consistently great acting and the fact that the next series could bring absolutely anything to the table  there's just no way of predicting what is to come!Top 10 Doctor Who Stories 1.

I truly feel that this is a show that anyone and everyone can relate to no matter the generation age or background.I have to start with how I was introduced to the series. It was a Monday night and I was watching wrestling of course right? I mean what else is on on a Monday night for a thenmale bachelor?!. Around 9 PM I got a phone call from my best friend Hannah who said Hey dude! You need to turn it to BBC America now! My response? Why? I'm not British... She proceeded to tell me of this great series called Doctor Who and I was about to protest when I thought What the hell? Why not?As soon as I tuned in I loved it. The episode I watched starred the 10th Doctor David Tennant and I loved how I was on the edge of my seat at one moment and laughing the next. That's what started my voyage to becoming a Whovian.The series began in 1963 on BBC and is centered around a character simply known as the Doctor who is the last Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey. He travels through the far reaches of time and space in a time machine called the TARDIS Time and Relative Dimension in Space which is stuck in the disguise of a 1950s blue police box. With the aid of timetraveling companions he battles with different robotic and organic adversaries in the attempt to save other planets from suffering the same fate as Gallifrey. In addition instead of dying per se he regenerates into a different outer appearance. There has been 12 reincarnations of the Doctor who is currently played by Peter Capaldi.I absolutely love the entire series even those in the Classic Who series pre2005. The character has the ability to speak to many people in different ways. I think that is why there are so many people who like different reincarnations of the Doctor. My favorite reincarnation is the 10th Doctor masterfully played by David Tennant Fright Night Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire because he has a sense of humor but also has a maniacal dark side.The best thing that I love about it is that is has action suspense drama and comedy that can be seen even by children. My oldest son absolutely loves the Doctor who started with the 4th Doctor Tom Baker. Even though it is indeed geared toward children there is a tremendous fan base made up of all ages. It's a great show with a great story line that can show children that even if you have the power to go through time you still don't have everything. The Doctor shows the audience that he still longs for acceptance if not from his companions but from himself as well. He must fight his internal demons that threaten to crush him as much as his adversaries.If you're looking for a familyfriendly fun ride that you can continuously watch particularly if you're a fan of sciencefiction andor fantasy please consider Doctor Who. By the end I promise that you'll be saying the famous line from the 10th Doctor Allons y!".

	schema:reviewBody "It seems that there is a huge diversity in the reaction to this show. Fortunately for the IL' Doc I think this means he will be around for awhile again. I have seen Rose The first episode in the revamped BBC series and I have to say I am thrilled. The majority of the negative reviews seem to be coming from ultradie hard Whovians. I myself was a giant DR.Who nerd in my younger years. I had a subscription to Dr.Who magazine I sent Tom Baker a letter when I was 10 years old I still have the autograph he sent me back thank you Tom!My grandmother knitted me an eight foot long scarf etc..etc..I could tell you who Roger Delgado is and why when he looked like Geoffery Beevers he really wanted to go on Holiday to Traken.In early 1984 when I was 8 years old I met the Doctor and his friends Sarah and Harry. It was at midnight in Arizona on a black in white television that was barely 10 inches wide. I was transported to somewhere I had never been and have never been since.

The former obsessive fan with the critical eye and the adult who wanted to be whisked away by Pan again.I feel the show succeeds in the latter department. I had a huge smile on my face the entire 45 minutes and if I had to guess this show is going to capture the fancy of a lot of young ones and even though Doctor Who was always my best friend I'm ready to share him with the people who he was made for in the first place. Thank you Russell and welcome back Doc!".

I have seen Rose The first episode in the revamped BBC series and I have to say I am thrilled. The majority of the negative reviews seem to be coming from ultradie hard Whovians. I myself was a giant DR.Who nerd in my younger years. I had a subscription to Dr.Who magazine I sent Tom Baker a letter when I was 10 years old I still have the autograph he sent me back thank you Tom!My grandmother knitted me an eight foot long scarf etc..etc..I could tell you who Roger Delgado is and why when he looked like Geoffery Beevers he really wanted to go on Holiday to Traken.In early 1984 when I was 8 years old I met the Doctor and his friends Sarah and Harry. It was at midnight in Arizona on a black in white television that was barely 10 inches wide. I was transported to somewhere I had never been and have never been since.

Chris Chibnall has a fantastic budget to write with but so far has failed imo to come up with anything with dramatic tension. And Jodie Whittaker has had some godawful lines that will make it difficult for anyone to endear to her.Episode 3 'Spiders in the UK' left me aghast at how bad the ending was. The build up was OK and the SFX with the spiders was very good but to end with 'Oh well they'll die. Let's go home' was the writing of a teenager who just wanted to finish his homework.The episode also contained an attempt at a Donald Trump joke  a contemporary reference in a scifi show is not a good idea. It just helped to show the amateurish nature of the writing.This might be a little unfair on poor Jodie  David Tennant could run and it was used to generate tension in many episodes. Jodie can't run! She looks like your mum in an eggandspoon race at a primary school sports day  not good for dramatic tension.Having three 'companions' is the dumbest idea I have ever seen in Doctor Who. The point of the companion was they either got into trouble or they helped the Doctor out of trouble. Is that possible with three companions? So far they have just been an advert for inclusivity BBC at it again!.I loved the reboot by Russell T. Davies but this show no longer tries to equal the standards set by the man. Disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Make what you will of the pilot episode of the new Doctor Who. I myself was fairly dubious upon first viewing yet by the second episode Russell T Davies had established a mark that makes this series his own! Gone are the wobbly sets and loose plots without continuity. Despite the episodes being manned by several writers Davies manages to ingeniously weave them together. From the very first episode he leaves the slight inkling of an epic subplot the Doctor's heartfelt almostapologetic excuse to the Nestene Consciousness I couldn't save your world  I couldn't save ANY of them is incredibly engaging and it was this very line that drew me in to offer the series a second chance.And I'm incredibly glad I did. The series takes everything that made the original series popular and updates it for a new generation. The villains the ideals and the themes all reflect a world that people are living in today. And then Davies also adds something new to the character of the Doctor  a REAL mythology. He no longer has that familiar skip in his step that he was famous for  he's running on low battery power  and he has something no other Doctor had a survivor's guilt. A man left homeless by an epic war between an ancient and familiar enemy. He carries both the burden of the loss of his home and people but also the guilt that he somehow had a hand in it.This subplot runs through the course of the series and works incredibly well that no matter how random the location or episode plot beneath it lays that familiar drive that is guiding the audience toward the twopart finale. And what a finale! Not to spoil it for those who haven't seen the series but everything regarding the Time War comes to an explosive crescendo and at long last the Doctor appears to be able to put his demons to rest.And then there's Rose! Well I thought she was amazing and such a wellrounded character. You can believe her and the fact that she is very much our eyes and ears on both the Doctor and the life he gives her makes her even more endearing. But what sets her out from her predecessors as with the Doctor is she has a mythology of her own. A life a family a home  and Davies taps into those unanswered questions from the old series excellently. What happens to her life away from the Doctor? Do her friends and family miss her? Will she come back? If anything Rose is just as important as the Doctor. They have the electrifying chemistry that bristled with Lois Lane and Clark Kent Mulder and Scully and all the other great Willtheywon'tthey characters. With some shows pairing off the characters kills off a program but with these  you almost feel that it would only take the future plots and scenes even further! This series is fantastic  despite its one of two slight hiccups Episodes 45  and it is clear that both Davies and the BBC have taken slight influences from popular scifi shows such as Buffy and Angel. Though this is in no way a criticism. If you want to be the best you have to study the best. Adapting the story arc episode 6 placing a Big Bad to the forefront of the series and throwing in an enigmatic hook Bad Wolf gives the show an excellent feel of continuity and does not feel out of place in today's society.The Doctor's back  and he's here to stay! and PS  things in my opinion look VERY promising with Mr. Tennant.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been a big fan of Doctor Who for 38 years and watched it ever since I was 5. I have always looked forward to watching every episode.However they definitely dropped the ball with Capaldi not that he is a bad actor but they rammed SJW agendas down your throat. So much so that many episodes were basically unwatchable.Rather than get better writers they have decided to throw the entire essence and character out the window and replace it with a woman!!! Why on earth would you make such a bad decision. Don't get me wrong I was a big fan of Broadchurch great show and Jodi was perfect in that role as she is a very talented actor.It's just that I have always looked up to the doctor as a role model since I was a kid. He was my hero and now he is gone. And I don't resist change....I just love my hero!! Nothing wrong with that.Episode 1 I am forced to watch a women carrying a phallic shaped sonic screwdriver with a rainbow LGBT gender neutral Tshirt who judgmentally rolls her eyes at the nerdy white guy yeah I noticed it who wants to leave the train in the first 5 minutes of the first episode and seems to give up hope in the second episode towards the end something that the doctor would never ever do...as the Doctor has always been the bastion of hope even when all hope was gone. Episode 3  save the repressed African Americans from the evil racist white people. Episode 4  Parody of Trump but.....I'm not from America. I d o n ' t c a r e.Oh please. No.... Just No. It's beyond tedious and lame.What on Earth are they thinking? Have the writers lost their minds?Noone wants to watch this. Absolutely noone.It's less than pathetic.Plus to add injury to insult all the millions of fans who love the doctor are lambasted as sexist antichange manbabies blah blah bah.I don't think so.They just want some fun escapist sci fi fantasy with an epic hopeful hero who they have grown to trust respect and admire.I know I do.Please bring back The Doctor and end this travesty.Pretty Pretty Pretty Please".

I have always looked forward to watching every episode.However they definitely dropped the ball with Capaldi not that he is a bad actor but they rammed SJW agendas down your throat. So much so that many episodes were basically unwatchable.Rather than get better writers they have decided to throw the entire essence and character out the window and replace it with a woman!!!

There's absolutely no reason why the Doctor needed to change sex it was never part of canon.While the show has the name 'Doctor Who' it's essentially using an established brand to do a 180 on the fans. And that's not always a good thing. It reminds me of the Star Wars side story movies like Solo. All the characters are there but it was missing something that made it feel 'Star Wars' even though it had all the right pieces.If they had gone and done this as a spinoff of the series I'd be okay with it. Why not have a female Time Lord who goes around helping solve problems. But do not call the character The Doctor because it just feels like a gimmick to satisfy some sort of agenda. Without good writing and good stories it doesn't matter what you make the Doctor the series will fail. And that is what was hurting the series not the fact that the Doctor was a man.Let's have this experiment end by the end of the season and go back to the real Doctor Who we have all known and loved.".

Because I care what Johnny Singsalot does in his off hours! I really do! Now you may be thinking Hey! On the entire continent of North America less than 4 million people watched the first episode. Doesn't that mean this show sucks? Well to that I say less than 4 million people in North America have syphilis so sometimes low numbers bring good news now don't they?.

	schema:reviewBody "From the weeks and weeks of promotion for this ABC's The One was supposed to be The Real World meets American Idol. We were to watch these singers perform compete and see how they lived together in a house as well. The Drama! The Tension! Where does one begin with this atrocity? Let's start with the judges who were known as Music Experts on this program. Experts implies they have expertise. Andre Harrell at least had a pedigree. He was in charge of Motown Records for a time. The other two... eh. Kate Hudson's uncle who could have been labeled Mr. Weird Beard. He dyed his facial hair three distinctly different florescent colors. I wonder how scary he would have been with a black light! And The Paula Abdul wannabe who did something I didn't think could happen she was even more gushing and cloying than Paula! She then over corrected and became harshly critical after the first episode. The farce of critiques that these three offered was a true joke and an insult not only to the process of finding the best singer but to the audience that is now quite savvy already having done this numerous times on Fox.There was the host. George Stroumboulopoulos was no Ryan Seacrest. In fact he was as lackluster as can be. He actually sucked what little energy there was in the program dry. How he got that job was the second biggest mystery of the show.The first was how did they pick the 11 competitors for this program? This was literally a talentfree talent show. OK. Perhaps that's an exaggeration. And granted the performers all have to be relatively close in ability because if they were not there wouldn't be a contest. If only one person was good there would be no suspense. So I get that they all needed to be comparable. But they all should have had some chops! Additionally the judges were running a Singing Academy so the program was part Fame as well. Clearly these performers desperately needed those lessons. But you need some extremely talented people to teach those with little talent to be talented. And that definitely wasn't what was happening here.It seemed in casting the show the priority was on the homelife elements as all of the players were very attractive to look at in equal parts to how badly they vocalized. But the filmed segments in their house were so chopped and sliced you couldn't get into the stories that were starting to happen so the show didn't capture the events there either.As badly devised as all of that was The One had an incredible unbelievable fatal design flaw built into the results that made it completely laughable.The audience phoned in their votes for who they liked the best just like on AI. But then after the audience vote was revealed the bottom three contestants were forced to sing a final song. The music experts based on that performance chose one person from the three to save for the following week. And THEN the contestants who were safe got to vote for who they wanted to keep from the remaining two sending the remaining contestant home.The design flaw was that the contestants had the final say. I mean if you were in a music competition and you wanted to get as far along the path as you could would you vote to KEEP the better singer or would you try to get rid of your toughest rival? Any first season viewer of CBS's Survivor could answer that one! And that's exactly what happened on the program. The person who had the better potential was lost and the contestants voted back the one who had no talent at all! On top of that the contestant who was just saved from the bottom by the experts was also allowed to vote against the remaining two! It was a complete farce! Maybe if they let the contestants vote first at least the experts would save the better of two evils to finish. But this just confirms how not ready this show was for broadcast how unsatisfying the whole process was to view and how misguided the producers were in attempting it.".

Theatre great Jane Cowl is also highly amusing in one of only four film appearance's as Bob's mother. One small drawback. Montgomery is a perfect choice for the breeziness necessary to make his character work but he was 45 at the time this was made and looks it whereas Ann Blyth was 24 playing 19 and is convincing as such making their pairing a bit off. They would have been better paired as a father and daughter at this point. Be that as it may this is still a pleasant little known film.".

JORDAN THEY WERE EXPENDABLE THE LADY IN THE LAKE RIDE THE PINK HORSE THE SAXON CHARM JUNE BRIDE. Even some of the failures he was in were interesting enough to be still watchable RAGE IN HEAVEN MR. AND MRS. SMITH. But Montgomery wanted to do more and more production and directing work. In 1949 he made what would be his last movie performance  he played Collier Lang an egotistical movie star who is dragged into helping the authorities do an investigation about a young girl's boyfriend.Apparently my view of this film is a minority view. Most of the views given are favorable about it. I thought it was a dull witless script with Ann Blyth's groupie heroine not very appealing as a character. She admires Montgomery as a star and this helps when he is called in to assist the authorities but after awhile I found there was no chemistry between them. The script was also devoid of much fun although Montgomery and Roland Winters did try. The only thing I recall to this day as a joke point was that Taylor Holmes is the wealthy father of Blyth and he is an admirer of Winston Churchill. So he always dresses up as Churchill and we see him wearing a floppy broad brimmed hat smoking a large cigar and painting Holmes' bald head helps in the disguise. That was the most memorable joke from this film  not much of a real memory.Montgomery went into early television and finally won the attention and respect he always had deserved in motion pictures. His last contact with the movies was his direction of THE GALLANT HOURS about Admiral William Bull Halsey starring his friend Jimmy Cagney. It is a far better film than this. For his overall film and television career I will give this mediocre film a 4. That strikes me as generous.".

	schema:headline " One of the subtlest zany comedies of all time";
	schema:reviewBody "The plot of Once More My Darling is one of the goofiest of any movie I've ever seen. It has a cleverly disguised role reversal subtly woven into the script. I didn't realize it fully until a second viewing. And then I discovered even more wit and humor in third and fourth viewings. This film contains some marvelously subtle pokes and jabs at various aspects of life and things and people. And above all its a wonderfully clever social satire that packs much humor in the reversal of roles of male and female pursuer and pursued. The very plot makes it hard to catch everything. The situations are so outlandish and funny that it's easy for one to miss some of the many sidesteps in the dialog. Thus more viewings mean more laughter. To some extent this film is dated. A few of the references may not register with younger viewers today unless they know history very well. But for the most part the humor in this film should delight audiences of the 21st century just as it did those in the mid20th century. It's a wonderful zany comedy and subtle satire of many things from the Army to culture and custom and from the legal profession to the stage.The stars of this film seemed to be having a ball. In more than a couple of places it looked as though they were about to break out with laughter. I can imagine that happened and that it took a number of takes for some scenes. The cast of characters is a riot in itself. All the players do superb jobs in their roles. Robert Montgomery is attorney playboy Collie Laing an actor wannabe and World War II Army MP officer. Ann Blyth is Marita Connell daughter of a reclusive and strict tycoon. She overpowers people with her overdose of perfume and with her nonstop zany talking. She goes by the nickname on her Tshirt Killer. Jane Cowl is Collie's very witty attorney mother Mrs. Laing. Taylor Holmes is Jed Connell the crabby father of Killer. His hobby is painting because he admires Winston Churchill. Charles McGraw is Herman Schmelz chauffeur to the Connells and selfappointed protector of Killer. He was seven times a contender for the Middleweight title boxing. Roland Winters is Colonel Head Collie's active Army CO. John Ridgely is Burke a Gman who's hot on the trail of a WW II jewel thief from Europe. Only by the wildest stretch of one's imagination could all these characters and more be brought together. But Robert Carson's screenplay does just that. And this plot with its smaller interwoven plots makes for one zany hilarious movie. Here are some of the riotous lines. Mrs. Laing Don't you ever long for the patter of little feet? Collie Patter of little feet? You mean mice? Mrs. Laing Children also have little feet. Collie Madam don't tell me that at your age you're thinking of marriage again? Mrs. Laing Yes I am. Not for myself for you. Collie The War Department is obviously plotting my ruin. They won't be satisfied until they blow Taps over me.Receptionist Captain Laing is here colonel. Colonel Have him come in. Receptionist You may go in. Collie I will not go in without my mother. Receptionist He won't come in without his mother. Colonel Head Uhh  send them in.Mrs. Laing The truth of the matter is Colonel my client thinks you have a perfectly splendid Army but just this once he'd like to be excused.Mr. Burke We certainly know how to pick 'em. He's the prettiest military policeman I ever saw.Colonel Head Captain Laing there's an old German family in Upper Bavaria called Margradeyshillingsfosthengschweiller. Collie Oh I'm not surprised.Colonel Head He's an extremely violent personality I tell you there is nothing to worry about. By the way do you have a gun?Killer Herman are you with me or against me? Herman I'm with you Killer. No funny stuff. Collie You can depend on me Herman. Herman Oh I'm not worried about you.Collie I may appear a little priggish but if I gave in too easily to you I might do the same thing for some other girl and you wouldn't like that would you? Killer Gosh no you're a nice boy Collier. I honor you for it. But look out for me tonight.Killer Mrs. Laing did you know that Collie was a romantic dreamer? Emotional impulsive quick to embrace life? Mrs. Laing Well that side of his nature has been hidden from me.Killer Why the moment we met we threw caution to the wind.Killer I hope you'll all forgive me for going on like this but when a girl is facing the natural fulfillment of her aspirations  when she finds herself a part of a scheme of boy meets girl and the inevitable happens Collie Uh good night.Mamie Mr. Collie you've never had a girl like that before. Collie I take no credit for it personally. It could've happened to anyone.Killer Collie do you think your mother was impressed? Collie There must be a stronger word.Killer Darling I suppose you've always dreamed of a big church wedding with your mother and all your friends there? Collie Well yes. It is the most important day in a man's life. He gets to wear a cutaway and striped trousers and then there are the presents.Killer There's nothing to be afraid of dear. I'll be awfully gentle and tender.Mrs. Laing I'm not going to let you be the victim of a deranged siren in night wear I'll have you declared mentally incompetent. Say you were drugged by that perfume.Collie Good night man's best friend. Mrs. Laing Boy's best friend. Man's best friend is his dog.".

I compare it with Johnny Guitar at the seaside but 3 years earlier two women fighting for a man where mad love might lead one.The character of the female anti heroine Anne Providence is superb acting without compromise like a child lost alone on her search for a own female identity in a real mans world. Shes a quite strange moviehero not a funny pirate as most of her companions in this genre not making jokes all the time fighting for the poor and good and only killing the stupid spanish or british soldiers or  better  sly governors but shes murdering all the poor prisoners of war after she captured a ship look careful at this at the start of the movie shes primitive she cant even read she is desperated and she gets an alcoholic she looses all her friends as consequence of her obstinacy and shes wearing rags most of the film. This film shows a pirate hero a little ! bit as he or in this case she but there has been a female Anne buccaneer Anne Boney might have been in brutal reality.The film is quite short and the story is told in a breathtaking manner. Certainly a film from the 1950s has no exciting special effects for present time viewers the ships swim very obvious in a bath tube but this real drama about love that kills trust betrayal revenge hatred and sacrifice drives one crazy. Maybe Anne is even supposed to be Judas Iskarioth and Jesus from Nazareth in one person being betrayed by her friend the french LaRochelle as Jesus after being disappointed by the friend delivering him to a death penalty as Judas than getting remorse about this like Judas who commits suicide according to the gospel of Matthew and in the end sacrificing herself for the rescue of the beloved enemy as Jesus. But even if you are not interested in this philosophical questions of guilt and atonement the film brings a lot of cheap action as sword fights and burning plastic ships for a very short one and a half hour.".

Starring Jean Peters as the femalebuthardly pirate Captain Providence Tourneur uses expectations of gender roles and genre to explore Providence's struggles with her sexual identity. In fact she remains almost asexual  whilst she shows little interest in men or only as sexual objects she is similarly ambivalent or downright hostile to women or wenches.Although the cinematography and lighting lacks the stylistic force that is inherent in so many of Tourneur's other films Cat People I Walked With A Zombie and Out of the Past most notably the film is almost thematically flawless. Though these stylistic concerns are to the film's detriment the script and Tourneur's ability to play strongly to subtle subtexts overcome such problems.".

To the extent she may have a double doing the action it's hard to tell...but Peters herself obviously is doing a good deal of it and doing it well.  With a good and serious script this could have been an excellent film. But it's basically cheesy. Still entertaining however.  Not up to a regular Jacques Tournier film but definitely above a regular Jean Peters film. Color is typical of this '50s time period ie. too garish and not realistic. The actors for Blackbeard and her first mate and the drunken doctor were good. Louis Jordan was a bit weak. I don't think Debra Paget was right either. But certainly Jean Peters and Debra Paget were probably the two best looking female stars in the '50s.".

Love revenge and sacrifice are at the heart of this engaging story.The incomparable Louis Jourdan portrays Captain Pierre Franois LaRochelle who is forced into pretending to be a prisoner on a pirate ship whose purpose is to spy on Blackbeard Thomas Gomez and Captain Providence Jean Peters. The discovery that Providence is a woman changes LaRochelle's game plan he woos and romances her all the while holding tight to the fact that he is happily married to Molly Debra Paget. When LaRochelle plots to have Providence captured she realizes his truth and kidnaps Molly as revenge.Revenge because LaRochelle does not truly love her. He had lied to get what was needed in order to get his own ship back. Despite the tough exterior that Providence exhibits she is still a womana reality that LaRochelle had shown her through his albeit false tenderness. She even reneges on her banishment to a deserted cay where she had taken Pierre and Molly and arranges their departure moments before she engages in battle with Blackbeardher mentorand is killed. Her last act is the kindest Providence has ever shown. It also cements her legend as one of the great pirates.This is a tale of lovetrue love and unrequited love. Pierre's true love lies with Molly. Providence's love for Pierre is unrequited. However witnessing the true love shared between Pierre and Molly quenches Providence's thirst for revenge and opens her kindness and humanity. She sacrifices herself so that Pierre and Molly can live out their lives together. That is indeed a noble act.".

	schema:reviewBody "The legend of Anne Romney here referred to as Anne Providence has recently been made into a shortlived Broadway musical but in the early 50's there were two films about her which couldn't be any more different in presentation. Universal's Double Crossbones features Romney as a secondary character played by the quite imposing looking Hope Emerson in support of Donald O'Connor. That was a comedyadventure but for a more serious look at her 20th Century Fox cast their rising player Jean Peters as the legendary captain of the Sheba Queen. Peters was much more diminutive than Emerson best known as the evil matron in Caged so it makes a different character altogether. But she is still as tough trained by none other than Blackbeard Thomas Gomez in a very showy performance to captain her own ship. She is first seen in a sword fight with Blackbeard revealed only to be for fun. When Frenchman Louis Jourdan is about to be made to walk the plank Peters steps in to save his life learning he is an enemy of the British. It is her love for him an enemy of Blackbeard's which causes her mentor to declare war on her and she in turn declares war on Jourdan when she learns that he is married. Herbert Marshall plays her drunken adviser who incurs her wrath when he disapproves of her revenge on Jourdan and his wife Debra Paget.This is a colorful tale of the romanticism of pirate life that will delight fans of the Pirates of the Caribbean series. Some parts of the movie in fact highly resemble the ride at Disney's Amusement Parks. From an entertainment point of view the film works its magic and ranks a good review. Peters gives a lot of gusto to her portrayal and Jourdan is romantic and handsome. Paget gets to be a bit more than decorative and veteran actor Marshall gives a touching wise performance. While the true story of Anne Romney may be quite different this will do for a typical rousing Hollywood version of the legends of the high seas.".

Velvetyvoiced Marshall is uncharacteristically cast as the ships obligatory philosophical lush of a doctor and Gomez is suitably largerthanlife as Blackbeard The Pirate.The cast is completed by Debra Paget as Jourdans wife who incurs the jealous rage of the tomboyish titular character in whom Jourdan instills the first pangs of love which however does not spare him the occasional flogging or swordwound incidentally the film was the second exotic teaming of Jourdan and Paget in one year following Delmer Daves BIRD OF PARADISE. The direct result of this unexpected softening of Annes character is her falling out with Blackbeards crew and her unlikely climactic sacrifice in order to save the lives of the stranded Jourdan Paget and Marshall.While the film is not a particularly outstanding example of its type Jacques Tourneurs energetic direction and Franz Waxmans grandiose score ensure an aboveaverage effort that moves along at a brisk pace incidentally Tourneur had already done service in the genre with the superior Burt Lancaster vehicle THE FLAME AND THE ARROW 1950. As usual with vintage Technicolor productions the cinematography gives the film a sumptuousness that is invigorating. By the way differing runningtimes are given for this film 81 or 87 minutes and for the record the version I watched was the shorter one.".

This time the captive is not a beautiful woman but a handsome Frenchman LOUIS JOURDAN who naturally catches the eye of the tomboyish heroine and makes her wish she looked more like a woman. What she doesn't know is that he does indeed have a wife DEBRA PAGET who fills the role of conventional beauty nicely.Some of it is actually fun to watch and it's a nobrainer that given the standards of the 1950s the ending will conclude the way it does. I like JEAN PETERS very much but this is one role that would have served MAUREEN O'HARA better. O'Hara had a more convincing way with a sword and the fiery temperament to go with the role.".

Reality does not often intrude in movies about women and pirates.However though women don't generally get much betterlooking than Jean Peters she came across as believable ordering men into battle and swinging a sword herself.In fact though maybe I'm not a good judge I thought she looked fearsome dueling with sailors and pirates. Supposedly Basil Rathbone was at least one of the best fencers in Hollywood if not the best and I felt she could have taken him on.Watching her incredibly expressive face especially during the fight scenes is the best part of viewing Anne of the Indies. She struck me in fact as one of the best actresses I have ever had the pleasure of watching and certainly the best woman pirate  taking nothing away from any of the others.She was ably assisted by a superlative cast including Herbert Marshall playing the only really sympathetic character.But James Robertson Justice did shine as the righthand man. Thomas Gomez usually so good in anything was terribly overweight to be Blackbeard but still seemed suitably scary.Louis Jourdan was so cool and collected so at home in his role he almost blended into the background  which might be a sign of great talent.One of my personal favorites is Sean McGlory whom I interviewed after his stage appearance in an Oscar Wilde play. He doesn't appear in Anne of the Indies until fairly late but just grabs a viewer's attention.I think the ending was rather weak and even disappointing but every part is so well played and the effects were so nearly perfect I can rate the move very good over all.I highly recommend Anne of the Indies if only for the joy and pleasure in watching Jean Peters and the admiration her performance will inspire.".

	schema:reviewBody "This story will likely keep you entertained throughout with occasional action events and complex interpersonal relationships not to mention a bombastic Blackbeard. Like Maureen O'Hara in 1952's Against All Flags 25yo Jean Peters was privileged to star as a woman pirate captain thus achieving the fantasy of a woman ordering a sizable group of men about. Both developed credible skill with a rapier which added credence to their position. In Jean's case she duels with BlackbeardThomas Gomez in a semifriendly bout then engages in serious bouts. Clearly Jean as Captain Anne Providence is enjoying her role putting her all into it....As the story unfolds Anne hates anything British blaming them for killing her brother who like her had been nurtured by a young Blackbeard. Now she was feared nearly as much as Blackbeard. Soon she sinks a British ship making the crew walk the plank all except a handsome Frenchman  whom she calls 'Frenchie'Louis Jordan to whom she gives the option of joining her crew or walking the plank. She treats him with some suspicion at first but gradually warms up to him and eventually they engage in a passionate kiss or two something she's presumably never done before with a crew member. But then she would have him flogged at one point. Later she would discover that Frenchie had a beautiful wifeDebra Paget as Molly housed in Port Royal and that he was actually a spy for the British who had impounded his ship and wouldn't give it back until he captured either Anne or Blackbeard. Anne captured Molly  and threatened to throw her to her crew or sell her into white slavery. But before all this happened she had defended FrenchieCaptain La Rochelle from attack by Blackbeard who claimed he was an excaptain and a spy. She made Blackbeard and his small crew leave the island. Blackbeard would get his revenge in the end. So now Anne has the British Frenchie and Blackbeard all out to get her. Eventually she captures Frenchie and maroons him with his wife on a very small island hoping they will starve or die of thirst. Then she has a change of heart returns and gives them a small boat. This proves her downfall as Blackbeard is closing in. After losing Frenchie and Blackbeard as friends or lovers Anne seems to have no close friends male or female. She despises the wenches who provide comfort to the pirates and others in the few towns. She also despises kept ladies such as Molly. She apparently only respected women like herself who had earned the status of being a leader in the outside world  or had mastered a complex job normally done by men. She had earned her exalted status despite being functionally illiterate as most women of that time were. Check out YouTube to see it.".

Well it's not. Tho it's not totally without value as a curio piece. Out of 20th Century Fox Anne Of The Indies is adapted by Philip Dunne  Arthur Caesar from a short story written by Herbert Ravenel Sass. Direction is by Jacques Tourneur the score is by Franz Waxman and Harry Jackson is providing the Technicolor photography. Jean Peters is in the titular title role of Anne AKA Captain Providence and support comes from Louis Jourdan Debra Paget Herbert Marshall Thomas Gomez  James Robertson Justice.Originally meant to be be based on true life pirate Anne Bonny the film ultimately turns out to be a tale of a woman seeking identity and finding herself in the predominantly male led world of piracy and sea based shenanigans. Filled with clichs and over familiar set pieces the film also suffers from a cast that is largely misfiring. Peters gives it a right good go and Paget lights up the screen with effervescent beauty. While Robertson Justice although underused actually looks the part and doesn't overact like the rest of the male cast does. Some reviewers have desperately tried to dig deep into the film to find intelligence and hidden meanings purely because it's Tourneur in the directing chair. But there is no depth here this is merely a job for Tourneur a professional one granted but its thinly plotted and actually lacking swash to go with the buckle in the action stakes. Disposable at best. 410".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the sort of thing that the studios were experts in grinding out in the 40s and 50s. The opening credits are flung across the screen in huge crimson letters. The musical score by Franz Waxman resembles on a lower plane the exquisite bombast of Eric Wolfgang Korngold who was referred to by one of his detractors as Wolfgang von Korngold.That fact is only worth mentioning in passing but so is this entire movie. I liked it especially when I saw it as a child in the Mayfair Theater in Hillside New Jersey. I thrilled at the boom of the cannon shivered when a protagonist was threatened with death by cutlass chuckled when Thomas Gomez as Blackbeard swilled wine and overturned wooden tables and stirred in my seat when the pale prim innocent Debra Paget was thrown into Captain Paradise's cabin with her dress half torn off.That particular incident went nowhere because the captain was Anne of the Indies Jean Peters. As the stern scowling pirate captain Peters I think all of us must admit was a little butch but she was heterosexual. She proved that when she made chaste love to her prisoner played by the handsome suave organically grown Frenchman Louis Jourdan. That lovemaking wouldn't be so pure in one of today's movies. And I'm not so sure that Debra Paget would have remained unscathed.The plot. Some nonsense about rivalries and possessions and revenge involving Peters Gomez and Jourdan. Peters having discovered that Jourdan and Paget are married is convulsed with rage and jealousy. She maroons the two of them on one of those desert islands with nothing but sand and she sneers as she describes the horrible deaths they will suffer because they have no food or water. Actually I think if they dug deep enough they'd find a fresh water lens. I don't know about the food situation. The best they could hope for would be crude versions of moules mariniere or zarzuela de mariscos.Jean Peters plays the role of the unlettered Pirate Queen in a blunt and onedimensional fashion. She was really good in Sam Fuller's Pickup On South Street. Louis Jourdan is too debonair for me. I suspect he wins a lot of goodlooking women just because of his French accent. Fine for him but what about the rest of us? Thomas Gomez is fine as the blustering uninhibited proudful Blackbeard. He looks as if he's wearing a fat suit. I met him in a now defunct San Francisco night club called Finnochio's. Debra Paget has very little to do except look distressed.".

	schema:reviewBody "So let me get this straight Roger Corman for reasons only he himself knows decided to remake the film Forbidden World. Not only did he remake it he apparently decided to take out most of the nudity make it less gory and make it a bit more talkative. Why? I am sure everyone out there would like an answer to this but I am guessing he wanted to make a more serious version or something. This one is basically a lot less fun version you have Marc Singer and his robot pal going to a planet cause an experiment has gone array. So yes like Forbidden World only with all the fun stripped from it. It was not all bad as there was one rather good jump moment I was not expecting and there was a couple of good gore effects but overall Forbidden World has this one beat in nearly every possible way. I mean the effects were even better in that one as was the music. In that one it was a really nifty 80's sounding set of tracks while this was very forgettable. Stupid twists and the ending was not as cool either. That and another thing that made this film kind of hard to watch was the fact it featured more creature in the air vent scenes. I have watched a lot of horror movies the past few weeks and this theme is getting old. The monster does not look as good the robot looks dreadful though it did not look great in the original just not enough here. Even the girls were more attractive in the other film. Though this film features one of the most unheroic moments I have ever seen near the end that had me chuckling too. Still if I did not get this on a double feature set of movies along with The Terror Within I would be a bit more ticked off.".

And when a man is attacked by it he simply seems to be holding an inanimate object against himself so that it won't fall to the ground. This is still not the worst Alien ripoff around the two Xtro films are even worse for example it's actually sufficiently entertaining if you've got 68 !! minutes to spare.     12".

	schema:reviewBody "The first thing about Dead Space I couldn't help noticing immediately was the running time displayed on the back of the VHScover. It states 70 minutes! Okay here on the IMDb the running time is supposedly 80 minutes but that probably includes trailers andor full closing credits. 70 minutes is practically nothing. How can you possibly tell a proper SciFi tale in such a short period? Well see below this review for a couple of tips on how to make your film shorter but usually it's not the best idea. But hey Dead Space is a very redundant movie in general. It is more than obvious that this thing got made in probably even less than a week under the strict surveillance of Roger Corman. It's a remake of Forbidden World which was released also by Corman not even ten years earlier. That movie was a shameless Alien ripoff so basically Dead Space is the remake of a ripoff. Only Corman is shameless enough to make the exact same film twice and then still include footage from his other work like Battle Beyond the Stars. Marc Singer who here looks like he might be Kevin Bacon's older brother plays a lone space macho cowboy who arrives on the research facility planet Phaebon together with his petrobot Tinpan after they picked up an S.O.S signal. He literally crashlands amidst a group of scientists that are trying to develop a virus to destroy another virus namely the lethal Delta5 disease. Little problem however their anti virus developed itself into a monster and finds pleasure in killing off the crew members. One of the main reasons why I liked Forbidden World so much was because of the awesomely cheesy monster design and special effects. That film had an amazing lowbudgeted Batmosphere going for it! Dead Space is also very lowbudgeted and cheesy but it never manages to bring forward the same irresistible charm or outrageous enthusiasm. I guess that's a privilege exclusively for 80's movies. The mutant monster looks like a clay dragon and the killings are very uninspired. This is one film that can easily be skipped except of course if you're a sucker for cheap and amateurishly directed Alien ripoffs like there are literally hundreds of out there. As promised I'm going to reveal some tips about how to make your movie fit right into the 70 minutes limit. For example combine sequences! Director Fred Gallo knows that every selfrespecting SciFi movie needs A a sex sequence B a dream sequence and C a monsterbursting throughthechest moment. In Dead Space these three classic scenes are one and the same! The lead girl dreams she has sex with Marc Singers and witnesses the creature bursting through her chest right before waking up! Secondly if you have a eightheaded cast but not the time to introduce them start by killing two of them before the cause of the problem is even properly established. If you don't want to waste too much time on the remaining six neither then make sure they live up to the most commonly known stereotypical trademarks of cinema. One of them needs to be an obsessed scientist who'll continue with the experiments no matter what one of them needs to be an insufferable coward and you also need one strong female cast member to put the link with Ellen Ripley in Alien. See it's easy.".

Once he gets there with his robot sidekick he finds out the scientists have been performing a series of genetic experiments that have unleashed a big ol' monster. This isn't nearly as good as the original but it does feature a fine alien and nice performance by Singer. He really can make anything just the slightest bit better with his everyman delivery. The only place where the remake trumps the original is in the insertion of nudity. WORLD had a really gratuitous bit with Vint and a female companion in a sauna type area. This is even more casual as the nudity is inserted in a dream sequence a character has during all the chaos. Finding a place for that in the film's short 72minute running time is perhaps its biggest merit.".

The makeup and creature effects are actually not that bad thanks to the efforts of Gabe Bartalos an old pro at this sort of thing. If one is already familiar with Forbidden World they'll experience a fair bit of deja vu as this version sticks pretty close to the original plot.Singer is passable as the hero and the ladies Laura Mae Tate Judith Chapman Lori Lively are pretty. Randy Reinholz delivers a useless performance as an equally useless character named Tim.

	schema:reviewBody "The Merchant of Four Seasons is a film about a lack of love. The film starts off with the main character Hans Epp returning from a spell in the foreign legion. He returns to his mother not to be told how much she loves him or how much she's missed him but to be told that he is worthless and even worse that she would have preferred the man he went with to have come back instead. It is the character's relation to women that makes this film so hateful the fact that his wife is taller than him is symbolic of his relation to the other gender he is consistently humiliated by them and it is through his relations with them that his life isn't as great as it could have been. This is also shown clearly by the way he treats his wife after a drink. He lost his job as a policeman through lust for a woman and even his wife a woman that is supposed to love him never really shows any affection for him. Even at the end his wife is more bothered about what her and her daughter will do than the state of her husband.The Merchant of Four Seasons is a thoroughly unpleasant film. There isn't a scene in the movie where someone is happy and not only that but the movie seems deliriously blissful to wallow in the misery of it's central characters. The movie is certainly not recommended to anyone who is currently having a hard time that's for sure. Despite all the misery the film never steps out the bounds of reality every event in this movie can  and most probably has  happened and that only serves in making the movie more shocking. The film is of course helmed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder the cult German director that committed suicide in 1982. This is only my second taste of the man's work but through just two films it is easy to get an idea of the type of art that he creates. Both films are downtrodden and gritty  yet realistic pieces of art. His characterization in this movie is subtle we only ever get to know the characters through their plight's and not through their character. This is a very clever way of showing the audience that it is their surroundings that define the people in the film not the people themselves  and as nearly everyone that sees the film knows what living in an urban society is like it wont difficult for the majority of people to relate to. The Merchant of Four Seasons is not a film that is easily forgettable the movie is high on substance and low on style and that makes for a very memorable picture and one that everyone who considers themselves to be a fan of cinema should experience. It is with that in my mind that I give this film my highest recommendations it's not sweet and it's not pleasant but you will not see a more realistic portrayal of depression and this is most certainly a movie that will stay with you.".

He lost his job as a policeman through lust for a woman and even his wife a woman that is supposed to love him never really shows any affection for him. Even at the end his wife is more bothered about what her and her daughter will do than the state of her husband.The Merchant of Four Seasons is a thoroughly unpleasant film. There isn't a scene in the movie where someone is happy and not only that but the movie seems deliriously blissful to wallow in the misery of it's central characters. The movie is certainly not recommended to anyone who is currently having a hard time that's for sure. Despite all the misery the film never steps out the bounds of reality every event in this movie can  and most probably has  happened and that only serves in making the movie more shocking. The film is of course helmed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder the cult German director that committed suicide in 1982. This is only my second taste of the man's work but through just two films it is easy to get an idea of the type of art that he creates. Both films are downtrodden and gritty  yet realistic pieces of art. His characterization in this movie is subtle we only ever get to know the characters through their plight's and not through their character. This is a very clever way of showing the audience that it is their surroundings that define the people in the film not the people themselves  and as nearly everyone that sees the film knows what living in an urban society is like it wont difficult for the majority of people to relate to. The Merchant of Four Seasons is not a film that is easily forgettable the movie is high on substance and low on style and that makes for a very memorable picture and one that everyone who considers themselves to be a fan of cinema should experience. It is with that in my mind that I give this film my highest recommendations it's not sweet and it's not pleasant but you will not see a more realistic portrayal of depression and this is most certainly a movie that will stay with you.";

	schema:reviewBody "THE MERCHANT OF FOUR SEASONS was Rainer Werner Fassbinder's first shot at mainstream acceptance. In a turbulent career of just fifteen years he managed to create an astounding body of work in film and theater both as a performer and a creative producer actor and director. Although this movie might not appeal to many viewers the film has much to offer. The storyline is fairly straightforward. A man is ostracized from his upper middle class family due to emotional and economic problems and proves unable to control his downward spiral. THE MERCHANT OF FOUR SEASONS is shot with a slavish devotion to elegant detail and each set is very carefully designed and constructed. Every object on set seems painstakingly arranged so as to provoke layers of emotional texture. Many religious paintings and icons decorate the walls of the various rooms and seem to speak to Hans's desperate quest for spiritual meaning or direction in his life. Much thought was given to how lighting and color were employed to contrast and enhance the drama. Several times during the film I froze the frame to marvel at the beauty of the shot's composition. I streamed this film and the print was nearly flawless and second to none. Fassbinder employs his actors in an almost vehement AntiNatural' style. He does everything possible to prevent the actors from reacting in a normal or colloquial manner and this creates a rather stilted effect. However by doing so he injects an almost 'hyperreality' to the narrative. Rather than the presentation of a mundane melodrama the actors almost militant lack of affectation forces the viewer to confront the film in a different manner. Fassbinder's film intentionally prevents the viewer from easily connecting with the characters' trials and tribulations. You are constantly on the outside looking in. This will be a disconcerting experience for many but I found it to be a unique and satisfying artistic adventure.".

	schema:headline " Fassbinder's first real melodrama.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Merchant of Four Seasons established a number of trademarks both visual and thematic that would become further refined and much more expressive in the Fassbinder films to follow. Here for example we see the action unfold through the eyes of a tortured antihero and his literally abused wife as they strive to put aside petty differences the ghosts of the past and the animosity of friends family and neighbours in an attempt to overcome the monotonous misery of everyday life. However as with most Fassbinder films the daily grind often ends up being too severe  and generally things never go to plan  leaving most of the characters feeling damaged depressed worthless or worse. With that in mind it would be easy to dismiss Fassbinder's work as nothing more than misanthropic selfpity yet to do so would require us to disregard the threedimensional characters the meaningful dialog and the heart that seems to beat at the centre of all of his films.Unlike many other director's who have mined the socialrealist path Fassbinder never looks down on his characters to gloat or heap scorn and instead seems to have a genuine warmth and love for then. That said he respects the fact that such reallife archetypes can often fall foul of the system ending up as nothing more than damaged shells forced to enter into a downward spiral that takes time faith and selfbelief to truly escape from. The central notion of The Merchant of Four Seasons then involves a character that has fallen into one such spiral that has crushed his very will to escape. So like the characters in later works like Fox and his Friends Mother Ksters Goes to Heaven and In A Year With 13 Moons Hans Epp becomes a character that has through circumstance and upbringing been led towards an ultimate downfall that he both accepts and embraces. As you can imagine from such a barebones description The Merchant of Four Seasons is bleak stuff offering an honest and at times rather ugly depiction of failure despair contempt and alienation.Fassbinder attempts a purposely fractured narrative with The Merchant of Four Seasons beginning the film with a scene in which Hans returns from a stint in the Foreign Legion. He expects a heroes welcome but instead is chastised by his mother for waking her up at such an ungodly hour before lamenting the fact that the young man dragged along by Hans to fight by his side has been killed whilst her errant son has returned the good die young and people like you come back she says before closing the door in his face. The scene establishes the relationship between Hans and his mother perfectly and will go some lengths towards explaining Hans's often quite violent relationship with his own wife Irmgard. Later scenes presented in similarly fragmented flashbacks inform us of Hans's past as a promising scholar before he dropped out to join the Legion his dismissal from the police force after accepting sexual favours from a prostitute the humiliation in the eyes of his family and friends of having to become a common fruit vendor and his inability to woo the great love of his life.Like many of Fassbinder's key characters Hans remains a tragic antihero. On the one hand we feel pity and to some extent empathy for this short overweight character so unfortunate in life that he's even ended up married to a tall slender woman who's very appearance can only exaggerate his physical shortcomings but at the same time he comes across as quite vile and detestable. The scene in which the drunken Hans viciously beats his wife  whilst his young daughter tries desperately to protect her mother  is captured in a static medium shot that goes on for so long that the actions run from the heartbreaking to the comedic to the tragic and beyond!! Even when Hans seems to be getting his life back together finally winning the respect of his family and even establishing a successful working relationship with his old Legion pal Harry there's still something missing. Fassbinder's point seems to be that the failures of our early life can only dictate the direction of our adult life whilst one scene in particular in which Hans's daughter Renate asks her aunt Anna if her father is going to die seems to sum up the soul of the film perfectly with Anna replying he will live as long as he wants to live.Ultimately The Merchant of Four Seasons is a film about a character resigned to a life from which there is no escape... a life in which his very presence is enough to poison the lives of those around him!! Hans Hirschmller's performance as the tragic Hans is exceptional stuff managing to elicit a degree of sympathy for this dark and complicated character. As great as Hirschmller is he is far eclipsed by Fassbinder regular Irm Hermann who offers a touching and sympathetic performance as Hans's loveless and equally complex wife. Further support is offered by Hanna Schygulla Klaus Lwitsch Ingrid Caven and Kurt Raab... though the film belongs to Fassbinder who here begins to develop the style that would later lead to masterworks like The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant Fear Eats the Soul Fox and His Friends The Marriage of Maria Braun and In A Year With 13 Moons. Though perhaps too morose and continually bleak for some viewers The Merchant of Four Seasons remains an intelligent honest and subtly affecting look at failure alienation and despair.".

And despite the complex portrayalHans himself doesn't precisely make these claimsthe above must be a substantial part of Fassbinder's thinking as well his use of Freud and Marx. But the viewer may look no further than Hans' gender and sexism to locate the truer cause of his crushed spirit.First it's highly unlikely that his mother's lack of love pushed him into signing up with the Foreign Legion. It was far more likely and is in part indicated that it was a quest for adventure male camaraderie escape from the female world of mother and sister and male identity itself which both the Legion and war offered.Second Hans loses his successful job as a policeman because of his own sexism. By falling for a prostitute's wiles at work he not only rubber stamps prostitution as an oppressive institution but shows that he cannot even control his sexuality in a professional arenaand is even willing to jeopardize a desirable career.Third he commits serious verbal abuse against his wife in front of his sheeplike male buddies making no distinction at all between her absence orwhen she shows up looking for himpresence. In fact he is more brutal in her presence.A few hours later in a violent and drunken state he beats his wife in front of their daughter who intervenes on her mother's behalf. The terror he instills in her and his daughter are palpable. But both heand the audiencemove on with nary a whimper of conscience or protest. Why? Because his wife is cruelly characterized as both nagging and sexually promiscuous yes this this may be Fassbinder's view of what capitalism does to womenowned insecure and a commoditybut this hardly absolves Hans' brutality nor Fassbinder's exploitation of her in the battery scene.And then there is this male role pressure which Hans could choose to reject and protest but instead accepts. He's too short for a male and too unheroic to achieve the worldly success the male role recommends. But how can these be causes of despair when he not only gains his lost love as a mistress but marries a tall woman who is considerably more attractive than himself. Finally Hans allows Harry his war comrade to remain over his wife's convincing plea to the contrary on in their house. By this decision he not only makes it clear that he is more tied to Harry than to his wife but that male bonding supersedes his love of women. And supersedes in the end his own life because it is Harry's superior competence and spirit around the house that causes Hans' star to fall. Hans the merchant may be to a degree the victim of capitalism but more to the point he is the victim of his own allegiance to his own male identity. His inability to let it go is the ultimate cause for his isolation and despair.This is something that is lost I think not only on Fassbinder but also on Han's sister Annaalthough only to a degree lost. For Anna's and Fassbinder's support of her brotherover her mother only goes so far. She is quite insistent that only he can save himselfthat her support and love cannot it itself end his selfloathing. Unfortunately she does not offer any of this same support and love for his wife who must be much more embittered than Hans but who in the end is able to pick up the pieces and save herself and daughter and present a marked contrast to Han's fall.".

But it's certainly no less than a fascinating experiment in taking a look at those in a society that you and me and others we know might possibly know or not really want to know. I imagine in the early 70s in Germany a generation coming out of WW2 had a stigma to live with but tried their best just to get by. This is a stigma that floats all over this film and in many instances in Fassbinder's work in general but especially because with Four Seasons he takes his eye on the middle class and a particular married couple the distanced depressed angry Hans the fruit seller and his longsuffered wife that is nothing short than trying for realism in the guise of melodrama. If Cassavetes were a crazy German he might make this film maybe even as just a lark.The story sounds simple enough where Hans' drinking gets out of control he beats his wife this scene is one of the toughest to take maybe in just any movie the way Fassbinder's camera lingers without a cut as his wife is left helpless and their daughter trying to stop him in his frenzy and then she's ready to leave him. As he stands in the room her family holding him back she makes the call for divorce and he gets a heart attack right there. He recovers his business suddenly starts booming again with some help from some good or not so good employees  and yet this only continues his longing for another woman and his despair in general.And yet it's in this simplicity that Fassbinder tries and succeeds for the most part in attaining a mood of dread of a tense vibe in a kitchen or in the bedroom or out on the street that you can cut with a knife and bleed out. The weakest part of this all may be the acting... at least that was my initial impression. Hans played by Hirschmuller can be a stilted presence with only the slightest movements in his face and eyes and for a while it doesn't look like he's much of a good actor. The actress playing his wife Irm Hermann and her sister Fassbinder Hanna Schygulla fare better but only cause they're given more to do conventionally like cry or look concerned. It takes some time to adjust to what is essentially a void in his guy Hans of something from his own psychological selftorment or selfpity that pervades himself and those around him who just want to get on with some sense of normalcy especially once Hans gets successful.Not everything clicks together in The Merchant of Four Seasons but enough did to make me recommend it to those looking for a different sliceoflife than you might be used to with more modern American movies. Fassbinder's world here is a combat between the melodrama he loves in cinema and the harsh crushing sense of humanism that he feels personally and puts into characters that for better or worse we somehow identify with. Are the Epps a family you know of? Or could you even be them? Who's to say. It's a methodical study of tragic emptiness in the human spirit and its goals are all attained.".

Some of the scenes are exaggerated the family confrontations but I particularly liked the sequence where Hans is desperately searching for meaning  comfort he tries to find some peace in natural surroundings goes back to his first lost love in order to recapture past feelings she's only interested in a quick fling before her husband returns and visits his sister perhaps the only person who has any degree of sympathy for him only to find she's too busy with work.A poignant story of a vulnerable inarticulate man crushed by his mundane surroundings and  bourgeoise middleclass German values obsessed with economic success and a upward mobility that conveniently papers over the cracks of its more disturbing past.".

	onyx:emotionText "I didn't find this film as accessible as 'Fox  his Friends' but it was a moving portrayal of a typical Fassbinder victim figure the eponymous barrowboy Hans Epp whose hopes and dreams are eventually crushed by stultifying conformity family  society. Some of the scenes are exaggerated the family confrontations but I particularly liked the sequence where Hans is desperately searching for meaning  comfort he tries to find some peace in natural surroundings goes back to his first lost love in order to recapture past feelings she's only interested in a quick fling before her husband returns and visits his sister perhaps the only person who has any degree of sympathy for him only to find she's too busy with work.A poignant story of a vulnerable inarticulate man crushed by his mundane surroundings and  bourgeoise middleclass German values obsessed with economic success and a upward mobility that conveniently papers over the cracks of its more disturbing past.";

The occasional zooms seem a bit uncomfortable at times and unnatural but then again Fassbinder was still coming out of his purely avant garde phase. This might be because Michael Ballhaus isn't behind the camera but instead the slightly inferior Dietrich Lohmann.Still this is Fassbinder and you get your fix here.  Broken dreams shown so vividly and unflinchingly as to alienate audience and drive them into a depressed stupor.  Just what the doctor ordered.

TM4S is a fairly simple story but it can be difficult or painful to watch due to the subject matter class prejudices domestic violence infidelity family discord depression and selfdestructive behavior. In other words it presents a bleak view of the world and its human inhabitants. I believe there's an undercurrent of cutting humor throughout although it's interesting that no examples spring to mind and it's not campy. I saw TM4S in the mid70s and in 2015 didn't remember much at all other than not liking it which suggests I repressed a lot that first time.

Nonetheless this film had an effect on me.First the lead character Hans amazingly looked so much like soccer great Diego Maradona. I was trying to place his face and then Maradona's face came to mind. Anyway the protagonist seemed really down on life because of little or no support from either his wife or family with the exception of his sister who seemed just a little caring.Hans makes a modest living selling fruit on a cart and going from apartment complex to apartment complex to do so. Neither his wife nor mother approve of his job and he was fired from his job as a cop after getting serviced by a prostitute who was under arrest. The story seems a real downer as just about everything that can go wrong does for this guy.I will say the acting is rather rigid but perhaps that is characteristic of German society esp. back then. I was surprised at the moments of emotion like when the wife suggests getting someone to help them sell the fruit. As for the ending this is my take on this. Hans knows that he is a burden on his family so after seeing that his war buddy is good with his wife and daughter as well as the busy Hans drinks knowing full well that he will die. He figures he will get out of the picture to allow his wife and buddy to be together and such. So perhaps his act of suicide stemmed not just from his desire to live no longer but also to leave his family in a better position not to mention the woman he was cheating with. Others might disagree but perhaps that is his one final act of good for the world before he leaves it.Overall I'd say this film will stay with me and help me to stay off booze.".

Fassbinder's The Merchant of the Four Seasons. Simply from the fact that Fassbinder played through social abuse between men and women as well as between hetero and homosexual couples it should be clear that he does not favorize any sex.In Hans Epp's case there are the women who drive him into despair illness and finally death. When he comes back from the Foreign Legion where he flew because he could not stand anymore the pressure of his mother she complains that he is still alive while the good boy from her neighbor had been killed. Then Hans gets a job as a policeman but is surprised by his foreman while he is seduced by a prostitute. After having lost his job he works as a fruitmerchant with little income going from backyard to backyard crying out his produce. His mother one of his sisters and her husband are ashamed to have such a streetworker in their family. The love of his life she has no name in the movie refuses to marry him because his job does not fit together with her social status and origin. So he marries Irmgard whom he does not love and who does not love him. From her constant pressure on him he flees into drinking. One evening after his wife was stalking him he explodes and hits her. She flees to her family for which this event was just what they have been waiting for. When Irmgard is calling a lawyer for divorce Hans suffers a heart attack. Imrgard decides to stay with him but from now on he is not allowed anymore to do heavy work and to drink alcohol. So he starts to feel more and more superfluous gets quieter and quieter and more and more depressive. When he finds out that Irmgard cheats him he chooses to end his life but not like Hermann Hermann by having a trip into the light of madness but he drinks himself to death in front of Imrgard their little daughter and his boozing buddies. Fassbinder said in an interview that Hans knew what he was doing. The question however is Did Hans just kill himself because he could not stand anymore his miserable environment or did he make selfjustice?".

There are some films of his I really like Angst essen Seele auf Martha but also a large part of his body of work did little to nothing for me. Hndler der vier Jahreszeiten or The Merchant of Four Seasons is among his earlier but not first works and looking at how he was only in his mid20s when he made this film it is an impressive achievement taking that into account. A wild new generation of cinema we have here even if it is not so obvious by today's standards as the film is of course 45 years old now already. And Fassbinder's work was also honored on several occasions here for example by winning the grand prize at the German Film Awards that year. The two lead actors were honored too and three of the supporting cast received nominations. The only one who is absolutely deserving of all the attention is Hans Hirschmller in my opinion. His lead performance is the heart and soul of this work here. And it helps that he is in so many scenes as he carries the action nicely and even when he isn't every scene probably still has an impact on his character. A bit sad that he has not really been that prolific in the last 30 years or just appeared in minor projects and roles. As for the action in this one here it is okay and interesting but not among Fassbinder's very finest. I think a lot of the film's success is due to Hirschmller's great performance. But this film is also once again about people talking about other people usually in derogatory ways as it was so common back then and still is today. The costume design and sets reminds strongly of Mad Men. Those were the days that the series is portraying and Germany did not look entirely different compared to the United States. All in all this relatively short Fassbinder film stays easily under 90 minutes is worth checking out. I give it a thumbs up.".

Turns out my best friend watched it too and it became our favorite movie. Every weekend after that we watched it until we could recite it. We woke her parents up late at night laughing hysterically. We began to worship the main character Julie played by the beautiful Deborah Foreman. I am not saying this is a great classic. Although it is for me personally. And I understand that the whole Valley Girl talk becomes annoying but that was the 80's. But deep down at the heart of the movieit is a love story and a familiar but good one. Girl meets boy and there are sparks from both sides an instant connection. Julie's friends don't like himhe doesn't fit in doesn't go to their school doesn't have money. They like her better with her exboyfriend the football player even though he is a jerk. She makes the ultimate sacrificeher own happiness for her friends' happiness. And she has these really cool supportive hippie parents. It is one of Nicholas Cage's first movies and his first starring role. One minute he is absolutely hilarious and the next incredibly touching and romantic. His friend Fred is pretty funny too. If you were a teenager in the 80's you will love this movie or at the very least it will bring back memories. It is no longer my favorite movie but it is still one of my favorites probably in my top 10. I am eagerly awaiting it's release on DVD if they ever release it. You can go to Deborah Foreman's website to sign a petition to get it released on DVD and there are 2 soundtracks from the movie that are must haves if you like 80's music.".

Punk was considered FAR more radical and a lot less mainstream than New Wave like The Plimsouls for example. While bands like The Ramones and Sex Pistols seem pretty sedate today they weren't so back then which is why I think that this movie went in the direction that it did musicwise. The clothes are spot on obviously! This is one of my favorite movies because of the love story and I never get tired of watching it.".

The movie never made clear just what attracted these two people together in the first place nor did it make clear what they found in common that was keeping them together in the relationship. Also the solution the protagonists use in the final minutes to resolve the crisis that came up is terribly lazy and unimaginative. Then there are some scenes such as the subplot involving another teen attracted to an older woman that seem to serve no real purpose.

	schema:reviewBody "People who see this movie as juvenile with weak acting and unnecessary subplots just aren't in the same zone with the 80s genre as the people who call this movie a classic. Valley Girl to those who love it is THE classic 80s movie. It's not the best movie ever made by any means. But it is a great love story and to a teenage girl who was going in to high school when the movie came out the dialog clothes and music were just the COOLEST thing ever. I rented it so many times that I knew every word by heartand was amused to find that I still know just about every line after seeing it again on some channel on TV the other night. It is so great and brings up nostalgic feeling of 80s youth like no other movie. Pretty in Pink Some Kind of Wonderful Breakfast Club St. Elmos Fire and others are all great too...but nothing beats Valley Girl. If you haven't seen it and you love all things 80s you will love this movie.Oh...and the subplot with Stacy's mom is not unnecessary as some have said...there is plenty in the movie about the other girl's love interests to justify those scenes. Every girl has some sort of liaison going on and they're all shallow or unrequited relationshipswhich is the movie's way of showing how ironic it is that Julie's friends can't accept her true love with a townie. And btw Stacy's Mom by Fountains of Wayne is about those scenes with Kip and Stacy's mom in case you didn't catch it. They must be fans of the movie too.And as if I haven't raved enough it has the all time best soundtrack of the 80s. If you're a 20something who loves 80s music get the soundtrack too. You haven't heard half of the songs on the radio or on Napster etc. They're only in the movie and on the record. I mean....Johnny are you Queer and Eaten by the Monster of Love?? Awesome awesome awesome. Totally.".

	onyx:emotionText "People who see this movie as juvenile with weak acting and unnecessary subplots just aren't in the same zone with the 80s genre as the people who call this movie a classic. Valley Girl to those who love it is THE classic 80s movie. It's not the best movie ever made by any means. But it is a great love story and to a teenage girl who was going in to high school when the movie came out the dialog clothes and music were just the COOLEST thing ever. I rented it so many times that I knew every word by heartand was amused to find that I still know just about every line after seeing it again on some channel on TV the other night. It is so great and brings up nostalgic feeling of 80s youth like no other movie. Pretty in Pink Some Kind of Wonderful Breakfast Club St. Elmos Fire and others are all great too...but nothing beats Valley Girl. If you haven't seen it and you love all things 80s you will love this movie.Oh...and the subplot with Stacy's mom is not unnecessary as some have said...there is plenty in the movie about the other girl's love interests to justify those scenes. Every girl has some sort of liaison going on and they're all shallow or unrequited relationshipswhich is the movie's way of showing how ironic it is that Julie's friends can't accept her true love with a townie. And btw Stacy's Mom by Fountains of Wayne is about those scenes with Kip and Stacy's mom in case you didn't catch it. They must be fans of the movie too.And as if I haven't raved enough it has the all time best soundtrack of the 80s. If you're a 20something who loves 80s music get the soundtrack too. You haven't heard half of the songs on the radio or on Napster etc. They're only in the movie and on the record. I mean....Johnny are you Queer and Eaten by the Monster of Love?? Awesome awesome awesome. Totally.";

	schema:reviewBody "The teen movie of my generation is not Valley Girl it's Clueless. I can hardly recall Bush's presidency much less Reagan's.  My earliest recollection of fashion magazines does not include suntanned celebrities with feathered hair but rather pale flannelwrapped grunge girls. However I do know enough about the valley girl phenomenon the talk the style of dress the malls and gallerias the hippy parentage the wholesomeness the pastels..you know what I mean. So I wasn't completely detached when I saw the movie.So now to what I thought of it I really really liked this movie. I even bought the video.I think growing up surrounded by the GenX mumbo jumbo made me appreciate this lighthearted flick.  It's a nice love story kind of like a watered down Romeo and Juliet. The acting may not have been good enough for Shakespeare but it's a movie so it's perfectly fine that these people are actors and not melodramatic thespians. Also the script was just right it wasn't too phony it had a sense of humor.. Examples would be Randy and his friend's visit to the valley party.  The bathroom scene was ticklish.Randy's depression and Julie's frustration and hearttoheart with her dad were parts of the movie that didn't disappoint. In other movies of this kind the actors are often unable to carry their characters from one emotional situation to the next and they end up making themselves unpleasantly flat. Randy and Julie have appropriate sincerityremember they're playing two young kids in love. The dreamy whimsical quality of the movie fits just right.In conclusion this is a wonderful timeless movie. Though the time in which it is set plays a major role in the movie the essential love story is timeless. The great thing about this movie is that it uses a very common theme but still comes out fresh and affective.  Even for younger viewers like me who didn't grow up in the 80s the movie can be just as endearing as it was to its first audiences.".

A good soundtrack if this is your kind of thing the wardrobe and the attitude is true 80's. At moments you want to laugh at some of the clothes that the teens are dressed in.

	schema:reviewBody "I was not expecting too much from the 1983 teen comedydrama Valley Girl'. But to my surprise I got a very intelligent movie that does many things that are not in your usual teen movie. Sure we have seen some big teen films like American Graffiti Ferris Bueller's Day Off  Mischief Girls just wanna have fun and in recent times The American Pie' Series but Valley Girl is right up there as a very good teen film with a cool soundtrack and a cast that really amazed me.  The strangest people fall in love and when these two opposites met the fun just started when they tried to break down the barriers! This movie combines Hollywood punk with Valley conservative ageing hippies with high school proms and generally shows that being a teenager CAN be outrageous fun! The direction of Valley Girl' is an area that I find to be very good indeed. It was directed in a way where you got the feeling noone on or off set had to be rushed which I believe made the movie a very easy to follow. The other great aspect of the direction is that it was done extremely well by Martha Coolidge a woman who knew exactly what she wanted to show onscreen and show it is what she did. If more directors male and female could capture what Coolidge did with this film more films would be much better. The screenwriters for Valley Girl' were Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane who did a great job in bringing out the teenage issues in the film but did not make the mistake of basing the film totally around sex which is what most teen films think they need to be. Instead we get a better insight into who these young people actually are. The other interesting aspect of Valley Girl is the way that the movie seems to allow itself to contain very intelligent and interesting dialogue which for me is another highlight. I also enjoyed the characters created for the film. We get to see the hot shots of LA the young impressionable chicks and the cool guys who are not sleazy but very very likeable. All in all this story is going to stay with me for along time to come. This leads me to the cast of the film which was very good. Randy A very young Nicholas Cage by looking at him seems just like another teenage smartass. However looks can be deceiving and Randy shows himself to be a really nice guy. The other part I like about Randy is the confident manner he has with him stating at one stage of the movie I like the girl and she likes me I am gunna have her'. Now that might sound like arrogance but that is not the case it just the cool confident kind of guy Randy is. Nicholas Cage sure showed in this movie that he was a star of the future. Randy also has a very good friend in Fred Cameron Dye who stands by him many times.The girl Randy is after is the beautiful Julie Richman Deborah Foreman someone who has just broken up with a real creep Tommy Michael Bowen who unfortunately has not accepted it yet. Then when Julie and Randy meet at a party there is an instant attraction. Julie is a very nave young girl but you feel for her plight in the movie as I know I certainly wanted her to be happy. There are many good supporting cast members in Valley Girl. Julie's friends include Loryn Elizabeth Daily Stacey Heidi Holicker Suzie Michelle Meyrink and Samantha Tina Theberge. In fact there are many moments with these girls that are great highlights of the film including a scene that shows Julie going for her license while three of these girls totally distracting her in the backseat more interested in Julie's relationships status then getting her license. The other highlight of the cast has to Julie's parents Sarah Richman Colleen Camp and Steve Richman Frederic Forrest. Of course they are like any teenage parents concerned for their daughter's wellbeing and life. But the real highlight here is Julie's dad Steve who gives his daughter some good advice when it comes to Julie choosing who she really wants to be with. Steve states to her It's what you are that counts what's inside you what you stand for. Not what other people wanna make you'. Both Colleen and Frederic were a part of the brilliant 1979 war film Apocalypse Now'.The music of Valley Girl was a true delight to hear as it made the film very fun and exuberant. The composers for the film were Scott Wilk and Marc Levinthal who certainly did their bit to help make this movie seem all the more memorable'. The songs I like from the soundtrack include Melt with you Modern English Who can it be now Men At work and Girls Like me Bonnie Hayes with the wild combo.If there were more teen movies like Valley Girl than I would certainly be a very happy movie watcher of this genre. Valley Girl is a movie that has the courage to show how difficult life is for teenagers in general and is not just interested in showing the issues concerning the bedroom. Although the conclusion of the film has some enjoyable aspects it was a bit of let down for me as I would have preferred it finish on a different and better moment. Finally I have never seen a cover to a video quite like the one for this movie showing a Glossary of Valley Girl talk'. But I am not going to tell you any of it you can learn about that for yourself.CMRS give Valley Girl' 4 Very Good Film".

Great things about this movie....Great cast with hungry actors and a hungry director.  Bad points of this movie....To small of a budget calling for way too much improvisation.  If Martha Coolidge had been given more money and time on this movie then the results would of been even better.  They should have taken the story from an early 20's prospective and not from a 1517 year old high school stand point.  Most of the actorsactresses were in their early to mid 20's trying to play 1517 year olds....come on  The music is extremely memorable and the two soundtracks get played all the time in my car. The best scenes in this film take place in seedy Hollywood clubs by Nicolas Cage's character.  I gave this film a high rating of 910 for five reasons.. Nicholas Cage's improvisational on the spot acting The camera work and angles are excellent given the budget they had and only being able to have one take of each scene The sytles music and lingo are captured perfectly and forever Again the music is incredible and carries the story along from scene to scene  And finally...Martha Coolidge could turn a weak script unknown actors and a very very low budget and 20 days of shooting the entire movie into such a good and memorable movie is astounding!".

	schema:reviewBody "After reading in the Cool Today email letter the other day where the Sherman Oakes Galleria was torn down in LA got me to thinking that I should watch either Valley Girl or Fast Times in Ridgmont High and decided on Valley Girls.Having gone through High school between 19801983 I'm from the class of '83 I am very familiar w the style mannerism and music of that era. I even remember listening to some of the music used in the film.However I felt it to be a nice film depicting a culture only to be found in the San Fernando Valley however it's language made it into pupular culture w phrases like barf me out gag me w a spoon!!! and the Frank Zappa tune that followed but it kinda falls down in one critical areathe charactors.The charactors depicted within the film come across rather shallow unfortunately much like the adolescent girls who proclaimed themselves to be Valley Girls in real life and unfortunately like so many others too became shallow. Even the male charactors were shallow with the exception of Nicolas Cage's charactor. He seemed to have more emotion and depth compared to the other main charactors though he needed to be fleshed out even more. And by shallow I mean less cliqued and stereotypical.Remember that was a hedonistic and shallow time in our lives where wealth or the appearence of it big hair and flashy clothes reigned supreme. Now I do agree with one reviewer that Frank Zappa's daughter Moon Unit would've been much better in the main role then played by Foreman. Moon Unit did an outstanding job of talking Val Speak in the Zappa 1983 classic Valley Girl.Over all I thought the film to be good for an occasional rental but not necessarily to own. If I were to own it I'd find a better video distributorone that used the fast SP standard play speed and also recorded the HiFi track instead of LP long play speed and only the monophonic linear audio track as was the copy I rented.Otherwise a good teen flick that miracously depicts the early 80's fairly accuratly. Just remember any current teen that wants to see this film should put it in it's historical context before casting dispersions on it.".

The movie is not only about his struggle to get his book the origin of Species published but also his relationship with his oldest daughter. His daughter was at start the only person in his family to approve of his views something that she as well had to pay for. Een more than him at times.Now this is not an evolutionary propaganda film as a matter of fact I think it managed to stay very neutral. A hard thing to do in my opinion. of course it does not condone the way the characters was treated by the church quite the opposite actually. If you need me to use the big words to shed light on this film it will be liked by deists and atheists alike but goes away from theism. The movie talks about evolution and that's it.Paul Bettany as Charles Darwin was incredible. Of course we all may think of Darwin as that old man with the funny beard but this movie centers around the man in his late 20's early 30's. Jennifer Connelly Emma Darwin is great as always but the actor who impressed me was Martha West as Annie Darwin Darwins daughter. Definitely on of the best child actors of the decade. The story is about Darwin and his daughter and it is beautifully acted.Except for a few jumps in time that was momentarily confusing the production of this film is pretty flawless. Some scenes were Darwin observes nature is just marvelous and is almost like taken out of a high production National geographic documentary.I must admit though I'm not quite sure of why they chose Creation as the title. I doubt it is an irony the movie is too respectful for that. Well I'm sure there's a meaning too it just don't let it scare you away. I give this movie a 910. This is truly a great tribute to Charles Darwin and please give it a chance.".

	schema:headline " Darwin Biopic that focuses on the Great Man's Family not his Work";
	schema:reviewBody "CREATION received wonderful reviews when it premiered at the prestigious Toronto Film Festival but those reviews notwithstanding the film had difficulty picking up a distributor in the US apparently because of the fear that it would offend the religious right.The film is based on the book Annie's Box which was written by Darwin's greatgreat grandson Randal Keynes so I don't suppose there's any doubting its veracity. Against that the film is very much focused on Darwin's family situation and the death of his young daughter Annie in particular and not on the great man's work. It's a sometimes powerful yet strangely uneven telling of the tale. We see Darwin as a family man who struggles to accept his daughter's death a man who is torn between his love for his deeply religious wife and his own growing belief that God has no place in the world. He finds himself caught in a battle between faith and reason between love and truth all the while dealing with the death of his favourite daughter Annie.Charles Darwin is played by acclaimed British actor Paul Bettany probably best known for his role as the mad monk in THE DA VINCI CODE 2006 while Mrs. Darwin is played by Bettany's real life wife and Oscar winning actress Jennifer Connolly.There's a palpable tension between the actors Connolly is particularly good as the understated Mrs. Darwin driven to distraction by the loss of her daughter and the consequent loss of her husband. Darwin's masterwork THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES comes to light and the film depicts a cosy little world of English gardens in turmoil as a happy marriage is ripped asunder by the loss of a child.As a film that deals with the loss of a child and the resultant impact on what had previously been a perfectly happy marriage CREATION works well. It's beautifully shot with some touching scenes not least of which concerns the death of an ape which when you think about it is quite apt. What's less apt is hearing Darwin muse What if the world stopped believing that God had any sort of plan for us? Why on earth would he care whether a God he no longer believes in has a plan or not?

	onyx:emotionText "CREATION received wonderful reviews when it premiered at the prestigious Toronto Film Festival but those reviews notwithstanding the film had difficulty picking up a distributor in the US apparently because of the fear that it would offend the religious right.The film is based on the book Annie's Box which was written by Darwin's greatgreat grandson Randal Keynes so I don't suppose there's any doubting its veracity. Against that the film is very much focused on Darwin's family situation and the death of his young daughter Annie in particular and not on the great man's work. It's a sometimes powerful yet strangely uneven telling of the tale. We see Darwin as a family man who struggles to accept his daughter's death a man who is torn between his love for his deeply religious wife and his own growing belief that God has no place in the world. He finds himself caught in a battle between faith and reason between love and truth all the while dealing with the death of his favourite daughter Annie.Charles Darwin is played by acclaimed British actor Paul Bettany probably best known for his role as the mad monk in THE DA VINCI CODE 2006 while Mrs. Darwin is played by Bettany's real life wife and Oscar winning actress Jennifer Connolly.There's a palpable tension between the actors Connolly is particularly good as the understated Mrs. Darwin driven to distraction by the loss of her daughter and the consequent loss of her husband. Darwin's masterwork THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES comes to light and the film depicts a cosy little world of English gardens in turmoil as a happy marriage is ripped asunder by the loss of a child.As a film that deals with the loss of a child and the resultant impact on what had previously been a perfectly happy marriage CREATION works well. It's beautifully shot with some touching scenes not least of which concerns the death of an ape which when you think about it is quite apt. What's less apt is hearing Darwin muse What if the world stopped believing that God had any sort of plan for us? Why on earth would he care whether a God he no longer believes in has a plan or not? Which brings up the main problem with the film  as a movie about Darwin and the writing of Origin it completely misses the boat. It's all religion and no evolution. Where's the Beagle? The Galapagos? Where are the vampire finches? Or woodpecker finches for that matter?

	schema:headline " Historically inaccurate anachronistic and not suitable for educational purpose";
	schema:reviewBody "This could have been a great movie with plenty of educational potential for teachers around the world about evolution biology the creative work in science research and Darwin's life but it is not.The screenplay is mostly historically inaccurate and transforms a true story into a Mexican soupopera melodrama. While it is true that Darwin gradually lost his religious beliefs this was in great part due to his findings during the voyage of the Beagle and not solely due to the loss of his daughter. He was certainly disturbed by his loss but that did not made him literally insane delusional and detached from his friends and family. The such portrayal of Darwin is an invention of the script writer. Thus it cannot be used in any way as place to learn a bit about Darwin's life and psyche. According to most historians Darwin had the theory ready by the end of the Beagle voyage and kept it from going public because he wanted to develop further the consequences of it and check against more data. In the movie it is an imaginary conflict of Darwin with his religious beliefs and the mental illness that he developed after his daughter's death that kept him from going public.The movie brings a modern situation the creationists vs scientists debate into the life and times of Darwin thus it is anachronistic. It depicts Thomas Huxley not as a man trying to develop further understanding of biology but as someone eager to kill God in his own words from the movie and destroy the church who would accept the theory of evolution for such purposes and not because it was a synthesis of plenty of disconnected data. Huxley is presented as a very arrogant and insensible person a combination that I interpret was an attempt to ridicule active atheists who speak up against religion. In real life Huxley accepted Darwin's ideas after publication only gradually and before the work of Darwin he thought that there was not enough evidence to support evolution. His first support of evolution was published one month after the Origin of Species became public. He was agnostic but did not think it was necessary to kill God only thought that there was not enough evidence to believe in the supernatural. The debate creationists vs scientists appears throughout the movie and creationists catchphrases such as It is only a theory are part of the discussion. Of course no such dispute or catchphrases existed at that time. In fact the Anglican Church published a positive review of the Origin's saying that they saw God's work in evolution in some sense quite in fact in contradiction to the way that the clergy is portrayed in the screenplay.Another awful aspect of this movie is that it gives the wrong impression to the general public that scientific research is done by a solitary crazy man who just writes a lot. Nothing could be further from the truth. The conception of the theory of evolution was the result of thorough observations of living forms by Darwin during five years in the HMS Beagle and was developed gradually as it can be seen from Darwin's notes of the voyage. Even though the Beagle voyage was the sole most important part of Darwin's life to the conception of Origin of Species the voyage is briefly mentioned only once at the beginning and no attempt is made to show that the book came as an elaborate analysis of observations. To make it worse Darwin is shown performing a single experiment pigeon breeding to test his theory and in the end quits it. And I'm not really sure whether such experiment did actually occur.Great disappointment. It is not in any way a homage to Darwin and science.".

	schema:headline " Slightly Gothic insight to Charles Darwin the man.";
	schema:reviewBody "As you sit there quietly evolving spare a thought for Charles Darwin. He was more than the venerable man with beard you may remember from your schoolbooks. He had a wife and children and spent much of the long hiatus between writing his big theory and actually publishing it coping with his wife beautiful Emma who if she looked at all like actress Jennifer Connelly was beautiful but not at all ready to give up on God. She was also having to deal with Darwin's allconsuming guilt over the fatal illness of his eldest daughter for which he seemed to have believed he was responsible in at least one way.This Charles Darwin's homelife is colourfully evoked in the slightly Gothic new film Creation. As it opens with a flashback to a failed attempt to steal 'savage' children from a Pacific island and take them home to convert them into Good Christians it has us on its side from the start even more as it nods to Francois Truffaut's 'L'Enfant Sauvage'. Paul Bettany as the man himself is onscreen most of the time like a contestant in the Channel Four 'big brother house' permanently in closeup. The way the story jumps backwards and forwards in time gives it the feeling of a ghost story too. And there are other pieces of Darwin's life we rarely get to think about such as the relationship he built up with the female ape stolen from her jungle family and living in solitary confinement in an English zoo until her death. All in all it's quite an emotional rollercoaster although not at the expense of recreating the world of the late Victorians very convincingly.".

The Beagle's only in a couple of short flashbacks the whole thing is about Darwin's life from 1841 to 1859 when he was ensconced in Kent with his growing family 200 pages of Origin had already been drafted and he was wondering whether to complete the book. The script is based on Randal Keynes's book Annie's Box Annie Charles's daughter died when she was 10. It is mostly a family drama but does include sex scenes  however the participants are married both on and off screen. Not too exciting not much science but a wellmade film that's pleasant to watch and pushes the right emotional buttons. A bit of a romantic weepie actually. I suppose the conclusion is that you can be an agnostic freethinking scientist from an atheist family background and still be an emotional romantic as well as an excellent father. Some of the characters and Darwin himself state or wonder whether he killed god but the viewer is able to doubt that. What is beyond doubt given the deadly struggle for survival and the web of predation on the meadowbank wellknown before Darwin and completely uncontroversial and the failure of Darwin's prayers is that the idea of a kind providential god who loves his creatures is untenable. I really cannot see many Americans objecting to it very much. Some may have problems with the title which is probably the most controversial thing about the film or with the fact that Bettany does not have horns a tail and a pitchfork.".

That said the movie is made beautifully with amazing cinematography and art direction. I love the background score of piano and violins creating a sense of melancholy and drama in the story.

This movie dramatises this concept and extends it by speculating that Darwin was haunted by this memory and even by Annie's ghost and only finds peace by finally publishing his magnum opus. It is a good concept and was the basis of a best selling book Annies Box.Much of this movie is well executed. Let me list what is good about this movie1 Paul Bettany  Jennifer Connelly  whoever played Annie Darwin. They were perfect period detail was beautiful. 2 The premise. The concept is simple and accurate to the history of his life. Darwin's life is changed utterly by the death of his young daughter Annie. He sees that nature is merciless and loses his faith in God. He was a polite society man a loving father and never wanted to cause a controversy. He was therefore tortured by his theory and procrastinated endlessly about publication. Haunted by the memory of Annie the insistence of his friend and finally a letter from Alfred Wallace who has independently come to the same theory Darwin finally decides to publish. What went wrong 1 The direction. This movie has very frequent flashbacks and flashforwards. OK that's good but not if the viewer is sometimes confused as to whether this is the past or the present. In the present Darwin sees Annie as a ghost or a hallucination who goads him to finish his book and in the past she is his real living daughter. There were scenes when I had to ask myself was this Annie as the ghost or was this in the past? The only way to tell was to look at Paul Bettany's hairline! 2 The script Was this about Annie? about Darwin? about the publication of the Origin? I think it is meant to be about all three and perhaps that is too much to take on in one movie.3 The pace. The first 3040 minutes were excellent and set the movie up for some dramatic point where Darwin is finally goaded to publish. However the remaining hour is spent with scene after scene about Darwin tortured about his theory and his illness in the present Darwin tortured by watching Annie die in the past Darwin tortured by his losss of faith and increasing distance from his wife. It seems like it takes a full hour for Annie to die. This was viewer torture.Perhaps the life or Darwin is not really suited for cinema. The man was the ultimate patient nerdy scientist. It took him decades to develop his theory and decades longer to publish. He was a loving father he was tortured by his theory and he became an atheist in the end much to the chagrin of his wife. He wrote so many letters that there are many excellent and fascinating biographies of him. He remains one of the most fascinating men of all time which just adds to the tragedy that this movie is not better than it is.There are some good scenes in the movie but ultimately it was sadly a bit boring by the end. Don't believe the nonsense talked about this being too controversial for the US in reality it is simply not controversial enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "Creation is a partly biographical partly fictionalized account of Charles Darwin's relationship with his eldest daughter Annie and his wife Emma as he struggles to write On the Origin of Species. It is based on reallife letters and documents of the Darwin family. Hence the movie delves very deep into the life of Darwin.Cast wise I can't complain. Paul Bettany delivers in what is an award winning performance as Charles Darwin. His dialogue delivery costume posture expressions etc gives us clear insight into the kind of dedication and authenticity that has been incorporated into the movie. Jennifer Connelly as Darwin's wife Emma depicts the internal conflicts going on in her mind owing to his controversial book and daughter's death is a splendid way. Rest are very notable in their role.Creation is a bit slow but that's very important to understand the turmoil and mental instability and social burden endowed by Charles Darwin into writing his revolutionary yet controversial book during his times. The manner in which Charles Darwin struggles to find a balance between his revolutionary theories on evolution and the relationship with religious wife whose faith contradicts his work is pictured and acted wonderfully. The Cinematography is beautiful and the Soundtrack by Christopher Young truly deserves more recognition.Overall Creation is a very good biographical movie. It moves slowly through the entire spectrum of Darwin's life. It's a slowbut beautiful and faithful bio drama. A must Watch.My Verdict  710".

	schema:reviewBody "The film is worth a watch probably rented on DVD as opposed to in theaters. It presents an argument science vs. religion that has been raging since Darwin's time and it does so without forcing the audience in either direction. No one can deny the importance of such an argument and that alone gives the film some weight. Sadly the film ultimately abandons this line of thought in favor of family melodrama centered on Darwin and his wife. This is also wellexecuted but it fails to maintain the very high initial level of interest. Nonetheless in both halves Paul Bettany gives a noteworthy performance as Darwin himself.After watching the film I found the trailer to be rather misleading. It focuses solely on the first half of the film science vs. religion and frankly the film should have as well. In spite of this overall it is a wellmade period piece that people should check out. Fans of melodrama will probably enjoy it more than those who were looking for evolutionary debate but it contains enough of both to keep audiences interested.Full Review at MacGuffinFilmReviews.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "CREATION is not a film about the development of Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution and if that is what the audience expects it will be disappointed. What this little film presents instead is the midlife crisis the film takes place in 185859 and Darwin was born in 1809 having completed his 1840 'Voyage of the Beagle' after the famous time he spent from 1831 36 on the HMS Beagle as a naturalist gathering data when Darwin had made his observations of nature and natural survival of the fittest and was struggling with writing of 'The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection' a book that would threaten to incise his relationship not only with Christian society but also with his fervently religious wife Emma. It is a story of the tortured man coping with the dichotomy between science and religion between a man obsessed with his scientific discoveries while longing to be a good father to the children he loved. Yes there is discussion of his scientific theories made mostly in his stories he told his children but the book on which it is based Randal Keynes 'Annie's Box' Keynes is the great great grandson of Darwin  a book of diaries and quiet notes about the Darwin and his oldest daughter Annie whose death as a young girl nearly destroyed Darwin  is more concerned with opening the windows to the family life of the great scientist than expounding the scientific theory we all know so well. John Collee's screenplay serves the film well as does the careful direction of Jon Amiel. Charles Darwin's presence is illuminated by Paul Bettany's performance and the difficult role of his wife Emma is played with great sensitivity by Bettany's real wife Jennifer Connelly. The pivotal role of Annie Darwin's eldest daughter who seemed to have inherited all of the curiosity and imagination of Darwin is portrayed by first time actress Martha West daughter of actor Dominic West it is Annie's death that alters the course of this story that event and the final reconciliation between Darwin and Emma after Emma actually reads the completed book The Origin of Species. The supporting cast is excellent Jeremy Northam is the unforgiving cleric Reverend Innes the other Darwin children are very natural in their acting  Freya Parks Harrison Sansostri Christopher Dunkin  and Toby Jones adds sparks as Thomas Huxley who declares that Darwin's theories prove that God is dead! The cinematography by Jess Hall is excellent  especially in the scenes involving man's first connection with the apes. The musical score by Christopher Young rather blurs all the action into a Victorian mush but the actors and director are able to make us forget that ill conceived addon. In all the film is a family story  it just so happens that the family is that of a great man about whose personal life we know very little. Impressive work. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "On the Origin Of Darwin. In my opinion he is the unofficial founder of freethinking. He may not have been the first to challenge the beliefs of Christianity but upon the publication of his literary work On The Origin Of Species everything changed. By everything I mean the very purpose of life and a step closer on mans endless journey for meaning. Science took a rapid leap forward in its race with religion and subsequently modern science was established. For Britain this proved both a shining moment of conquest and a deadly blow to their status amongst the Vatican Church. Needless to say it's been over a century since Charles Darwin passed away leaving only his work to be marveled at by modern scientists and his life to be immortalized by modern filmmakers. Who better to do so than BBC films with their adaptation of Randal Keynes' a distant relative of Charles Darwin biography entitled Annie's Box. The book was written to tell the tragic tale of Charles and Emma's eldest daughter Ann Elizabeth Darwin. Her life was cut dismally short due to a strange illness that is yet to be identified. Our story picks up after Darwin's who is played by British talent Paul Bettany voyage around the world but before having penned his most famous work. He lives a troubled life in the countryside of England with his family and loving wife. His wife Emma Jennifer Connelly a devout Christian doesn't share her husbands love of science and for the most part tries to ignore his research. This barrier has an awful affect on Charles' health that dwindles due to an inner battle that forces him to choose between science and religion. His only crutch is his eldest daughter Annie Martha West who manages to evoke her father's happiness in a way no one else can. But his relationship with his daughter is beginning to way heavy on the rest of his family who feel rejected by a man who is struggling to come to terms with reality. Those who know the history of Darwin's life will be overwhelmed to find a film that so justly portrays his most personal events. Directed by Jon Amiel Entrapment and written by John Collee Creation travels the less obvious route of highlighting a period in Darwin's life that proved most challenging. Those expecting a biography of his life from start to finish will be disappointed but might rejoice in the fact that it focuses on a time of far more importance. There is a multitude of layers that encompass this story involving a deeply moving rendition of a loving father devoted husband and a keen scientist. For Paul Bettany this role is clearly a career highlight allowing him the chance to play a British icon in a way know one would have imagined. His own intelligence knowledge of the character and ability to immerse himself in character is precisely the right mix for a role of this sort. Paired up with his wife Jennifer herself a fine actress and you have pure magic on screen. She was the obvious choice for the role of Emma Wedgwood a woman blindly devoted to the church which she brings to life elegantly yet with a sharp presence. Their on screen chemistry is made easy by their off screen relationship but never for a moment do they lose sight of their epochal roles. Every scene in this film is accompanied by intense emotional drama and it is this drama that makes Creation more than just a biopic. There is a lot to be learnt from this story and will certainly be an education as to the impact Darwin's life had on the course of history. What BBC Films have added to the production is their understanding of natural history and how to capture its brilliance. Over the years we have been exposed to our natural world in documentaries such as Planet Earth which have managed to capture the very essence of our world. In Creation you can look forward to a few scenes that pay homage to these documentaries and the incredible work of the BBC. This is a perfect marriage of dramatic structure and historical fact combined into a film that will leave you with a greater understanding of the life and times of Charles Darwin and his immense contribution to life as we now know it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was a bit of homework for me since I'm studying Darwinism this semester. 'Creation 2009' is an account of naturalist Charles Darwin played by Paul Bettany whose book On the Origin of Species published in 1859 is probably the most influential and important work in the history of science. It is commonly believed that Darwin delayed publication for twenty years possibly due to a religious conflict with his wife Emma played here by Jennifer Connelly. However my preliminary research seems to suggest that Darwin didn't dither at all instead withholding publication until he was certain that his theories were empirically supported. Certainly the film does linger most emphatically on the former  probably apocryphal  version of Darwin's life with particular emphasis on the death of daughter Annie. Did Darwin really blame himself for Annie's death having married his firstcousin? The narrative of 'Creation' does a lot of temporal jumping around often cutting to flashbacks without any warning and bizarrely giving Darwin schizophrenic visions more at home in 'A Beautiful Mind 2001' which by the way gave John Nash visual hallucinations that the real economist never experienced. I would have liked some more focus on Darwin's voyage aboard the Beagle especially the work in the Galapagos Islands that first spawned his theory of evolution by natural selection.Still this is a beautifullymade film and Bettany and Connelly give superb performances that are sure to empty the proverbial tear ducts. There's one absolutely stunning sequence a timelapse montage that depicts the apathy of organismal interactions the world as an indifferent battleground in which only the fittest survive. It's a hard pill to swallow but then it's the only pill that isn't a placebo.".

	schema:reviewBody "Reallife husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star in Creation which recounts the period of Charles Darwin's life prior to the publication of On the Origin of Species in 1859 his infamous world changing tome on evolution and natural selection. Darwin's research created an enormous rift a schism between the believers of his day and scientists. He was said at the time to be going to war against God and even to have killed God.The film revolves around Darwin's life with his wife and four children. Jennifer Connelly is excellent as his extremely devout and loving wife. A revealing scene at the beginning when she leads the dinner table in prayer and Charles fails to say Amen is foreshadowing of what will follow and of the stark differences between the two. She is convinced that he will be eternally damned and bring misfortune to their family by rejecting God.Darwin is torn between his strong love for his wife her faith and his even stronger reason. There are beautiful moments of him observing animals dissecting their behaviors and the sequences that make up their lives explaining phenomenons of selection to his children the first born Annie having a very morbid curiosity. We see him interacting with England's first orangutan Jenny playing with it as if it were a child deciphering her every look and action. Annie the eldest child later dies and Charles becomes haunted by her death having been closest to her. In my opinion this part was too long bizarre and drawn out. I did not like the trippy scenes where he seems to be losing his mind and is pursued by the ghost of his daughter shouting and ranting. Although Charles thinks that his wife blames him for her fatal sickness she very poetically says The truth is if I knew then what I know now I would marry you tomorrow. Their bond is solid and unbreakable despite tremendous differences of belief. When Charles finishes his manuscript he hands his wife the final copy telling her she can burn it if she does not agree. She stays up reading it nights on end and finally presents him with a package the book ready to be sent to its publisher. In the end reason and perhaps love as well triumph as he makes an accomplice out of his staunchest adversary.It is fascinating that Darwin received a full Christian burial at Westminster Abbey proof that his groundbreaking ideas were seen as controversial of course but were already then recognized as vital knowledge for the advancement of the human race. The movie definitely draws heavily on Darwin's family life its joys and its troubles. I happened to like this aspect but Fabio said it was like watching a documentary on I quote Hitler's passion for pingpong. This is true in some respects and I can't disagree with his desire to have learned more about Charles Darwin's theories from this film than we do. It remains nevertheless a well executed and flawlessy acted period drama. My rating 7 Fabio's 7 Total score 14 Please visit httppaulinasmovies.blogspot.com and become a follower to read more reviews!".

Jennifer Connelly is excellent as his extremely devout and loving wife. A revealing scene at the beginning when she leads the dinner table in prayer and Charles fails to say Amen is foreshadowing of what will follow and of the stark differences between the two. She is convinced that he will be eternally damned and bring misfortune to their family by rejecting God.Darwin is torn between his strong love for his wife her faith and his even stronger reason. There are beautiful moments of him observing animals dissecting their behaviors and the sequences that make up their lives explaining phenomenons of selection to his children the first born Annie having a very morbid curiosity. We see him interacting with England's first orangutan Jenny playing with it as if it were a child deciphering her every look and action. Annie the eldest child later dies and Charles becomes haunted by her death having been closest to her. In my opinion this part was too long bizarre and drawn out. I did not like the trippy scenes where he seems to be losing his mind and is pursued by the ghost of his daughter shouting and ranting. Although Charles thinks that his wife blames him for her fatal sickness she very poetically says The truth is if I knew then what I know now I would marry you tomorrow. Their bond is solid and unbreakable despite tremendous differences of belief. When Charles finishes his manuscript he hands his wife the final copy telling her she can burn it if she does not agree. She stays up reading it nights on end and finally presents him with a package the book ready to be sent to its publisher. In the end reason and perhaps love as well triumph as he makes an accomplice out of his staunchest adversary.It is fascinating that Darwin received a full Christian burial at Westminster Abbey proof that his groundbreaking ideas were seen as controversial of course but were already then recognized as vital knowledge for the advancement of the human race. The movie definitely draws heavily on Darwin's family life its joys and its troubles. I happened to like this aspect but Fabio said it was like watching a documentary on I quote Hitler's passion for pingpong. This is true in some respects and I can't disagree with his desire to have learned more about Charles Darwin's theories from this film than we do. It remains nevertheless a well executed and flawlessy acted period drama. My rating 7 Fabio's 7 Total score 14 Please visit httppaulinasmovies.blogspot.com and become a follower to read more reviews!";

	schema:headline " A moral fable of Scientific Creation";
	schema:reviewBody "'Creation' premiered in North America at the Toronto Film Festival to rave reviews then opened in a handful of cities across North America and seems to have sunk out of sight. Several of us petitioned to have it shown more widely but nothing came of it. The National Center for Science Education tells me this seems to be lack of interest rather than any particular antievolution campaign.Having now watched the Bluray release my reaction is mixed. It's a superb acting job by all concerned especially newcomer Martha West as Darwin's eldest daughter Annie who perfectly portrays the spirit of Charles' and Emma's 'dear child' who died at ten. It's easy to see Paul Bettany as Darwin in perhaps the first film version to show the invalid Darwin suffering from nausea shaking palsy and hypochondria. His spirit of scientific inquiry is caught as he makes notes on the newborn Annie and later uses the same approach on Jenny the Orangutan.The film is not and perhaps does not try to be an historical account nor is it a scientific documentary a la Nova. 'Creation' I think refers more to the agonies of Charles Darwin wrestling with the scientific philosophical and personal issues inherent in his study of evolution and specifically the Creation of his book Origin of Species. The wellknown themes are present but presented with great intimacy Charles' physical reaction to the suggestion 'You have killed God Sir! his delay to publish Origin in consequence of psychosomatic illness the arrival of Alfred Wallace's letter and the final flurry of writing. The ghost of his daughter hangs figuratively and in the movie literally over this act of Creation. Annie can with her father dispassionately watch a fox catch a rabbit while her younger sister cries Not fair! Factual and errors and misleading interpretations cause me to deduct one star. Emma was not Catholic. There is no basis at all for the major theme of sustained brittle tension between husband and wife over Annie's illness and death or over religious differences the documentary record is they were a loving devoted couple throughout this period and indeed throughout their marriage see Deborah Heiligman's Charles and Emma. There is no evidence of a sexual dry spell they had ten children before and after the Origin. Creationists will delight in several erroneous notions Huxley is not a horrid diminutive atheist. Nothing in the record or Darwin's nature suggest he tried to make a Deal with God to save Annie's life. The Theory of Evolution is not the tortured reaction of a father who has lost faith upon the death of a child. The Darwin's country parson was a narrowminded fellow who both disliked not a wise spiritual counselor.And yet I would recommend this film to anyone interested in the Darwin story the process of scientific creativity the workings of the scientific mind and the dynamics of the reallife husbandwife team of Bettany and Jennifer Connelly as a key to the historical couple.Supplementary materials include interviews with Lewis Wolpert world famed developmental biologist who's take is similar to that of Richard Dawkins a theistic evolutionist who thinks natural selection is the way God works and a selflabeled Young Earth Creationist who thinks the outstanding scientific question of the age is how we can see galaxies billions of light years away when we know the earth is only 6000 years old his conclusion is a variable rate of the speed of light.".

From the beginning I found it a remarkable experience and a complete joy to watch.Spoiler The opening titles overlay a beautiful visual of the evolutionary process and this introduces the story with a serene and sweeping style. The film isn't about the process itself though it concerns Charles Darwin's struggle with his conscience his love for his wife his deceased daughter and his search for truth.The appearances of his daughter are the manifestations of a tormented mind that knows it has killed God. The daughter is an adult making adult comments about his work and torturing Darwin with personal doubts. Was he in some way responsible for her death? Husband and wife in real life Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly give truly wonderful performances as Charles and Emma Darwin as does Martha West as Annie. Bettany's size and awkward gait give Darwin's character a genuine sense of reality whilst Connelly seems very comfortable with her English accent and occasionally somewhat severe persona.It's easy to misunderstand the times in which this film resides. The grip that religion had on society and the inner struggles that a man like Darwin must have endured to seek the truth in what he witnessed. Science and religion have always been awkward bedfellows and although it didn't cost him his life as it did with so many earlier men and women science put a barrier between husband and wife fact and faith. This film portrays that barrier supremely well.I give Creation ten stars because I think it's beautiful profound superbly well acted and a genuine noextraneousfrillsrequired look at one of the world's true geniuses.What seems obvious to everyone today well almost everyone... see Bill Maher's wonderful Religulous was hidden for millennia. The truth once it was discovered was undoubtedly painful for many. Creation examines that pain and the realisation that we are all that we possess.A wonderful cinematic experience.".

	schema:headline " Paul Bettany creates Charles Darwin";
	schema:reviewBody "From the moment Paul Bettany blazes onto the screen in Jon Amiel's newest film Creation I am hypnotized as this is his most powerful performance of his career. Charles Darwin the famous scientist who came up with which many consider the most profound and antireligious vision of our existence is portrayed more charismatic and tender than one would have thought. This is probably due to Bettany's stunning portrayal of the colorfully warm and devoted father and husband.The controversial book On the Origin of Species by Darwin depicts nature as a constant battle a fight that is constant and everevolving. The film however doesn't focus on the book as it does with the battle in Darwin's heart. The film takes place very early in Darwin's life. He's not the old greybearded man that we learned of in our Science classes. He's vigorous full of life and shows much promise for his career and life for his family. He's married to his wife Emma played by Jennifer Connelly and has four children Darwin couldn't have life any better. But it is the loss of one of his children that ails the man's health both physically and mentally. The grief weighs so heavily on his heart that the Darwin that had once been a devoted family man has transformed into an emotionally unavailable and vacant body.Director Amiel in his best work to date I might add and writer John Collee adapt this tale from the book Annie's Box by Randal Keynes. The narrative isn't always engaging and paced well. The film moves slowly and plays like a psychological thriller at times bringing tension and haunting moments. The problem with this is that it takes a turn to psychthriller midstory so what we thought is a biographical film touched on by high hitting drama takes a sharp left and becomes almost a horror film.Technically the film is quite exquisite. Stunning art direction by Laurence Dorman places us in the early 1800's. Darwin's residence is quite the striking eyecandy. Costume designer Louise Stjernsward and makeup designer Veronica McAleer provide the perfect combination especially to Bettany to connect the viewer to a particular time in history. The highlight of the picturehowever aside from the starturn is the boisterous score by Christopher Young. In his best musical work to date Young offers many missing qualities to pull us through the film. When it's downtime in Creation Young's score often makes up and detonates beautiful strings and percussion.The rest of the cast does some solid work for themselves. Bettany's reallife partner Jennifer Connelly takes on the role of Emma Darwin with full force. She works the room with Emma's engraved yet subtle pain for the loss of her daughter and the constant anxiety for her husband's health. I'm afraid it's the underdevelopment of her character that doesn't allow her to run with the role. To top it off any time she shares the screen with her husband she is completely upstaged and nearly invisible. The screen debut of Martha West who plays Annie Darwin Charles and Emma's dead daughter who haunts him as life goes on without her gives an incomparable performance probably the best child performance of the year. It is West who is given the best lines emotion and development of all the supporting players. She will be an outstanding talent to keep an eye on in the future. Toby Jones Infamous Benedict Cumberbatch Atonement and Jeremy Northam Gosford Park all do work respectively.In the end when walking out of the theater you take Paul Bettany's harrowing work with you. Incredibly impressive and stands a fair shot at awards consideration at least worth the consideration due to the stacked Best Actor race this year. The film however doesn't warrant any real hardhitting drama. The film takes a safe and soft route which offers nothing new to the realm of biopics. Its results are simple moments that do not mirror the qualities a good film.".

	schema:headline " Creation the story of one man's soul and one woman's religion";
	schema:reviewBody "Don't plan on watching Creation as a light comedy suitable for a Saturday night date movie.Creation must be watched with full attention and an open mind. It has little to do with the debate that fundamentalists have made it.It is a movie of two loving parents four children one of whom became mortally ill and the struggle to create a book from a mind according to the movie that is tortured and delusional. It is the story of a child whose curiosity parallelled rather tragically an act of an orangutan that brought about her death.The movie depicts Emma Darwin Jennifer Connolly as a strong willed Christian which Emma was. If you are expecting Ms. Connolly to be as stunning and lively as she was in a Beautiful Mind you will be disappointed. Here she dares act with little if any makeup her hair drawn straight back to a bun and parted in the middle. She is more than adequate as a study of a plain strong woman who can stand up to her husband to the point where he is driven almost mad by her unbending religious will. Yet she is not a fanatic. Others may think so but she really is not. If a viewer is not convinced consider how she handles reading his manuscript. The movie shows it just the way it happened. It took a marvellous woman to retain her religious beliefs and encourage Darwin to publish.Darwin himself wonderfully played by Paul Bettany is shown as almost mentally ill by what he observes. He has two driving motives to love his family especially his oldest daughter Annie and to find a way of writing the Origin of the Species knowing that it will offend all traditional religious thought on the subject of creation. Particularly odious to him is the fact that his wife believes that he will be permanently separated from God and from her should he persist in publishing his book. He half believes that she may be right. A fact that the movie left unstated is that Darwin was trained to be a minister  I think a huge omission. It would have made the complexity of his problem that much deeper.Though we do not see much of the children except Annie what we do get is really well handled. We will hope there is more of Freya Parks to come. She was a very sensitive Etty Darwin with naturalness much beyond her years. She is especially touching as she watches a fox kill a rabbit. Though Annie understands Etty is more childlike in her response of repulsion sadness and horror. She is even better displaying affection if that is possible when she asks her father to tell the children a story they have not heard.Annie Darwin Martha West caries most of the load for the part the children must play and she is delightful serious charming witty understanding and above all a lovable girl of about 10 going on 30. Her scene with the photographer and her father cannot be missed. This girl too will make many more movies one hopes.The great critic Roger Ebert said that Hollywood he was referring to Creation believes that all problems can be solved in the bedroom. Maybe that does reflect 2010 more than 1851 but if it is a flaw it is a minor one.Creation should be seen not for enlightenment about Darwin or the Origin of Species or a resoltion to the Fundamentalist debate about religion vs. science but because it is a good film that has good family values. We see parents who are parents as well as being adults and children who are children. We need more films like Creation.".

Others may think so but she really is not. If a viewer is not convinced consider how she handles reading his manuscript. The movie shows it just the way it happened. It took a marvellous woman to retain her religious beliefs and encourage Darwin to publish.Darwin himself wonderfully played by Paul Bettany is shown as almost mentally ill by what he observes. He has two driving motives to love his family especially his oldest daughter Annie and to find a way of writing the Origin of the Species knowing that it will offend all traditional religious thought on the subject of creation. Particularly odious to him is the fact that his wife believes that he will be permanently separated from God and from her should he persist in publishing his book. He half believes that she may be right. A fact that the movie left unstated is that Darwin was trained to be a minister  I think a huge omission. It would have made the complexity of his problem that much deeper.Though we do not see much of the children except Annie what we do get is really well handled. We will hope there is more of Freya Parks to come. She was a very sensitive Etty Darwin with naturalness much beyond her years. She is especially touching as she watches a fox kill a rabbit. Though Annie understands Etty is more childlike in her response of repulsion sadness and horror. She is even better displaying affection if that is possible when she asks her father to tell the children a story they have not heard.Annie Darwin Martha West caries most of the load for the part the children must play and she is delightful serious charming witty understanding and above all a lovable girl of about 10 going on 30. Her scene with the photographer and her father cannot be missed. This girl too will make many more movies one hopes.The great critic Roger Ebert said that Hollywood he was referring to Creation believes that all problems can be solved in the bedroom. Maybe that does reflect 2010 more than 1851 but if it is a flaw it is a minor one.Creation should be seen not for enlightenment about Darwin or the Origin of Species or a resoltion to the Fundamentalist debate about religion vs. science but because it is a good film that has good family values. We see parents who are parents as well as being adults and children who are children. We need more films like Creation.";

The biggest surprise was none other than Ted Raimi you know Sam's little brother. He played the mad doctor's henchman to the greatest extent. Somewhere between physical comedy and clever dialogue he did nothing but shine. But i really cannot ignore the magic that is Bruce Campbell. Though I did think that Ted Raimi stole the show Bruce did what he does best on the big screen. Somewhere between the sketchy nasty American business man and the tragic victim he displayed the same energy that he has always shown to be incredibly attractive to audiences. The movie itself was often interrupted by applause from the viewers. The crowd was definitely excited with each little turn that the movie took.This movie may not be Oscar material but my goodness it was amazing. I would highly recommend this to any Bruce Campbell fan. Also anybody that likes campy scifi movies do yourself a favor and watch this. Can't wait till this makes it out to DVD.Take it as you want to....the fed".

	schema:reviewBody "As a Bruce Campbell fan for nearly two decades I was thrilled to have an opportunity to see his latest film on the big screen with the man himself in attendance. Unfortunately Man with the Screaming Brain was itself a disappointment.Set in Bulgariawhere the SciFi Channel makes its Saturday night original filmsMan with the Screaming Brain is a curious mix of '50s Bmovie horror bodyswitching comedy violent revenge flick and overdone slapstick with a touch of romantic reconciliation. If that doesn't make sense well neither does Man with the Screaming Brain. Campbell plays a pharmaceutical company CEO who visits Bulgaria with his estranged wife in an inexplicable attempt to invest in the former Communist country's halffinished subway system. The two fall in with a former KGB agent turned cab driver and all three ultimately meet their demise at the hands of a vengeful gypsy woman.A local scientist Stacy Keach and his goofy assistant Ted Raimi who have developed a technique to allow tissue transplants without the possibility of rejection steal the bodies and place a portion of the cab driver's brain into Campbell's damaged skull. Also they put his wife's brain into a robotic body they just happen to have at hand.Campbell escapes and with a hastilyrestitched skull and the voice of the cab driverwhose transplanted brain tissue controls the left side of his bodyechoing in his head sets off to find and kill the gypsy. His robot wife does the same. But first there's an attempt to emulate Steve MartinLily Tomlin's All of Me when Campbell's two personalities battle for dominance over a restaurant dinner. Just as he was playing his own evil hand in Evil Dead II Campbell is adept at making his body appear to be inhabited by more than one mind.At times Screaming comes closest to another Steve Martin film The Man with Two Brains as it also takes a silly approach to '50s scifi clichs. However it tries too hard for too little result and that goes double for Ted Raimi's semicomprehensible Bulgarian oaf who gets entirely too much screen time. Nothing against Raimi it's just that he's better in smaller doses. In the end it's neither outrageous or funny enough to satisfy as a spoof nor is it serious enough to enjoy as a Bmovie pastiche. I was glad that Campbell had already left the screening by the time it ground to a halt as I feared having to say Gee Bruce that was really...something.Perhaps the best praise I can give it as a film is that at least the images stuck to the emulsion. And it was twice as good as Alien Apocalypse.".

Apparently he will be making a film in conjunction with Dark Horse comics in which he plays himself. The premise is that there is a town that is being terrorized by some monster and somebody suggests that they bring in the Evil Dead guy to help out. But since Bruce Campbell the actor doesn't really have any monster fighting abilities his arrival only results in more people dying as a result and things just end up getting much much worse. I think the idea is brilliant and it will be interesting to see how it is executed.But getting back to The Man With The Screaming Brain my suggestion is to not go in with your expectations too high. It's a disposable madeforTV movie that has a few good Bruce Campbell moments. It isn't going to convert anybody over to Bruce but if you're already converted then it's worth a watch.".

Stacy Keach plays a mad scientist who savesbrings Bruce Campbell back to life by implanting half of the brain of an exKGB turned cabbie. Bruce Campbell spends the rest of the film trying to avenge his death and has many internal arguments between himself and the KGB agent. The movie has all the great Bruce Campbell slap stick and humor. The movie is somewhat predictable I knew once the wife was killed that she would be sharing a brain with her killer. However I didn't go to see this movie because I thought it would have an Oscar winning script I went to see it because it was a Bruce Campbell scifi movie and I was not disappointed in the least. I highly recommend that you go see him on his book tour or wait and watch it on the scifi channel next month. Although before the movie he said the SciFi channel did cut some of the movie out to make it TV friendly. If you are a fan of Bruce I highly recommend it.".

All I can really say for sure is that silly is not always funny. Campbell plays an affluent American business man with a cheating wifeAntoinette Byronand trying to close a business transaction before he is murdered. He hires a cabbie to drive him around a strange little town not knowing that his wife is 'carrying on' with the taxi driver. Within moments of Campbell being bludgeoned the cabbie is killed in the same location. A mad scientistStacy Keachproceeds with an experiment putting the cabbie's brain inside the American's head. With massive stitches on his forehead Campbell breaks free and roams the streets looking for his wife all the while he is arguing with a strange voice inside his oversized head. Campbell contorts his rubbery face making silly expressions as he argues with himself. Thus Bruce is doing what he does best and no doubt his many fans will be pleased. I get the impression this must have been written as a straight comedy. Rounding out the cast are Ted Raimi Tamara Gorski and Vladmir Kolev. Watch for this on the SciFi Channel.".

I know that there are some Bruce Campbell fanatics out there who like Star Wars diehards will string you up from the nearest tree if you DARE speak any ill of their beloved cinematic icon...nevertheless Campbellteers this particular work from The Chin is a celluloid black hole.Before you make any assumptions that I'm some hoitytoity film buff who only watches real movies like Ladies in Lavender and Sideways think again  I'm a huge fan of Bmovies and Bruce Campbell in particular. His trademark character Ash is one of my favorites and his portrayal of the aging Elvis in Bubba HoTep was phenomenal.But hey Bmovies still have the potential to be reeeeally reeeeally bad and not in that good campy way we all love...and that's what watching this particular one was like for me and my fellow coworkers. With the exception of that one tracking shot where Bruce runs through the square and scares the kids there were no laughs to be had. Overall we found the story to be mindnumbingly stoopid the pacing mollasseslike and the socalled humor dumber than a bag of hammers. I'm sorry but Ted Raimi's Pavel character was not comic relief...he was just plain retarded! Believe me we all went into this really wanting to like it but left feeling incredibly disappointed and robbed of two hours.If you absolutely loved this movie plan to see it multiple times want to marry and have kids with it etc. that's fantastic  we all like what we like so you get no judgement from me. But don't go questioning the sense of humor or fan loyalty of those who aren't having multiple orgasms over Campbell's latest cinematic coupe. This flick was a steaming turd sandwich in my humble opinion...and as a true Campbell fan I'm allowed to say that!".

He gets in trouble with cops friends drug dealers women prostitutes and society in general.  He's just not that likable a guy.  Neither is the movie though it's still hilarious and worth watching.The flimsy premise is that Dolemite played with as much enthusiasm as star Rudy Ray Moore can muster is in jail for a crime he claims he didn't commit.  When a drug hit or a drug bust or drug something is about to go down the warden releases him to stop it or help it or just watch it.  Not very clear.  All I know is that I was unaware that the justice system frees convicts in order to allow them to prove their own innocence.  My ignorance I guess.The plot is convoluted and unimportant basically Dolemite goes around killing people Usually with very poorly choreographed karate having sex and cursing out people sometimes even rhyming too.  The joys of the movie are its total incompetence and its total indifference in the matter.I stopped counting the number of times I saw the boom mike after it was in one scene for the entire duration about two minutes of film.  I stopped questioning why the warden was looking down at where Dolemite was sitting even after he stood up and walked around when they cut back to the establishing shot and Dolemite was inexplicably sitting down again.  I stopped wondering why Dolemite dressed like that when he got naked on the street to change because he didn't want to get in his car with the ugly read normal clothes the jail gave him.  And I stopped wondering where he learned karate when he jiggles his hand on a guy's stomach and somehow cuts him open.  The only time I was ever remotely nervous and tense was when the disgusting flabby white mayor is walking around totally naked with nothing but a towel hanging around his neck which just barely covers him up.  You keep saying Cut away...cut away...cut away but by the time they do you are already emotionally scarred.The movie is ridiculous in every way imaginable.  Moore as Dolemite is either funny cool or both.  If you're on the lookout for a bad movie you have found it with Dolemite.".

But these considerations are ultimately irrelevant. In fact the sheer scale of the cinematic incompetence is certainly one of the actual joys of the movie. The filmmakers just didn't care and seemingly knocked this one out with little concern for such matters.The rough and ready style of Dolemite kind of seems appropriate though given the nature of the central character who is a supershady bad mutha in a pimp suit. This character Dolemite spends most of the film swearing in creative ways. His routines are like protorap and seem to have influenced hiphop culture. The movie is really a superb timecapsule flick. The insane fashions and jive talk are all almost alien in their bizarreness now. While the movie sports various other strange characters such as Reverend Gibbs the mayor and the Hamburger Pimp. The latter of which actually appears to be out of his head on something or other  I don't think this bloke was really acting! There's also an extended scene near the end in a nightclub that really has to be seen to be believed. It has a priceless performance from a soul act and a crazy dance routine with some guy battering hell out of a drumkit it then climaxes with Dolemite's swearing rap thing. It's strange like the movie in general. This may be supertrashy but it's highly original. It's yet another example of why the 70's ruled when it came to movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a time capsule from a particular social cultural and economic era Dolemite is remarkable. As a movie it sucks very very very very hard.This is one of those socalled blaxsploitation films from the 1970s and before you watch Dolemite or any of these films you'd probably be well served to at least check out the Wikipedia entry on blaxspoitation. If you don't you could suffer a severe case of brain cramp trying to figure these things out.Dolemite Rudy Ray Moore is pimpspoken word artistnight club ownerstreet avenger who starts out the movie in jail where he may or may not have been framed by the cops for dealing in drugs and stolen furs. Yeah I don't understand the stolen furs either. It must have been a 70s thing. Anyway Dolemite is offered the chance to get out of jail if he'll go back to his old neighborhood and put a stop to the out of control crime and violence that's taken it over. Accepting the offer Dolemite is picked up by a carful of his ladies and exchanges his prisonissued suit for his first of many pimptacular outfits. Returning to his neighborhood Dolemite discovers that Willie Green D'Urville Martin has taken over his old night club. As Dolemite basically wanders from scenes of sex to scenes of violence and back again we learn that Willie is connected to the mayor of the city and essentially runs Dolemite's old neighborhood to suit the mayor's agenda. Essentially it's the story of the white power structure coopting elements of the black community to keep the black man down with Dolemite being the returning hero spoiling that plan. It's a brutally primitive rendition of that story but subtlety's not exactly a strong point of this movie. A couple of racist cops hassle Dolemite a black FBI agent gets involved and Dolemite and his ladies use some amazingly bad 70s karate to defeat the forces of evil. I mean seriously there are 10 year olds in karate dojos all across America who could more convincingly kick people's butts.From almost every technical aspect this is a laughably bad movie. It's poorly shot poorly written it looks cheap and the acting is almost uniformly terrible. Jerry Jones as the black FBI agent and D'Urville Martin are passable I suppose but Rudy Ray Moore's alleged acting consists of a Can you dig it baby? nonchalance interspersed with overemphasis of the word motherfrand he still gives the third best performance of the film.For all of it's flaws there are two things for which I can recommend this movie.1. This is a film made by 1970s urban black people for 1970s urban black people about the world of 1970s urban black people. I'm not saying this is some sort of documentary about the way the 70s actually were for AfricanAmericans but it does give you a theatrical view of how they looked at and felt about their world. I don't say that as some kind of excuse for how crappy this movie is but this was the era when AfricanAmerican filmmakers were getting their first meaningful chance to tell their stories their way. In a country where history is what happened last month and everything before that has vanished into the mists of time this is a movie that slaps you in the face with how different things are today from how there were just a generation or so ago.2. For all the bad acting bad camerawork bad dialog and bad fight scenes there's an infectious energy to Dolemite. Everything about this movie is raw and unpolished and unpretentious. If you ever got together and made movies with your friends when you were kids the same honest joy that you can still see in those stories is the same thing you can see in Dolemite. These filmmakers and these performers are all so clearly caught up in what they're doing that they're extremely likable no matter how awful they are. A great example of that is the clothing in this film. It is hilariously bizarre but the performers AND the characters they play are so utterly at ease in these fashion disasters so convinced that these fabricated atrocities are the greatest thing since sliced bread that you'll end up wishing you could wear those sorts of outfits to work.If you want to watch a good movie I really can't recommend Dolemite. There are just so many ways that it's truly terrible. But this is a fun movie I enjoyed it and it's a reminder of how weird the 1970s actually were. So if you ever are in the mood to watch a awful film about a pimpspoken word artistnight club ownerstreet avenger and his army of karate chopping prostitutes you now know where to look.".

	schema:reviewBody "Certainly far far from the quality end of the Blaxploitation genre this nonetheless shares some of the staple ingredients which make many of its more illustrious brethren so charming. The plot concerns the titular hero the term applied in the loosest possible manner as our man is a bit of a scumbag who does a deal with the warden in the prison he is being held in after he was framed by bent cops to clean up his old hood. This our man sets about with great gusto partially fuelled by the need to avenge the senseless murder of his nephew. It turns out that the crime in the area is far more deep rooted than a few mere drug dealers and gun runners however indeed a whole conspiracy is afoot involving bent law enforcement officers and a dirty mayer.With multiple attempts on our heroes life and the pressure on will our man be able to save the day? Well if Dolemite's inimitable way with obscenities is anything to go by then the answer is 'hell yes'!!! Indeed Rudy Ray Moore's fast and foul outbursts are probably the real highlight here and are sure to raise much mirth.

	onyx:emotionText "Certainly far far from the quality end of the Blaxploitation genre this nonetheless shares some of the staple ingredients which make many of its more illustrious brethren so charming. The plot concerns the titular hero the term applied in the loosest possible manner as our man is a bit of a scumbag who does a deal with the warden in the prison he is being held in after he was framed by bent cops to clean up his old hood. This our man sets about with great gusto partially fuelled by the need to avenge the senseless murder of his nephew. It turns out that the crime in the area is far more deep rooted than a few mere drug dealers and gun runners however indeed a whole conspiracy is afoot involving bent law enforcement officers and a dirty mayer.With multiple attempts on our heroes life and the pressure on will our man be able to save the day? Well if Dolemite's inimitable way with obscenities is anything to go by then the answer is 'hell yes'!!! Indeed Rudy Ray Moore's fast and foul outbursts are probably the real highlight here and are sure to raise much mirth.

You ignore the errors and weak plot you see Rudy's obvious pleasure over acting in front of a camera for the first time. I imagine this was a dream come trur for Rudy he could finally bring his nightclub character Dolemite to the big screen. Of course Dolemite is an almost mythological character much bigger than real life sort of like a Black Paul Bunyan but Rudy gives an admirable attempt in bringing Dolemite to the screen. This movie had a revival of sorts when Arsenio Hall's TV talk show would feature clips from this movie and also when Arsenio had Rudy Ray on his show. Worth seeing if not taken seriously.".

You can tell this movie had a director or the actors would've just wandered off the lot during filming and gone about their lives however none of the acting seems to be directed. Maybe the director just gave up after seeing the......writing. Odd when the drugged monotone of a narrated flashback matches the exact dialog after the flashback.

However DOLEMITE manages something rare for the genreit's just cheap and silly and not the least bit entertaining! It's like blaxploitation made for very very stupid people.Years ago I saw a takeoff on the Dolemite films on Mad TV and unfortunately the real DOLEMITE isn't any better. Like the parody the acting is just atrocious. Rudy Ray Moore has all the charm and charisma of a piece of balsa wood. He can barely read his lines and his karate is a jokewith his kicks obviously missing the target again and again. As for the rest of the actors many might be even worse. My favorite was the FBI guy who couldn't even remember his lines and really struggled to get them outyet they didn't even bother to refilm these scenes! In fact so much of it was inept that I had a hard time figuring out whether the film was intended as a joke.If you think that despite horrible acting and action that there is something worth seeing about this film you're wrong. Even for the perverts out there hoping to see some skin will be disappointed. The naked women in the film really do look like hardluck prostitutes and there's nothing remotely sexy about their sagging bodies. I think looking at old people nakedREEEAALLY old people nakedis no worse than looking at these ladies. And as for Rudy Ray he has man boobs. No Black superhero or antihero should look that bad naked!! For goodness sakes put on your clothes people and come up with a script that doesn't look like it was written by winos!!!FYIApparently there are actually sequels to this film!! I can't imagine watching them so you'll just have to find someone else to review them.

In fact he says he always imagined himself as a black guy in Southern Cal.  Mr Roth is quoted as sayingWe saw every Blacksploitation picture and those movies were a HUGE influence on me. Trouble Man Superfly Foxy Brown Shaft Cleopatra Jones Blacula Rudy Ray Moore doin' his Dolemite vibeI saw all of those...He goes on to sayDolemite  Rudy Ray Moore  was one of the originals.  He was a blue comic doing blue humor.  Like Redd Foxx did on early party records.  So he was the most perfect to play a new secret agent.  His answer was not Bonds. James Bond.  His answer was Dolemite motherf!  We would wait for that line in all of his movies.  Get Whitey would show up in every single movie at least once and we would wait for that too.  They had the cars.  They had the shoes.  They had the guns. The Haircuts.  The Slang.  And the scams. And we all knew that all those beatific resolves at the end of the movie were white bull.  He's trying to feed hungry children but he's actually a pimp...bull.  That was designed to make it palatable to our moms and dads so they'd let us go see the picture.Spoken like a true genius.  So upon reading about Dolemite in Mr. Roth's book I immediately bought in on DVD and I really like it.  Yeah it's super lowbudget and yeah...I hate rap...but as a fan of Tarantino movies I can see many similarities especially some of the 70's fusionfunk alajaco pastorius music throughout the film.  I also love the scene where the two cops 'bust' him for coke and then one of them snorts a whole bunch of it like he'd done it a thousand times before and says something like Aww yeah....that's the real mccoy!...and then he continues to talk and has a little bit of coke still on his lip.  CLASSIC!  Some of the violence is a little over the edge but shocking which I would consider to be a positive quality.  Not as predictable as I assumed it would be.  Definitely going to pick up The Human Tornado very soon.  10 out of 10.".

They had the shoes.  They had the guns. The Haircuts.  The Slang.  And the scams. And we all knew that all those beatific resolves at the end of the movie were white bull.  He's trying to feed hungry children but he's actually a pimp...bull.  That was designed to make it palatable to our moms and dads so they'd let us go see the picture.Spoken like a true genius.  So upon reading about Dolemite in Mr. Roth's book I immediately bought in on DVD and I really like it.  Yeah it's super lowbudget and yeah...I hate rap...but as a fan of Tarantino movies I can see many similarities especially some of the 70's fusionfunk alajaco pastorius music throughout the film.  I also love the scene where the two cops 'bust' him for coke and then one of them snorts a whole bunch of it like he'd done it a thousand times before and says something like Aww yeah....that's the real mccoy!...and then he continues to talk and has a little bit of coke still on his lip.  CLASSIC!  Some of the violence is a little over the edge but shocking which I would consider to be a positive quality.  Not as predictable as I assumed it would be.  Definitely going to pick up The Human Tornado very soon.  10 out of 10.";

The plot drags a little in the middle but the power of such a cheap premise as kung fu hookers is enough to bring all but the snootiest film lovers through.

I sometimes wonder if the boom mike was left in on purpose as commentary on the ridiculous aspects of movies in general but i usually get distracted by erotic scenes that lack eroticism to the point of high art mundanacity.

The plot is very generic and has no substance that I could see not to mention it had a major flaw in my eyes. The main character Dr. Sorensen is a washed up astronomer who believes that an asteroid named Nemesis will strike Earth causing all life to cease.  He bases his belief on his discovery of cave paintings by an Aboriginee I'm sure I spelled that one wrong.  The paintings show an apparent timeline showing significant events throughout history such as the building of the Great Wall of China.  All of the events are shown in perfect chronological order and the very last picture on the timeline is Earth being destroyed.  Now to me if the painting showed things that had indeed happened why would the great Doctor believe that he could somehow change what was going to happen?  All that aside the movie moved along with extreme formulaic precision.  There was nothing in the movie that surprised me at all.  The actors were not very good and on a few occasions I just felt that they didn't even take the movie seriously to put forth enough effort to try to convince me that the characters were worth caring about. The whole movie was cliche ridden and a downright waste of time and money. I'd recommend Armageddon over this piece of crap any day.  At least Armageddon has some good acting compared to this not to mention the eye candy that is Liv Tyler.  Now that I think about it Golf isn't that bad.......".

The 13th Floor is a passable action movie with some slightly more interesting philosophical mumbojumbo thrown in.  Existenz is not an action movie at all and is not as many seem to believe about reality or any such deep concept.  It's about the human tendency to intentionally replace reality with an artificial both in its origin and in its behavior world of makebelieve.The most chilling moment in the movie is when Allegra Geller repeats her scripted line.  It's at that point you realize that the people in the game have voluntarily surrendered their free will in order to participate in a story.  This is made even more frightening at the end when D'Arcy Nader or rather his player comments on the possibility of spending one's life in the game.  I sympathize completely with the realist philosophy that providing interesting worlds in which people simply locate the correct predefined path to the end goal is ultimately a recipe for a soulless existence.  Living in the game is not living at all but is a tempting way to spend one's time on earth.  As Allegra comments about the real world there's nothing going on here.  Might as well jack into someone else's imagination and pretend to be doing something interesting.  Although I have to ask whether Cronenberg considers this a selfindictment considering that he himself offers up worlds to be experienced in 90 minute snippets.Upon leaving the theater after first watching this movie I thought it was one of those movies that was watchable only to see how it ended.  But having seen it a couple more times thank you SciFi Channel I've realized how much deeper it goes.  Seriously if you've only seen it once it deserves another viewing.".

	schema:headline " an existential psychotropic trip";
	schema:reviewBody "David Cronenberg much like colleague David Lynch is an acquired taste. A director who plays with themes like reality perversion sex insanity and death is bound to get the most extreme reations from audiences. He proved this with films as The Fly Naked Lunch Crash and eXitenZ capital X capital Z and more recently Spider. It's best to see eXistenZ with a clear mind. Try not to read too much about the plot or it'll be ruined for you. What I can tell you is that Cronenberg takes you on a trip down into the world of videogames that acts as a metaphor for any kind of escapist behaviour. Living out fantasies is something people always dream of but how far can you go into it before reality gets blurred and the fantasy takes over and turns into a nightmare? Those are the themes touched in eXistenZ an exploration of identity the human psyche physical bodies being invaded by disease and most importantly reality itself.The story and directing are excellent. Cronenberg knows his trade very well and succesfully brings to life an artificial world avoiding the usual pitfalls and clichs linked to stories such as this. The film shows some pretty disgusting stuff but is unusually lowkey in the gore department in comparison to Cronenbergs other work. The shock effects he plays on are never over the top and the plot progression is very intelligent and creative. It's not the most intellectual movie ever but it will leave you thinking about it wondering and pretty confused.The acting gets two thumbs up as well. Both protagonists Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law play their parts perfectly and cleverly portray their character's shifting moods and identities. The dialogue may seem a little stale and clinical at times but that is part of the effect Cronenberg was going for to create a disaffected and alien atmosphere that puts you quite at unease. Supporting actors as Ian Holm Don McKellar and an especially creepy Willem Dafoe lift the movie even higher with their disturbingly familiar performances.This movie takes some getting used to but if you can appreciate the dark tone bloodcurdeling imagery and existentially warping story you'll love it.".

	onyx:emotionText "David Cronenberg much like colleague David Lynch is an acquired taste. A director who plays with themes like reality perversion sex insanity and death is bound to get the most extreme reations from audiences. He proved this with films as The Fly Naked Lunch Crash and eXitenZ capital X capital Z and more recently Spider. It's best to see eXistenZ with a clear mind. Try not to read too much about the plot or it'll be ruined for you. What I can tell you is that Cronenberg takes you on a trip down into the world of videogames that acts as a metaphor for any kind of escapist behaviour. Living out fantasies is something people always dream of but how far can you go into it before reality gets blurred and the fantasy takes over and turns into a nightmare? Those are the themes touched in eXistenZ an exploration of identity the human psyche physical bodies being invaded by disease and most importantly reality itself.The story and directing are excellent. Cronenberg knows his trade very well and succesfully brings to life an artificial world avoiding the usual pitfalls and clichs linked to stories such as this. The film shows some pretty disgusting stuff but is unusually lowkey in the gore department in comparison to Cronenbergs other work.

Some roles don't suit this very talented actor but when she has a good role like this she is unmatchable. Her unconventional beauty and fascinating voice suits the part of Allegra. Looks great in a short black skirt too. There are other familiar actors but they are not given much to do. It looks good sounds good and a Howard Shore score complements the film very well.

'eXistenZ' and Alex Proyas' similarly overlooked 'Dark City' are everything 'The Matrix' claims to be  intelligent thought provoking CHALLENGING S.F. This movie is almost a summary of all the themes and motifs that Cronenberg has been obsessed about for the last 25 years or so. Especially the Burroughsian biological horror and the Phildickian questioning of reality. While it echoes many of his previous movies it especially evokes his masterpiece 'Videodrome'. It may not reach the hallucinogenic heights of that movie  very few have  but it certainly takes you to places most contemporary S.F. and horror movies don't even try to reach.However this movie isn't just Cronenberg rehashing his greatest hits. There are more than enough new and interesting touches especially the Rushdielike Fatwah theme the odd sexual symbolism and the witty touches such as the bone guns that fire teeth. Helping all this along is the interesting carefully chosen cast. All are good but I especially like Willem Dafoe's creepy garage mechanic and it was also great to see Canadian cult star Don McKellar 'Highway 61' 'Twitch City'etc as the enigmatic Russian Yevgeny.'Videodrome' has taken many years to find its real audience and maybe 'eXistenz' will too.

	schema:reviewBody "All reality is virtual. It's collaborative. It's invented.  David Cronenberg.In retrospect Existenz is part of a group of films released between 1998 and 2001 all of which examine the fragile lines separating an illusory reality from a supposedly more authentic Real. These films which include The Matrix Vanilla Sky Eyes Wide Shut Dark City Existenz Mulholland Drive The Truman Show Fight Club and A History of Violence all portray reality as a hyperreal simulation in possession of a dark and violent underside.But what separates Existenz from its big budget counterparts are it's biomechanical themes. Marshall McLuhan famously asserted that all technological advancements are merely extensions of the human body clothing an extension of our skin binoculars of our eyes cars of our legs media of our minds and desires. McLuhan believed that as media builds upon itself it grows further and further away from our human skin until the limits of our bodies becomes less and less definable.This bodily alienation is highlighted in Existenz. The film establishes a series of layered hyperrealities for the players of a virtual reality game to connect to. In order to enter each new layer of the game the players must literally plug in using organic looking spinal grafts. These grafts let the players enter the computer generated landscape of the game whilst leaving their physical bodies behind. They are essentially wilfully disembodied from their physical reality.The irony of the film is apparent at the end when we discover that the film's reality only exists when the characters decide to enter another reality at the moment of plugging in. Since the movie begins at the second plugging in without referencing the first Cronenberg suspends all reality to imply that no reality is grounded. In other words the audience's act of playing the film was the first plug in to an alternate reality. In this way Cronenberg engages the disembodiment that technology offers and threatens us with. The audience embodies media because media becomes an escape from the body through its prosthetic extensions. These plug in extensions are themselves sexualised implying that man's virtual escapes are themselves pleasure centric activities man hiding in fantasy by mind humping his machines. Importantly the film's machines become less organic and more mechanical and rigid as we get closer to reality.But though McLuhan suggests a refragmentation of the Self through extensions into media realities other thinkers suggest less pessimistic models. For example though our instruments have become detachable organs they need not displace us entirely. Isn't it possible that our senses no longer limited to our physical bodies now become receptors to a wider variety of stimuli and perceptions? Cronenberg acknowledges this but highlights the complications in returning to our real bodies. Recalibration to a pure reality is becoming increasingly impossible. One can imagine future generations thinking of their own brains as organic computers and not computers as imitations of the brain. In other words the machine becomes something that our body aspires to or increasingly enjoys being with.On yet another level Existenz portrays a war between a group of game players and rebels known as The Realists. The Realists want all game designers and games destroyed. They want the simulation to end and all of humanity to reenter reality. The great joke which only Cronenberg and Kubrick seem to acknowledge is that these Realists who delight in such demystification are operating under the most lamentable and unsupportable of assumptions the idea that you can strip away all fantasy. The reality they defend is in fact the ontology of a depressive shabbily empirical nothing ever adding up to more than the sum of its parts nothing worth getting worked up about nothing connecting with nothing existence. IE post modern hyperreal hell. They're defending simply another fantasy level in a game unable to face the fact that The Real is itself a cosmic ateleological event completely without design. The Real is purposiveness without purpose. Think the giant conversation at the end of Eyes Wide Shut Tom Cruise standing over a pool board as everything is explained but nothing actually adds up.Cronenberg is thus a kind of ontological existentialist believing that the very nature of reality itself the individual choices of subjects is radically open. Watch how he has his lead character played by Jude Law confront the existential horror of abandonment and despair when he complains to the game designer who is herself a mere player and not the actual game designer that the game is without final purpose and that they are forever being assaulted by malevolent forces intent upon destroying them. It's a game that would be hard to market he moans. And yet as she smartly replies it's a game that everyone is already playing.The Realists however want to defend their comfortable selfdelusions. They want to believe that the particular world in which they find themselves a mere consensual hallucination is fixed and determined. What guarantees such predetermination is of course the functioning of a transcended game designer whose role is basically a metaphor for God.Finally Existenz makes a distinction between players who are capable of making choices and preprogrammed drones who are nevertheless also players. Unable to act unless triggered by specific lines of dialogue these drones are reminiscent of so many interactions with real human beings in late Capitalism robot announcers telemarketers call centre employees etc. These days professionalization means becoming as much like a bureaucratically controlled drone as is humanly possible man losing all signs of autonomy unable to sensitively engage with situations or people around him.8.910  This film has aged well. Briskly told Existenz has an elegance and sexiness which lifts it above its big budget more action oriented brothers.".

	schema:headline " Cronenberg Levels Up";
	schema:reviewBody "From the brilliantly twisted mind of director David Cronenberg comes eXistenZ. What is eXistenZ exactly? A new male enhancement product? No rather it's a reality enhancement product a new type of videogamevirtual reality experience to be even more specific. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays the programmer of said video game while Jude Law plays her hapless protector and our surrogate as the audience. The further down the rabbithole Law's character goes so too do we until we are left dizzy and without words to describe what we just saw.Early in the film our characters are on the run from somebody who wants to do away with this groundbreaking technology. They'll have to deal with a creepy Willem DeFoe character and deadly spores along the way while still finding time to explore their new reality and test their limitations. Cronenberg's film pretty much hits the ground running and doesn't allow us the chance to catch our breath as it levels up. Because this is vintage Cronenberg of course there is plenty of gooey grossness to go around the least of which are the portholes that allow wouldbe gamers to plug in. Those crushing on the lovely Leigh may find themselves feeling somewhat conflicted about whether the porthole exploring is sensual or nausea inducing. Plotwise the film draws comparisons to other late '90s tech thrillers like Dark City and The Matrix. Heck even the DVD box art states that eXistenZ makes 'The Matrix' look like 'Child's Play.' Well I don't know about all that seeing as how I personally don't ever recall seeing a killer doll dodging bullets in that movie but no matter. What sets eXistenZ apart is that it is less focused on its dystopian future and more focused on our present quandary in balancing technological advances with good old downto earth human experience. Like the best Cronenberg films eXistenZ has a lot to say about that subject but doesn't bludgeon or bore his audience with it. Trade the giant placentalike sacks of skin in this film for the latest iPhone and it's safe to say that eXistenZ was ahead of its time to say the least.".

No rather it's a reality enhancement product a new type of videogamevirtual reality experience to be even more specific. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays the programmer of said video game while Jude Law plays her hapless protector and our surrogate as the audience. The further down the rabbithole Law's character goes so too do we until we are left dizzy and without words to describe what we just saw.Early in the film our characters are on the run from somebody who wants to do away with this groundbreaking technology. They'll have to deal with a creepy Willem DeFoe character and deadly spores along the way while still finding time to explore their new reality and test their limitations.

	schema:reviewBody "David Cronenberg's eXistenZ' is a well designed reflection of the philosophy of existentialism. It addresses the problems of a culture that is plugged into technology that it can no longer distinguish between fantasy and reality or between the organic and the mechanical. The movie shocks the audience with its replacement of mechanical technology with organic metabolismic one. In this context the technology is able to be part of human body. After playing the virtual reality game of eXistenZ' the real world feels like a game and as a result human behavior change in order to apply violent gameurges even when the game is over. In eXistenZ technology has evolved from machinery to biological organisms that plug directly into the human nervous system an idea that reflects Marshall McLuhan's belief who is a well known media theorist that computers are extensions of human consciousness. Like telephone is an extention of the ear television is an extention of the eye telegram is an extention of the central nervous system hightech virtual reality is an extention of human consciousness. In eXistenZ technology is biological and thus more human than it is in our world. But as technology becomes organic humans become more mechanical and therefore less free unable to resist their gameurges. eXistenZ is a virtual realty simulation of man's existence. Jean Baudrillard describes a mediated society in his book of Simulacra and Simulation which all power to act has been transformed to appear. The world has passed into a pure simulation of itself. In eXistenZ it is obvious to see Baudrillard's mediated society with the themes of the invasion of the body the loss of control and the transformation of the self into other.While you are in the eXistenZ consciousness slowly replaces with another identity your role in the game which is a reflection each individual's real life subconscious. While you gain the control of your hyperreal life step by step the aura of your real life disappers. For Baudrillard .simulations or simulacra have become hyperreal more than real.' Our hyperreality like Cronenberg's world of computer simulation .now feels and for all intents and purposes is more real than what we call the real world.' Baudrillard The purpose of the game which can basically be called 'experience' is quite metaphorical. Because you can not even know what is experience unless you experience it. As existentialists say that life without an exact explanation is absurd the game of eXistenZ is absurd too. Cronenberg ironically reflects the absurdity of our lives. For instance in the game the other roles just stand still unless you ask them a preprogrammed question. And when you put their aimless funny looking state of being into the representation of our lifes the exposed absurdity really shocks.The theme of the game is to understand what it is for? This hidden metaphorical question creates anguish over the people who play eXistenZ. They have no doubt about their existence however they do not know the underlying reason of their existence. The essence.Existentialists have held that human beings do not have a fixed nature or essence as other animals and plants do each human being makes choices that create his or her own nature. In the formulation of the 20thcentury French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre existence precedes essence. Choice is therefore central to human existence and it is inescapable even the refusal to choose is a choice. Freedom of choice entails commitment and responsibility. Because individuals are free to choose their own path existentialists have argued they must accept the risk and responsibility of following their commitment wherever it leads.' Perhaps I should mention eXistenZ' deals with the concept of freedom of choice too. You achieve your final role in the game by taking right decisions. If you don't than the game becomes irrevelant and boring. So you begin to interrogate the game your existence rather than your essence. You suddenly become schzopfrenically alianated from the game and realize your position outside the game. Well as a last word eXistenZ is a well designed reverse simulation of life thus existentialism.".

Apart from a plotbased running gag with a friend ever since I don't think I've spent much timing thinking about it since. After catching it on TV recently though I'm inclined to think this is one of those movies you really ought to evaluate over multiple viewings.The plot is brilliantly twisted. As Allegra and Ted port in and out of the game she's invented it's hard for them  or us  to know what's real and what isn't. Playing the game along with them and interacting with the characters works exceptionally well considering some of these concepts are pretty far ahead of the movie's time. No spoiler here but some of the plot concepts must have influenced some very big sci movies released since!There's a lot of freaky biohorrorerotica on screen. It's not an overly violent film and I wouldn't call it a horror movie at all but some of the scenes are very 'fleshy'. It's more like overt eroticism runs throughout  even Allegra's bio 'pod' the games machine looks and reacts like some feisty fleshy erogenous zone.The special effects aren't bad. Yes some involving creatures are a bit Harryhausen but others hold their own really well more than a decade later.There's a message  and again it's ahead of its time and doesn't shy away from asking the big questions. But then the movie's called 'existence' after all.I've probably given this an extra star because I can't quite believe the lack of love here on IMDb. This is a good film that aims to do say and stretch you more than most. That's gotta be worth a look.".

	schema:reviewBody "After his almost disastrous Crash Cronenberg returns to more familiar terrain with eXistenZ. After Videodrome and Naked Lunch this is now his third movie featuring different levels of reality which gradually mix with each other until at the end you don't know any more what reality is. Nowadays you cannot say any more that this is a novel concept and in addition eXistenZ is much tamer much more mainstream and much weaker than Naked Lunch and especially Cronenberg's masterpiece Videodrome. There simply isn't anything new which Cronenberg has to add to the subject.Moreover the fact that the movie deals with computer gaming is misleading. First the subject was probably chosen to attract a new audience which isn't familiar with his previous movies. Second Cronenberg's visions aren't very much based on what modern computer gaming really is except maybe for adventure games. In Cronenberg's movie the computer game allows you to enter another reality which however looks very much  like the reality you know except that there seem to be other rules. Modern computer gaming in turn has already created a new reality which differs in its very characteristics from the world we know. This world is aggressive fast paced and the player as individual is reduced to its capability of reacting as fast as possible this aspect is indeed captured much more appropriately in the  much weaker movie  The Matrix. Thus Cronenberg's movie is more a surrealist dream than a serious discussion of the dangers of computer gaming. Of course this is prefectly legal. The game console is a means of changing into another reality just like the drugs were in Naked Lunch and video tapes were in Videodrome. At other times the console appears more like a sexual fetish.eXistenZ has some interesting and remarkable scenes such as the whole part in the Trout Farm and the Chinese restaurant but there are also involuntarily ridicolous scenes such as the character being stuck in a game loop. Overall the images which Cronenberg chooses do not have the strength and impact of his older movies The central element the organic console just looks like what it is a piece of rubber. It is directly hooked up to the spinal chord an unpleasant idea but how much more impressive was the scene when James Woods inserted the video tape into his own stomach in Videodrome. All in all eXistenZ is another trip into the weird world of David Cronenberg but into the more civilized regions which doesn't give you many surprises.".

	onyx:emotionText "After his almost disastrous Crash Cronenberg returns to more familiar terrain with eXistenZ. After Videodrome and Naked Lunch this is now his third movie featuring different levels of reality which gradually mix with each other until at the end you don't know any more what reality is. Nowadays you cannot say any more that this is a novel concept and in addition eXistenZ is much tamer much more mainstream and much weaker than Naked Lunch and especially Cronenberg's masterpiece Videodrome. There simply isn't anything new which Cronenberg has to add to the subject.Moreover the fact that the movie deals with computer gaming is misleading. First the subject was probably chosen to attract a new audience which isn't familiar with his previous movies. Second Cronenberg's visions aren't very much based on what modern computer gaming really is except maybe for adventure games. In Cronenberg's movie the computer game allows you to enter another reality which however looks very much  like the reality you know except that there seem to be other rules. Modern computer gaming in turn has already created a new reality which differs in its very characteristics from the world we know. This world is aggressive fast paced and the player as individual is reduced to its capability of reacting as fast as possible this aspect is indeed captured much more appropriately in the  much weaker movie  The Matrix. Thus Cronenberg's movie is more a surrealist dream than a serious discussion of the dangers of computer gaming. Of course this is prefectly legal. The game console is a means of changing into another reality just like the drugs were in Naked Lunch and video tapes were in Videodrome. At other times the console appears more like a sexual fetish.eXistenZ has some interesting and remarkable scenes such as the whole part in the Trout Farm and the Chinese restaurant but there are also involuntarily ridicolous scenes such as the character being stuck in a game loop. Overall the images which Cronenberg chooses do not have the strength and impact of his older movies The central element the organic console just looks like what it is a piece of rubber. It is directly hooked up to the spinal chord an unpleasant idea but how much more impressive was the scene when James Woods inserted the video tape into his own stomach in Videodrome. All in all eXistenZ is another trip into the weird world of David Cronenberg but into the more civilized regions which doesn't give you many surprises.";

Released at around the same time as THE MATRIX and exploring many of the same thoughts and ideas EXISTENZ is less a crowdpleaser and more of a lowkey thoughtful affair which still manages to be packed with bizarre imagery and grotesque creations from Cronenberg's decidedly warped mind except this time in a film more appealing to a larger audience than his older gruefests like THE BROOD.In the end EXISTENZ fails to become a great movie by being too annoyingly clever for its own good and is flawed by being too cold in its depiction of characters and situations a problem Cronenberg has felt throughout his career  he's just too detached with the exception of DEAD RINGERS I believe. As realities switch and characters change allegiances the film does isolate itself from the audience although the wealth of ideas and imagination keeps it totally interesting throughout. Here Cronenberg's obsession with body horror crops up in weird games consoles which are plugged into sockets at the base of the human spine once again Cronenberg dwells on the sexual subtleties of the act and pulsate and cry as organic lifelike creations.There are a couple of very wellrealised situations particularly the restaurant scene where Jude Law's character assembles an organic gun which shoots human teeth! from the remains of his meal and uses it to shoot the waiter or another scene near the end when a diseased console is burnt releasing thousands of spores into the air. The diseases in the film hark back to earlier Cronenberg creations like RABID although his films all look and feel a lot different the same underlying obsessions and principles can be felt in each. The special effects are excellent and frequently disgusting and there are brief flashes of the graphic gore and carnage which Cronenberg used to use so much.EXISTENZ also benefits from a strong cast of accomplished actors although some only appear in cameo roles. Jennifer Jason Leigh is the strongwilled and powerful female lead and her pairing with Jude Law as the film's audience type character a complete novice who is sucked into the virtual world is an inspired one with the two setting it off really well together. Ian Holm appears as a mad inventor and Willem Dafoe shines in another of his demented turns as a gas station assistant who has ulterior motives. Christopher Eccleson also cameos as a teacher sporting an American accent along with Law which was a bit disconcerting for me! Although not one of his best movies EXISTENZ is a good introduction to Cronenberg's work as it covers most of the themes and ideas closest to his heart while providing enough thrills and spills as well as an almost obligatory twist ending for the modern audience.".

	schema:headline " Play it. Live it. Kill for it.";
	schema:reviewBody "The way you pronounce the name of this film is a little different. The story that is shown is certainly different and after you have seen it you will say it is movie that is definitely different in almost every aspect. Of course I am talking about the 2000 scifi thriller 'eXistenZ' which shows that going into the world of 'virtual reality' can be weird and dangerous. 'eXistenZ' also proves that virtual reality' can be a world that one cannot be sure of being in or out of.During the first closeddoor demonstration of an amazing new virtual reality game  called 'eXistenZ'  the system's brilliant designer Allegra Geller is violently attacked by a crazed assassin intent on killing her and destroying her creation. Forced to flee into hiding Allegra enlists the help of young marketing trainee Ted Pikul to help her test the damaged system by convincing him to join her inside a game of eXistenZ. The action then explodes as their world's reallife dangers begin to merge with the fantasy of the game.This film has a most unique and unusual story but in a good way. I have read on the internet that eXistenZ 'makes the Matrix look like child's play' and I would have to agree. What I will say about this film's story is that it gives the impression that its audience will understand where it actually is and that they will believe who someone is is truly that person and that they are on a level par. I guess that is what is most inventive about the film to make what is seemingly so true to be actually not true at all. The writerdirector of eXistenZ David Cronenberg from 'the Fly' wrote a most inventive screenplay that I am sure you will not see in along time.This movies lead actors are Allegra Gellar Jennifer Jason Leigh and Ted Pikul Jude Law. The pair share a most unique chemistry onscreen as we see their game characters doing some very weird and wacky things as they keep going deeper and deeper into the game of 'eXistenZ' they are playing. I love the way that both Leigh and Law turn this movie into a very erotic kind of an experience to watch. Allegra says this is all part of the game and that the pair should not give into any of these so called 'bits'. I must mention that Jude Law suits this kind of movie genre. Law has also been a part of the Steven Spielberg movie 'AI' which was another unique movie that I did not mind.The supporting cast of this film was also good. I like how we get to meet the guy at the gas station who affectionately known as Gas Willem Defoe. The role that he took on in this film suits him down to the ground. However I thought that his role of the 'Green Goblin' in the 2002 blockbuster 'Spiderman' was ordinary to say the least. Other supporting cast members include Kiri Vinokur Ian Holm the strange man at the trout factory Yevgeny Nourish Don McKellar and the Chinese waiter Oscar Hsu.I also like the way this movie looks. The 'virtual reality' world created for  'eXistenZ' looks so weird and wonderful that part of me feels that I might be tempted to play the game. Then the creation of the funny creatures in the movie the funny pods that are used to play the game and the surprise in the 'special' Chinese meal are interesting to see as we go further and further into the film. Then take the great parts of the film. I like how this movie starts as it is one thing that needs to be looked at carefully or you could misread what is happening for the entire movie. When the lead pair then start to play eXistenZ the movie becomes all the more interesting as this is the part where you can start to realise that not everything is what it seems.But here is a clue for you out there that are a little confused by the whole reality vs. virtualreality parts of the film. The film does point out very subtle clues as to what mode both Allegra and Ted are actually in. However if you are one person who is clever enough to work out the movie's entire plot then you are one lucky person as even I am still thinking up questions that I want to know the answers to such as was the entire movie just a game? What does the end of the film actually mean? Did those mean streaks that happened in the supposed 'game' turn out just to be glitches in the real life 'virtual reality' game? What should you make of the two lead characters after the end of the film? I am sure I will think of more questions but whether I find out there answers is another thing.The whole world of 'virtual reality' is becoming realer and closer in the world that we live in. We can enter into many different aspects of virtual reality at the drop of the hat thanks to technologies such as computers the internet computer games and the movies that we watch. However whether the whole idea of 'virtual reality' is good that I am unsure of. My opinion is if we enter into a world that is outside of our reality than we could be giving something of ourselves that we don't actually know we are giving and could turn us into people that we might not normally be. That being said this movie makes me so curious about the world that I have just criticised. If you want to experience a film that goes one step further than what the Matrix did in certain aspects then I can only recommend that you dare yourself to enter into the game which is called 'eXistenZ'.CMRS gives 'eXistenZ' 4.5 Very Good  Brilliant Film".

	onyx:emotionText "The way you pronounce the name of this film is a little different. The story that is shown is certainly different and after you have seen it you will say it is movie that is definitely different in almost every aspect. Of course I am talking about the 2000 scifi thriller 'eXistenZ' which shows that going into the world of 'virtual reality' can be weird and dangerous. 'eXistenZ' also proves that virtual reality' can be a world that one cannot be sure of being in or out of.During the first closeddoor demonstration of an amazing new virtual reality game  called 'eXistenZ'  the system's brilliant designer Allegra Geller is violently attacked by a crazed assassin intent on killing her and destroying her creation. Forced to flee into hiding Allegra enlists the help of young marketing trainee Ted Pikul to help her test the damaged system by convincing him to join her inside a game of eXistenZ. The action then explodes as their world's reallife dangers begin to merge with the fantasy of the game.This film has a most unique and unusual story but in a good way. I have read on the internet that eXistenZ 'makes the Matrix look like child's play' and I would have to agree. What I will say about this film's story is that it gives the impression that its audience will understand where it actually is and that they will believe who someone is is truly that person and that they are on a level par. I guess that is what is most inventive about the film to make what is seemingly so true to be actually not true at all. The writerdirector of eXistenZ David Cronenberg from 'the Fly' wrote a most inventive screenplay that I am sure you will not see in along time.This movies lead actors are Allegra Gellar Jennifer Jason Leigh and Ted Pikul Jude Law. The pair share a most unique chemistry onscreen as we see their game characters doing some very weird and wacky things as they keep going deeper and deeper into the game of 'eXistenZ' they are playing. I love the way that both Leigh and Law turn this movie into a very erotic kind of an experience to watch. Allegra says this is all part of the game and that the pair should not give into any of these so called 'bits'. I must mention that Jude Law suits this kind of movie genre. Law has also been a part of the Steven Spielberg movie 'AI' which was another unique movie that I did not mind.The supporting cast of this film was also good. I like how we get to meet the guy at the gas station who affectionately known as Gas Willem Defoe. The role that he took on in this film suits him down to the ground. However I thought that his role of the 'Green Goblin' in the 2002 blockbuster 'Spiderman' was ordinary to say the least. Other supporting cast members include Kiri Vinokur Ian Holm the strange man at the trout factory Yevgeny Nourish Don McKellar and the Chinese waiter Oscar Hsu.I also like the way this movie looks. The 'virtual reality' world created for  'eXistenZ' looks so weird and wonderful that part of me feels that I might be tempted to play the game. Then the creation of the funny creatures in the movie the funny pods that are used to play the game and the surprise in the 'special' Chinese meal are interesting to see as we go further and further into the film. Then take the great parts of the film. I like how this movie starts as it is one thing that needs to be looked at carefully or you could misread what is happening for the entire movie. When the lead pair then start to play eXistenZ the movie becomes all the more interesting as this is the part where you can start to realise that not everything is what it seems.But here is a clue for you out there that are a little confused by the whole reality vs. virtualreality parts of the film. The film does point out very subtle clues as to what mode both Allegra and Ted are actually in. However if you are one person who is clever enough to work out the movie's entire plot then you are one lucky person as even I am still thinking up questions that I want to know the answers to such as was the entire movie just a game? What does the end of the film actually mean? Did those mean streaks that happened in the supposed 'game' turn out just to be glitches in the real life 'virtual reality' game? What should you make of the two lead characters after the end of the film? I am sure I will think of more questions but whether I find out there answers is another thing.The whole world of 'virtual reality' is becoming realer and closer in the world that we live in.

Some real world exists which creates a synthetic world which in turn creates another synthetic world and so on. More in this film conspiracies blend levels reversing and folding roles. This is the stuff of Phil Dick not the Matrix or The One or any of that other juvenile stuff.But there is a more fundamental difference Films like the matrix start with a story concept then work to tell the story by whatever visual vocabulary is current. Cronenberg starts with a specific strong vision and hangs a story on it. Clearly his vision here is for artificially living sexual paraphernalia. These have highly erotic exteriors but disgusting reptilian interiors. The whole film is built around this notion prurient fiction repellent pudenda.And the whole thing selfreferentially encompasses the audience with the final level because the film clearly shows itself to be a creation in the same mold as Allegra's. I love this stuff if only as an intellectual construction.But what puzzles me is Cronenberg's meekness. He knows he's a cult filmmaker so why pander to a bunch of kids who will go to The One' instead? Jennifer has the guts to do whatever is required. Her presence here shows edge by reference because we know that she would risk all if asked. But she's not asked.

	schema:reviewBody "What has happened to David Cronenburg?  I came out of this film feeling really dispirited and depressed primarily because none of my expectations for a Cronenburg film were fulfilled.As soon as I saw the organic game pods I laughed and was pleased but the kind of development I was expecting of that idea did not materialise.  The gore and the organic props were simply displayed to us as if that was enough to create a visceral response.  I'm afraid I found the scene in the Chinese Restaurant no more disturbing than actually eating chicken's feet for real.Too many of the action and plot points were set up in advance such as the bony gun leading to a lack of suspense.I think the worst aspect of the film is that there was no emotional involvement at any level.  Nothing was done to make us feel empathy with the characters.  The fact that we are in a game and that game dialogue is trite and inane is no excuse to use trite and inane dialogue throughout the film. The performances suffered as a result and I was most disappointed in Jennifer Jason Leigh who appeared to be sleepwalking through the whole movie.  The love scene seemed to be put in gratuitously just to show us some kissing.  Also Jude Law was completely miscast  his role should have gone to Christopher Ecclestone who for our American friends who may not have seen him is one of the most intense and powerful screen actors around. Law failed to convince that he was really scared or worried by developments.  One minute he is phobic about having his body penetrated the next he is consenting to a spinal operation with scarcely a shrug.  Of course if he's playing a game he wouldn't be worried no more than I am by playing Doom.  But a film has to use fear and uncertainty as a dramatic device to draw the audience into the story and this is where eXistenZ failed completely.I think Cronenburg likes to think that the world he creates in his movies is existentialist and unemotional but the fact remains that his best films specifically The Dead Zone The Fly and Dead Ringers I haven't seen M. Butterfly all work because of their emotional power.  The musical scores for these films all by Howard Shore all serve to underline the emotional undercurrent but in eXistenZ the score is simply trying to create a response which isn't provided by the film and gives the same impression of hackwork which the rest of the film provokes.  Furthermore if we take the example of The Fly the theme of physical transformation is very clearly expressed and deeply explored.  In eXistenZ I could see from the plot that Cronenburg's theme involved the nature of reality but I found no deep exploration of this theme unlike in say Videodrome.The whole film suffers very badly from having a small budget.  The various game worlds we are shown are all very smallscale and cramped  not even up to the standard of modern roleplaying games.  Also the props and the special effects looked cheap with only the bioport in the characters' backs remotely convincing.  I feel that Cronenburg should have made some other film for the money he had and to wait until he could raise enough money to make eXistenZ on a much larger canvas.  This also affected the ending of the film which came too quickly and seemed quite perfunctory. The fact that the world of reality was one in which there is a battle between gameplayers and realists and that the world of the game was a world in which there was a battle between gameplayers and realists and so on ad infinitum seemed to indicate a distinct lack of imagination on Cronenburg's part and undoubtedly gave away the ending at least for me.When the film was coming to it's for want of a better word climax I couldn't believe it  nothing had happened yet!  Even when the final twist happened nothing major was at stake.  I didn't care whether we were still playing a game or whether this was the real reality.  We never found out enough about reality to know if the conflict between gameplayers and Realists was meaningful.  In the end the entire film could have been made as one of the less intriguing episodes of the Outer Limits the Twilight Zone has already been cited and certainly the socalled twistinthetail ending was every bit as predictable as one from one of those programmes.I feel that Cronenburg should avoid writing his films from now on.  In the early days of Scanners The Brood and Videodrome similarly emotionless in tone the films were worth watching because nothing like them had been seen before.  As his career developed the films were worth watching because he combined visceral imagery with strong emotionality.  Now we are back to just strong images with no emotional involvement and in 1999 the imagery simply isn't strong enough to excite interest any more.  These same problems afflicted Crash his last film.  For me Dead Ringers remains his best film.The film is worth seeing if you have never watched any of Cronenburg's past stuff and you have had no exposure to science fiction.  Otherwise there's nothing new or provocative in this film to make it worth watching.".

All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts! In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team! This is a good Three Stooges short! The Stooges are very good in it so is Christine McIntyre Kenneth MacDonald Frank Lackteen Vernon Dent Duke York Stanley Blystone and Cy Schindell. Its quite good to watch around Halloween time! There is another similar like this Three Stooges short with alternate scenes called Of Cash and Hash.".

Anyway Gladys McIntryre vouches for the boys and they in turn help her out at the caf and then later go to a country house she is interested in buying or selling I forget to be honest. That's when we get the wild finale with the real crooks and a cleaverwielding ghoul named Angel chasing our boys. Those chase scenes with the Stooges and scary characters are always funny. It's too bad the rest of the film wasn't as entertaining as the last three or four minutes.".

The interrogation scene was pretty funny and the beginning part of the cafe part. But there are a lot of plotholes in this short. For example why are the stooges hiding in the garbage can when the police come? In the remake Of Cash And Hash1955 director Jules White fixes this and the reason for the stooges hiding in the garbage can is because there is a gunfight between the police and the armored car robbers. The scene in which Moe is having trouble with the oyster was done before with Curly in Dutiful But Dumb 1941. The spooky house part wasn't all that great except for the hilarious scene on the outside of the spooky house. To top it off the ending had no sting to it. Rating C".

Here are my reviews of the episodes released so far Episode one was even better than I expected and from everything I had heard about it I expected quite a lot. I am very impressed with the actors already. The father was creepy and played perfectly. The little girl is so expressive she uses her eyes to convey such emotion. The animation was superb. The cinematography was amazing each camera angle capturing the feeling of the scene perfectly. The editing was done so well each scene blending seamlessly into the next. The music captured the emotions quite well and drew you into the story. I just can't say enough about how wonderful this episode was. It definitely whets my appetite for more! Episode 2 was even better than the first one! Everything I said about the first episode carries through only you get to see even more of the character development. I can not wait to finally see episode 3 or the rest of the series for that matter. What is developing is an intriguing character driven storyline with all the trappings of a big Hollywood production but without the pretension. So much is said with so few words. This series is something like you've never seen and perched to become a real success.This episode was FREAKING AWESOME! No other words describe it! WOW! Everything that I've said about the previous episodes holds true for this one and yet it was even better! I don't know how you manage to take something amazing and make it even better! The further character development proves that this is a completely character driven piece. The cinematography excels as it always has and draws you into Emily's pain fear hate and emotional rollercoaster. I can't wait to see Episode 4... or the rest of the series for that matter. You have truly outdone yourself!As much as I have loved the other episodes episode 4 is the best yet. I love the character progression. I feel like we are really coming to know Emily her pain and her internal struggle. The other themes I've stated in past reviews are continued. GREAT cinematography the writing is superb the actors are right on with their portrayals and have made the characters their own and the animation is simply amazing! Another great job from the DbP crew!".

Centreing round a woman who as a young girl was beaten by her father who also killed her mother she spends her time drawing but wait for it then she becomes her superhero drawings and goes on to fight crime therefore being drawn by pain so clever. The story itself is actually OK but it's just how it's done Jesse the writer and director has no idea how to write a script just listen to a monologue featuring the 8 year old version of the hero and it sounds like it was written by a 30 year old man while her dad who sports a great moustache just walks around the house all day while looking angry just showing how bad the characterisation is especially the bit where he gets angry in the first episode and begins repeating the phrase no more while holding his wife's head before killing her using the marble work surface. The following bang sound effect and just his terrible acting as all he can convey is angry just is brilliant including after where he goes to beat his daughter using his belt which is all done with him moaning and looking angry in slow motion. The episodes themselves could contain easily a good clean script ranging over 5 minutes but oh no Jesse doesn't want this. Little Jesse is shitting out post modernism as if he'd just eaten Donnie Darko and then douched himself to death. Pointless camera jerks all at weird angles overly repeated lines and even pointless sequences just muddled up every now and again to fill the overlong episodes. In conclusion the idea isn't bad it's just how it's done also there is a great character of a fat guy on a bench who doesn't come up enough and is great i just wanna hug his Lil chubby cheeks cause they look so soft. The character development is non existent as the main character just says the first philosophical sounding thing that comes to her head although they all contradict one another. But all in all mainly stIndiana Jones 4 however is much better Type Jeeharv into youtube as well the results may make you weep at the beauty of the world also you'll hear a lot of cheap sex jokes mostly gay ones.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a huge fan of 80s Hard Rock I was really looking forward to seeing Rock Star. As the movie started I was more than satisfied. A lot of the early scenes were funny and entertaining. The concert scenes made me feel like I was actually there. One major compliment I give this movie is that they made the songs from the fictional band STEEL DRAGON sound realistic for the time period the movie is in. If I didn't know better I could've been fooled into thinking Steel Dragon was a real band and all their songs actually were made in the mid 80s. The underdog portion of the story may not be original but it still works none the less. And by the time Wahlberg's character was in his first concert with the band I really thought Rock Star could be one of the coolest movies of the year.But at about the halfway point I was lost. The second half of this movie could've really used a lot of work on the script. I say that the second half of the script needed work but what I should say is the second half of the movie actually could've used a script period. The second half is held together by some predictable sequences all telling the story of a guy indulging in the rock star life which we've all heard and seen a thousand times. There were very few moments that actually were used to progress the story.But I don't want to give the impression that Rock Star was no good. Although some of the movie didn't work I still had a blast watching it. The music is what really holds it together. Both the original songs written for the film Steel Dragon and the background songs used. It's not often that you can hear bands like Bon Jovi Def Leppard Kiss and Motley Crue used in a movie. And like I said before the concert scenes are awesome.So for people who love great 80s Rock this movie will be a lot of fun. Rock Star is an average movie with an above average soundtrack. Not a perfect film but it provides enough entertainment for your money.".

	schema:reviewBody "ROCK STAR  2001  out of fourBy Blake FrenchRock Star is the story of a nobody who becomes propelled into fame only to realize living his dream is not the way he imagined it. We have seen all this before in better movies but this human story does capture the world of rock and roll with a brutally honest and insightful edge. It garners a recommendation because of its visualization of the atmosphere. The script by CrazyBeautiful director John Stockwell portrays the hardcore universe with memorable imagesit doesn't explain what it is about it shows us.Rock Star originally titled Metal God stars Mark Wahlberg as Chris Izzy Cole a Pittsburgh office supplies salesperson who dreams of becoming Bobby Beers the fiery lead singer for the heavy metal rock group Steel Dragon. Although Chris already sings for his own tribute rock group called Blood Pollution instead of writing his own songs he insists on performing only those by Steel Dragon and only in the exact way they perform them. His group becomes irritated with Chris' obsessions and gives him the boot.This devastates Chris as well as his supportive parents and faithful girlfriend Emily Jennifer Aniston from TV's Friends. He then receives a phone call. It's the Steel Dragon band. They have seen Chris' tapes and want him to replace the recently fired lead singer. In an instant Chris rockets into the dizzying world of sudden stardomfrom the biggest rock fan to the biggest rock star. Unfortunately it's not as rewarding as he expected.A true story inspired the Rock Star concept. An Ohio supply salesman Tim Ripper Owens really did replace Rob Halford the lead singer in Judas Priest after initially singing for a tribute band. The rest of the film is probably fiction although most of what happens must represent the experiences of many other bands. The film details the various ordeals of being a rock star. It explores the aspects of touring personality differences the danger of drug abuse and violence struggling relationships sexual freedom dishonesty and the extreme measures of the producers all to please the fans and keep popularity high. I have seen all of Mark Wahlberg's movies and this is the first that has earned my affection. Wahlberg a former singermodel has made movies like Fear Boogie Nights Three Kings and most recently Tim Burton's lacking remake Planet of the Apes. I am starting to admire the young actor more and more. Although he has not performed in many successful films he has taken many chances and done a variety of roles. Rock Star is his best film to date. I can't think of many actors who could have convincingly portrayed Chris Cole's struggles and aspirations. Wahlberg truly makes Rock Star rock. Jennifer Aniston lights up the screen as well. She creates a chemistryrich relationship with Chris that induces audience participation. It's tragic of what happens to their relationship. We care about these characters a great deal. During the film concert scenes director Stephen Herek who also directed Holy Man and the live action version of 101 Dalmatians creates a gripping atmosphere. He captures the scenes with an intense urgency and a raw unmistakable energy. The musical numbers provide the film with the best most involving scenes. Unfortunately Herek cannot sustain the energy and zest throughout. At the threequarters mark he looses the spark as the movie becomes dull and unpleasant. I understand where the story needs to go in order to portray the negative side of fame but this movie loses everything it previously had going for it. In Almost Famous a much better film about rock and roll there is a certain amount of interest and life in even the most sorrowful scenes. Here it feels as if the filmmakers lose their passion.The message comes a bit too late and suddenly in the story. The film turns into a morality tale that wants to provide us with a sappy destination. The filmmakers might as well stop everything appear on screen and say now audience the moral of the story is We understand the theme but it's too instantaneous. The personal discovery for Chris' must be gradual.Fortunately all of this happens in the last twentyfive minutes of the film hardly enough to completely destroy an entire eightyfive minutes of a reasonably good feature. Rock Star is not a great moviesee Almost Famous if you want a remarkable film about rock and rollbut for Marky Mark it's a turning point in his career.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been looking forward to the release of this movie since I first heard the concept two years ago and I was not disappointed.  I won't bother summarizing the story since everyone else has but I will say that it was just plain entertaining throughout.  The performances were great as was the music and the main characters were likeable.My only complaints are 1 the story was definitely lacking the movie wrapped up very abruptly in fact the writing became pretty lax in the second half as though the writers weren't sure what to do with the plot. Since the plot wasn't nearly as important as the music and the action this didn't really affect the entertainment value of the film so this is not as major a complaint as it would seem.2 This is really nitpicky but the music that the characters in the movie were listening to was sometimes dated after 1985 when the movie was set. INXS' Devil Inside was from 1987 and ACDC's Are You Ready was from 1990 among other mistakes.  This bothers me a bit since they obviously went to lengths to make a good period piece they could have checked the copyright date on these songs to make sure they were 1985 or earlier.  Again not a big deal.Oh I thought of something else that was strange.  The Steel Dragon band members were supposed to be English but for some reason Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson and Ozzy guitarist Zakk Wylde played band members and they each had a couple of speaking lines in AMERICAN accents.  That was kind of lazy also but it was still cool to see actual musicians playing musicians so I will forgive that as well.I could probably nitpick all day but I don't want to give the impression that this wasn't a super entertaining movie.  I will probably buy the DVD when it comes out and I will certainly buy the soundtrack CD simply for the six Steel Dragon songs some of which were sung by the singer from the band Steelheart if you remember them!.  The highlight of the film was possibly a great outtake where Mark Wahlberg is lipsynching to a rock song on stage and suddenly someone plays Good Vibrations by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch.  The surprised look of Mark's face is priceless.  Classic rock and roll flick! Score 810 due to extreme entertainment".

The performances were great as was the music and the main characters were likeable.My only complaints are 1 the story was definitely lacking the movie wrapped up very abruptly in fact the writing became pretty lax in the second half as though the writers weren't sure what to do with the plot. Since the plot wasn't nearly as important as the music and the action this didn't really affect the entertainment value of the film so this is not as major a complaint as it would seem.2 This is really nitpicky but the music that the characters in the movie were listening to was sometimes dated after 1985 when the movie was set. INXS' Devil Inside was from 1987 and ACDC's Are You Ready was from 1990 among other mistakes.  This bothers me a bit since they obviously went to lengths to make a good period piece they could have checked the copyright date on these songs to make sure they were 1985 or earlier.  Again not a big deal.Oh I thought of something else that was strange.  The Steel Dragon band members were supposed to be English but for some reason Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson and Ozzy guitarist Zakk Wylde played band members and they each had a couple of speaking lines in AMERICAN accents.  That was kind of lazy also but it was still cool to see actual musicians playing musicians so I will forgive that as well.I could probably nitpick all day but I don't want to give the impression that this wasn't a super entertaining movie.  I will probably buy the DVD when it comes out and I will certainly buy the soundtrack CD simply for the six Steel Dragon songs some of which were sung by the singer from the band Steelheart if you remember them!.  The highlight of the film was possibly a great outtake where Mark Wahlberg is lipsynching to a rock song on stage and suddenly someone plays Good Vibrations by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch.  The surprised look of Mark's face is priceless.  Classic rock and roll flick! Score 810 due to extreme entertainment";

I totally did not believe that she would fall for a guy as goofy as ChrisIzzy. He reminded me of a big dumb puppy.Also the emphasis on the rockin' parents and the scenes of the mom's home daycare center made the movie seem too cute and cuddly...cute and cuddly do not fit in a movie about metal music!The use of real metal musicians as band members was interesting...but most of the musicians were bad actors. I know it won't happen but it'd be great if another movie centering on the rock music world could be made...this time with a better script. An updating of the Barbra StreisandKris Kristofferson movie A Star is Born' remade as A Rock Star is Born would work nicely.".

Wahlberg's Izzy acts as the film's host plays the everyman who gets to see his wish come true. His likable character quickly wins over the heart of the viewer who wants to see him succeed and gets the chance to give him the Metal goat horn handsign several times over.The only real complaint with the story is that the supporting cast namely the other members of the band were not fleshed out or even introduced properly. More interaction with these lifelong Rock musicians would have amplified and solidified Izzy's new surroundings. Naturally ROCK STAR is filled with great music. Rabin's score the Steel Dragon's original work and plenty of 80'sstyle Metal hits makes this soundtrack a musthave!

Where's the flash and excess of groups like Led Zeppelin or the old Motley Crue?  These were the hard rocking and even harder partying bands who brought the sex and drugs to rock n' roll.  Whether trashing hotel rooms engaging in debauchery that would make Caligula blush or caught up in a deluge of chemicals and booze there were no half measures.  Women wanted them and men wanted to be them.  Sometimes life is good.Life as a photocopier repairperson is less than riveting.  For Chris Cole the only way to cope with the daily tedium of toner and paper jams is in his alternate guise as the lead singer in a Steel Dragon tribute band.  Chris acts dresses and sounds like his idol hoping beyond all reason that one day he will join his idols.  Lucky for him rock and roll is a fickle business. As anyone who follows heavy metal or reads previews knows Rock Star is loosely based on the true story of salesmanturnedheavymetalfrontman Tim Ripper Owens who was tapped to fill in as lead singer for Judas Priest when Rob Halford left the band.  However the similarities end there  when Judas Priest pressed for increased creative control over the project the producers opted to distance themselves from the band and change the story and the exploits of  Steel Dragon are a composite of several apocryphal rock legends.  With strong performances in such films as Three Kings and The Perfect Storm Mark Wahlberg has proven that he is more than a living underwear mannequin.     Wahlberg brings the same combination of innocence and wideeyed wonderment to Chris that he displayed in Boogie Nights without displaying much else.  These qualities keep Chris' transformation from nobody to rock god from becoming a ridiculous parody. Keeping him grounded is Jennifer Aniston as his girlfriendmanager the one person who realizes his talents and for once Aniston breaks free of Rachel and delivers a decent performance.  The supporting cast drawn from real rockers and solid character actors gel well onscreen. Overall the story is well paced lighthearted the soundtrack is great  I felt my head moving back and forth more than once and you actually buy the group as a real band.  Definitely worth the price of admission and remember not to leave before the outtakes are finished.".

A great sound track and the songs of Steel Dragon had a good 80s rock vibe about them.The first hour of the film basically takes the story of what happened to Judas Priest in the early 90s they're singer leaves and they hire a new singer who was previously in a Judas Priest tribute band. However come the second half of the film they really mess things up with the plot. We are somehow supposed to believe that Mark Walhberg's character is obsessed with Steel Dragon and actually singing for them is the ultimate dream come true but then when he actually achieves this dream he is just gonna walk out on it so he can be with his girlfriend who doesn't even support his dream and suddenly get over the band.I'm sorry but I just don't buy it. To me it basically said that Heavy Metal is just a phase that you'll one day grow out of. Well any true fan will tell you that this music stays with you for life. To me this movie was not written for fans of the genre because they totally copped out on the ending.However I was pleasantly surprised with Mark Walhberg. I still think he is one of the worst actors in Hollywood today but I thought he handled the role very well. Also as I said before the soundtrack was also cool. It was also great to see Steel Dragon made up of actual musicians Zakk Wylde Ozzy Osbourne Black label Society Jeff Pilson Dokkenand Jason Bonham son of late Led Zepplin drummer John Bonham.A film of two halves so I'm gonna give 510 a wasted a potentially good film messed up by ridiculous plot holes.".

Also I liked how Jennifer Aniston as his girlfriend handled the situation.  Instead of being totally immature and jealous and breaking up with him in a screaming match with accusations flying everywhere she calmly tells him that this is his time and his dream and although she is sad that she doesn't have a bigger part in it she is content to go do something she wants to.Also I watched this movie on DVD and I would totally recommend this way to view it.  If you listen to the director commentary he tells you that there are artists from Slaughter Dokken Third Eye Blind and Verve Pipe among others that play the musicians including Jason Bonham.  Therefore these guys really contributed a lot of input as to whether the movie was realistic.  As for the guy who commented that there was no connection to Judas Priest the director said that the studded vest hat and collar seen at the Steel Dragon house was a direct reference to Judas Priest.  Also that the lead singer of Steel Dragon turned out to be gay.So if you like rock movies I would totally recommend this one!!".

Priest's guitarist sister saw him perform live liked what she saw and set up an audition. Tim sang 1 verse before he was given the job. Be reminded that this was after Priest has been without a singer for 8 years! He held it for 6 years before Rob Halford came back. During that time he did multiple tours and 2 albums. He also did the vocals for Iced Earth's latest album The Glorious Burden. It was originally a favor but eventually he joined the band. Another note Judas Priest was originally involved with making the movie but then backed out. And Owens never saw a dime for it either. Weird huh?".

So the result is some stupid lame movie full of sexdrug  rock'n'roll cliche's. I mean its so bad that I'm sure that the whole thing must be a pis take.Some of the scenes are so ludicrous it made me laugh. The scene where Mark Wahlburg is arguing on stage with his guitarist at a gig... In reality the music is so loud that theres no way you could hear what anyones saying even right next to you. But in this scene the music seems to quiet down while they talk on stage. Hahaha ...And when Whalburg takes so many drugs that he forgets what city he's in.. duh!! ..that happens without the drugs. But this is a Hollywood movie.. you have to have the singer gets messed up on drugs clich'e in there somewhere.And then theres the singer sees the light leaves evil hard rock band and forms happy acoustic band clich'e. No Hollywood movie is complete without a nice moralistic ending like this.If this movie is supposed to be loosely based on the Tim 'The Ripper' Owens story...how come Ripper Owens is still in Judas Priest and having a ball?? Sometimes reality doesn't quite cut it huh?.OK... Mark Whalburg is quite good ...considering he's been given a junk script to work with... But the acting looks forced from everyone else. It could have been a good movie if the guy had taken longer than 2 hours to write it.210".

The original idea of the script focuses on a young singer in the 80s leading a tribute band of one of the most famous hard rock bands of the period. He is not only playing their music to the note but also living the life of his idols. When his friends  in the tribute band expel him in search of some originality the destiny plays him a good turn and gets hired to replace the lead singer of the idols band.  A dream came true? Well almost. While starting to live the life of the famous including the drug and sex excesses of the rock scene of the 80s he will also have to face the problems in relationship with his supportive girlfriend and will be eventually need to answer questions about creativity and having a saying in the music of the band.I liked the film one of the reasons being that it is one of the first times that the life and music of the hard metal rock bands is shown in a realistic manner. Fans of the music genre will be satisfied by the soundtrack. The overall idea is original and the issues of how an artist lives his life and creates his art are being rendered in a sensible and balanced manner. Acting is quite good with Mark Wahlberg better than in most of the other action flics I saw him lately and Jennifer Aniston in tune with the nicegirlwhoknowsalotaboutlife role. More problematic is the ending which  is quite conventional and may disappoint.  It looks like the main character after quiting the big and famous band has found his own creative path. However in an  ironical twist the music he is playing in the club at the end is the worst in the whole movie! 810 on my personal scale. Worth seeing  however expect exposure to a high dose of metal. If you do not like this kind of music you may chose to avoid this film.".

Oh well....I loved this movieand would see it again and againbut I know that's purely based on my own personal tastesRock Star is a movie that will appeal to anyone who has experienced elements of the rock or hard rock lifestyle and wants to go down the road to nostalgia. It was a great time for metal heads. And it's nice to have a movie that effectively captures thatlong forgot by many nonrock fans. time effectively as I think that Rock Star has done. That is one of the film's strengths the concert footage. You will feel like your right there with them and how could any hard rock fan not love that? As far as setting the atmosphere Rock Star gets a 10 of 10. It also gets a 10 of 10 for pure entertainment. If you want a movie to just let yourself go and free flow into some great memories of good times past then this is the movie for you. It is also the reason why I loved this movie so.But it isn't a great movie. I understand that and were it my actual job to review movies professionally I'd probably have to be a bit hard on this one. The problem with Rock star is the character development.What is wrong with the character development is this there isn't any. None. The movie has certain scenesfew and far between but they ARE therethat DO touch on greatnessWARNING BRIEF SCENE SPOILERS 3 examples 1when Izzy makes his debut on stageincluding the fall he takes2The first after show party with EmilyAnniston and Izzy.3Backtracking a littleIn the beginning when the original lead singer is casually dismissedfiredthe whole business as usual tone sets the stage for what's to come. It's played very effectively.But the problem is nothing ever does come. There is little to no character development of anyone in this movie peoples' persona's are merely touched on but never fully explored. I don't think that's the fault of the actorsactressesparticularly Anniston who tries hard they just are not given much to work with. It's just that the script was weak and lacked the ability to go beyond the formula feel into true movie depth. Rock star was so sugarcoated at timesincluding towards the end it was almost ridiculous. And  though those scenes I mentioned WERE outstanding and very believable sadly much else in the movie wasn't.Another reviewer mentioned the lack of buildup towards the end and I agree but there was actually a lack of buildup about ANYTHING. WHY does Izzy leave at the end? Because he misses his girlfriend and the band won't let him write songs? It tests the limits of believability. And frankly the end was just corny. Made no sense and had no reality to it at all.Watching this it's almost like watching a movie where the makers of it said OK this happens here and then this happens and then this etc etc etc. By the end it's no longer a movie about a boy who's dream came true it's just another thickly formulated love story. And you wonder why so much detail is left out....I hope I'm not being to hard on Rock Star because I truly loved itbut not for the right reasons. I would have liked to love this as a great movie about the highs and lows of rock fame. Instead I loved it for it's 80's period feel the clothes the hair the lights the life.... Although many others loved it to I suspect most are people who lived the life of a rock fan like I did or some who play. I'd have liked to see the movie cross over and just be respected for being a good well told movie instead of a clich. I think one of the problems was the length. I myself hate over long films but this was one that really should have been longer if a movie is done really right the length is not even feltthere is just to much to the story for it to be as short as it wasthat's one reason why there doesn't seem to be much development of either the story or the human beings portrayed in the movie.Soto wind downthis is a movie you can greatly get into but not a great movie. See it for fun. See it for entertainment. See it to go back to that great great space in time when metal wasn't just a part of life it WAS lifeand for those non rock fanssee it to get a little glimpse into a life that meant and still means so much to so many of us.".

Originally titled Metal God this movie could have been something great. Instead someone in an office somewhere who knows little to nothing about metal music decided to water it down. From the title change of Metal God to the 'safe' middle of the road 'Rock Star' to the lame soundtrack this movie plays out badly. Having spent most of my life in a professional metal band I was really looking forward to seeing this I was very let down by several points of the film. The soundtrack is very NOT metal for one and the ending of the movie is lame as well. The movie does have a few bright spots in the writing and acting but as a whole it fails in the end because...1A movie based on a metal band should have a metal soundtrack. 2There is NOTHING metal about Marky Mark or Jennifer Aniston. If Bon Jovi Warrant Def Leppard and Poison are your idea of 'heavy metal' go see this movie. If Iron Maiden Judas Priest Dio  Black Sabbath are your idea of metal see this movie for a good laugh.".

Originally titled Metal God this movie could have been something great. Instead someone in an office somewhere who knows little to nothing about metal music decided to water it down. From the title change of Metal God to the 'safe' middle of the road 'Rock Star' to the lame soundtrack this movie plays out badly. Having spent most of my life in a professional metal band I was really looking forward to seeing this I was very let down by several points of the film. The soundtrack is very NOT metal for one and the ending of the movie is lame as well. The movie does have a few bright spots in the writing and acting but as a whole it fails in the end because...1A movie based on a metal band should have a metal soundtrack. 2There is NOTHING metal about Marky Mark or Jennifer Aniston. If Bon Jovi Warrant Def Leppard and Poison are your idea of 'heavy metal' go see this movie. If Iron Maiden Judas Priest Dio  Black Sabbath are your idea of metal see this movie for a good laugh.";

No I'm going to go higher and to speak my mind about the horrible facts who makes this to be one of the worst insults to whatever heavy metal have inspired in its more than 40 years of life.1. The title. If the plot of the film consists in the story of a METAL fan singer who sings in a METAL band who pays tribute to another METAL band called Steel Dragon and one day he's giving the opportunity to front the latter band why on earth have this movie been called Rock Star?. Rock stars are Mick Jagger Little Richard Chuck Berry and they are not that metal at all!. 2. The music. Is Bon Jovi metal? no. Is INXS metal? no. Enough said. 3. The lead actress. When you know beforehand that the movie is going to portrait 80's metal life style one with even a certain amount of knowledge about that era could foresee that the lead female actress is going to be someone named Doro Pesch Warlock's singer or even Lita Ford. Nop here we have Rachel from that annoying TV sitcom. 4. Steel Dragon. If this movie is based loosely on Tim Owens'life then Steel Dragon is the fictional equivalent of Judas Priest. Mmm not likely. Though made up of great musicians Zakk Wylder Jeff Pilson and Jason BonhamSteel Dragon's image and music is nowhere heavier or good as Priest's. I see them as a slighter heavy version of Motley Crue when they played pop metal. 5. The main protagonist. Marky Mark it's an outsider here. I think Vanilla Ice could have done a better effort. It's like doing a film about the life of Bob Marley and giving the main role to Adam Sandler who would suck even if he decides to play himself in a movie about his life. 6. The end. If you think this movie is inconsistent then don't watch the end. I'll tell you one word Seattle. Can you make the associations?.In the end Rock Star is not good or bad. It's not entertaining or depressing. It's just a travesty to the Metal genre the Metal community its bands and fans alike.".

It becomes more dramatic as each of the characters face their own tragedies. Each character gets just enough screen time and you care about what happens to each of them. Even though there are 9 characters we have to learn and care about within just two hours Toshiaki Toyoda pulls it off brilliantly.After I saw Blue Spring I was hoping the soundtrack would be at least a little bit as good as it was in that film. I got my wish because the soundtrack to 9 Souls was also incredible. The music used in each scene more specifically the more dramatic ones is just simply wonderful. I loved every second of it.I wasn't sure whether or not I wanted to see another Toshiaki Toyoda film Pornostar but after I saw this I'm going to. Definitely. Also because I read the plot for it and I think it sounds really good. I'm looking forward to it. On the R1 DVD of 9 Souls there are two interviews with Toyoda.

	schema:reviewBody "Finally! Third time lucky. This film has been always been on my mind but my first viewing I forgot about it and only caught the second half of the film. Then only a couple months later I had the my second chance of watching of it so I decided I would record it. Only to discover that my timer went off late and again I missed the first half of the flick. I wasn't going to allow that to happen again. So when it came on TV again I thought bugger it I'll wait until it comes on then I will record it. And it was a good choice. I would have just watched the film but they always put on weeknights around midnight. After discovering a hole in their crowded cell nine prisoners escape their confinement to track down the key of the universe which a fellow prisoner known as the Counterfeit King said he had hidden. They think that this key could be an opening for a hidden loot of counterfeit bills. On this journey they naturally see this as an opportunity to pick up their lives before they were gaoled. Although things don't turn out the way that they intended to with most of the criminals plans going astray. 9 Souls is an perky spiritual journey from Japanese director Toshiaki Toyada which flung it's viewers into a film of two totally different halves. The first half of the story plays out more like a psychical comedy with the criminals bonds and the situations they find themselves being the selling point but all that makes way to a moralistic and consequence dramapacked second half where the real trouble begins with some quite nasty and bloody moments replacing the goofball tone it started off with. While the first half is quite amusing with its on the road screwball doodling and offbeat banter. But it's really the genuinely haunting latter half with it's peculiar turn of events that hit you so hard with some surprising touches that make you really sympathise for these very human characters. Even though they are not truly innocent from their crimes you just become entrenched by these fleshout characters in the first half that when you see them spiral into their downfall you know it's an effective drama when you become shellshocked in the dramatic change. The nine characters get enough screen time to truly understand their personal story and what weakness would eventually bring them down. The way the plot works out is that Michiru and Torakichi are the lead characters and we mostly see it from their perspectives. The escapism tale is an unquestionably engaging character study that's clear in it's goal and puts to you many questions on society and the path you choice to take to escape life and free yourself from these restraints. While the symbolic story is full of clarity and vividly told. The visual element doesn't go by unnoticed because there's just a dreamy and trancelike vibe that channels itself into the unique atmosphere. What HIGHLY contributed to that factor and gave the film a lift was the sweepingly moody instrumental rock soundtrack. The mellow atmospheric gel it was able to create in many scenes left me rather breathless with the everlasting emotions it was able to provoke. Simply beautiful and downright powerful control on that front. The pacing for such an long film  2 hours  seems to breeze by and editing is swiftly done because we are just so wrapped up in it all. The hypnotic photography is crisp in detail. While the performances by the cast as a odd bunch of criminals are that of high quality with each one providing enough personality and features to separate themselves. I found 9 Souls to be a pleasing and quite an amazing surreal film that stirs up the emotions and then it smacks you with an almighty wallop when it changes direction. Highly recommended.".

The visual element doesn't go by unnoticed because there's just a dreamy and trancelike vibe that channels itself into the unique atmosphere. What HIGHLY contributed to that factor and gave the film a lift was the sweepingly moody instrumental rock soundtrack. The mellow atmospheric gel it was able to create in many scenes left me rather breathless with the everlasting emotions it was able to provoke. Simply beautiful and downright powerful control on that front. The pacing for such an long film  2 hours  seems to breeze by and editing is swiftly done because we are just so wrapped up in it all. The hypnotic photography is crisp in detail. While the performances by the cast as a odd bunch of criminals are that of high quality with each one providing enough personality and features to separate themselves. I found 9 Souls to be a pleasing and quite an amazing surreal film that stirs up the emotions and then it smacks you with an almighty wallop when it changes direction. Highly recommended.";

Escaping from the sewage the group of 9 souls take advantage of their new found freedom and head for civilization. What soon follows is not surprising. Complete mayhem and terror follow in their wake. It seems that each has some unfinished business to take care of.Loosely based on The Great Escape 9 SOULS is by far in the top 5 best films I've seen this year. Running at right around 2 hours 9 SOULS will deliver a story so powerful it'll literally leave you breathless. The beautiful yet subtle use of the rolling country sides adds the realism that is expected from this story. The vision of director Toshiaki Toyoda Blue Spring Porno Star is completely mind boggling as he implements a sense of pity towards the characters. As quickly as each character grasps their dream it's as quick as it's torn from them. Now all responsibility of the success of this film should not fall solely on the shoulders of the director yet props must go to the actors as well. This film was full of excellent acting from top to bottom. Ryuhei Matsuda the son of Miyuki Matsuda of Audition delivers a stellar performance and seems to bring some of his mothers eeriness to the screen.I must give props to Artsmagic DVD as well. This is the 6th film of theirs I've seen now and they seem to get better and better each DVD. The sound quality is perfect and the picture clean and crisp. It's very annoying trying to watch a film that is too dark in transfer so the discs from theses cats are nice.Bottom line is this film will soon receive masterpiece status by viewers' world wide. Keep an eye out in 2005 for 9 SOULS it's really amazing film to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "This 2002 Japanese film is the third feature film showcased in the inaugural Singapore Fantastic Film Festival The first two being Kontroll and Immortel which I should be able to watch by the end of the fest.9 Souls is at times a complex movie and at times one which has a simple tale to tell. It blurs and crosses the line so often it makes it difficult to try and classify its genre  part gore part comedy part social commentary.The title refers to 9 prisoners who are introduced in more detail during their escape from prison in a very creative introduction by the way ranging from murderers to a porn king from a juvenile delinquent to a vertically challenged escape artist. It turns into part comedy once they escape and have to find the means and substinence to help keep themselves alive in a strange new world.Prior to their escape their world is their prison cell rudely interrupted by a tenth crazed prisoner a counterfeit king who leaks out the secret to the whereabouts of his stash. With this bit of information they embark on a quest to recover this lost promise of treasure before going their separate ways.Which forms the second half of the movie. Throughout the first half we are exposed to the dreams and hopes of these escape convicts. Being locked up for some time they each have a secret desire to either reunite with their loved one or have plans to live a better life. At some point you will ponder if it was wise of them to each seek their dream knowing its dire consequences or would rather choose to stick together in their new found family.Thoughts on second chances in life also crosses your mind if these serious crime offenders deserve another break in life or are forever condemned in the eyes of society for their one moment of folly which has kept them locked up.The pacing of the film is at times choppy and you'd have scenes that come out of the blue like crossdressing as a disguise. I heard quite a number of people around me give the hmm... where did that come from comment.The soundtrack is kept simple to a constantly played guitar tune which in scenes of peace are kept soft and in scenes of angst being played to a crescendo. I find this effective in conveying emotions in the film without the need of a bloated soundtrack.Rated R21 here for its subject content and scenes of gore which is not really shown on screen this film is recommended for those who seek a different film offering which is what this film fest is striving to achieve.".

Nine convicts escape a prison after the tenth one goes crazy and tells them where the treasure is.The first half has a lot of slapstick some of it very broad while the second half is a character driven descent into fantasy and melancholy.The two halves simply don't mix. Individual scenes do work very well The guys crashing a friends house who has a new Filipino bride is hilarious While a later scene with the big guy working in the restaurant tugs at the heartstrings. They simply don't mesh with each other.The movie as well is missing entire setups. One scene shows the guys desperately looking for change under a deserted vending machine to buy a snack. The very next scene has the whole crew in drag sitting down in a restaurant. Where did they get the dresses and wigs? The crew includes both the big guy and a midget How did they get all the clothes and money to buy the meal? And most puzzling is why are they in drag? They are clearly guys in drag and lets face it is there anything more memorable to witnesses than a big guy and a dwarf eating a meal dressed as women? I mention the big guy and the dwarf because besides the old guy everyone else seems to blend into each other. In fact they wear matching white jumpsuits throughout most of the movie The movie has very little character development in the first half and as a result the second half really lacks an emotional punch. As we are often trying to figure out who is who in their individual payoff scenes.Speaking of a drag the second half has all those wonderful sweeping camera shots and big emotional moments and great symbolism that makes a great film. It is also excruciatingly slow which makes for a boring movie.9 Souls is a big disappointment the reviews gush about a great film and it's in there somewhere good luck finding it yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Heaven's Gate on its opening week nearly twenty years ago. Tickets were sold in advance based on the great anticipation of seeing Cimino's long in the making follow up to his 1978 masterpiece The Deerhunter. The reviews came in and critics trashed the film with vehemence. An influential New York film critic led the way and most critics followed suit and the 3hr. 40min. film was pulled from distribution. United Artists had Cimino shorten the film by about an hour and it was rereleased many months later to equally horrible reviews and to dismal business. The film at that time cost about 40 million dollars now considered low budget making it one of the most expensive in history and Cimino had free rein on the project with endless retakes despite it being only his third film. The Deerhunter had also received a negative backlash based on a perceived political ideology which was not popular. I mention all this to present a possible bias building up against Cimino.                        At the time I thought the film was very good and when I saw the shorter version it was still very good only less so. The film showed up again in a museum in the early 1990's. They were supposed to show the long version but they could not find an existing print. Nevertheless seeing the film years later I now thought Heaven's Gate was a masterpiece. Finally the long version started to appear in a few select cities I got to see it recently and it was well worth the wait. Heaven's Gate begins with the graduation ceremony at Harvard University. Two of the graduates are Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt and we some of the flaws in their characters early on. Despite the mandate Joseph Cotton gives in his speech to the graduating class to use their education to enlighten and improve their country many of the graduates behave as if they are part of an elite country club. The film flashes ahead 20 years to Johnson County in Wyoming. A cattle company called the Stockholders Association has hired poor people to shoot 125 poor immigrants claiming they are cattle thieves. Kristofferson sides with the immigrants while John Hurt is part of the Association. Although Hurt is totally against this insane action he is too ineffectual a character to do anything about it.                             A massacre takes place but the immigrants do well in defending themselves. A United States Cavalry comes to the rescue of the Association  to allegedly arrest them after most of the damage has been done when in fact they sanctioned the mass killing. Kristofferson also suffers a great personal loss and the film ends with him years later as part of the elite class of his Harvard days married bored on a yacht living but dead on the inside.This is a very complex film which is brilliant in every department such as it's themes structure direction cinematography writing music editing set designs and acting.   Kristofferson Walken Hurt Huppert Dourif Bridges Waterston and Cotton are all excellent portraying very complex characters. Some of the major complaints I read about this film state that is ugly to look at incoherent too long that the characters make no sense and that the words are often unintelligible.             In its defense Heaven's Gate has the look of photographs of that period just as McCabe  Mrs. Miller did. Some of the scenes are smoky looking to suggest the industrial revolution or sometimes horses wagons people are passing by from all sides creating a sense of reality.The critic who called it one of the ugliest movies ever made likes to use his thumbs a lot. But in spite of all that the composition of each frame and the cinematography are impeccable.                                                     The film makes a great deal of sense if you pay attention to it.  Everything is not spelled out for the viewer and one has to observe closely to understand the motivations of the characters or its themes. As to its length it is a beautifully structured piece  at times moving poetic exhilarating or devastating with virtually one great scene following another. At times some of the words are unintelligible especially in some of the scenes bustling with activity. But one could understand such a cinematic film as this through its use of film language the glances between characters or their actions. One day soon this film should be rereleased in its full length so that people and critics could give it a second chance. Do not let Michael Cimino become another Orson Welles under appreciated in his lifetime and not able to make the  kinds of great films he is capable of making.".

I seriously dont think that the people who hated Heavens Gate really understood it. Heavens Gate in its uncut form much like The Deer Hunter shows the gross differences of living an insecure and dangerous life like the immigrants and Averil in Wyoming and living in comfort and privilege like the settled Americans in Wyoming and Averil in the prologue and epilogue. Living a hard life is painful but it can also be invigorating as opposed to the dull life Averil leads in the epilogue. Also as Michael Cimino took great pains to make the picture historically accurate  it is fascinating as a document of and maybe indictment of American life in Old West Wyoming. The dialogue is often genuinely clever and emotional. Combined with great music and cinematography the movie works like a truly poetic work of art. Granted Heavens Gate with its refusal to patronize the viewer is not for all tastes. However Hollywood turns out so much commercial dreck each year which is so much easier to dismiss as mindless eye candy even when an example of it becomes a blockbuster that Gate and Cimino really do deserve more respect.  All people should see the uncut version at least once and then they should make up their own mind.".

	schema:headline " As the good book says many are called but few are chosen... and most are damned.";
	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this film when released in 1980. From other sources I've learnt that the only release of the 219minute cut was in New York City after which it was severely cut to 149 minutes. So I guess I saw the shorter version first which at the time I thought was a very interesting antiWestern if a trifle confusing...So it was with even more interest that I finally obtained a DVD of the fulllength version. I'm glad I did because this second viewing has confirmed for me that the movie is a true classic and the critical vitriol poured on Michael Cimino was unwarranted to say the very least.Yes it's a long movie but so have been many others. For example Once upon a time in America 1984 at 227 minutes Cleopatra 1963 at 320 minutes The Ten Commandments 1956 at 220 minutes Spartacus restored version 1960 at 198 minutes Gone with the Wind 1939 at 222 minutes and others. So it can't be the fact of running time that made so many froth at the mouth way back when Heaven's Gate came on the scene.But note this all of those above movies have everything to do with reinforcing myths about history and heroes.Not so Heaven's Gate in this narrative the American West is shown in all its grim and unrelenting harshness injustice and poverty. And that's probably the first reason why so many disliked this film it laid out the circumstances of the Johnson County War of 1892 in Wyoming showing how the Wyoming Stock Growers Association hired 50 assassins to hunt down and murder a large group of European immigrants accused of cattle rustling and all with the assistance and conniving of authorities right up to the President of the United States. For an essay on that war with the background and what happened there is a link at Wikipedia under Johnson County War.Very few like to be reminded of the really dirty periods in their country's history and which fly in the face of what the country is supposed to be. Had it been a documentary it would have been barely palatable for most as entertainment it was almost bound to fail commercially and be torn to shreds by the shrill and infamous.Leaving aside the sociopolitical diatribe for a moment that Cimino launched herein what about the narrative  the story of the three main characters? Well it probably wasn't unusual for men of that time to fall for a local prostitute just as it's probably not unusual now. It's a fairly standard love triangle whereby Ella must choose between the two men and ultimately decides upon the younger man Nathan who although not above resorting to coldblooded murder when it suits him shows more spirit and commitment than the older James or Jim as most people in the film say. For some that part of the story threads too slowly perhaps in the context of the wider narrative about the war however it is I think entirely appropriate.And that war is depicted graphically viciously and cruelly with scenes of carnage that are exquisitely staged and edited flawlessly  although in the final massacre between the Association and the immigrants I'm certain that some scenes of wagons blowing apart are repeated. A minor point and perhaps brought about when the 219minute cut was restored? Any way you look at it though it hits you in the face with the noise dust chaos and confusion of war...Which brings me to another criticism by others the noise and dust is such that it's often difficult to hear the dialog and even see clearly what is happening. I'll admit that I found that to be a trifle annoying at first even backtracking to replay parts to try to catch the image or the words  until I realized that really wasn't necessary if you accept the director's intent life is chaotic it is difficult to hear and see in crowded situations and in war it's the sine qua non of this miseenscene. In short it's as though you truly are present in and within the scenes...And what of the title? From Shakespeare it refers to a figurative nearness to God and so if you equate God with the natural world the stunning scenery that pervades the movie  and it is stunning hauntingly equal to that of David Lean's Doctor Zhivago 1965  is a useful metaphor. I tend to think however that Cimino had something more to say namely the idea that the brave immigrants  the Godfearing salt of the earth  were denied entry to heaven on earth and the freedom to build a life for themselves in the land that espouses to be freedom's champion.Was that Cimino's intent  to gut the myth of the American West? To show how in America only the rich get rich while the poor are massacred one way or another throughout history? Is that anything new? Not really as we all know. Where it really hurt however is in showing how America was not and by implication is not the land of the free and the home of the brave. Instead after absorbing this narrative we are left with an impression that the underpinnings of America have more to do with a land of dispossessed slaves and a home for knaves...".

	onyx:emotionText "I first saw this film when released in 1980. From other sources I've learnt that the only release of the 219minute cut was in New York City after which it was severely cut to 149 minutes. So I guess I saw the shorter version first which at the time I thought was a very interesting antiWestern if a trifle confusing...So it was with even more interest that I finally obtained a DVD of the fulllength version. I'm glad I did because this second viewing has confirmed for me that the movie is a true classic and the critical vitriol poured on Michael Cimino was unwarranted to say the very least.Yes it's a long movie but so have been many others. For example Once upon a time in America 1984 at 227 minutes Cleopatra 1963 at 320 minutes The Ten Commandments 1956 at 220 minutes Spartacus restored version 1960 at 198 minutes Gone with the Wind 1939 at 222 minutes and others.

	schema:reviewBody "'Heaven's Gate' is not a masterpiece which apparently was what it needed to be upon first release to justify its great cost and more importantly the continued uneasy reliance of Hollywood on the Auteur model of filmmaking. Yet 'Heaven's Gate' seen today at last on DVD in a cut of 229 minutes is a superb film. It is a touch lethargic in pace. But at least it is paced. Quite apart from the incompetence of construction that marks many films today there have been many films which deliberate in form have been severely damaged by being hacked down with no care for rhythm so the films become shapeless and confusing. Beyond this the criticisms leveled at the film have become in retrospect quite lame. If the good guys and bad guys are too obviously pronounced for a serious film and yes Sam Waterston's mustachioed furclad villain is comicopera and not in the multileveled manner of Bill The Butcher from 'Gangs of New York' and yes the townsfolk do seem a touch 'Fiddler On The Roof' on occasions then a few dozen serious films made since then including 'Titanic' and the graceless 'Cold Mountain' which bears certain similarities and is a notable failure in convincing qualities compared to this film can be castigated for exactly the same reason. Also despite accusations the film has a plot quite a wellessayed plot at that. It simply does not bow to standardform 'epic' quality by providing Titan heroes rafts of subplots and confusion. It experiments with telling in a manner more like much smaller modest films by carefullycaught moments of character interaction and welltextured pageantlike explosions of communal action as with the opening at Harvard and most specially the wonderful scene where the Johnson County folk following the lead of a brilliantly physical fiddler make celebration on rollerskates.'The Deer Hunter' was a critical and commercial success but abandoned the first half's inspired mosaiclike accumulation of detail and I think in a manner similar to criticism of Robert Penn Warren's novel 'All The King's Men' and its dictionary of Jacobean stunts if Cimino had not had such a strong grasp of the conventions of Hollywood epics he might have made a special rare work of art based in honest visualisation of people within their milieu. In contrast 'Heaven's Gate' succeeds in screwing its narrative momentum and tension upwards in a slowly expanding arc until the finale explodes whilst not abandoning the mosaic approach.The central romantic triangle for instance resists standard inflections a decent intelligent but psychically defeated man James Averill Kris Kristofferson competes with a hotshot but identitychallenged young gunman Nate Champion Christopher Walken for the hand of a young Madame Ella Watson Isabelle Huppert there is no selfconscious bedhopping no slaps in the face recriminations or typical sadsack moments but more a sad and distanced decision by Ella to choose the younger man whom she loves less because he is ready to make the commitment. Ella emerges as the film's true hero Huppert's performance though initially awkward is really quite excellent balancing a dewy emotionalism with a hardhammered spirit attempting first to rescue Nate and then mustering the resistance party of immigrants into an enterprising defence. Subsequently Averill is stung into action as friends die. Indeed in the process of overcoming so many traps of clich and style 'Heaven's Gate' successfully and willfully throws off the defeated outsiderheroes grace note of so many '70s Westerns and portrays an eventual vigorous cheertheheroes rallying to a compromised but still relished victory. The social conflict of so many '70s Westerns at last hardens into a fullyfledged war where capital attempts a crushing final victory over the miscreants who stand in their way suddenly they find a massed and morepowerful people's army led by the man who played the thoroughlydestroyed Billy the Kid a decade before. This is what led the film to be described as the first Marxist Western but really it simply deflowers a theme of the genre extant well before the '60s. Such various and classic oldschool works as William Wyler's 'The Westerner' and even 'Shane' tell awfully similar stories. It is simply here that the romantic myth of the gunslinger has been replaced by the romantic myth of the people's revolt. In a spectacular exiting but realistic and thus chaotic finale the marauding Cattlemen's encampment is attacked ringed by dust clouds punctuated by fallen horses writhing bodies and gunfire. Averill puts his classical education to work finally by stealing a Roman trick and bringing the Cattlemen to the brink of annihilation before they are rescued by the Cavalry another distinctly seditious touch but surely not so offensive after 'Little Big Man's unrelenting depiction of Native American massacres. Really it's hard to think of a more heroically American vision of grassroots resistance. The film's only real dead spot stands as an unnecessary coda indicating Averill's eventual relapse a rather potted piece of tragedy. Despite then certain failings and a slow midsection 'Heaven's Gate' is a supreme piece of work a genuine attempt to create a contemporary Western and a new kind of epic. If one has to still join the chorus that reckons Cimino was absurd in his behaviour on set and expenditure it is regretfully. When today flops like 'The Adventures of Pluto Nash' and 'K19  The Widowmaker' see nearly a hundred million dollars sink down the drain and yet a tag of infamy still hangs on this film one ponders what exactly its grim death signified. The attempt at original style the bawdy sexuality the very hardwon sense of detail the breathtaking rigor of the filmmaking and what is being filmed all throw into contrast what is sorely lacking in so much contemporary Hollywood product.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been a fan of Heaven's Gate since its first release. I've seen it at least halfadozen times and have long thought of it as a masterpiece. So it was with excitement and a sense of anticipation that I took myself off to see the restored director's cut.To my surprise I was disappointed on seeing it again and have since revised my estimation of the film. Heaven's Gate touches upon greatness in parts but overall lacks the thematic and narrative consistency and the passionate urgency characteristic of a truly great film.Firstly two technical problems The sound quality is diffuse throughout the film verging on inaudibility at times. Some of this perhaps is intentional  a way to mimic the chaos and confusion of history as it is unfolding. But at key points one is unable to register what it is the characters are saying.The cinematography is similarly diffuse. The images lack sharpness and particularity of detail. The result is a certain graininess and lack of pictorial sharpness which succeeds in blurring foreground and background.Structurally the narrative is offkey throughout as if Cimino can't quite make up his mind as to the effect he is after. He wanted an epic for sure. But a pastoral or dramatic epic? The film sits uneasily and unconvincingly between styles and perhaps even genres. At times it reminded me of Terrence Malick's 'Days of Heaven' or even 'Elvira Madigan' in its languid pace and elegant scene painting. At other times it threatens to turn into a robust 'western' more akin to 'The Wild Bunch'. In fact the latter film offers an instructive reference point for an assessment of 'Heaven's Gate' as it shares the same period concern and employs a similar tone of ambivalent nostalgia for a darker yet more heroic America. This structural and thematic uncertainty isn't helped by the poorquality script which often sounds forced and jarring to the ear. The result is an inauthentic sense of period speech. The neargreatness of Heaven's Gate resides in its set pieces. The roller skating sequence in particular is astoundingly beautiful one of the most evocative scenes ever put to film.Another set piece which works very well in terms of unifying theme mood and setting occurs when Kristofferson and Huppert go riding in the new rig to the lake and she washes herself while he naps in the shade. The languid pacing evocative music and monumental scenery combine in this scene to convincingly portray the love story which might just lie at the heart of the film  and which could have been its saving grace if pursued more convincingly.Some critics have complained about the length of the film. This in itself doesn't bother me. A good film can't be long enough. The restored minutes are critical in restoring the motivation and characterization absent from the cut version and they are full of pictorial interest.Perhaps the chief glory of Heaven's Gate lies in the achingly evocative soundtrack. The repeated waltz motif and its different scorings throughoutfull band guitar solo fiddle etclends a haunting quality to the foreground action and establishes a thematic consistency lacking in the narrative itself.Despite its obvious flaws most notably the absence of a compelling narrative there is a sense of grandeur about the film. One leaves the cinema with a rueful sense of missed greatness and a wish that Cimino could revisit the film with the wisdom of time and hindsight to put right what is so badly amiss.".

I was stunned and pleased to see that 22.5 of those voting at IMDB rate this movie a 10 as do I.  A recent book the Worst Movies of All Time includes Heaven's Gate.  Through it's production and release it was vilified as no movie since Cleopatra almost twenty years before.   At one time it was considered the most expensive overbudget movie of all time surpassing even Cleopatra.  It was blamed for the downfall of its studio United Artists until everyone finally saw all the studios were falling. Michael Cimino fresh from his glory with the Deer Hunter was hated and despised for his success and movie making excess but clearly that was petty jealousy at its worst.     Cimino ended up fashioning one of the great expositions of the American experience.  This film is not to be missed but any serious student of American filmmaking.".

	schema:reviewBody "Few films have been as vilified as Heaven's Gate. It has gone down in history as the film which bankrupted a studio and wrecked the career of its director who only three years earlier had made the Oscarwinning The Deer Hunter. It contributed to the decline of the Western as a genre although it was far from being the only cause. And played a large part in bringing to an end the reign of the Hollywood auteur a reign which had begun in the late sixties and continued throughout the seventies although again there were other causes. Recently Joe Queenan the film critic of The Guardian named it as the worst film ever made.Was he serious? Could Cimino really have gone from Oscarwinning whizzkid to Ed Wood in just three short years? The answer is no. Certainly the decision to make Heaven's Gate must rank among the worst business decisions ever made but critics should beware of judging a film solely on its profitandloss account.The film is set in Wyoming in the 1890s although actually shot in the neighbouring state of Montana. It is based although it takes many liberties with the facts upon the Johnson County War a historical conflict over grazing rights between large ranchers and small farmers many of them European immigrants. The film's main characters are named Frank Canton Nathan Champion James Averill and Ella Watson real individuals with these names played a part in the conflict although in each case this was not the same part as they play in the film.In the film Canton is the leader of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association which represents the interests of the big ranchers. The ranchers detest the small farmers whom they accuse of stealing their cattle and take the law into their own hands. They draw up a death list of 125 names and recruit an army of hired gunmen who will receive a bounty for every person on the list killed. Averill is an idealistic Harvardeducated Sheriff who sides with the immigrants Champion a hired enforcer for the ranchers who comes to doubt what he is doing. Ella is the madam of the local brothel and also the lover of both Averill and Champion. In the film Ella is obviously French but keeps the AngloSaxon surname of her reallife namesake who was actually Canadian.When it comes to artistic merits of the film I should point out that I have only seen the shorter 2hour version which was originally shown in cinemas and is the version normally seen on British television I have not seen Cimino's director's cut which runs to more than 3 hours. Certainly Heaven's Gate has its faults. The dialogue is not always audible and the plot sometimes difficult to follow. At times it can seem very slow paced especially as the action is often slowed down by big setpieces such as the opening Harvard graduation scene actually filmed in Oxford or the rollerskating sequence which are visually spectacular but do little to advance the story.These however are faults which the film shares with The Deer Hunter and I find it difficult to understand why the later film should have been so reviled by the critics when the earlier one took Best Picture. The Deer Hunter was perhaps fortunate in that its Vietnam War theme caught the mood of the American public at the time whereas Westerns had already started to decline in popularity in the late seventies. Possibly Heaven's Gate's leftwing political slant its sympathies are very much with the with the little man against big business alienated more conservative audiences. 1980 was after all the year which first saw Ronald Reagan elected to the Presidency.Heaven's Gate however also has its virtues as indeed does The Deer Hunter and to my mind these outweigh its faults. Cimino was a director for whom the pictorial qualities of a film were as important as its narrative ones and as in the earlier film he shows here that he has a good eye for a striking visual image the opening shots of the mistshrouded university buildings a train pulling into a frosty station the barn dance the soaring Rocky Mountains. The film borrows elements from a number of famous Westerns the grand scale of its battle sequences recalls Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch its lush photography and warm tones are reminiscent of Malick's Days of Heaven and Altman's McCabe and Mrs Miller. In that latter film too the main female character is a brothel madam.Perhaps the film's most interesting feature is the way in which Cimino gives a new slant to old Western themes. Averill is essentially a similar character to Shane or Eastwood's High Plains Drifter the outsider who tries to help a community in trouble. The scene where the small farmers who have decided to fight back against their oppressors encircle the ranchers and their private army is strongly reminiscent of all those Westerns where the settlers are encircled by hostile Indians and saved at the last minute by the arrival of the cavalry. The difference is that Averill is defending the community not against outlaws but against an oppressive Establishment and the cavalry in this film ride to the rescue of the bad guys not of the heroes. Heaven's Gate is a revisionist Western not in the sense that it seeks to replace moral distinctions with moral ambiguity as for example The Wild Bunch did but in the sense that it seeks to give an ironic new meaning to some of the genre's conventions.Cimino was quite deliberately setting out to make a perfect masterpiece. He did not quite achieve that ambition but it was an honourable one and his failure was by a much lesser margin than some of his detractors would have us believe. Heaven's Gate a Western on a grand and epic scale can be regarded as a flawed masterpiece. 710".

As a movie it has too many sequences that drag to many lyrical moments that are great to watch but a major violation of the films momentum and too many actors evidently not knowing where they are leading players Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt pitifully among them. But it features Isabelle Hupperts still best performance in a nonfrenchlanguage movie one of Jeff Bridges finest performances and a storyline that is willfully political antiestablishment and antiReagan. In fact Cimino seems at times more concerned with the contemporary overtones of his film than with the historic tragedy itself. Coming from a director who just two years before that had made the most conservative and proamerican film about the Vietnam experience not about the war! who ran away with the major Academy Awards for doing so and who had  not to forget  cowritten the DirtyHarrysequel Magnum Force together with John Milius of all people Heavens Gate must have come as a surprise with some impact. Being released in the launching stages of what was to become the Reaganera both Cimino and the film were dutifully punished for their conduct unbecoming. Heavens Gate was resurrected as the flawed masterpiece it is at the Cannes film festival four years later. Michael Cimino still hasnt recovered from the massive blows his career had to take.".

	schema:reviewBody "HEAVEN'S GATE will always be remembered for at least three things destroying United Artists wrecking director Michael Cimino's career and ending the last golden age of Hollywood when the directors could make the types of films they wanted to make.  To this day we are still living through the effects from HEAVEN'S GATE.  Although the film was made for only 36 million back in 1980 that was a fortune.  Many films since have lost more money but this one wrecked a respected studio.  There is no question as to where all the money went for it is on the screen to see.  Everything was carefully detailed exquisitely down the extras' clothing.  An entire town was built in a remote area of Montana.  The film opens with a graduation sequence that takes place at Harvard in 1870 which is nicely shot and choreographed but is completely unnecessary.  Many such scenes are scattered throughout and the film is more than halfway over before the plot finally starts to move forward.  The actors all play characters who are onedimensional andor irrelevant especially the John Hurt character.  Why Cimino needed so many extras to play the immigrants is unclear because we never get to know any of them and they are so annoying when they gather together to plot strategies against the rich bad guys who want to kill them off.  The editing is pretty bad but that's to be expected because there really isn't much of a story here just a series of vignettes.  Vilmos Zsigmond's photography is good but too often there is too much dust and smoke everywhere that obscures the characters and locations.  Also the colors in the film are all washed out it looks like the filmstock was left out in sun.  For example in the middle of the rollerskating scene the color simply vanishes leaving only light brown and black!  Granted there are a few things in the film that I admire like David Mansfield's score.  Isabelle Huppert always looks sexy even without makeup.  The battle scenes are pretty exciting although I could swear that I saw one particular wagon blow up four times. The film has a rather odd denoument that takes place on board a ship but everything else in this movie is pretty odd.  Why the studio didn't bring in another writer or two to rewrite the script is a mystery because inside this mess there was a good movie trying to get out.  It's a shame that Michael Cimino still hasn't recovered from this debacle.  I sure hope he makes a comeback.".

Is it an epic adventure a revisionist western a character study a snapshot of a historical period a love story a dramatic expose of corruption an artful meditation on humanity? Cimino has no idea. He tries to make Heaven's Gate into all of these things more or less failing.It's not as if he was concerned about the damage this incoherence would do to the plot characters pacing etc. The bottom line is SPECTACLE. The audience is supposed to be overwhelmed by the epic subtext cast of thousands artistic lighting the sheer money apparent on the screen. But any selfrespecting viewer will tell you that being overwhelmed is not the same as being entertained.Every scene presents a bare minimum of information to tell the story There's a guy. We saw him before I think. Now he's on a train. Now he's talking to somebody. Now he's mad. And so on. We get the gist of what's going on with little clue why or how. Not that we care anyway the characters are all constructed as supporting players to spectacle.To make matters worse every shot scene sequence and subplot is about four times too long. There is one exception the roller skating scene filled with such energy and cinematic prowess that it seems tacked on from another picture. That alone was worth the price of admission. Almost.Cimino has a relatively unimaginative style of direction which appears standard on prime time TV. Yet Ciminio constantly gets lost in fetishes which apparently are dust trains and horses. Dust is everywhere. Everywhere. Indoors outdoors in the middle of grassy fields. Sometimes there's so much dust you can't even see what's going on. Whenever a train appears we are treated to beautiful laborious shots that clog up the storyline. There are apparently less people in Johnson County than horses who repeatedly hog the foreground. Even in the battle sequences. In fact the dramatic scene at the end of Part I consists of horses riding off a train obscured by dust. I'm serious.This would be a film forgotten by time if it weren't for the titanic production misadventure that bankrupted an established movie studio bringing the New Hollywood era down with it. Of course JAWS and Star Wars are guilty too but only in the best possible ways.But Heaven's Gate is a sheer mess. Not a disaster or an ostracized masterpiece. An unguided absolute sheer mess. Like T.S. Elliot This is the way the world endsnot with a bang but a whimper. It would feel a lot better if the age of the auteur that included The Graduate Bonnie and Clyde 2001 The Godfather Taxi Driver and Apocalypse Now had ended with a spectacular bomb.But no. Heaven's Gate is Hollywood's whimper.".

After viewing I can certainly understand why it was.I have no problem with movies taking their time developing so that we can get to know characters and really feel a part of what is going on in the film. But this film gave me the impression that director Michael Cimino felt moving things along at a snail's pace automatically makes those things happen. In spite of the epic length he had to work with Cimino's character development is quite minimalistic due to the sheer volume of dead space devoted to empty looks and a lack of dialogue or at least a lack of comprehensible dialogue which is thanks to unsubtitled foreign languages or bad sound recording. The end result is another film in which we just don't care what happens to these characters because we really know so little about them nor are we given a reason to care for them other than the fact that they exist.The film begins with a long and tedious setup at Harvard leading the viewer to believe there is going to be an important significance for this later. As it turns out there isn't. Strangely the relationships established in these scenes end up going nowhere. By the end of the movie several characters especially John Hurt's and Jeff Bridges' were so pathetically wasted in their development I wondered why they were even in the film at all.Worst silliest most bizarre and utterly maddening scene the targeted immigrants decide to fight back against the band of regulators. They end up on horseback stupidly circling around the enemy encampment like a bunch of caricatured Indians circling the wagons in an old Western serial. The only thing missing from the scene as the immigrants get picked off like ducks in a shooting gallery are those stereotypical hysterical Indian war whoops.But that is just one example of people behaving extremely stupidly and unrealistically in this film.As someone who enjoys subtlety in a film and doesn't even mind one that is slower paced I nonetheless found myself fastforwarding through several noneventful minutes of this film.

	schema:reviewBody "I was curious to see this one of the Big Three movie fiascos the other two being Ishtar and Waterworld your list may vary and so gamely gave the director's cut a try on TCM the other night.I was not disappointed by the awfulness of this movie. I wish I could understand what those who think it's some kind of unappreciated masterpiece see in it. To me Mr. Cimino is a director and let us not forget also the writer who cannot tell a story and does not respect his audience. This film is after all longer than Gone With The Wind but  unlike that fine film  scene after scene has nothing to do with anything before or after it the dialogue is unintelligible in many places and anachronistically modern in tone and the whole thing is unattractively photographed in sepia as if to say look at me I'm sure making a historical epic alright! With all the unnecessary crowd scenes it's easy to see why this thing turned into a money pit.I appreciated many of the other comments on this movie here on IMDb they hit the nail on the head. With regard to the various dancing scenes I admit I did enjoy the one on roller skates but can someone tell me where the orchestra was that was churning out all that high volume orchestral music on the lawn at Harvard in 1870? Or did it just come down from Heaven?Whatever modest talents Mr. Cimino may have demonstrated early on in his career apparently he deteriorated into a raging egomaniac somewhere along the way. Still this movie probably could be edited down into some kind of small characterdriven film. That would be a fun computer game. I would buy Make Your Own Heaven's Gate if it ever becomes available.".

	schema:reviewBody "Now infamous Western that was at its time the biggest budgeted disaster in Hollywood history. I was lucky enough to see the full 220 minute version at a theatre in 1990. It was truly staggering how BAD the film was!They had a great cast a story based on a true incident a fight between foreigners and Americans in the 1800s magnificent scenery...so what went wrong? Three wordsdirector Michael Cimino. He was so full of himself after The Deer Hunter he went out and made this god awful Western. He's not totally to blame. His previous film The Deer Hunter was considered a masterpiece and United Artists gave him free reign to do anything. They let him all alone...and everything went wrong. The cost went barreling out of control and Cimino insisted on redoing sequences again and again until they were perfect.First off the sound is horrible. Entire sequences go by and you can't make out a word the characters are saying. For instance Jeff Bridges' character is introduced during a dance sequence but I STILL have no idea who he was! The dialogue in his introductory scene is incomprehensible! That's the director's faulthe should have made sure the dialogue could be heard. Some scenes are shot with so much dust flying around you can barely make out what's going on. The story line doesn't make a whole lot of sense and Cimino took great liberties with the factsin the real story only one person was killedCimino turns it into a massacre. There is some admittedly beautiful sequences here totally destroyed by lack of story and incomprehensible dialogue. Also the bad sound was not the fault of the theatreall the prints sound that way.This garbage effectively closed down United Artists and was the end of Cimino's career. A textbook example of a director so full of himself he doesn't realize what he's doing. Jeff Bridges has said this is the worst movie he ever did. This is from a guy who made Tron! A definite mustmiss.There is a pretty good book called The Final Cut which details the whole disaster. This gets a 1. I wish IMDb had negative numbersthis deserves it!".

	schema:headline " Long on boring detail short on fact";
	schema:reviewBody "The director spent a lot of time making the scenes look real right down to the historical photos and all the sounds of the old west bustle. Too bad the Producers and WriterDirector Michael Cimino spent zero time on any of the historical facts of what the Johnson County war was really about. A lot of the war was over how public lands should be used for grazing. The cattlemen didn't want the poor sheep herders on the land to compete for forage on this cold windswept plateau. The entire epic makes no mention of grazing sheep which was one of the most important reasons for the war.The worst scene is the battle between the peasants and the hired killers. The peasants are shown circling the gunmen like a bunch of Indians would do in much earlier Hollywood movies. The true fact is that Johnson County Sheriff William Red Angus with a posse of 200 to 300 men intercepted the gunmen and trapped them in a barn at the TA ranch. I doubt any women took part in the siege. Ellen Ella also known as Cattle Kate Watson and her second husband James Averell were hanged by a lynch mob about three years before the Johnson County invasion. Ella was never a prostitute. This was a canard spread by the Wyoming Stock Growers Association WSGA in order to discredit her. The fact that the plot makes her out to be a brothel madam only serves the interests of the WSGA.I object to the use of names of real people in a plot that is so obviously fiction. There is no fact in the events time lines or backgrounds of the characters. Why Michael Cimino would use real names of people who were loosely connected with the Johnson County war and events leading up to it is beyond me.The movie could have been much more interesting if it had dwelt on the political ramifications of the Federal Government intervention in a State Government's affairs and what happened after the WSGA gunmen were saved by the Calvary. Some effort was made to prosecute the Cattlemen who were responsible by the Johnson County attorney. But since Johnson county could not afford the court costs and the Governor of Wyoming Amos W. Barber backed the WSGA the charges were eventually dropped.Overall I think the movie was just an excuse to show Isabelle Huppert naked for much of the three and 34 hours of running time on the DVD version.".

Whenever a movie has its agendaheart on its sleeve I am beside myself. There's a scene in a rollerskating rink that seems totally out of place. Long drawnout love scenes with the main character and a Russian prostitute that seems more like a rock star and his sexy groupie. John Hurt's character who is part of the overlong beginning scene drinks and disagrees with the overdone villains. His death scene could very well be the stupidest in history. And I hear everyone even the haters of this film talk about how gorgeous the cinematography is. I think it looks washedout. Watch Days of Heaven if you want to see gorgeous backyards. This movie is even worse than the anti hype. It's pointless. The epilogue showing the main character in a yacht was almost as dumb as the prologue. The battle scenes are tedious and dizzying.

The long gaps between lines and each overwrought scene be it a noisy town meeting or a gang rape gives you plenty of time to think about how this could have been a two hour film and you can spend the rest of the time finding other things wrong with it. While the actors are all pros sometimes adding dimension to their roles they are usually bored beyond even scenechewing. Aesthetic pacing is one thing but then when it occasionally gives you canned lines like the bad guy saying 'I am the law' into the sepia mix well it's just fodder for MST3000. Even they'd get bored. If you see it you'll be bored too. It's a typical Hollywoodization of an actual historical event in other words here have another love triangle with a sweet prostitute the sheriff and a sorta bad guy. In an ultimately failed attempt to reinterpret the western Camino instead grabs at all the standard 70's clichs graphic violence that quickly becomes cartoonish buttnaked ladies jumpy volume shifts and antiheroes. Whee. Face it when you think Old West do you think... roller rink? Not really surprising that it's such a legendary flop it has such high aspirations to fall from.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the movie that pretty much sounded the death knell for the auteur in Hollywood.  At over 40 million bucks Heaven's Gate is so poorly conceived and executed it would take a lifetime to break down every area of failure.  What really galls me the most about it is that technically it's very bad an unforgivable sin for the money that went into it.  John Hurt's commencement speech at Harvard is inaudible as is a conversation between Kris Kristofferson and Richard Masur at the train station.  Some people seem to think Cimino intended this as a style. He didn't.  It's just bad sound recording.  The characters are not particularly welldrawn except for the four or five leads in the climactic battle scene it's difficult to tell who's the bad guys and who's the good guys.  Even on that level it's impossible to enjoy the movie.  The casting of Isabelle Huppert as the town madam is a joke her French accent renders the whole character a fraud.  The acting is generally stiff without any range or depth of feeling even Christopher Walken is bad.   John Hurt's character is the only one with any swagger or vitality although Hurt in his 40s playing a freshfaced Harvard grad with bags under his eyes is patently ridiculous.        I guess to say that it's overlong is overkill.  The rollerskating sequence could have been easily cut the cockfight scene is rapidly becoming a movie cliche and the final scene on board the ocean liner is right out the Twilight Zone.   Having Rod Serling appear before the camera at the end to explain what we just watched would have been the perfect finale. Actually those scenes in and of themselves are not bad but Cimino has not earned the right to include them because what he's given us as the meat of the picture IS so incompetently bad.  The editing is poor especially in the grand battle climax. At one point the same explosion with the same wagon wheel flying from the blast is used three different times.  I wish could I say something anything nice about this movie a great scene a great performance even one memorable line of dialogue but I can't.  It is all just one big unholy mess.  About the only thing I did like was the cinematography and the Montana locations which are stunning.  Even Cimino couldn't screw that up.  This is a long boring bad movie by all standards. And the people who say that it gets bashed only because of the cost overruns are just kidding themselves.  12  out of 4".

It wasn't easy good thing I had a pot of coffee nearby. 2. I absolutely hated the Deer Hunter. Thought it was complete garbage as with any Michael Cimino film. 3. I believe anyone who has sit through even 5 minutes of this cinematic abortion deserves a big cheque from Cimino himself as an apology.Don't listen to the people who call this film a masterpiece. I don't know what they're snorting and I certainly don't want any of it especially if it dumbs them down enough to make them call this film a masterpiece.Don't get me started on how long each scene is. The 20 minute dance scene in the beginning will make you go OK is it done yet????. Or the 5 minute shots of people staring off into the distance. I don't mind movies starting off slowly as long as the time is spent to set the tone. I'll mention Inglourious Basterds here the opening scene is 20 minutes long and consists of a conversation at a table between a Nazi and a Jew. However it's there for a reason. It's a scene in which miss a single line of dialogue and you will not get the film. It does an excellent job at setting the tone and having the audience on the edge of their seat.To say this movie moves at a slow pace is really wrong it doesn't move at any pace at all. It just sits on its arse and expects the audience to help it move. That's not to say that nothing happens because plenty happens too bad only 10 minutes of it are actual content. There's a difference between epics and length. The entire dialogue could fit onto maybe 3 sheets of paper and back to back too. And whatever dialogue was there it wasn't even interesting at all.The movie even looks like crap too. Half the film is shot in Sepia this takes 2 seconds to get annoying and by the third hour it you'll be needing to see an eye doctor. This is just a horrible film and one that should be avoided. The quote on the back of the DVD is right too A Remarkable Achievement. I'm only sure the full quote was A remarkable achievement in boring its audience to death.".

I'll mention Inglourious Basterds here the opening scene is 20 minutes long and consists of a conversation at a table between a Nazi and a Jew. However it's there for a reason. It's a scene in which miss a single line of dialogue and you will not get the film. It does an excellent job at setting the tone and having the audience on the edge of their seat.To say this movie moves at a slow pace is really wrong it doesn't move at any pace at all. It just sits on its arse and expects the audience to help it move. That's not to say that nothing happens because plenty happens too bad only 10 minutes of it are actual content. There's a difference between epics and length. The entire dialogue could fit onto maybe 3 sheets of paper and back to back too. And whatever dialogue was there it wasn't even interesting at all.The movie even looks like crap too. Half the film is shot in Sepia this takes 2 seconds to get annoying and by the third hour it you'll be needing to see an eye doctor. This is just a horrible film and one that should be avoided. The quote on the back of the DVD is right too A Remarkable Achievement. I'm only sure the full quote was A remarkable achievement in boring its audience to death.";

	schema:reviewBody "The recent death of Stephen Bach one of the producers of HEAVEN'S GATE has raised the specter of at least a partial resurrection of the reputation of the cursed film. Moreover the original release the long version was recently shown on TCM exposing the film in ail probability to its largest audience ever. I saw the film when it first came out at a packed screening in a 3rd Avenue cinema across the street from Bloomingdales. I think it was released on a Friday and withdrawn on the following Wednesday. Maybe that wasn't a fair release but it was and is a terrible film. Seeing the fulllength version recently confirmed that judgment and with some thirty years more experience watching and writing about films I am better able to articulate why.First there is the dreaded phrase miseenscene whose definition is at the same time so simple yet so amorphous that it puzzles even after being defined. Basically it's everything that happens in front of a camera. For example a crowd extra will be given a piece of action say just walking by on the sidewalk and a spot to start from. When the assistant director yells action the extra will go through their action. If there's another take the extra will return to the start spot and go again on action. All of the extras do this. Then say a cab drives up to the sidewalk and the star gets out and embraces another principal while all the while the crowd extras are doing their thing. This is miseenscene. In the theatre they call it blocking but cinema is far more multidimensional.The importance of defining miseenscene is because when the French critics developed their theory of the auteur the opposite of an auteur was a mtierenscene even more derogatorily referred to as a traffic cop. An auteur was intimately involved in the meaning of a film and through the director's body of work a theme or themes discerned. The metierenscene was basically a company man rendering in film what had been handed to him on paper. It is the difference between say John Ford and Sam Wood.The second point is how the director Michael Cimino got into the position of directing films. Cimino first gained prominence directing the first milliondollar TV commercial. This depicted a Chevrolet floating down the Grand Canal in Venice. This commercial never appears on any lists of greatest TV commercials of all time and is notable solely because of how expensive it was and how utterly exaggerated it was. The effect is like that of a three year old girl brought out to entertain company who gets her biggest response when she flings her dress over her head. Cute for a three year old embarrassing for a thirty year old. So Cimino was praised early on for spending a huge amount of money for some overthetop image and so he learned.His first film THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT 1974 has a scene where Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges are passengers in a lunatic's car that drives back and forth back and forth until it drives off the road and the driver opens the trunk full of rabbits which he proceeds to shoot one by one. I had the feeling that if the producer Eastwood hadn't stepped in that the scene would have lasted until every rabbit had been killed.Which brings us to HEAVEN'S GATE. I guess if one watches the film on a DVD in snatches like a miniseries it can be impressive. This is because scenes are directed with such a dense miseenscene that each scene is like an encyclopedia it's just plain exhausting to sit through nearly four hours of this. Its like sex at some point it just becomes a whipping. There is the opening 40 minutes which takes place at Harvard. Brilliantly photographed at Oxford it is something of a nonsequitur. I personally favor the artistic way of unfolding a story as opposed to the more commercial Now I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna tell you of most films. However the whole preface adds up to only one line Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt went to Harvard together. Now twenty years later All of that time money and effort not to mention all of the audiences' attention and energy just to deliver this almost useless piece of information.Then there's the scene in the street between Kristofferson and Masur which just goes on and on with a populated city of background extras and horse drawn vehicles in the background in continuous motion to deliver a tiny bit of expositional information. It's just so exhausting. There is just one scene after another like this. It's like trying to eat a thirty pound pizza. Then there are these long conversations of inconsequential details and unintelligible witless dialogue which go on and on and are exhausting and boring. Of course any single scene excerpted looks brilliant. Overall it's a rich piece to spin praiseworthy articles about. Seen in snatches with the possibility of fastforwarding through the boring bits or turning it off if feeling miseenscene whipped it's basically painless. But don't let anybody tell you it's a good film. When I saw it in 1980 there was a guy sitting in front of me who commented on the scene where Kris Kristofferson is on his horse and he turns one way and then the other and does this about six times. That's symbolic he said of he doesn't know which way to go. That is basically at its kernel the basis of every pro Heaven's Gate critique.Watch it if you must but be forewarned this is not a film whose time has come this is a stinker which will smell for all time. HEAVEN'S GATE is historically inaccurate in the extreme. I recommend the book BANDITTI OF THE PLAINS by Asa Mercer on the Johnson County War.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had to order Heaven's Gate off the Internet in order to see it. I couldn't find it anywhere in town. I was insatiably curious about it.I watched all 219 minutes of it in one day. I have viewed it in sections several times since. I must say it is a painful experience. I don't mean painful as in it's so terrible you can't stand watching it I mean painful as in you feel it's lost greatness. It should have been so much better.Vilmos Zsingmond's photography is splendid. The entire film looks like it has been soaked in gold making it feel like you're watching a lost memory. David Mansfield's music is absolutely sublime. I've caught myself humming the tunes from this film many times.Other than that the movie is crap. I am unsure of how close it comes to reaching it's intended greatness but I assure you it doesn't.The plot follows like this James Averill Kris Kristofferson graduates from Harvard University full of youthful idealism. This opening runs for about 20 minutes. He runs to a commencement ceremony. Their are several very long speeches. One is from the university president the other is from the class orator. These speeches say nothing really. The writing is not very good. They tell about how they are going out to civilize a country. They are so wordy you get lost after a few seconds. Then everyone is dancing on the lawns outside. Then the lawns are empty again and everybody runs out of the buildings and gathers around a tree. They try to take flowers from high on the trunk and end up punching each other for no apparent reason. We are given no explanation as to how or why they all went inside after dancing and then ran out again to pick some flowers. Then they are all standing around the tree at night singing. I guess they are saying goodbye to their youth. That could have been accomplished in much less screen time. Fast forward twenty years. James Averill is on a train west to civilize Johnson County which is in anarchy. He is the new sheriff. From then on the film is a mess. Their are so many scenes that serve no purpose. It takes over another hour before the characters are established. We learn that James had taken a lover in Ella a local prostitute. Later we learn that she has also fallen in love with a local gunman Nathan ChampionChristopher Walken wearing eyeshadow that makes him look like a clown. Champion is involved in a plot to kill 125 immigrants suspected of stealing cattle. It all leads up to several battle scenes that thanks to the aforementioned photography are very good to watch. But the movie is so poorly made that I don't know how it escalated to the point of war. It has all been people talking to each other in cabins. The immigrants in this movie have no purpose but to look cute look ragged or poor and to scream things in other languages when under stress.The film has a point I suppose of how crappy it is to grow old. Many people think they are smart when they enjoy films with sad endings because it makes them feel like they are better then the rest of us because they don't need to feel good after a movie to enjoy it. Do not be fooled by these people. This ending is cheap. It is pointless. Well I suppose it's point is a nihilistic view on life and old age. But it is a cheap point that can be found anywhere and is certainly not worth 40 million dollars. Watch this movie for the look and sound of it but don't take it seriously. It is not accurate to history and it had nothing to say.".

I guess they are saying goodbye to their youth. That could have been accomplished in much less screen time. Fast forward twenty years. James Averill is on a train west to civilize Johnson County which is in anarchy. He is the new sheriff. From then on the film is a mess. Their are so many scenes that serve no purpose. It takes over another hour before the characters are established. We learn that James had taken a lover in Ella a local prostitute. Later we learn that she has also fallen in love with a local gunman Nathan ChampionChristopher Walken wearing eyeshadow that makes him look like a clown. Champion is involved in a plot to kill 125 immigrants suspected of stealing cattle. It all leads up to several battle scenes that thanks to the aforementioned photography are very good to watch. But the movie is so poorly made that I don't know how it escalated to the point of war. It has all been people talking to each other in cabins. The immigrants in this movie have no purpose but to look cute look ragged or poor and to scream things in other languages when under stress.The film has a point I suppose of how crappy it is to grow old. Many people think they are smart when they enjoy films with sad endings because it makes them feel like they are better then the rest of us because they don't need to feel good after a movie to enjoy it. Do not be fooled by these people. This ending is cheap. It is pointless. Well I suppose it's point is a nihilistic view on life and old age. But it is a cheap point that can be found anywhere and is certainly not worth 40 million dollars. Watch this movie for the look and sound of it but don't take it seriously. It is not accurate to history and it had nothing to say.";

	schema:reviewBody "Hard Justice is an excellent action movie! The whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting but it does have a very good vampire plot! For the people who say they don't make shoot em ups and fighting films like they use to. Well this one is really hardcore! Don 'The Dragon' Wilson is excellent and his character is really cool in the movie. Nicholas Guest was very good as well and he arguably steals the show! He really performs as a fantastic villain! Melanie Smith was also good. I think that this very fine looking actress is very underrated. Michael Cavanaugh was good. It was really cool to see Vince Murdocco in this film! As for the action it is truly awesome with all of the gun fights and the super cool fighting scenes. The fighting in this picture is really some of the greatest I have seen! There is so much that happens in the 86 minute run time. For the action fans you will be blown away by all of the fire power and superb fighting that this film has to offer! Night Hunter is a movie that isn't easy to locate and if you are at a video store and you see it for sale buy it up because this movie is big keeper and plus the box is cool! There is a ton of action that has to be seen to be believed! Look and see if you can find some good deals on Ebay Half.com Amazon.com's ZShops and Market Place Sellers! In My opinion Night Hunter is one of the greatest fighting films that I have ever watched and the characters are so neat. If you like Don 'The Dragon' Wilson and want to see Nicholas Guest in a great performance then I strongly recommend that any action movie fan who loves shoot em ups fighting movies and vampire films and has been disappointed by other movies that has the look of a true non stop action flick but fails to deliver it to get and buy Night Hunter today!".

	schema:reviewBody "Jack Cutter The Dragon comes from a long line of vampire hunters. When he was just a kid vampires attacked his family farmhouse. The Cutter family has a sacred book all about vampires and how to combat them. His family tells him don't trust anyone and he is sent off to be on his own. In 1995 now an adult Cutter has tracked and killed every vampire in existence  except an elite underground club of nine multiracial vamps led by the sinister Brit Bruno Guest. Cutter teams up with Raimy Baker Smith a reporter for the National Inquisitor. But can he get over his deepseated trust issues? Can he avoid the cops and exterminate the last vampires on earth before the solar eclipse when they will gain maximum power? Will Jack live up to his nickname of The Hunter? Night Hunter is a Ring of Fire 1991 reunion of sorts as Don The Dragon Maria Ford Ron Yuan and Vince Murdocco all return in front of the camera and Rick Jacobson and Art Camacho behind it. However there seems to have been a conscious effort to do something totally different and not repeat themselves. They succeeded in that and it is a nice novelty to see Don in a different kind of role a dark horrortinged storyline instead of a sunny romantic one like Ring of Fire. Two sides of a coin I guess. Maria Ford is always welcome and Melanie Smith will be instantly recognized by Seinfeld fans as Jerry's girlfriend in a story arc on that show.Don doesn't say anything until 20 minutes into the movie and his character and dress are very clearly influenced by The Crow 1994 and Brandon Lee. It's also one of the better Don performances we've seen as his wooden delivery is hidden well by a character that doesn't talk much anyway. As this is a Corman production and he is known for borrowing ideas popular at that time the film also borrows the flamenco music of Desperado 1995 and some ideas from From Dusk Til Dawn 1996. Interestingly it predates Blade 1998 in the fact that it has Vampire POV and Ford's character is similar to Traci Lords'.As far as the fights are concerned it seems to be a mix of gunplay and martial arts and highlighted by Don's punishing finishing moves and death blows. A positive for Night Hunter is that it seems to have created its own vampire rules and mythos. For example vampires may come out during the day especially if they wear special sunglasses. Vampires shoot guns and there is a gunshotcure serum. Notably you can only kill them by breaking their neck. So that sets the stage for some violent moves. But there is a major downside...You've heard of shaky cam but during the fight scenes they seem to have initiated something we called earthquake cam. The screen violently shakes so much so you begin to feel ill. The attempt to be stylish is somewhat appreciated but you can't sicken your audience by sticking the camera in one of those paintshaking machines at the hardware store and not expect a reaction. If this was done to cover up the moves of the actors there's no need for that as Don's moves are excellent. They really should have reined in the earthquake cam. And sometimes they added a strobe light on top of it! For a Don The Dragon movie with more of a professional sheen and featuring Don in an unorthodox role by all means try Night Hunter...but beware the earthquake cam.For more insanity please visit comeuppancereviews.com".

	schema:headline " BMovie cheesiness at its best very best!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a classic mid90's Bactionflick it's so bad I thought at first it was made in 1985 because of the poor picture quality but I was surprised indeed it's from 1995.The movie starts out with a underdeveloped story of vampires and they kill some kid's father. The kid has actually some sort of curse on him which is never explained any further how he eventually got it.20 years later or so he only needs to kill a dozen remaining vampires but unfortunately the police tries to capture him because they think he's a killer  no wonder when you're running around with a sawnoff shotgun like an idiot.The hero whose name is Jack Cutter usually returns to his hideout which looks incredibly similar to the Highlander's one from the television series with the same elevator.Cheesy scenes follow and follow for example when Cutter sees a homeless person and gives him a little bag of raw meat out of his jacket.

Where did the shotgun go in all of sudden? There are even more of such scenes but are way too numerous to mention. The ending is really weird in fact it does not even feel like an ending it seemed that the movie would have another 2 or 3 minutes.With a almost nonexisting plot bad actors cheesy fight scenes a main character who has only 15 lines in the whole movie it's not too surprising that this movie can be considered garbage in every aspect even fans who voted this movie a 10 out of 10 can't deny this. Only the unintentional humor saves it though.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a classic mid90's Bactionflick it's so bad I thought at first it was made in 1985 because of the poor picture quality but I was surprised indeed it's from 1995.The movie starts out with a underdeveloped story of vampires and they kill some kid's father. The kid has actually some sort of curse on him which is never explained any further how he eventually got it.20 years later or so he only needs to kill a dozen remaining vampires but unfortunately the police tries to capture him because they think he's a killer  no wonder when you're running around with a sawnoff shotgun like an idiot.The hero whose name is Jack Cutter usually returns to his hideout which looks incredibly similar to the Highlander's one from the television series with the same elevator.Cheesy scenes follow and follow for example when Cutter sees a homeless person and gives him a little bag of raw meat out of his jacket.

	schema:reviewBody "I always rent a film with the desire to like it. However this film started with two strikes against it. The first strike is that its lead is Don The Dragon Wilson an inept actor by anyone's standards but a solid martial artist. I'm not a martial arts fan so I'm not big on Mr. Wilson. Second its a vampire flick and you can count all the decent vampire films in history on one handand you won't employ all your fingers. So you might be wondering why I rented this. Well I'm a video completist and will watch anything that Melanie Smith appears in. So there you have it.The film focuses on Don who plays Jack Cutter the son of vampire hunters who were killed by head vampire Nicholas Guest and his minions when Don was just a boy. He grows up determined to rid the earth of vampires. When the police chase him he has the ignorant tendency to run around town with a shotgun at any hour day or night he is hit by a vehicle driven by Melanie Smith. Melanie's intro isn't a casual hello for she in Mina Harker like fashion is the reincarnation of a lost love from Guest's past. So Don must save the world from bloodsuckers and the girl from the head fangface.Don does battle with far more eyeliner than Melanie Smith wears... I guess vampire killers need to look darkeyed. Also filmgoers that can't stand movies that have vampires walking around in broad daylight will hate this film. They can combat the sun with shades.STORY  Too clichd. The reincarnation subplot wasn't needed. This film borrows too heavily from other sources to flesh out its weak script such as the Bram Stoker borrowing. Also when Melanie gets shot while driving her car she clearly gets it in the left tit which made for a tricky Kennedyesque shot from the officer who accidentally drilled her. Yet when Don treats her her wound is in the right shoulder. However jumping wounds aside the head vampire is quite progressive and should be applauded for adhering to the call for diversity. His four vampire followers are a woman an Asian a black guy and a white guy. Way to go!ACTING  Although this is BRate fare there are many BRate films that boast solid acting. When your lead is the wooden Don The Dragon Wilson you've ascribed before filming to lowgrade acting. We also have the terrible eroticthriller actress Maria Ford as the female vampire and Nicholas Guest is quite lessthanmenacing as the lead vampire. Melanie Smith does a fine job with what little she has to work with and James Lew who perhaps should have been the lead gives a fine cameo performance as Don's dad.NUDITY None".

Also filmgoers that can't stand movies that have vampires walking around in broad daylight will hate this film. They can combat the sun with shades.STORY  Too clichd. The reincarnation subplot wasn't needed. This film borrows too heavily from other sources to flesh out its weak script such as the Bram Stoker borrowing. Also when Melanie gets shot while driving her car she clearly gets it in the left tit which made for a tricky Kennedyesque shot from the officer who accidentally drilled her. Yet when Don treats her her wound is in the right shoulder. However jumping wounds aside the head vampire is quite progressive and should be applauded for adhering to the call for diversity. His four vampire followers are a woman an Asian a black guy and a white guy. Way to go!ACTING  Although this is BRate fare there are many BRate films that boast solid acting. When your lead is the wooden Don The Dragon Wilson you've ascribed before filming to lowgrade acting. We also have the terrible eroticthriller actress Maria Ford as the female vampire and Nicholas Guest is quite lessthanmenacing as the lead vampire. Melanie Smith does a fine job with what little she has to work with and James Lew who perhaps should have been the lead gives a fine cameo performance as Don's dad.NUDITY None";

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those films which like most straight to videoDVD fodder! sadly unfortunately DOES NOT live up to its poster! I remember years ago in the late 1990s seeing a VHS yes that long ago! copy of it in my local video rental store picking it up reading the cover and thinking as other reviewers have already mentioned that in this film Don Wilson had a similar look to that of Brandon Lee in The Crow. And that it sounded like quite a fun film and also a bit of a change for Don Wilson I believe it's the only slightly Horror themed film he has appeared in. However I didn't bother renting it at the time 199899 and it wasn't until many years later 2013 that I actually saw the film when someone kindly uploaded it for free on Youtube In fact most crappy straight to DVDvideo films should be uploaded on Youtube because they certainly aren't worth paying to see!. And when I eventually did see it I thought to myself That was crap and it didn't live up to its poster and furthermore I'm glad I didn't pay to see that all those years ago in the video rental shop. Like most low budget straight to DVD films the film is hampered by budget limitations poor acting and a lame script. And as everyone else has mentioned I really do not understand that earthquake camera effect?! William C Martell the man responsible for the poor script usually blames the failure of films he wrote on the cast and crew involved and never seems to take his fair share of the blame! He often claim that the cast and crew changed almost every word he wrote! Martell said that Don Wilson did not actually want to do a horrorvampire themed film and when he eventually agreed to it he wanted to control every damn part of the film? Well that may be true but from the looks of things Martell probably wrote the script in a couple of weeks if that? He really needed to spend more time on it and made sure he sold it to a better production company as well! Don Wilson claims that ALL of the films that he starred in made money by that I assume he means that they broke even? But I find that hard to believe because more expensive Wilson films such as the Cybertracker films had a few million spent on them from the look of them and how does a film that did not get a cinema release make a few million to break even? They couldn't have made that much on video because it's the films that were previously at the cinema that make the most on video not a film that's been released straight to DVDvideo and stars a cast of nobodies.".

I was pleasantly surprised with the film. It's very campy and entertaining. There's no pretense here. The film knows that it's corny comicbook entertainment and it never acts like anything else. We've got a pair of retired female prowrestlers as minor villains. We've got a police captain who is never seen without a lit cigarette in his hand or mouth. We've even got a shapeshifting Batmobile which only responds if you end each request with a yo. Just about every single opportunity for campiness is put to good use. The plot is quite good though it is somewhat predictable in that it follows comicbook formula all the way from start to finish. Of course that only adds to the entertainment. The pacing is great. I wasn't bored for a second. The acting is as corny as the rest of the film. The characters are all comicbook clichs but the main characters are surprisingly fleshed out and welldeveloped. There's plenty of alluring shots of females showing off a fair bit of skin most of them being of the Black Scorpion herself. The action is highly entertaining and very comicbooklike. There's plenty of fun oneliners in there as well... Arnold would be proud. This film won't change any lives but it will entertain most viewers particularly those who enjoy comic books and campiness in films. It's a stylish comic book film no more no less. Something that deserves a mention is that there's a sex scene with the Black Scorpion which any man who is into SM andor attracted to aggressive women should see. I recommend this to fans of comic books and campy films. 610".

At 90 odd minutes the film moves along at a fair pace although the tone is maybe a bit uneven as the the superhero crime fighting bits are silly Darcy having to say 'Yo!' to her car to get it to do anything the serious moments about deep personal loss come across as misplaced. The plot isn't very good  if you think about the plot it falls apart how can an ordinary cop suddenly become a electrical genius  invent those things which make her jump about 30 feet in the air or if the cops know that the Breathtaker is going to release deadly gas from various towers around Angel City he went on TV  announced it why didn't they just destroy the towers?The action scenes are rather forgettable there's a couple of basic car chases one car chases another that's it  some martial arts fights as the Black Scorpion kicks ass. The costumes look cheap the Black Scorpion costume looks to have been inspired by Catwoman in Batman Returns 1992  is all black vinyl high heeled boots long gloves  a half face mask that is very fetish in style  I will admit even at 37 when she made Black Scorpion leading lady Joan Severance looks good in the outfit. The fight between the Black Scorpion  a cop on a rooftop when they end up kissing with one unaware of the other's identity is lifted straight from a very similar scene in Batman Returns. Like all good superheros the Black Scoirpion has her own car which can change shape courtesy of some cheap CGI effects  she has her own equally larger than life enemy in the Breathtaker who uses asthmatics as his henchmen the instance of having the main villain personally  emotionally tied to the hero is also standard comic book superhero fare  here it comes across as contrived. Considering this was made for telly it quite violent  there's a fair bit of nudity too.Filmed on what looks to be a low budget the production values are cheap  the whole thing feels cheap. The acting isn't great Severance looks good in latex  boots but has no real screen presence  the oneliners fall flat although Stephen Lee is amusing as the stressed out chain smoking police Captain  as usual Bruce Abbott turns in a good performance.Black Scorpion is an OK camp superhero comic book adventure film it's watchable in a mindless way  Severance in latex looks great but overall there's not much here to get excited about. Has no connection to the giant bug film The Black Scorpion 1957  was followed by Black Scorpion II Aftershock 1997  a Black Scorpion 2001 TV series that ran for twentytwo episodes.".

	schema:headline " One Long OverExtended Joke";
	schema:reviewBody "Ever since the original Superman film from the late seventies Hollywood has been conducting a longrunning loveaffair with the comic book superhero. Most of the wellknown figures from the Marvel and DC comics stables have been given their own film franchises Superman Batman Spiderman The Hulk Captain America The Fantastic Four XMen etc. Indeed many more obscure figures have also been adapted for the cinema until the recent film came out for example I had no idea that Thor was a crimefighting superhero as well as a Norse god. One curious exception to the rush to turn superheroes and superheroines into film stars is Wonder Woman even though she was given her own long running TV series starring Lynda Carter in the seventies. One explanation I have heard for this omission is that although Wonder Woman was originally conceived as a symbol of female empowerment her skimpy costume makes her today more of a male fantasyfigure. Hollywood producers are therefore worried that they will be accused of sexism if she keeps her original costume and of cowardly political correctness if she is forced to change it for something less revealing. Far safer therefore to steer clear of her altogether. Roger Corman however appears to be quite unworried about allegations of either sexism or political correctness because he acted as the producer of Black Scorpion a film whose eponymous heroine wears a costume quite as scanty as Wonder Woman's. Unlike most of the other superheroes who have become the subject of films she was an original creation not derived from a comic book. A Black Scorpion comic book came later. Actually the word original might not be entirely appropriate in this context as the Black Scorpion shares many traits with other crime fighters especially Batman. Like Batman but unlike Superman or Spiderman she does not actually possess any super powers so has to rely upon strength agility and technology including a Batmobilestyle car to overcome the bad guys. Like all selfrespecting superheroes the Black Scorpion keeps her real identity a close secret. Batman hid behind the millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne and Superman the mildmannered bespectacled journalist Clark Kent and the Black Scorpion's alter ego is Darcy Walker whose day job is that of a police detective. Darcy however finds herself frustrated by the limitations of police procedure especially after her own father is murdered and therefore moonlights as a freelance vigilante a role in which she need not bother with all that civil liberties stuff about not beating suspects up or reading them their Miranda rights. If this scenario were taken at all seriously it could have formed the basis for an intriguing Dirty Harry style thriller about the ethics of law enforcement but Black Scorpion is not a film that takes itself seriously at all. Darcy is not so much a Dirty Harriet as a Batwoman the model for the film being the camp Batman TV series of the 1960s rather than Tim Burton's rather brooding Gothic interpretation of the Batman mythos. There are however certain parallels with Joel Schumacher's two Batman films which also came out during the mid nineties. Both the storyline and the characters are deliberately exaggerated and unrealistic the whole thing being played more for laughs than for thrills. We need not bother too much with the plot standard superhero stuff in which the Black Scorpion thwarts a supervillain known as the Breathtaker who has a particularly complex scheme for seizing power in the City of Angels for which presumably read Los Angeles and who turns out to have been responsible for killing Darcy's father. The heroine is played by the former supermodel Joan Severance clearly cast more on the basis of her ability to look good in a revealing costume than on the basis of any acting talents but in the context of a film like this acting talents do not really matter very much. One thing that does matter is that although the Black Scorpion relies heavily on her martial arts prowess Severance does not seem to possess any great fighting skills herself and the fight sequences seem obviously staged. There is a contrast here with the work of other action heroes and heroines like Steven Segal JeanClaude van Damme or Cynthia Rothrock they may not possess much in the way of acting skills but at least they do know how to fight. The producers are never quite brave enough to turn the fight scenes into part of the joke in the way that the Batman television series did  complete with captions reading BIFF! WHAM!! or KERPOW!!! The problem with camp selfmocking action films like this one is that they are essentially onejoke comedies a joke which is forced to stretch a long way. The Adam West Batman was tolerable on TV in half hour doses indeed if you were a child during the sixties as I was it was great fun. When the concept was extended into a standardlength feature film it became a bit tedious. Black Scorpion suffers from the same drawback it is just one long overextended joke. 410".

Unlike most of the other superheroes who have become the subject of films she was an original creation not derived from a comic book. A Black Scorpion comic book came later. Actually the word original might not be entirely appropriate in this context as the Black Scorpion shares many traits with other crime fighters especially Batman. Like Batman but unlike Superman or Spiderman she does not actually possess any super powers so has to rely upon strength agility and technology including a Batmobilestyle car to overcome the bad guys. Like all selfrespecting superheroes the Black Scorpion keeps her real identity a close secret. Batman hid behind the millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne and Superman the mildmannered bespectacled journalist Clark Kent and the Black Scorpion's alter ego is Darcy Walker whose day job is that of a police detective. Darcy however finds herself frustrated by the limitations of police procedure especially after her own father is murdered and therefore moonlights as a freelance vigilante a role in which she need not bother with all that civil liberties stuff about not beating suspects up or reading them their Miranda rights. If this scenario were taken at all seriously it could have formed the basis for an intriguing Dirty Harry style thriller about the ethics of law enforcement but Black Scorpion is not a film that takes itself seriously at all. Darcy is not so much a Dirty Harriet as a Batwoman the model for the film being the camp Batman TV series of the 1960s rather than Tim Burton's rather brooding Gothic interpretation of the Batman mythos. There are however certain parallels with Joel Schumacher's two Batman films which also came out during the mid nineties. Both the storyline and the characters are deliberately exaggerated and unrealistic the whole thing being played more for laughs than for thrills. We need not bother too much with the plot standard superhero stuff in which the Black Scorpion thwarts a supervillain known as the Breathtaker who has a particularly complex scheme for seizing power in the City of Angels for which presumably read Los Angeles and who turns out to have been responsible for killing Darcy's father. The heroine is played by the former supermodel Joan Severance clearly cast more on the basis of her ability to look good in a revealing costume than on the basis of any acting talents but in the context of a film like this acting talents do not really matter very much. One thing that does matter is that although the Black Scorpion relies heavily on her martial arts prowess Severance does not seem to possess any great fighting skills herself and the fight sequences seem obviously staged. There is a contrast here with the work of other action heroes and heroines like Steven Segal JeanClaude van Damme or Cynthia Rothrock they may not possess much in the way of acting skills but at least they do know how to fight. The producers are never quite brave enough to turn the fight scenes into part of the joke in the way that the Batman television series did  complete with captions reading BIFF! WHAM!! or KERPOW!!! The problem with camp selfmocking action films like this one is that they are essentially onejoke comedies a joke which is forced to stretch a long way. The Adam West Batman was tolerable on TV in half hour doses indeed if you were a child during the sixties as I was it was great fun. When the concept was extended into a standardlength feature film it became a bit tedious. Black Scorpion suffers from the same drawback it is just one long overextended joke. 410";

	schema:reviewBody "Ah a Roger Corman epic that actually spawned its own comicbook and TV series which would indicate that the film is quite good...wouldn't it. Well I'm pleased to say that the film is actually pretty good IF you're interested in incredibly cheesy clichd trashy low budget superhero flicks that combine the camp of the 60's Batman and Robin series and the sleazy visuals of something like Barb Wire. Yep its an all round winner for meeee!The plot is an unbelievably stereotypical comicbook setup. A young woman's father is shot dead in front of her eyes which leads her to reinvent herself as the superheroine vigilante Black Scorpion. This happens just in the neck of time as a super villain who was once a hospital doctor that was accidentally shot dead by the Black Scorpions cop father when she was a child has come back to wreak revenge on the city by using a toxic gas in the air supply the cities air supply?. This villain is now encased within a metallic suit because he has major asthma...and facial deformities for some reason from the injuries suffered from his near death experience. So naturally he has lots of henchmen and equipment to plunge the city into despair.So like Batman the Black Scorpion fights crime and stands up for justice...especially justice for women naturally. At first she merely ekes out an existence on her own taking down pimps and muggers with martial arts in her tight scantily clad outfit and surprisingly expensive hot rod. But as the film goes on she picks up a cool cat sidekick that just happens to be able to supply her with neat gadgets and revamp her car. From there on the Black Scorpion flies around the city in a transforming American muscle car which is decked out with all sorts of hitech equipment...just like the Batmobile. When I say transforming I mean the car morphs into a completely different car in a dreadfully bad CGIeffects sequence its impossible and makes no sense at all but I don't think that's a concern here.The bad guy in his robot suit looks like something from an old Dr Who episode its laughably stupid looking and still makes me wonder how a bullet hit to the chest would equal the need for this suit...and give him chronic asthma. The bloke inside this thing can hardly move which makes it even more amusing lots of quick cut edits when he's involved in the action but as I said luckily he has lots of expendable henchmen just waiting to have their asses kicked by a female in fishnets. As for the Black Scorpion played devilishly by Joan Severance her outfit is bordering on softcore SM with black thigh high boots fishnets long black elbow length PVC gloves a nice black shiny PVC cleavage and a Catwoman style mask. I won't deny it looked good if a little vanilla for my tastes no way she could do half the stuff she does in those boots though.The actual film is an odd creation like I said already it plays like a camp pantomime like the famous Adam WestBurt Ward TV series. Yet at the same time its a very adult film in places there are strippers and hookers with tits n ass and on show a few revealing outfits clear cut male fantasy sequences of blokes getting beaten up by a woman in BDSM gear and even a simulated oral sex scene which is pretty darn good. It may be a silly childish exaggerated homage to the comicbook genre but it certainly isn't for the kids. There isn't really any blood and gore though the violence is pretty much on par with The ATeam. You don't see much no squibs or bullet holes...just men throwing themselves around.In the end the film is clearly meant to be a true over the top comicbook flick with larger than life characters and unrealistic scenarios. In no way is it meant to be taken seriously the superheroine is not a realistic believable character in any sense even though she has no super powers and no bottomless bank account...just the muscle car. In a sense she is more akin to a character from the KickAss universe I guess being a vigilante with a ridiculous outfit. This film does remind me of the recent Green Hornet movie actually the ethnic sidekick and muscle car loaded with gadgets that is. A cool little mishmash of sordid tacky fun and camp goofiness with ass...well worth it.6.510".

My first reactionUhhhhh...Okay...? They're really going to try to pass this off as a FEATURE?! And it didn't get much better after that.

No She's not a very convincing fighter so the fight scenes are mostly jump cuts and stuntmen falling down when she waves a leg in their direction. But she has a nice crazy gleam in her eye when the mask is on and she's able to at least give most of her lines of dialog a decent delivery. Bruce Abbott and Garrett Morris are also in here trying to maintain their respective dignities in thankless parts and they don't stink or anything either. The plot...well the plot and dialog appear to have been cobbled together by 10th graders who think they are funny. Roger Corman was involved in this at some executive level which explains a lot...Corman projects almost always have a germ of something interesting or intriguing something that keeps you watching even when the screenplay leaves plot holes big enough to drive the Scorpionmobile through and the jokes fall flat. At least there ARE jokes. And such is the case here. I wanted to see how things came out and so I stuck around until the end.And in the end I think that's all the creators wanted. DVD Delirum mentioned some sequels but apparently at some point Severance was replaced by another hapless modelactress who didn't have her mojo so I don't know if I'll bother to watch any more in the series.

This results in only an average rating for this review though you should know that it's an enthusiastic score nonetheless. This is a very entertaining adventure flick made during a time before DC and Marvel monopolized superhero pictures. I would never think to directly compare it to those blockbusters but for Bmovie lovers there is a lot to like here.The story Frustrated with the ineffectual law enforcement system a Los Angeles policewoman Joan Severance dons a secret identity and takes the fight to a super villain seeking to take control of the city Casey Siemaszko.The film could not have had a huge budget give the flimsy costumes weak effects and action scenes that look like they were shot under time constraints. Luckily these limitations bring out the talent in producer Corman and director Jonathan Winfrey and they make the absolutely most of what they have to work with. The screenplay is polished completely avoiding the narrative pitfalls of other lowbudget productions. The cast as a whole is enthusiastic and you can look forward to some particularly entertaining performances from Terri Vaughn and Garrett Morris. Most important of all the movie has that infectious enthusiasm that can turn schlock into classics the hammy personalities the bubbly chemistry between the cast and the filmmakers' knack for enjoyable absurdity make it clear that the movie's foremost goal is to have fun and it's hard not to be at least somewhat entertained.However enthusiasm by itself does not make a great action movie and this one's action content is in trouble. For all her dramatic talent Joan Severance is clearly no martial artist and the handful of fight scenes are lucky to reach mediocrity. Equally displeasing is the film's use of sexuality which seems determined to denigrate the heroine. Yes the movie is aware of its exploitive nature and gets all it can out of the Black Scorpion's BDSMinspired outfit but at the same time it tries to win points for simply having a mighty female hero. Corman is trying to have it both ways he wants the heroine to be a strong independent woman but also wants to titillate the audience by having her engage in a topless sex scene while in costume. Trying to fulfill both objectives seems mutually denigrating and cheapens the value of a rare female superhero flick.Nevertheless Joan Severance in particular ought to be proud of her work here. She shines in one of the few productions for which she landed top billing and while she may not be the action hero I was hoping for her adeptness at headlining a comic book movie says much about her range as a performer. It's hard to say whether Roger Corman has permanently retired the Black Scorpion character but I'd be happy to see Severance take up the role again especially if it's for a feature as fun as this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had just seen another Roger Corman film The Death Artist less than a week before this was on and I found that film very funny and entertaining. I have also seen another Corman film Sawbones which was quite entertaining in itself so I had high hopes for this one and it very very much let me down.The only good part of Black Scorpion is a cheesy villian called the Breathtaker who looks and acts about a serious as the villians in The Power Rangers and I guess is supposed to want to take over the city by spraying toxic chemicals or something silly like that. It sounds dumb and is and even The Breathtaker had his dull momentslike what was with all of his bumbling villian apprentices especially two annoying female wrestlers and where by the way did he get the power to fly? but he was better than anything else in the movie. My only major problem with him was not even necessarily related to the character itself but I must wonder why different actors were used to play The Breathtaker and the uh person behind the Breathtaker's mask? Did whomever was in charge of casting think that one or the other of them couldn't pull off the effect by themself? Was the voice of the Breathtaker too ugly to have his face revealed which more or less makes his human counterpart some himbo cast only for his looks? Because that's not very fair to either of them but I suppose even that discrepancy with Black Scorpion did not TOTALLY ruin the film for me...What ruins Black Scorpion is its stupid title character some bimboey police officer named Darcy Joan Severance who as a cop seems to masquerade as a prostitute with some...real prostitute until her daddyRick Rossovich who as a result of utterly cheap casting looks about the SAME AGE as Severanceis for some reason gunned down by the local DA and Darcy gets cannedor suspended? for police brutality after she goes to confront him in jail. A combination of seeking justice for her father's death and letting down her dull prostitute friend inspires Darcy to become the Black Scorpion a female superhero that goes around saving...other prostitutes or at least notveryproperlydressed people from bad folks who all seem to somehow be connected to the Breathtaker. I really didn't know how the Black Scorpion's saving the world connected to the Breathtaker except somewhere in the middle half DarcyThe Black Scorpion suddenly realizes that he must have been involved in her father's death. Abruptly after that it suddenly jumps to who is the Breathtaker? so what was the point of all of that other junk? Who knows and the character of Darcy her charismafree boyfriend and prostitute friend and pretty much everyone else were not interested enough for me to make any kind of exceptions to notverywell developed writing. If people want to make a stupid intentionally campy film they can at least make it a WELLWRITTEN stupid intentionally campy film as Sawbones and The Death Artist proved to be. What went wrong with this one?".

This really doesn't scratch the surface...   Virtually all exterior shots of the plane skimming the ocean landing in sinking and even the atrest shots are borrowed from Airport '77.   All of the raising shots are pulled from '77 including most of the interior flooding clips with the exception of Dennis Weaver's drowning.  I couldn't help but wonder if Olivia Dehavilland might come floating by at any moment or maybe a dead Tom Sullivan.   Another eyeroller  Dennis Weaver's name in this film is Stevens which is to compensate for the fact that Airport '77's plane is owned by the Stevens Corporation headed by Jimmie Stewart of course.This is a veritable calvalcade of actors who don't work much or at least haven't worked in a while which might have been the first clue that it was going to be a real stinker.I've rated this film a 2    It's quite worthy of a 1 but if this film can't offer any other redeeming quality at least somebody helped Coolio Max Caulfield Nicolle Eggert and Dennis Weaver make their car payments that month!".

The acting is surprisingly good there are LOTS of familiar faces whom you probably know if u're a bmovie fan like me.I was very glad to see Brent Huff playing one of the heroes knowing him mostly for his 80's action films and i must admit he is not a bad actor at all. Fred Williamson Maxwell Caulfield  Tim Thomerson get some limited screen time but are believable in their parts. The eyecandies in this Fred Olen Ray movie are Yvette Nipar and Nicole Eggert both looking very sexy and very mean. Michael Bailey Smith adds some muscle to the background as a Navy SEAL. Unfortunately the only cast member who in my opinion is completely out of place is Coolio. He doesn't act at all talks like he didn't even read the script and being a badass in the beginning of the movie gets shot like a wimp a hour later. Not a good choice.To sum this movie up  this is not such a bad choice for late night entertainment. If you can get over the special effects thing so many guns so much fire and not a single wound on anyone Coolio's annoying performance and the recycled footage from Airport 77 you might like this nobrainer after all.".

The worst kind of hack work. The worst kind of film. Boring.This type of film is a waste of money an affair where the crew on all levels are ghosts hoping to get whatever scant pay check they can and that no one will see or know they appeared participated in this rip off. There are so many people who want to make movies it's disgusting to see Ray burn up the money given to do nothing more but fill time.His commentary track is interesting in that he has to start it by explaining that he is really Fred Ray as he isn't credited on the film itself.

Todd comes to an agreement with Mrs. Lovett to rent the upstairs of her building so that he can open his own barber shop.

Based off of a play of the same name by Christopher Bond which in turn had been based off of an old London legend Sondheim did a wonderful job bringing it to the musical theatre stage. The score is just amazing by far Sondheim's best and probably one of the best scores written for a musical ever. The show was cast extremely well my only complaint being of Betsy Joscelyn's portrayal of Johanna. Its good mind you and she's a very versatile actress but she just doesn't sing Greenfinch and Linnet Bird too well. But other than that it's all phenomenal Angela Lansbury made the role of Mrs. Lovette and she just does it so well. George Hearn was a good replacement for Len Cariou in the title role and Ken Jennings gives a great performance as Tobias. The ending will give you chills. Top marks for a wonderful show.".

Its good mind you and she's a very versatile actress but she just doesn't sing Greenfinch and Linnet Bird too well. But other than that it's all phenomenal Angela Lansbury made the role of Mrs. Lovette and she just does it so well. George Hearn was a good replacement for Len Cariou in the title role and Ken Jennings gives a great performance as Tobias. The ending will give you chills. Top marks for a wonderful show.";

Every note is perfect I don't even need to hear the singing to enjoy it!Moving on to this particular production  This is magnificent!  Of course no one could play Mrs. Lovett besides Angela Lansbury and she does it perfectly.  And she should she has been playing this part for several years.  George Hearn is absolutely brilliant.  The best Sweeney Todd I have ever heard.  He has a wonderful voice yet he can throw his voice so well! His epiphany is incredible as you can tell by the audience's reaction to it.  The Judge Toby Antony and Pirelli are also so wonderful in their roles.  Everyone is perfect!  Well I still have to fast forward through Johanna's Green finch and linnet bird.  She just doesn't sing that song well at all.This show CAN be appreciated at all ages but it is not always accepted. I am not your typical middleaged theater lover I am only 15 years old yet Sweeney Todd has given me a greater appreciation for music than I have gotten from any other musical.".

I saw Hearn and Angela Lansbury who also won the Tony for her performance as Mrs. Lovett perform Sweeney on broadway.  They must have made the film at about the time I saw the show.  To this day the most moving moment I can ever remember in the theatre occurred when Hearn sang These are my Friends.  These are my friends see how they glisten.  My arm is complete again!  Hearn's performance in the San Francisco Opera production convinced me that he has lost nothing in the nearly twenty years since I first saw him perform the piece on Broadway and later in the film.

In an effort to correct the wrong that was done to him Mr. Todd devices a plan to seek revenge. With the help of Mrs. Lovett who owns a meat pie shop under Mr.Todd's barbershop they set out to have those above serve those down below.I was fortunate enough to have seen the original Broadway version eight times six with Cariou and Lansbury the other two with Hearn and Loudon. I saw the revival with Bob Gunton and Beth Fowler and several other concert versions.While the technical aspects in this production are lacking to say the least I believe that this filmed production version is the best. Lansbury and Hearn were the two best in these roles and they have a wonderful time playing off of each other.Very good supporting work by Ken Jennings and Edmund Lyndeck.

George Hearn is fantastic in my book as are Angela Lansbury and the composer Stephen Sondheim.  This musical is operatic in scope and shows much ingenuity in composition.  I certainly hope that this VHS becomes available on DVD!!  Hearn's performance is spookily sympathetic.  The one annoying performance is the young woman who sings the role of Joanna.  I believe this performance was at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles rather than on a Broadway stage and am not sure that the minimalist set was utilized in New York as it was in this production.  But I found the scaffolding being dragged across the stage to be quite effective to portray the streets of London.  I highly recommend this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story of Sweeney Todd evokes memories of the work of classic writers like Charles Dickens and more contemporary writers like Edward Gory. As a musical it naturally becomes more like the musical Les Miserables. Both deal with the grim effects of poverty in the Industrial Revolution and the breakdown of organized society. But this musical is different from Les Mis in one very important aspect Stephen Sondheim the songwriter who can adapt to any style. To be sure he's had his successes and failures but one thing about his shows you can always count on They will be something unique. Who would have thought someone would write a musical about a barber who slits people's throats and makes them into meat pies? Sondheim did and he did it marvelously. The entire show is set in a factory to suggest the everpresent catastrophic effects of the misery of those at the bottom of society and this serves the needs of the show perfectly. The catwalks and railings are moved throughout to suggest streets and walkways and bridges. Techniques are borrowed from Kabuki and Noh with the visual stagehands and set changes. Then to top it all off cast the great Angela Lansbury as the gruesomely practical and humorous Mrs. Lovett and George Hearn with his operatic baritone voice as the murderous Todd and you've got yourself a stellar musical vehicle. The rest of the cast moves smoothly through the clichs of the love story perfectly except for Johanna and Pirelli who sound a bit too forced. If the Johanna and Pirelli from the Broadway show could be here it would be perfect. Hearn acts while he sings more than Len Cariou on the OBC album and the accents don't sound as forced here. Through it all Sondheim's score never fails to underline the dark seriousness of the story. As I said he can adapt to any style. In Follies he imitates the '30s '40s style of showtunes in Pacific Overtures he captures the subtle art of Asian music Into the Woods knocks off the 32 bar Disney style songs and Assassins covers a history of American music. Here however he does wonders in making his score distinctly English from parlour songs to operatic duets and soliloquies to society waltzes to GilbertSullivan style patter. And yet still the show remains deadly serious even though it provokes more laughs than any musical comedy. In it still is a grim warning on the evils of taking revenge. Here is where this movie makes a mistake in cutting the Judge's solo in which he flagellates himself out of guilt for his crimes. Without it the Judge is just a conventional villain and this movie's point is that there are no straight villains. Both Todd and the Judge learn too late the horrors of having to accept responsibility for their actions and Todd loses everything in his obsession. This is well brought out by the chilling reprise of the grim yet rollicking Ballad of Sweeney Todd ending the show with Todd and Lovett rising from the grave to tell us that the end is the same in a world full of Sweeneys vengeance begets only vengeance. Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd. He served a dark and a vengeful God. To seek revenge may lead to Hell but everyone does it and seldom as well as Sweeney as Sweeney Todd the Demon Barber of Fleet Street.".

	schema:headline " Sondheim's Masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "The genius that is Stephen Sondheim was never more prominently displayed as it was in his 1979 Musical Thriller SWEENEY TODD a Gothic gory grisly yet delicious musical concoction about a demented barber who returns to London to exact revenge on the evil Judge who not only had him permanently exiled from London but who is also raising his daughter as his own and plans to marry her to shield her from all the evils of the world. The barber finds lovesympathy and assistance from a lonely pie shop owner who has her own agenda where Todd is concerned. This musical rocked Broadway and won nine Tony Awards including Best Musical and Best Actress in a Musical Angela Lansbury. The production was filmed in its entirety in 1982 with Angela Lansbury recreating her Broadway role as Mrs. Lovett the daffy pie shop owner who finds a practical use for the heads that Todd makes mincemeat out of. George Hearn who replaced Len Cariou on Broadway is electrifying in the title role so much so that you have to wonder why he wasn't originally cast in the role. Lansbury and Hearn are riveting from start to finish and commit 100 to their ghoulish characters aided by a first rate Sondaheim score probably the closest thing Sondheim has written to an opera. Lansbury shines on The Worst Pies in London and By the Sea. George Hearn stops the show with Epiphany and is also compelling during Pretty Women a duet he sings with Judge Turpin the man he has sworn revenge on. Cris Groendahl is vocally impressive as Antony the young sailer who rescues Todd and falls for his daughter Johanna. Betsy Joselyn is a little over the top as Johanna and really pushes vocally to the point that during Green Funch and Linnet Bird she actually drives her voice offpitch during a couple of moments. The rest of the cast is first rate especially Edmund Lyndeck as Judge Turpin who gets to perform Johanna in this production which was cut from the original production and Ken Jennings as Toby whose gorgeous tenor fills the auditorium on Not While I'm Around. But it is breathtaking musical score by Stephen Sondheim and the mesmerizing performance by Lansbury an especially George Hearn that makes this night of Gothic musical theater an experience that stays with you long after curtain call. Not for all tastes but if you're game and have strong heart SWEENEY TODD is a joy for all music theater lovers and a must for fans of Stephen Sondheim and Angela Lansbury.".

This is a typical Victorian story in the line of Jack the Ripper and so many other crimes of that type and I should say multiple killers or serial killers one century before the FBI invented profiling.This particular production is special since it is a Broadway production of the musical that Tim Burton brought to the silver screen many years later. This particular production was actually brought to TV a long time ago and it is this TV version that they remastered and brought to us in this format. The sound is perfect of course since in the 1980s FM sound also call hifi sound was already arrived. The pictures are good though from a TV standard probably professional probably Betamax. The remastering was only used to clean up the sound and probably too to densify the resolution. So we can consider we have the best possible rendering of this old production.The interest is to have a stage production from Broadway and from a period when special effects were not yet the norm on the stage. The stage production was supposed to create emotion in the spectators and they mostly only had human means to do so. They only wrapped up the human means in a stage setting that could increase or decrease the realistic effect. They chose to break up that realistic effect with the systematic use of machinery visible to the audience. Constantly elements some enormous are moved on the stage turned around more or less building up structures that are supposed to render the various locations and the various scenes. It is totally artificial and it works perfectly because of the other dimension which is used in the most genial way imaginable.This other dimension is the use of actors singers and dancers in one word stage performers. The music is good but we do not see the musicians. The singers are not opera singers but musical singers and they are good not so much because of their voices but because they use their voices as one element of their performing. That performing is physical and the voices are part of this physicalness. The voices the physical performing on the stage movements and other physical contact or absence of contact and the phenomenal body language and facial expressions it all is extremely effective to create emotion and density. The situations are deep and heavy because of this performing qualities. It is what has slightly been reduced in the most recent period by the use of special effects. In those old days special effects were hardly available and the actors had to work with their bodies voices and faces to create those emotions. And that was a time that has unluckily mostly disappeared.In this case we have a real masterpiece because everything is looking artificial and yet the emotions look extremely realistic. That's a stage directing choice that was more or less the only solution at the time if the stage director wanted to produce an emotional and powerful show. This is a real success along that line.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU".

It wasn't until a few years later I knew what I was missing.After watching this version you can never go back to that Burton garbage. Would you eat at Taco Bell after tasting food at a REAL Mexican restaurant? No. The first time I fullyunderstood the story was with this 1982 taping. The Burton adaption was a jumbled mess with many things cut out and many miscasted actors Helena Bonham Carter being the worst one. Sacha Baron Cohen actually did a remarkable job though.Anyway this review IS for the 1982 version so I'll stop trashing the newer one. In my opinion George Hearn performs Sweeney better than Len Cariou originally did but that's just an opinion. Angela Lansbury adds lots of character to Miss Lovett making her weirdly lovable. Ken Jennings not to be confused with the highneck Jeopardy geekalso reprises his role as Toby from the original show as does Edmund Lyndeck as Judge Turpin. Everyone does a remarkable job however I know a lot of people hate Johanna's singing. But if you stop and think she's asking the birds how THEY sing wonderfully when trapped in a cage....so I suppose she's not supposed to sing well. Cris Groenendaal is wonderfully cheesy as Anthony and was much more likable than that young prissy guy they casted in the Burton movie.This show is NEVER boring. If you found the Burton movie confusing I suggest you watch this. It's truly a treat to watch you'll see why this has an 8.5 score. Hopefully they'll release it on BluRay so we can attend the tale of Sweeney Todd in HD!".

	schema:reviewBody "I am not a fan of Broadway musicals but I can say without a doubt that Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street is certainly my personal favourite. Why? Well I think the story is pretty good and some of the music is the best I've heard in the genre. I saw the Tim Burton blockbuster made a couple of years ago and I thought it was okay but then I discovered this version which is considered by many to be the definitive version to watch and... I agree.The plot in case you don't know is that a barber named Benjamin Barker alias Sweeney Todd returns after 15 years of being shipped away wrongly because a courtroom judge wanted his wife. He goes to where his establishment was but finds it an unsuccessful pie shop and the owner named Mrs Lovetts tells him that his wife took poison and Judge Turpin raised Sweeney's daughter isolated from the rest of the world. Determined to get his revenge Sweeney establishes himself as a good barber to the rest of London. However after a rival Barber who recognizes him threatens to blackmail him Sweeney kills him. This sets the idea in motion that because meat is apparently expensive that if anyone comes in alone to Sweeney's barber shop that he should kill them and Lovetts serves them as pie to the public and they shall set their business going or... whatever you want to call that! until the Judge enters looking for a shave.The acting is amazing. I have never heard of George Hearn but he was the highlight of the show with his performance as Todd. I mean he plays the role coming off as downright psychotic in some scenes but in others he could come off as downright normal. His singing voice is also really really good. I could also say all the cast members are very very good. I would only bring up three exceptions  Judge Turpin I mean he DID come across as a creepy old bastard but I just think his singing voice strikes me the wrong way Tobias I know they couldn't get a little kid to do it especially in a story this dark and twisted but even then I didn't really like the performance mainly for the same reason as the Judge something about their performance strikes me the wrong way and Joanna but that maybe because she's my least favourite character in the entire musical.As far as the production goes I think the orchestra did a really good job and I also liked that it wasn't just the rotating set that was on the stage when I saw it live. I mean if you know what I'm talking about then I know that thing wouldn't be easy to make but I did prefer people rushing out and bringing the stuff in and out that's necessary to that part of the story. Just call it personal preference  either way for a stage production this is really good production design.I really don't think I can say anything else because I've covered almost everything. I would say if you're a slight fan of the Tim Burton movie or like the Broadway musical and haven't seen this I suggest that you check it out. I haven't seen many adaptations of Sweeney Todd but I think after this I won't be able to top it... still I'm going to check them out anyway.".

I agree.The plot in case you don't know is that a barber named Benjamin Barker alias Sweeney Todd returns after 15 years of being shipped away wrongly because a courtroom judge wanted his wife. He goes to where his establishment was but finds it an unsuccessful pie shop and the owner named Mrs Lovetts tells him that his wife took poison and Judge Turpin raised Sweeney's daughter isolated from the rest of the world. Determined to get his revenge Sweeney establishes himself as a good barber to the rest of London. However after a rival Barber who recognizes him threatens to blackmail him Sweeney kills him. This sets the idea in motion that because meat is apparently expensive that if anyone comes in alone to Sweeney's barber shop that he should kill them and Lovetts serves them as pie to the public and they shall set their business going or... whatever you want to call that! until the Judge enters looking for a shave.The acting is amazing. I have never heard of George Hearn but he was the highlight of the show with his performance as Todd. I mean he plays the role coming off as downright psychotic in some scenes but in others he could come off as downright normal. His singing voice is also really really good. I could also say all the cast members are very very good. I would only bring up three exceptions  Judge Turpin I mean he DID come across as a creepy old bastard but I just think his singing voice strikes me the wrong way Tobias I know they couldn't get a little kid to do it especially in a story this dark and twisted but even then I didn't really like the performance mainly for the same reason as the Judge something about their performance strikes me the wrong way and Joanna but that maybe because she's my least favourite character in the entire musical.As far as the production goes I think the orchestra did a really good job and I also liked that it wasn't just the rotating set that was on the stage when I saw it live. I mean if you know what I'm talking about then I know that thing wouldn't be easy to make but I did prefer people rushing out and bringing the stuff in and out that's necessary to that part of the story. Just call it personal preference  either way for a stage production this is really good production design.I really don't think I can say anything else because I've covered almost everything. I would say if you're a slight fan of the Tim Burton movie or like the Broadway musical and haven't seen this I suggest that you check it out. I haven't seen many adaptations of Sweeney Todd but I think after this I won't be able to top it... still I'm going to check them out anyway.";

	schema:reviewBody "I don't think I can add to the praise given to this wonderful production. The musical itself is a masterpiece in its own right and I honestly loved this production. I loved the darkness and bleakness of the sets and that while the costumes are nothing fancy they are effective and nice to look at. The score is utterly magnificent the music is completely memorable and the lyrics are something that I love to quote the opening chorus the epiphany Green Finch and Linnet Bird and the ending stand out especially. The dialogue is darkly humorous the story is suitably macabre and entertaining and even the make up is good.The performances both acting and singing were superb. The only person I had a problem with was Betsy Joslyn's Johanna I just found her singing shrill at times and there were a few moments in Green Finch and Linnet Bird where she was pitchy. Joslyn aside George Hearn is superlative as Sweeney funny chilling and handsome and what a voice. His Sweeney is by far my favourite Sweeney ever and the great Angela Lansbury matches him perfectly as Nellie Lovett. Cris Groenendaal was a charming Anthony and Edmund Lyndeck stands out in a considerable way as Judge Turpin. Even the chorus were great. Overall if you love Sweeney Todd this is a must see. 9.510 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "I finally got hold of a DVD copy of this production and was agog with curiosity since I had read so many people praising it to the skies particularly Angela Lansbury's portrayal of Mrs. Lovett. I saw the Tim Burton movie a few months ago and thought it over the top and overly bloody thankfully this version is not so horrifying gory but it suffers dramatically in too many other ways for it to be in the least satisfying to me.To begin with the casting. George Hearn is adequate and at least shows some expression as opposed to Johnny Depp's unending wooden face in the movie. Angela Lansbury is quite simply annoying. At least she has enough power in her voice to get the point across as opposed to Helena Bonham Carter's piping and expressionless little girl's voice but subtlety seems to be only a word in the dictionary to Ms. Lansbury. One cannot be drawn into the story when one of the main characters spends her entire time mugging and winking in a look Ma I'm acting! fashion and being far too aware of the audience. This is not something that is typical of stage productions heaven knowsI have been a regular attendee of many productions at the Stratford Festial for many years and stage actors do NOT behave in that fashion as a rule at least those who want to continue to find regular employment do not!...Betsy Joslyn. Oh dear oh dear oh dear. Did anybody besides me notice that she can't sing this role even vaguely appropriately? And her playing George Hearn's daughter is just creepy considering that she was married to him at the time. Isn't she supposed to be a sweet little sixteenyearold? Yes I realize that this is what acting is all about but not once did she convince me that she was any younger than about thirtyfive and the phrase mutton dressed as lamb seems to have been coined just for her. Her butchering of Green Finch And Linnet Bird had me gnashing my teeth and ready to turn off the DVD player at once. That song was done so well in Tim Burton's movie and this was a sad shock. The song requires the vocal range of Julie Andrews in the 1960's and a purity of voice that is only comparable to that of a boy soprano. Any vibrato at all kills it dead and Ms. Joslyn spent the entire time warbling so hard that I thought she was about to fall off of her ladder because she was trembling so much from the effort at sustaining coloratura notes with a voice that is a mezzo at best. Let us pass over the spectacle of her vibrating at least a quarter tone flat on at least three of the higher notes... This is quite simply not a coloratura role and perhaps a discerning director should have told her thatbut the fact that she was married to the star might possibly have tied the director's hands.Cris Groenendaal was adequate but again obviously far too old for the role and there is zero chemistry between him and Ms. Joslyn which makes the whole subplot fall completely flat. I am reminded a little of past stage productions of Wagner's Ring cycle where due to the vocal power required for the singers to bellow over the sound of a full Wagnerian orchestra they would have to cast based upon ability to penetrate vocally as opposed to any appearance or acting ability or even a good voice which is why you have the caricature of the massive mountainous Vikinghorned Brunehilde with a triple chin and a beard when the libretto calls for an ethereal beauty who is eternally young and bewitching. The casting of the juvenile leads is exactly like thatif you close your eyes you can almost believe in Mr. Groenendaal's Anthony but as soon as you look at the screen the illusion is shattered. And at NO time can you ever believe in Ms. Joslyn's Johanna... For me the rest of the production was completely lost because of three out of the four major characters were so obviously miscast. I cannot give a proper review of anything else because they were so distracting that they spoiled the rest of the production. I really can't understand why people rave about this badlyshot and selfconscious filming of a stage play. Surely there's more to camera work in the theatre than just plunking a camera down in the front row? If I want that I'll go to a decent play preferably at the Stratford Festival where at least they work together for the production and aren't constantly mugging for the camera. I give it three stars only because the quality of the production apart from the antics of Lansbury and Joslyn seems adequate if not spectacular.Probably the best thing one can do is buy the soundtrack of the film and a cast recording of this play and then combine the two to make a bearable whole. That's what I'm going to do and try to forget that I ever bothered to rent this wholly unremarkable production.".

Despite some other misinformed user reviews the role was performed accurately and without clich by the actress Taylor Roberts. Also a standout was Fran Kranz whose natural ease well complemented the more season veteran actors. Although the direction hit a snag here or there it seemed the only problems were with an underdeveloped script. What maybe worked well as a stageplay didn't hold out quite so well on screen. However the lovely cinematography by Paul Ryan definitely makes up for that as well as the pace of the film which is surprisingly not slow. I recommend this movie to fans of six feet under and also fans of plain good acting and cinematography.".

Amy Madigan played the part of a guilt ridden mother who is tired yet well intentioned and determined to make up for her younger daughter's condition. Yet in the process she has neglected her older sister who is more interested in playing with her savantsyndrome sibling and living in a world of escapism.The men in the movie are very powerful in their secondary roles. Christopher Lloyd in a very understated role shows us why he has such versatility. He plays a teacher who is dedicated to his profession and literature research yet starved for a meaningful relationship. He and Madigan connect very well in their scenes together yet both know nothing more can come from their friendship. Their wordless goodbye is nothing short of brilliant an acting lesson for aspiring performers.And in a small role Fred Savage is fun to watch.You can tell why this movie was based on a play it's probably very good on stage. On screen it's not particularly exciting but it's nonetheless very thoughtful and powerful in its subtleties.".

The acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch.The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good. They're acceptable and Evie's world is wreathed in color and light which makes for some very beautiful images but it's not very consistent. It's not really so much of a flaw as a result of a low production value but within that same value is some genuine storytelling and a real care for the characters.

The parental absence at all important junctures in Lauren Ambrose's school search provide admissions interviews only and draws the interviews with them at below transcript quality review that in 30 minutes sabotages four years of high school grading. The incident of anger in her mother obviously block a mothers display of possible physical abuse of her or her disabled sister at one time or another thus masking her Mother's truer involvement in family losses. The daughter Lauren really has done something big  trying to make her mother fulfilled and then that plan itself somewhat heroic in light of the age she is  still giving when everyone around her taking somersaults on her. A heart not yet connected to her head  something that age has never had a genuine answer to even to this day. Her replacement of a significant other not necessarily requiring a father image however a trusted authority nonetheless being imagined if not real. A pure cup without a handler .......see the movie. Everyone needs a friend to see through understanding of a proportional world  she made hers up on what she knew of life at the time. She has all the mental capacity for higher learning though having no friends present for her time makes the ending a developmental tragedy in progress ... given a bird in a cage... not a puppy... that would a least get her walking two times a day. Ideas out of the roof she is under would be the developing on her sidewalk life. Sad is the looming psychiatric ending... how could she be committed at a time when she has proved an important responsibility? believe it or not taking of a dog is a better witness than taking care of a bird at this time of her life The symbolic cage of her in a cage is too much mental and self fulfilling of some of her writings within the story. The neighbor college freshman is developed just fine he is as developed as the training education will allow for the mental maturity that dwarfs her eternal purpose compared to his fateful conditioning. I myself eventually just went to the Mensa magazine and got a 20.00 degree saying I was an HonDDiv. It offered all the education that buying the truth would and independence to skip fecal content. Run the world or do not get your own home was the college offer. Who was freeing anyone for superior time for the learning? The only sin is not having your pleasure right. What fight figged on that? She has been denied an act for life commensurate to her love for life. What is college a reward for failing high school? Do you graduate with your class or without it  what is the exchange? A lifetime of correcting youth with only questions? Could lead occur wo a question? The loss followed as much for good as bad. When was she given a mind for sexual intimacy or growth for her good self to be fulfilled? Why didn't good people treat her with good things? If good people do not do good things for good people what is good for? She is young pretty and walked on long before personal development is given a winning game. Her act taken in life with a closed door. Perhaps the title would be better as Christmas Doors not Admissions.".

The incident of anger in her mother obviously block a mothers display of possible physical abuse of her or her disabled sister at one time or another thus masking her Mother's truer involvement in family losses. The daughter Lauren really has done something big  trying to make her mother fulfilled and then that plan itself somewhat heroic in light of the age she is  still giving when everyone around her taking somersaults on her. A heart not yet connected to her head  something that age has never had a genuine answer to even to this day. Her replacement of a significant other not necessarily requiring a father image however a trusted authority nonetheless being imagined if not real. A pure cup without a handler .......see the movie. Everyone needs a friend to see through understanding of a proportional world  she made hers up on what she knew of life at the time. She has all the mental capacity for higher learning though having no friends present for her time makes the ending a developmental tragedy in progress ... given a bird in a cage... not a puppy... that would a least get her walking two times a day. Ideas out of the roof she is under would be the developing on her sidewalk life. Sad is the looming psychiatric ending... how could she be committed at a time when she has proved an important responsibility? believe it or not taking of a dog is a better witness than taking care of a bird at this time of her life The symbolic cage of her in a cage is too much mental and self fulfilling of some of her writings within the story. The neighbor college freshman is developed just fine he is as developed as the training education will allow for the mental maturity that dwarfs her eternal purpose compared to his fateful conditioning. I myself eventually just went to the Mensa magazine and got a 20.00 degree saying I was an HonDDiv. It offered all the education that buying the truth would and independence to skip fecal content. Run the world or do not get your own home was the college offer. Who was freeing anyone for superior time for the learning? The only sin is not having your pleasure right. What fight figged on that? She has been denied an act for life commensurate to her love for life. What is college a reward for failing high school? Do you graduate with your class or without it  what is the exchange? A lifetime of correcting youth with only questions? Could lead occur wo a question? The loss followed as much for good as bad. When was she given a mind for sexual intimacy or growth for her good self to be fulfilled? Why didn't good people treat her with good things? If good people do not do good things for good people what is good for? She is young pretty and walked on long before personal development is given a winning game. Her act taken in life with a closed door. Perhaps the title would be better as Christmas Doors not Admissions.";

I usually go out to the local cinema with my husband and feel as if we are held captive to the latest Sequel or Prequel that Hollywood throws at us. This was DIFFERENT and surprisingly  SO MUCH more entertaining than anything Hollywood spends millions advertising. When my husband and I go the movies we go to be entertained  and Half Empty did just that and the film did so in a smart manner that made me feel as if my trip to the movie theater was worth it. It is a funny human and surprising sometimes musical story that cleverly entertains in its simplicity. I especially enjoyed the scene with the 4 men singing in harmony in the bathroom. It is almost like an operetta. That particular scene reminded me of a scene in Phantom of the Opera when 4 of the performers did not just i.e. they sang against one another in a friendly retort. I am not a film maven but this film was more enjoyable than any other major studio film I have seen lately. It is silly funny entertaining and amusing. Completely enjoyable  which is what I expect from movies but rarely do they deliver like Half Empty.".

There is very little swearing in it but it alludes to some sexual situations.Sadly it has never been released on tape or DVD although it was shown by some pay services 15 years or so ago.  I happened to tape it off of the defunct Stardust Theater and watch it occasionally it's just as funny today as it was in 1978.Too bad they don't release it on DVD as it's a classic example of '70 humor and Sellers deadpan wisecracks are just as good now as when he was alive.".

This dross was made during what must have been one of Sellers' For A Few Dollars More periods when he'd participate in any crap for a few bucks. I'd seen this as a 15year old high school student in 1972 and loathed it then. No need to view it again after 35 years I remember it now as one of the top five worst movies I'd seen as a kid. As I recall Sellers had more of an ongoing cameo role than a lead here but even his presence couldn't ameliorate the stale jokes lame plot and infantile repartee. One ongoing theme revolves around Sellers' use of his fingers In one scene he holds up his open hand to a group of medicos and by folding down his fingers enumerates the groups for which a hospital exists  the interns the nurses the administrators etc.  until only his middle finger is left up whereupon he says ...and the patients! Har Har. In another scene to avoid costly lab tests he dips a finger into a urine sample and sticks it into his mouth to check for sugar then exhorts the interns gathered around him to do the same which they do. He then advises them that he'd placed his middle finger in the urine but sucked on the index finger and admonishes them to pay attention. Hee Hee. The only reason that I remember this and this movie and am writing this review is that a friend told me an even dumber version of this 'joke' today. If yu laik thiss you gonna luv dis movey. If not see 'Hospital' with George C. Scott came out the same year 1972 for some genuine marvelous black medical humor. Better yet read 'The House of God' by Samuel Shem and if you can see the movie version of it which has never been released please make a copy and send it to me  I'd love to finally see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was disappointed by Where Does It Hurt? For years I heard about this travesty of a movie starring Peter Sellers in the midst of the worst dry patch of his career. I expected something memorably awful.What I saw instead was a lame but eager satire about a big city hospital bad jokes flying fast and loose across an assortment of ill defined characters all culminating in a drunken orgy featuring a circumcision and a mariachi band. It's not a good movie but it's got enough energy and curiosity value to make it mildly dynamic and entertaining to someone with low expectations.Sellers plays the memorably named Albert T. Hopfnagel administrator of Vista Vue Hospital in California. Hopfnagel is the sort of guy so corrupt he orders a nurse to leave a dead guy in his hospital room for an extra hour so they can charge his family for another day. His mentality permeates to the staff so that when laidoff worker Lester Hammond Rick Lenz walks in for a chest exam he is pegged as a target for an unnecessary appendix removal.What's supposed to be wrong with me? Hammond asks a nurse.That's between you and your doctor she replies.Director Rod Amateau who cowrote both the script and the source novel uses a cutscreen effect to show how Hammond's bill is constantly being added to with spurious charges. The point of this satire that doctors are greedy and unethical and administrators even worse is established in the first five minutes and beaten to death for the rest of the movie. Shot in a rather flat and stiff manner by the aptlynamed cinematographer Brick Marquard Where Does It Hurt has a slapdash quality about it in every respect.The jokes are pretty weak in the main with a lot of ethnic japery more lazy than mean. Pat Morita as a lab technician tells a sexy administrator played by JoAnn Pflug that she makes his eyes round while a doctor proposes a circumcision thusly Someday he might want to marry Barbra Streisand!I actually miss the days when bad jokes like that weren't hanging offenses. The thing about Where Does It Hurt? is that the bad jokes like the persistent but enjoyable countryrock score by minor castmember Keith Ellison land with a kind of zeal that makes the film easier to take. The movie has a unique 1970s gonzo quality like Rip Taylor cutting up on the Gong Show. Sometimes the jokes are even funny especially those at the expense of Harold Gould as an incompetent surgeon who okayed Hammond's operation and now worries about being caught.What should I do? he asks another doctor Paul Lambert who happens to be his brotherinlaw.Why don't you go into airconditioning?That doesn't read funny but the deadpan actors sell it. This goes for Sellers too whose offbeat characterization of the hyperefficient Hopfnagel keeps you on your toes. He's not in a quality film but he manages to make something fun out of the experience of watching him. Maybe it's just those cool sunglasses or the way he smugly looks at a framed portrait of Vista Vue and mutters Tomorrow the world!I can't recommend Where Does It Hurt? but I can't really pan it either. Maybe it's just because I saw it for free on YouTube but whatever the reason whether it was a fierce commitment to their craft or free cocaine on the set its players work too hard in their misdirected way to warrant its terrible rep. It just doesn't gel into anything memorable for better or worse.".

Darn well I guess I will get ridiculed and spat upon here but for me this was a pretty good flick when I saw it. It has been awhile however I remember it used to come on HBO late at night and I watched it two or three times and I haven't seen it really since and I would love to watch it again now knowing Jolie was in it. The story follows a cyborg and a guy trying to escape the clutches of this corporation and some bounty hunters after them. I think that is basically all there is to it throw in a few scenes with Jack Palance and we have our movie. Some good action here and there and some blood and violence as well. There is also a love story at play as well as the female cyborg and the guy who trained her to fight kind of fall in love with each other. The dialog sometimes becomes rather bad at times and it is by far not a top notch film but for a bmovie it is really good. I don't know if it was a theatrical release though because it does not seem high quality enough for that but it does make for one of the better direct to videos if it was one of those.".

But the more I thought about I guess I might have to agree the special effects are better Angelina Jolie is in this one need I say more? the fights scenes are about the same the acting is about the same and the story is equally bad.  So I guess I'd agree that this film is a little better than the original but they're both pretty bad movies.I think it's safe to say that SciFi is my favorite genre and I think this movie was just awful.  It had some cool things here and there but overall was not very good.  The only reason I can see to sit through this movie is to see the beautiful Angelina Jolie she looks incredible in this film!!!! The rest of the cast was ok but definitely nothing special.  I did enjoy seeing SvenOle Thorsen  in the film though from Gladiator and a good amount of Arnold Schwarzenegger films.Unless you're a diehard scifi fan andor an Angelina Jolie fan I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see this film.  But if you do end up seeing this movie I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for readingChris".

	schema:reviewBody "When I heard about a sequel for Van Damme's absolute worst film Cyborg I rolled my eyes and thought Oh no....Why did they make this? To cash in on the success of a movie that WASN'T a success? There's no way this will be good....Well....I was eating my words about fifteen minutes into it.Cyborg 2 Glass Shadow is by no means a masterpiece nor is it an especially inspiring thriller but I was surprised how entertaining it was. This might be due to the fact that it completely abandoned the plot of the first film and started from scratch thus it can be viewed as a completely original motion picture. The plot is pretty standard late into the 21st century a company calls PINWHEEL have developed cyborgs that look and act just like real humans even down to emotions. If God didn't make you we did one of the big business men quotes.But what if one of the cyborgs begins to recognize independence as Cash a beautiful Angelina Jolie does? That's when Mercy comes in. Mercy is a freelance cyborg who after the death of his wife has dedicated his life to helping renegade cyborgs beat the system and flee to another country. The part is played by Jack Palance who actually does a good job though he spends most of the time on a computer screen with closeups of his mouth.At any rate Cash decides to flee and she takes along a human to guide her and he also happens to be in love with her.... His name is Colt a skilled warrior Elias Corteas who bears a close resemblance to Robert DeNiro. Pinwheel sends two people to track them Danny a chilling Billy Drago and Chan the standard orientalwarriorcyborg chick. So it's a desparate race for the two to survive in an odd futuristic city.It's pretty much a standard plot from there which is predictable and easy to figure out. But at least it HAS a plot something the first film can't claim. And this film has good qualities in other areas. The special effects are above average including the awesome shots of a batterycharged city of 2170! The characters are also well drawn out and defined with nice chemistry between the two leads and a chilling performance by Drago....That man is evil incarnate. Good score too.... Does anyone know if the soundtrack is available? Lastly the action is wellchoreographed with some nice settings.Summing it up the director knows what he's doing and he managed to make a soso plot get lifted by an excellent cast great memorable characters topofthedrawer dialogue okay special effects and good stunts. Recommended if you're like me I hated the first film. It's worth taping if it ever comes on TV again...I know I will....12 out of ".

Terrified by this knowledge  she enlists the aid of her human martial arts trainer named Colt. With his help she battles past armed guards and escapes to the outside world. Jack Palance stars as Mercy a renegade android who assists other androids seeking freedom and appears mostly as a mouth on a television screen throughout most of the movie. Billy Drago gives his typically good performance as the tough greedy and antagonistic bounty hunter sent after Cash and Colt. This movie while limited in budget has nevertheless earned a respectable place on my shelf along with the other great B movies. Add this one to your collection of fine science fiction films! Two thumbs up!".

I am not a big fan of Ms. Jolie's though I will say that her performance was stellar! Her blank stare and robotic acting really did have me believing that she was an android hooker. If anyone has a clip of her on 'Inside the Actor's Studio' explaining how she prepared for this role please send it my way. I'll make sure to use it when I try James Lipton for Crimes against Integrity.So what drove me to rent this movie? One would think that it was the hope of seeing Angelina Jolie's nipples but it wasn't. No the reason behind this rental rested solely on one of the images on the cover of the DVD that of Jack Palance's face! HALF OF HIS FACE WAS ROBOTIC! When I saw that I imagined legions of Palances slowly marching through a fiery wasteland laying waste to any humans that were foolish enough to resist. In my mind's eye every member of this Unholy Army of Palances had a red glowing eye a red glowing eye that looked at humans and saw only meat. They were to be the Architects of Oblivion...a cold steely Apocalypse...a Nightmare from which Humanity would never awaken. It's a beautiful image that I will cherish till the end of my years.Like most things in my life the actual movie did not live up to my expectations. No there was only 'one' Jack Palance and the only visible cybernetic enhancements that he had were located on his legs. Sadly those enhancements didn't really enhance anything. That is unless you count WALKING LIKE A POLIO VICTIM as a super power. At least their was a scene where Jackgrinning like a triggerhappy Alzheimer's patientgot to shoot the hell out of some people. I was waiting for him to yell I'm damn tired of paying too much for prescription medication! Unfortunately any outbursts of geriatric rage were few and far between.What the movie did have an abundance of was a poorly developed love story about a manElias Koteas a.k.a. poor man's De Niro and a cyborgAngelina Jolie a.k.a. Demon Spawn of John Voigt. Oh man can the love between a Romeo of Flesh and a Juliet of Silicon ever be able to last?!?!?! It can if you follow Jack Palance's simple advice You have to TASTE each other's TIME.Yeah I'm not sure what that means. However I am sure that I do not want Jack Palance to be the one to explain it to me. I sure as heck don't want him to show me! As an experiment I suggest that you ask your significant other if heshe thinks that we have reached a level in our relationship where we can begin to TASTE each other's TIME?".

	schema:reviewBody "The fact that Cyborg 2 Glass Shadow has almost nothing to do with the first Cyborg is probably a good thing. I've seen both and the first one is an ugly grimy early starring vehicle for Jean Claude Van Damme that plays like an episode of American Gladiators on PCP. This sequel however is a scrappy little sci fi delight. It takes plays in a futuristic B Movie realm where maniacal corporations wage war on each other for the control of lucrative artificial intelligence cyborgs who can be programmed to be slaves soldiers or whatever you want. Angelina Jolie is Casella 'Cash' Reese a gorgeous warrior Cyborg held under the watchful eye of the Pinwheel corporation ruled by a hammy Allen Garfield. Her trainer a mercenary named Colton Hicks Elias Koteas starts to fall in love with her. In this particular B movie universe it's implied that there are fragments of what may resemble a soul that begin to grow inside the cyborgs and gradually Cash falls for him as well. They plan their escape and embark into a delightfully cheap looking metropolis of the future seeking an oasis far away that's basically a non extradition zone for robots. Pinwheel sends some dangerous bounty hunters after them. There's fighting. And running. And shooting. And Cyborg sex including a 17 year old Angelina going fully topless which makes me wonder how the filmmakers ducked the authorities on that one. Not that I'm complaining. Aside from baring her chesticles she makes a pretty solid action heroine at that age and even before making a name for herself she carries the film pretty well. Koteas is pretty much capable of anything as far as acting goes breezing through this one in his sleep whilst still keeping one eye open to give Hicks a vulnerability and desperation that the film hardly deserves. Character actor Billy Drago gives a scene stealing performance of sheer unbridled lunacy as Danny Bench a terrifyingly unhinged contract killer who pursues the pair and has an absolute smackdown of a fight sequence with Koteas. That old salty dog Jack Palance even shows up for an amusing warmhearted supporting role as a mysterious hacker who helps the duo out and in turn gets his own retribution. Get one thing straight right now this a B movie. If you go into one of these with your critic's brain shovelling coal into the fires of cynicism you're gonna have a bad time. These films are overtly cheap chock full of deliberate plot holes and speckled with acting that could wilt flowers. But I love them anyway. I grew up watching an endless stream of direct to video horror sci fi and thriller flicks that maybe ten people on planet earth besides me have seen. I love them they are amazing and they exist in a realm far far outside film 'criticism'. It's best to gear your brain into fun mode before hitting play then just relax and enjoy. If you're the type of person that can do that you'll love this kind of stuff. If not steer well clear. Cyborg 2 is the perfect example of a B movie done right and I'll be the first to admit that there's plenty that are made with the kind of lifeless ineptitude that doesn't even deserve a place in the genre. This one's cheaply made doesn't have much of a budget to its name yet admirably creates it's own little world with what it has spinning a story of action romance robots and Angelina Jolie. Honestly who can say no to those things? You that's who.".

It doesn't play down Japanese stereotypes as the writers of this film did their homework on life in Japan. I used to watch Japanese baseball and I can tell you that the film does a pretty good interpretation. In Japan the manager of a ball club is more of a nurturing father. It's also more like work than sport. Players run fundamental drills all day and talent takes a backseat to skill. The movie is nicely done and Selleck does a good job as selfish selfcentered Jack Elliot. Dennis Haysbert is also nice in the supporting role of Max DuBois He had enough practice being in baseball movies after being in Major League. Ken Takakura is good as the nononsense manager of the club. It's a shame he hasn't done any other American films after this one. Aya Takanashi is also nice as Jack's love interest. If you can get the video or DVD because the TV version makes some of the most absurd edits and cuts I have seen.".

Whoever chose the shots and locations really understood Japan well.The movie itself should rate among the best baseball movies EVER but doesn't because it's not about American baseball.  Take field of dreams or whatever.  That basically boils down to some plot contrivance about ghosts and whatnot and is only REALLY about the game at a very superficial level despite pretentions otherwise.  This one has an intelligent and realistic view of many aspects of the gameclubhouse behavior onfield action playermanager interactions the business of sports and so on.  If you're into baseball movies view this oneand if you don't like it I challenge you to find ONE other baseball movie that does as well as capturing so many aspects of the game intelligently with a minimum of sap.Characterizations in this movie  yes we all know that by the end of the movie the Tom Selleck character will do something to redeem himself.  In this regard except for one interesting plot nuance not really a twist the plot itself is straightforward.  But the characters all stand on their ownI dont think there is a single bad characterization there with the possible overstereotyped American agent.  From Yoji the interpreter through the teammates who are Japanese jocks to the strong female love interest.. well.. let's put it this way.. if you still think all Japanese look and act alike see this movie.Clearly this isn't the best movie ever made but I really like it on a lot of levels enough that on a scale of one to ten I honestly have to give it a 10 and I rate a lot of movies poorly.  You probably won't like it quite that much but I think you will enjoy itwhether you are male OR female by the way.  Definately a good rent.".

At the plot level you have the paradox of baseball a fine old American game as it is played in Japan  turned around with American values cast off and Japanese values imprinted upon the game. Some of the superficial sports comedy results from Jack's uncomprehending disbelief at how basaboru is played in Japan. You also have a lead character who's presented as an overthehill aging baseball star but who is actually quite immature  pro ball allowed him to postpone growing up. And you have a lead character who is rudely resistant to the changes in his life that are being forced upon him refusing to accept the curveball that life has given him in the midst of a new country a new manager a new team and a new girlfriend who have all welcomed him and try to accept him. Sound like heavy stuff? Not really. It's a charming clash of cultures comedy that takes place on the national sports romantic and professional levels. But if you watch it sensitively enough you will also find a great story about a man who has to abandon his immaturity and grow up way too late in life causing some amount of personal pain and finds success in places he never expected it. I love the story but I also have great respect for Selleck's performance he bares his tush literally to portray an ugly American insulting people and throwing tantrums in public then lets us inside this character to understand his dismay. It also doesn't hurt if you're a big fan of Takakura Ken like I am. MR. BASEBALL is a surprising loss of innocence tale.".

The situation of course  the essential culture clash that all gaijin cultures have with the Japanese  is inherently funny so Lost in Translation is undeniably a funny movie but it has virtually no plot and the other characters though played adequately by Scarlett Johanson and Giovanni Ribisi are little more than props for Mr. Murray. However the movie Dir Sophia Coppola is finely crafted and that counts for something. And I suppose that artful cinematography and other cinematic esoterica have impressed the critics and that their views have bled off into those of the hoi polloi and given them cover for their racist guffaws at the silly Japanese.Meanwhile the standard sports movie plot of Mr. Baseball has provided its critics with an excuse to dismiss the movie because it annoyingly succeeds in actually bridging the cultural gap without in any way sidelining the inherent humor in the situation  which doesn't as it turns out need any kind of exaggerated boost from Mr. Murray's brand of snide. Mr. Baseball actually provides insight into the Japanese culture and thereby also into our own American culture which IMO is the chief benefit of foreign travel and it manages to stop just short at the end from the improbable contrived Hollywood ending. All in all Mr. Baseball manages to artfully and plausibly traverse the tightrope of our expectations and on my own subjective rewatchable scale it beats Lost in Translation all hollow.".

	schema:headline " Based on the book You Gotta Have WA";
	schema:reviewBody "This has always been a favorite movie of mine. I've owned a VHS copy and a couple of months ago I found a DVD release which is also part of my video collection. I also happen to be a huge baseball fan and as part of my offseason reading I picked up a copy of Robert Whiting's excellent book You Gotta Have WA that profiles the ins and outs of Japanese baseball and the challenges that foreign players have encountered playing in Japan. As I began to read yesterday it made me think of this movie because it appears the screenplay was based almost verbatim on this book. The parallels are uncanny. The Jack Elliot character closely resembles Bob Horner an aging MLB slugger whose best days were behind him. Horner's teammate Leon Lee is also depicted in the character Max Hammer Dubois a veteran in the Japanese league who has made his peace with the frustrations of the Japanese game and helps keeps his teammate sane. The Elliot character goes through the same sequence of encounters as Horner from big fanfare signing early success that fuels an already ravenous sports media and the ensuing slump that spurs frustration alienation from teammates fans and media and the resulting disillusionment that prompts a desire to go back home to the US. The only difference is that the movie adds such Hollywood touches as a love interest and a happy ending. Speaking of love interests I'm sure many viewers have come to this site as I did to look up the actress who played Hiroko the beautiful Aya Takanashi and what other work she has done. It only lists this movie. It turns out based on an article I read that the brief love scene she has with Tom Selleck a foreigner in this movie mild by our standards  basically they kiss while he's in the bath and she's wearing a towel caused such an outrage on the part of the Japanese public males in particular that she has never been offered another role of any kind in Movies or television  essentially blackballed by the Japanese movie industry. It's a real shame as she iswas quite a talented actress in this movie. If you like this movie as much for the baseball elements and cultural differences as I did  go find a copy of You Gotta Have WA by Robert Whiting. A good read and a great companion book to this movie.".

It was SO good at capturing its era and dual cultures that it belongs in American and Japanese time capsules. If you wanted to know what living here or there was like back then this film will show you. As an American you'll feel like you tagged along for an extended Japanese vacation and by the end of the film you'll be a diehard Dragons fan as you accept the injection of Japanese tradition and culture into their baseball much as we have done with our culture in our own game.Jack Elliot Tom Selleck is a slumping aging Detroit Tigers' slugger who is traded to the Dragons perennial runnersup to the dynastic Yomuri Giants Japan's answer to the Yankees. The Giants are admired for their success yet that success also has everyone wanting to surpass them something which is rarely done. The Dragons' manager recruits Jack as the final piece of the pennantwinning puzzle and we're left with what could have been Gung Ho on a baseball field but instead was much more.The casting was outstanding Selleck proved that with a good script and a character that suits him he can carry a film as well as he did his television show and the Japanese cast was equally good down to Mr. Takagi from Die Hard back as the imageconscious owner. The other actors including the one who plays the love interest also the manager's daughter strong and independent yet simultaneously a believer in Japanese traditions beyond what was forced on her. She is a proper and supportive girlfriend for Jack. Even her father never tells her not to see him almost sympathizing with Jack for what he endures from her and a bit relieved he at least knows the man she has chosen to love.The baseball scenes are great bolstered immensely by a prefame Dennis Haysbert as another American expatriate and Jack's western mentor. The usual fishoutofwater elements are there and you can almost feel yourself stumbling right along with Jack to fit into a country that doesn't speak our language and doesn't practice our ways yet copies everything we do including our national pastime. one of the funnier scenes occurs when Jack clutching a magazine informs his manager that he has learned of the tradition in Japan where you can get drunk and tell off your boss and it can't be used against you and exercises that right very humorously. The plots and subplots are tied up neatly at the end but not too neatly and nothing concludes unrealistically.To call this a comedy is misguided it's a pure comedydrama or even a drama with good humor. The plot is too deep to dismiss it the way it was by critics as an actor out of his league trying to carry a lightweight film. The situations were amusing but in their place against a far more serious profound and precisely detailed backdrop that results in one of the best films I've ever seen. The baseball cinematography rivals that of For Love Of The Game for realism.Some say the film is about baseball or about Japan but more than anything it seems to be about the workplace and how people arrive at work from totally different origins with different agendas and somehow have to put their differences aside for the good of the company or the team.A truly great film that never should have had to apologize for itself the way it did when it was in theaters.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this 15 years ago in the theater and while I never had the desire to see it again it always stuck with me. Maybe that's because 1 I love baseball 2 hate to see arrogant ballplayers and 3 cringe if I see someone not representing my country in a positive light. That's what you get in this film as Tom Selleck plays a crude profane ugly American ballplayer who's talents have been outlived in the Major Leagues and he's now relegated to play in Japan. Ironically Japan is just starting to make some inroads the other way around especially with Daisuke Matsuzaka and the Red Sox.Anyway Jack Elliott Selleck pouts his way around Japan until he gets involved in a romance which is portrayed somewhat stupidly and leads to a predictable ending. Other characters in here were interesting to watch such as the stern manager played by Ken Takakura. One of the other American players has turned out to be a star in his own right actingwise Dennis Haybert of 24 and now The Unit.There are a lot better baseball movies out there but you could do worse too. It was okay but as an American I get to see enough arrogant pro athletes play here every day. All I have to do is turn on the TV.".

Maybe that's because 1 I love baseball 2 hate to see arrogant ballplayers and 3 cringe if I see someone not representing my country in a positive light. That's what you get in this film as Tom Selleck plays a crude profane ugly American ballplayer who's talents have been outlived in the Major Leagues and he's now relegated to play in Japan. Ironically Japan is just starting to make some inroads the other way around especially with Daisuke Matsuzaka and the Red Sox.Anyway Jack Elliott Selleck pouts his way around Japan until he gets involved in a romance which is portrayed somewhat stupidly and leads to a predictable ending. Other characters in here were interesting to watch such as the stern manager played by Ken Takakura. One of the other American players has turned out to be a star in his own right actingwise Dennis Haybert of 24 and now The Unit.There are a lot better baseball movies out there but you could do worse too. It was okay but as an American I get to see enough arrogant pro athletes play here every day. All I have to do is turn on the TV.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is an excellent little known movie. Tom Selleck does an outstanding job of acting in this movie with the Japanese 'Clint Eastwood'. I'd love to see if this movie has come out on DVD yet there are some spots that clearly have been cut. Hiroku Tom's love interest has clearly had some parts chopped. It would be interesting to see more of Japan in the film. The baseball sequences are far and away the most realistic of any baseball movie I'm quite sure most of the actors were current or former baseball players. I love loading the tape of this movie at least once a year. Best scenes involve the lack of hat tipping after Tom gets beaned in the big game and an intensely sensual scene of Tom having a hot bath with Hiroku. Dennis Haysbert also does a great job it's good to see he's finally getting some recognition not just in baseball movieshe was also in Major League.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mr. Baseball is a unique little film about the Great Game. This is because it takes place in Japan and the plot not only deals with the trials and tribulations of an overthehill American legend seeking to extend his career but also with his problems adjusting to Japan and its life philosophy its manners and customs  and the different way they play ball over there. It's well known that star Tom Selleck is a lifelong baseball nut and a diehard Detroit Tigers fan. This helped considerably in his portrayal of the selfish inpatient expat ball player. He knows the game. Watching his clashes with all things Japanese is entertaining informative and thoughtprovoking. His antagonist Ken Takakura as Chief the Manager of the Dragons is a perfect foil as the two butt heads over literally everything. Eventually Selleck's Jack Elliot is forced to change and that change is what gives this films it's real entertainment. After what seems an eternity he finally understands and the result is a beautiful thing. Selleck's Japanese girlfriend is Aya Takanashi a real beauty who can convey independence hurt pride love and joy all within a few moments was a real find. I was both surprised and disappointed to discover that this is her one and only screen appearance. She never appeared before the camera before Mr. Baseball  and never again afterward. I am bummed. What a waste she has talent. Anyway Mr. Baseball is recommended for all fans of baseball movies AND ALSO for those who enjoy light and enlightening love stories. As for mixing baseball and romance while I grew up adoring Coop and Teresa Wright in Pride Of The Yankees 1942 after a thousand viewings of Pride I'll now take Mr. Baseball.".

Although Elliot is on the downside of his career he has not lost all of his playing skills. Now the trade doesn't stir well with the drinking smoking and womanizing egomaniac. Knowing little about Japanese culture cuisine and mannerisms the gaijin foreign Elliot's awful attitudes form the basic plot of this not unlikeable movie. You just know that the American will quickly butt heads with unflappable Dragon manager Uchiyama Ken Takakura. Meanwhile as athletes attract attractive woman Hiroko Uchiyama Aya Takanashi will become Elliot's love interest. But Hiroko who is no bimbo is an advertising professional who makes commercials for Japanese television. So can the love interest last? Along the way Elliot would do well to heed the advice of new Dragon teammate Max Hammer Dubois Dennis Haysbert not a Frenchmen but an AfricanAmerican. Dubois earlier traded to the Dragons had the gumption to learn Japanese ways and some of the language. Fitting in as well as he can Dubois is resigned to his challenging situation. Conversely as Elliot is green in Japan he is accompanied by an interpreter Yoji Nishimura Toshi Shioya who is wise enough to clean up the American's sardonic comments for the Japanese press. Overall the movie does well in depicting the Japanese sports culture managerplayer interaction the fanfare of the large crowds which appear genuine umpire esteem corporate pressure on the managers and the voracious sports media. Also note the importance placed on saving face which means that certain onfield events are sometimes compromised. The climax involves the big game between the Dragons and their traditional rivals who always seem to beat them the Yomiuri Giants. Will Elliot find redemption? Watch and find out! PS Know that the Japanese certainly love their baseball and have played it a long time. The sport was introduced in Japan in the late 19th century!

Those negative or low reviews generally do so since they think many parts are predictable. SO WHAT!! Very few movies can more can be unpredictable anyway! This is one of those fun movies you can watch and enjoy over and over. The formula really works in this movie. If you like baseball you'll like it even more. It's about a clash in cultures and the cast is excellent! Roger Ebert even liked it predictability and all. I can't believe this only gets a 5.5 overall rating by the members! Tom Selleck is perfectly cast as the aging pro ballplayer who's contract gets sold to a Japanese baseball team and is not thrilled about playing in Japan. All of the supporting cast especially Dennis Haysbert are also perfect for their roles. Anyone who follows baseball or has lived in Japan can confirm how the foreign ballplayers gaigin are treated differently. This film covers this area perfectly. Again a truly enjoyable movie that's fun to watch over and over.".
