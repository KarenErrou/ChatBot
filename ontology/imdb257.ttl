This sequel is awful though the only reasons I don't rate it any lower is that the ending here is a little less stupid than the first one and also that I have seen worse movies. On the other hand it is choppily edited with rather poor effects and locations that didn't really give a sense of interest or engagement. The organ is ridiculously overblown and repetitive overblown I wouldn't have minded so much as long as you could hear what was going on but repetitive is inexcusable if you ask me. The script in the first Cyborg Cop did have some cheesy moments but also some fun witty ones. The sequel has the cheese but none of the wit. The story is derivative and predictable like the first but unlike the first it also made the mistake of being dull with unexciting action sequences and the characters are stock with no tension or empathy whatsoever elicited towards the hero. Cyborg Cop II also has a misleading title and seemingly has no connection to the first not even the annoying reporter from the first film. The acting fares little better David Bradley is made to do arrogant and chauvinistic and he seems uncomfortable doing it and Morgan Hunter is hammy and not very menacingJohn Rhys Davies one of the best assets about the first is missed here. All in all the first Cyborg Cop was not bad the sequel is to me. And no I don't need somebody who clearly doesn't know the meaning of the word opinion let alone spell it to tell me I have no sense of humour thank you very much! 210 Bethany Cox".

I did however decide to check it out as the DVD was cheap and it was by NuImage who did an excellent straight to video movie titled Hard Justice the following year. And to my huge surprise I actually found this to be an enjoyable little cheesefest.Sure it's campy it's clichd and doesn't exactly score high in terms of acting plot or originality but it's well aware of all those and with those all taken into account makes the best of them and comes out smiling. David Bradley who I've considered to be one of the better actors in the Baction genre provides a fun performance. He's well aware of the movie he's in and makes the most of it. Morgan Hunter as the mobster turned cyborg provides a suitably over the top performance that's a lot of fun to watch.Certainly it doesn't let down in terms of action. You'll get plenty of explosions and our hero flying through the air with a pistol in each hand numerous times. Opening with a huge warehouse shootout with a large bodycount and an especially huge explosive scene at a Gas station. Production values are generally above average only let down by some obvious stunt doubles and blatant modelwork which fortunately doesn't appear on screen for very long. Overall they're definitely no worse than Commando. It doesn't appear that producers have ever said No at any point to what director Sam Firstenberg has asked for as you'll get several big scale action scenes with tons of stunts and explosions which is rather impressive for such a little known and obviously low budget movie. Embarrassingly there isn't actually a huge amount which Universal Soldier for example does which this doesn't which either says a lot of bad things about it or a lot of good things about this depending on your point of view.One thing I did notice however was that while the movie is set in the USA it is quite obviously not filmed there. Where it is I'm not sure but if you know a thing or two about cars you'll notice a LOT which aren't sold in the USA such as Fiat's and an exploding Ford Sierra at the gas station scene.Like a James Bond movie Cyborg Cop 2 provides the familiar ingredients that fans of Baction movies like to see time and time again. Turn off your brain grab a few beers and watch and by the end you'll probably have the overblown organ music stuck on your mind for a few days. Yes it's silly it's clichd but for what it is it works.".

Cyborg Soldier is one of those movies that sort of just happens as you watch it. I didn't hate it because to hate it would indicate that I had an opinion of it. Basically it's Robocop Terminator Universal Soldier and Nemesis rolled into one. I loved the first two movies I mentioned I liked the third and found some merit in the last so you would think a movie that could mix and match elements from each would be a winner. It's not. David Bradley is blah in the lead role although the best thing about the movie he's not nearly as terrible of a presence of say Lorenzo Lamas or Don The Dragon Wilson but he definitely has less charisma than your Van Dammes SeagalsLundgrens and Dudikoffs. The main problem though is that it's really flatly directed. None of the action crackles it should as the choreography is pretty good there looks to be somewhat of a budget given the numerous explosions and yet nothing rises above the uninspired. Cyborg Cop wasn't very good either but that one had a sort of distinctive B.movie charm this sequel lacks even that and the film is dreary and unexciting. Die hard fans of 90s B.movies may find something worthwhile here but for me I found it dreary and unexciting. A mindless thing to watch on TV when you can't fall asleep I still recommend sleeping pills. 12 Out of 4 Poor".

This is one of those movies during which you basically turn off your brain and enjoy it. Don't expect some good acting script adventure or anything else. We have a solidly fun action scenes and that's all. David Bradley is back with his usual appearance just like in the first film dark clothes white athletic shirt unshaved waist bag husky quiet badass voice and of course martial arts skills the only thing that actually appreciate for Bradley. He is Jack Ryan a usual hero name a DEA that captures a dangerous criminal Starkraven pretty generic and usual name for a villain and to increase the plot intensity Ryan killed Starkraven's brother so the movie didn't even begin properly and we already have personal story Shortly after arresting Starkraven he is sent to a scientific facility where he's turned into a cyborg a little naive I feel always picking those evil villains to be a proud solution of scientists who made some miscalculations To add that actor who played Starkraven Morgan Hunter is nothing special he was picked for a part definitely because of his bald menacing looks. When he becomes a cyborg his voice changes and it's ridiculously enhanced. The cyborg make up is funny you can clearly see that their feet hands and some other body parts are in rubber all cyborg units look stuffed like they suffered some taxidermy syndrome. So Jack finds out that Starkraven is a cyborg and he went on to stop him. And Jack pops cyborgs like a candy just like we saw in the first film so this means that Jack is using his experience with cyborgs pretty good. So overall a dumb but enjoyable low budget film to also mention that it contains a scene that is stolen from Terminator 2 he he he Enjoy it if you want.".

He is Jack Ryan a usual hero name a DEA that captures a dangerous criminal Starkraven pretty generic and usual name for a villain and to increase the plot intensity Ryan killed Starkraven's brother so the movie didn't even begin properly and we already have personal story Shortly after arresting Starkraven he is sent to a scientific facility where he's turned into a cyborg a little naive I feel always picking those evil villains to be a proud solution of scientists who made some miscalculations To add that actor who played Starkraven Morgan Hunter is nothing special he was picked for a part definitely because of his bald menacing looks. When he becomes a cyborg his voice changes and it's ridiculously enhanced. The cyborg make up is funny you can clearly see that their feet hands and some other body parts are in rubber all cyborg units look stuffed like they suffered some taxidermy syndrome. So Jack finds out that Starkraven is a cyborg and he went on to stop him. And Jack pops cyborgs like a candy just like we saw in the first film so this means that Jack is using his experience with cyborgs pretty good. So overall a dumb but enjoyable low budget film to also mention that it contains a scene that is stolen from Terminator 2 he he he Enjoy it if you want.";

Here again is another movie I decided to watch primarily based on the cast. I mean with Neve Campbell Kathy Bates and Danny Devito I hoped I was going to get some satisfaction at least and I was certainly right. I thankfully came across this movie because it was at a video store near me that I went to all the time that carried a lot of obscure movies among popular ones of course. I most definitely did not find it because it had any publicity or anything which is why it is so unknown. Relative Strangers is all around very fun and entertaining and well worth the time. While it is not a masterpiece like I said I enjoyed it a lot and thought it was a well made film regardless of minor mediocrities due to budget and indistinguishable crew members I mean the director was only known for the Meet the Parents series basically if anyone knew him for that and also I do realize it is not the greatest film ever. I got the movie for the cast as I have mentioned that's it and that is another reason why I enjoyed it as much as I did. Though the film is not necessarily fantastic on it's own the cast is wonderful and works with the material amazingly. Neve Campbell and Kathy Bates are a delight for me at least in any film anyway. The story is not amazing and the other main actor whose name escapes me if I ever knew it in the first place is not as enjoyable as the other three really well known stars but it's genuine enjoyability if you loosen up is what makes this film come through in the end. So should you give Relative Strangers a chance if you happen to come across this comment? If you know you will be able to like it for what it is a fun and endearing little speculation then most definitely because it is just a very fun movie with some heartwarming qualities. I was very pleased with the outcome and am glad I had the chance to view it. Do not even pay attention to it's ridiculous rating.".

Danny DeVito and Kathy Bates play the whitetrash birth parents of Ron Livingston an uptight self help author. His fiance is played by the incredibly sexy Neve Campbell who I could watch in anything. DeVito and Bates characters are very broad almost cartoons but by the end of the film you really feel they are real people and the film packs an emotional punch that was really unexpected. Along the way are some hilarious scenes..Bates and DeVito are a great team! I loved the talk show appearance where his parents unexpectedly of course show up and he loses it. It seems like so many films have to be about something deep and have a cynical edge nowadays but this film was just fun to watch and left me smiling at the end. The audience I saw it with exploded with laughs frequently through out. I can imagine this film is not for every taste but if you can relax and just enjoy a feel good fun comedy I recommend this film highly".

What if you are a successful writer of selfcontrol books and you found two weeks before your marriage with gorgeous Neve Campbell that your true parents are not the highclass couple that raised you but Danny DeVitto and Kathy Bates a popular circus pair of failed clowns throwing bad jokes and inheriting you nothing but a bunch of hereditary diseases? Unfortunately this is more or less where the fun of the movie stops. The rest is so predictable that you could have written the script yourself. Ron Linvingston is as funny as a evening news broadcaster DeVitto and Campbell do their expected game and only Kathy Bates is funny and looks comfortable and gorgeous yes! in her role but this is not enough.

You missed the entire point  this is fun entertainment!!! Its so refreshing to see a movie that you can just enjoy for what it is and not walk out trying to figure out the deeper meaning of what the movie was really about.

Still Katie Bates is a pleasure to watch but although she provides a very convincing performance as 'trailer trash' as us the nonAmerican viewers are supposed to imagine it from all the previous films on the subject one can't help but wonder are all those speech patterns that the screenplay limits her character to real?

He commits to playing the role a certain way and you don't understand why and you don't really like him. More than an hour into the movie they reveal why he is acting the way he did and it kind of makes sense but he's already lost your sympathy by that point.But if Devito and Bates as total white trash screaming at each other lines like If brains was chocolate you wouldn't even have a MM is something you want to see in a comedy then you should see this movie because there will probably never be another movie where that happens. If you go with them they keep the movie entertaining.Stick around for the end credits their duet is almost certainly the highlight of the film.

I sure do and yes sometimes I am a little embarrassed. But when i comes down to it. They are the genuine most loving people and the ones that truly stand by you. I can not believe how wonderful Kathy Bates was and what an actress she is that she can do so many different parts. What a hoot she is. I had a bunch of people over and we watched this video and we went out of our minds laughing and I have not had a laugh like this in a long time and did it ever feel good. I do not know why this was not out in the theaters more. They should run it again through the theaters. I have got to say it was wonderful and a truly must see film. Neve Cambell and Ron Livingston were sweet but it was really the rest of the cast that stole the show and I mean they stole it. I do not know who these ones that gave it a bad review are but then again I saw lots of great reviews for For Your Consideration and that one hardly had a chuckle. And Beverly D'Angelo I did not even know who she was and she was great. So was Christine Baranski and this time she was so good with just letting you know with her facial expressions.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dr. Richard Clayton Ron Livingston seems to be living the perfect life. He is a successful psychologistturnedwriter and his latest book on anger management is doing well. In addition he is engaged to a beautiful kind lady Ellen Neve Campbell and they share a lovely home. But one day his disgruntled slacker brother drops the Abomb that is he informs his bro that he Richard is the adopted sibling of the family. Richie's snobby parents Edward Hermann and Christine Baranski concede that it is true but that it made no difference in their love for him or his brother. Yet Richard is stunned and suddenly curious. At Ellen's urging he begins a search for his birth parents. Soon after Frank Danny DeVito and Agnes Menure Kathy Bates arrive on the doc's doorstep and announce that they are his true father and mother. It is a shock as the Menures are excarnies live in a trailer park and sell pest control products to support themselves. And while they are lively interesting folks Frank and Agnes are definitely a bit uncouth as it were. Richard is forelorn and his unhappiness grows each day the Menures extend their visit to Richie's home. Can they all really belong to the same gene pool? This is a funny film distinctively enhanced by the terrific cast. Livingston is just right as the confused disgruntled doctor while Campbell is lovely and sweet as the supportive fianc. As for DeVito and Bates they chew up the screen with their humorous outrageous turns as the farfromrefined folks who nevertheless may have bigger hearts than most. All of the niceties of filmmaking from costumes to sets to camera work are first rate too. If you are looking for mirth on an upcoming film night give this one a whirl. It is definitely no stranger to comedy as a viewing will result in big smiles for everyone.".

But one day his disgruntled slacker brother drops the Abomb that is he informs his bro that he Richard is the adopted sibling of the family. Richie's snobby parents Edward Hermann and Christine Baranski concede that it is true but that it made no difference in their love for him or his brother. Yet Richard is stunned and suddenly curious. At Ellen's urging he begins a search for his birth parents. Soon after Frank Danny DeVito and Agnes Menure Kathy Bates arrive on the doc's doorstep and announce that they are his true father and mother. It is a shock as the Menures are excarnies live in a trailer park and sell pest control products to support themselves. And while they are lively interesting folks Frank and Agnes are definitely a bit uncouth as it were. Richard is forelorn and his unhappiness grows each day the Menures extend their visit to Richie's home. Can they all really belong to the same gene pool? This is a funny film distinctively enhanced by the terrific cast. Livingston is just right as the confused disgruntled doctor while Campbell is lovely and sweet as the supportive fianc. As for DeVito and Bates they chew up the screen with their humorous outrageous turns as the farfromrefined folks who nevertheless may have bigger hearts than most. All of the niceties of filmmaking from costumes to sets to camera work are first rate too. If you are looking for mirth on an upcoming film night give this one a whirl. It is definitely no stranger to comedy as a viewing will result in big smiles for everyone.";

The films premise is about a 35 year old man finding out he is adopted pretty bland for a comedy film and might I add Ben Stiller had already done this concept in almost the same exact way several years before in the more successful 'Flirting with Disaster'. I believe that if not the characters portrayed by Bates and DeVito had been so down to Earth country bumpkins and looking nothing like Livingston's character it may have faired better! Even so this film has a cult following because of Ron Livingston. 310!".

And it's not quite on the level of those masterpieces nor of La Rgle du jeu from the following year or for that matter most of Renoir's 40s and 50s output but it's also hardly worthy of dismissal.The film begins in the countryside and the Mediterranean port city of Marseilles as a middleaged man is about to be tried and presumably executed for the killing of a pigeon on his lord's land. He instead escapes into the country into the mountains where he meets up with with other likeminded impoverished protorebels. Slowly over the course of the first halfhour the struggle takes on political tones rather than just the personal gripe of one man and it is the genius of the film to keep slowly building to the inevitable climax of The Nation versus The King while never forgetting to regard participants also as individuals.By the middle of the film the royal family and nobles have begun to understand the dangers they face or at least some have  the king still ignores the growing strife  and they begin to play a major role in the film. Interestingly the prime revolutionaries themselves though mentioned never take the stage the focus is always on the lowest and the highest members of society with the intellectuals who fomented the events offstage. Renoir is it seems trying to tell us that events were inevitable and the prime movers really aren't all that significant if we look at the lives of those who stood most to gain or lose.The final battle sequences are impressively staged the film as a whole is strikingly wellacted and pretty seamless for all its shifting of focus between the oblivious king and his progressively angrier subjects. Particular acting honors would go to Edmond Ardisson as Bomier whose growing beginnings of an understanding that revolution is not merely about him but about the whole world around him are very moving. Pierre Renoir as Louis XVI manages to be foolish brutal and sympathetic by turns.".

All this is not to suggest that LA MARSEILLAISE is dull. Far from it! As mentioned before LA MARSEILLAISE is witty and often poignant.

The Assassination of the Jean Paul Marat is probably the most interesting and offbeat film but it takes place 20 years after the revolution and only debates and argues about it. Scarlet Pimpernel Reign of Terror and Tale of Two Cities just use the revolution as backdrops to tell fun adventure stories. Danton is boring antirevolutionary and childish everyone is presented in black and white terms. Griffith's Orphans of the Storm has lots of delights and some great action sequences but is too didactic and antirevolutionary. Marie Antonette 2006 and Affair of the Necklace are beautiful and great works but show little interest in the revolution itself.Although it deals with only some events leading to the overthrow of the monarchy La Marseillaise is possibly the best film. It shows the complexity of the events and deals with them in an intelligent and reasonable manner. It shows how the Brunswick Manifesto led to the arrest of the King and Queen. While Marie and Louis are not shown in a particularly good light neither are they caricatured.The movie is episodic and slow but there are a number of dazzling shots and scenes. The attack on the King's palace at the end is the dramatic highlight. There is a fabulous scene in the middle of the film where the aristocrats are singing a song about how they are going to hang the traitors and shortly the revolutionaries answer by singing about how they are going to hang the aristocrats. It shows the most humanistic balanced and honest presentation of the situation of any film on the subject that I have seen.".

	schema:headline " Summary of La Marseillaise";
	schema:reviewBody "Jean Renoir's classic tribute to the glory of the French Revolution the film captures the personal flavor of the struggle and the philosophical background to the revolutionary upheaval. In a rapid series of vignettes we are introduced to the elegance and nobility of the court of Louis XVI and MarieAntoinette... the contrasting plight of French peasants governed by laws they cannot understand...the storming of the Bastille in 1789 by an undisciplined mob...the plotting of France's exiled nobility to return to power...the Republican march on Paris...and the capture of the Tuilleries in 1793 ending the revolution. The film follows the adventures of two young patriots who join the Peoples' army in Marseilles. As their battalion begins its long journey north to Paris to join with the Federate army they adopt as their anthem a song from the Army of the Rhine. This song was soon to be known all over France as La Marseillaise and would lead the newly unified nation to victory.".

In a rapid series of vignettes we are introduced to the elegance and nobility of the court of Louis XVI and MarieAntoinette... the contrasting plight of French peasants governed by laws they cannot understand...the storming of the Bastille in 1789 by an undisciplined mob...the plotting of France's exiled nobility to return to power...the Republican march on Paris...and the capture of the Tuilleries in 1793 ending the revolution.

	schema:reviewBody "La Marseillaise takes place during the phase of the French revolution that was the most optimistic and the least bloody. Director Jean Renoir is concerned with how this moment is viewed by both the monarchy in Paris and the everyday people of Marseillaise who march to Paris singing their song Battle Hymn of the Rhine Army. His presentation is realistic and probably more accurate than most films that have dealt with the subject.La Marseillaise has been proclaimed as a masterpiece but while I liked the film I cannot share in that acclaim. Jean Renoir is considered one of the if not THE greatest French directors in film history. I love The Rules of the Game but have found many of Renoir's other films slow going. This is true of parts of La Marseillaise as well. The running time is 132 minutes there is intentionally no main protagonist an assumption is made that the audience knows more about the historical events than some viewers like me may.Despite some restlessness on my part La Marseillaise remains a worthwhile film. Every Jean Renoir film has wonderful moments La Marseillaise especially. My favorite is Louis XVI's long walk with his family to Parilament. Renoir uses a crane shot to view the pedestrians. The dejected look on the King's face is powerful. He and his son share a reflexive moment over fallen leaves. This scene powerfully contrasts with the buffoonish way Louis was portrayed at the beginning of the film. This is a perfectly made scene. The film has other great scenes as well. Although it did not affect me as deeply as it has others I would recommend La Marseillaise especially to French film admirers students of Jean Renoir and history buffs.".

Martin Luther King Jr Like much of director Jean Renoir's work during this period La Marseillaise which offers a romanticised retelling of the French Revolution of 1789 spends much of its time contrasting the lives of commoners with those of the aristocracy. Modern audiences will no doubt find this class baiting tedious but such angry tracts were common in the lead up to and wake of the second world war everyone from Renoir to John Huston to Rossellini to Pasolini to Pontecorvo etc. By the end of the 70s cinema's fires of revolution which Renoir lights here and which were subsequently passed on from torch to torch for roughly four decades would completely burn out.The film is divided into five chapters The Court The Civil and The Military Authorities The Aristocrats The Marseilles Locals and The Ordinary Citizens but essentially takes the structure of a grand march from Marseilles to Paris a battalion of 500 volunteers arriving in time to capture The Tuileries Palace leading to the publication of the Brunswick Manifesto and the overthrowing of Louis XVI's monarchy. With this march came La Marseillaise the song of the peasants which later becomes France's national anthem.Renoir's direction is impeccable the director adopting a naturalistic semidocumentary tone. The film's wellchoreographed battles and crowd scenes are particularly impressive. Today its marriage of scope and sensitivity means La Marseillaise is still the best film to directly document the French Revolution. Martin Scorsese calls it one of the finest and richest historical films ever made and would borrow from it heavily for his stylish but strangely vapid pulprevolutionary movie Gangs of New York.Renoir himself considered La Marseillaise one of his favourite films. Fittingly it was partially sponsored by the Popular Front government of France a coalition of leftists in power at the time and was also financially backed by the French trade unions and the public.In terms of flaws the film fails to get us to actually care about the revolution has too much speechifying during its first hour it eventually becomes quite stirring and possess a brand of 1930s melodrama which modern audiences will no doubt turn their noses up to. Ironically the most touching scene in the film is of a tortured King Louis XVI surrendering his power to the National Assembly. Visconti would be proud.What dates the film most though is the fact that we now firmly live in postrevolutionary times. Renoir rallies against aristocrats and their crimes against humanity he champions for the revolution as a call to the rights of man he reminds citizens to always be vigilant in defending liberty against tyranny he advocates against both monarchy and nationalism he demands that commoners be given an equal voice in government...bunch such things have a quaint almost naive tinge nowadays.In our era of diversity devolved power anticentralizen digitized capitalism mobilized local creativity and self organisation there is simply no head to strike. Revolution is an art. It is an art of realising and seizing the moment. Today in which context is near impossible in which moments and time itself seem increasingly fleeting in which culture is one of continuous flux or rather the continuous rapid movement of commodities which creates the illusion of change of progress and perpetual confusion traditional revolution as Renoir sees here seems impossible. This is what another French director Robert Bresson realised with The Devil Possibly and what Godard spends his career wrestling with.810  Worth one viewing.".

It is understandable that these abuses aren't covered in depth but to omit the beheadings completely seems rather dishonest.

	schema:reviewBody "I heard of this movie before but I had no knowledge of what it was about and basically rented it because it looked good and Robert DeNiro is the starmy Number One favorite actor.  Well DeNiro's performance is one of the high points of the film and he is extraordinary as the abusive father who seems pleasant and jovial at times but can turn violent when you push his buttons.  Leonardo DiCaprio is also great in one of the best performances of his career.  Over the years he's been gaining a reputation as a glamour guy.  And that he is but you must see his performance in this movie before regarding him as just another pretty face.  He was still in his early teens I'm guessing when he made this film so this was a long time before he hit it big with Titanic. Ellen Barkin is also good but I wish her character could've been developed a little more.  I kept wondering during the course of the film why she felt like withstanding Dwight's abuse for such a long period of time.  In the beginning of the film she's established as a free spiritthe kind of woman that romances a man then drives off to another state to find her next man.  Well why didn't she do the same thing with this jerk?  The film is based on a true story so I'm sure she really did stay with him that long but I just wanted to know her motives.  This Boy's Life is a solid beautifully made sliceoflife that kept me glued to the screen from start to finish.  The climax is an emotional powerhouse that made me want to stand up and cheer.  Please check out this underrated masterpiece!  My score  9 out of 10".

Well DeNiro's performance is one of the high points of the film and he is extraordinary as the abusive father who seems pleasant and jovial at times but can turn violent when you push his buttons.  Leonardo DiCaprio is also great in one of the best performances of his career.  Over the years he's been gaining a reputation as a glamour guy.  And that he is but you must see his performance in this movie before regarding him as just another pretty face.

	schema:reviewBody "This Boy's Life was the break out role for Leonardo DiCaprio who proved what a great talent he was in this coming of age film. He had to be to hold his own with Robert DeNiro. DeNiro with his great ear for voices and accents perfectly captures the role of stepfather Dwight Hansen a man with a terrible inferiority complex who takes it out on his stepson.The film is based on the memoirs of writer Tobias Wolff as he and his mother endured five years of hell with this very provincial man who is trapped in the small town mentality of Concrete Washington during the 1950s. The title quote is from DeNiro who repeats that line many times during the film. In fact that's all he does is talk in clichs and it's made abundantly clear that his level of ignorance about the outside world is frightening.That puts him in contrast with stepson DiCaprio who's a bright kid and capable of going places with some guidance. DeNiro isn't about to provide that guidance he's just plain jealous of him.In fact This Boy's Life is similar in that respect to the Tom Cruise film All the Right Moves where Cruise is also trying to escape the drab life he sees in his small Pennsylvania mining town through athletics and meets with jealousy from many around him but not in his own family circle.This Boy's Life should be required viewing on the effects of homophobia. In addition to the principal players DeNiro DiCaprio and Ellen Barkin as DiCaprio's mother credit should go to Jonah Blechman who played gay teen Arthur Gayle. He's got a real lonely existence in Concrete Washington. Arthur's story is still unfortunately being acted out today in thousands of small town throughout the USA. He gravitates to DiCaprio not just sexually but because he recognizes a kindred spirit there.Among other things DeNiro encourages is homophobia as homosexuality is one of many things he's ignorant about and prefers to remain so. It's quite a scene in which DeNiro encourages DiCaprio to beat up Arthur on any and all occasions.In fact that's ultimately Dwight's problem. It's maybe ONLY two things that he knows anything about and can converse intelligently on. And he's living in a town full of other Dwights as ignorant as he is.This is one of the best films of the last decade of the last century and should not be missed.".

I had never heard of Leonardo DiCaprio but I'm just I wasn't alone as this was his second or third time on screen. Anyway he certainly gave a powerful performance and served notice he was going to be a big name actor.Basically it's about teenage kid and his mom trying to survive the mean fatherhusband of the family in a small town during the 1950s. Robert De Niro plays the dad and Ellen Barkin the mom. This may be the only film I've seen in which Barkin actually played the nicest person of the leads!! Leo plays Tobias Wolffe De Niro Dwight Hansen and Barkin Caroline Hansen. She had remarried Hansen after having Toby earlier hence the surname Wolffe.What made this story tough for me was that to be honest neither father nor son were nice guys although De Niro's character was far worse. The struggles  and that's putting it tactfully  between father and son were really nasty. Yet as unpleasant at is the story is memorable and it haunted me for several days especially since it is based on a true story. How much of this was true I can't say but it is a dramatic story you will not dismiss. However watching dysfunctional families and hearing a lot of verbal abuse is not fun so be warned.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although I didn't live there during the time the movie was made I did venture up one afternoon to see what the town looked like as a movie set. Remarkably the town looked much like I remembered from my childhood in the 60's and it was a nice journey back in time. While living in Arizona '922001 I would frequently watch the movie when I was homesick I enjoyed seeing my old town my old schools  the surrounding scenic shots. I am now living back in Concrete and sadly the town has wasted away to nothing but with This Boy's Life I can go back for an hour or so to when it was a really great place to live and growup. The reallife Dwight has since died everyone who knew him says he was just like book and movie portrayed him and his real kids dispute the fact that he was an abusive father. Tobias Wolff is of course now a wellknown writer but remembered as a nice funloving kid who did pretty well weathering the constant stress at home while growing up. A number of Concrete residents still resent the portrayal of our town as a backwoods redneck community that harbors childabusers. Unfortunately the truth hurts  that description pretty much sums up our little spot on the map. But we do have some of the most beautiful scenery in the world lots of fresh air and no gangs so I guess we are better off than a lot of urban environments. Leo DiCaprio did a great job in his role. Ellen Barkin was memorable but I had a hard time feeling much empathy for her character. DiNiro was  well...DiNiro. Every role he touches becomes gold and this one will shine for a long time. This movie was highly underrated in my opinion and not just because I was biased and should have gotten more notice after it's release. You can still see it on the pay channels occasionally on cable networks and of course video  DVD. The sets clothing and music really do justice to the time. See it and you will never forget it! small tidbit on my trip up to Concrete to visit the set I was happened upon DiNiro DiCaprio  Barkin filming the scene where they were driving for the first time into Concrete. The local sheriff had closed off the highway until the scene was completed but because I knew the area and side rural roads I sneaked up to a spot where I could videotape the car with the three inside going down the highway. I DID get decent video of DiNiro driving the car and was thrilled!".

	schema:headline " A splendidly unnerving analysis of family dysfunction";
	schema:reviewBody "When the words This Boy's Life and Based on a true story appeared within the first few seconds of this movie I was almost tempted to switch off. Because it looked like something I'd seen in many a TV movie. And I hate TV movies. I've got a real personal bias against them. Because they're so predictable. They dot every i. Cross every t. And they're need for sentiment is nauseating. I was expecting very much the same of This Boy's Life.But then when I saw Robert De Niro's name on the credits that gave me pause for thought. So I decided to stay with the film a little while longer. And was pleasantly surprised.This Boy's Life is a quite compelling portrait of a family on the verge of flying apart. There's not only a strong commanding performance from Robert De Niro but an impressively assured one from a young and then unknown Leonardo DiCaprio.DiCaprio plays Tobias 'Toby' Wolff a rebellious teen of the 1950s. After heading South with his mother Caroline Ellen Barkin they wind up in the charmingly titled Concrete USA.Hoping for a fresh start after breaking up with an abusive boyfriend Caroline gets involved with Dwight Hansen De Niro. The man is an obvious snakeoil salesman. He flatters Caroline constantly. Dazzling her with the use of a lighter. Complimenting her on her Java. And Toby sees right through him.Toby knows Dwight is as useless a father and husband as he is a human being. But Caroline is so desperate to marry into a happier life that it isn't long before she foolishly gets hitched to him. And that's when the trouble starts.Dwight is a bully. Pure and simple. He enjoys antagonising Toby. Beating up on him. Hoarding his paper route money away for a rainy day. And all because he's trying to make a man of him. Or so Dwight says.I suppose This Boy's Life isn't terribly original nor does it do anything strikingly different with the theme of fractured families. But the performances from the excellent cast goes some way towards making up for that.When I did see Robert De Niro on the credits on the one hand it enlivened my original flagging spirits but on the other I proceeded into the film with caution.I'd just recently watched De Niro in Cape Fear a film that contains one of his worst ever performances. A performance so annoyingly over the top he lost all credibility in the role. Even now 16 years later I still can't watch that film without cringing.So it was something of a relief to see him revert to form in This Boy's Life. He mostly resists the temptation to go overboard and thoroughly convinces as an abusive bully.Dwight is quite fascinating to watch. This is a man who feels terminally put upon. He's the victim here. The one who's been shortchanged throughout all his life. He's been left to raise three kids alone. As well as a stepson. His dreams have never come to fruition. So he sees nothing wrong with thwarting the dreams of those around him. Including Toby's.In his breakout role Leonardo DiCaprio works wonders. He brings a superb eagleeyed maturity to Toby. Interesting considering he doesn't always have that quality in some of his later films. But here he's got this character nailed. The way he rotates from frustrated to rebellious and rare moments of happiness is just marvellous.De Niro is careful too the way he shows to us what a thoroughly reprehensible monster he is.

He does occasionally lapse into some borderline theatrics but it doesn't ruin the film the way it did Cape Fear.The ending is quite satisfying too.

It's still quite violent but its an ending that feels true to life. Dwight's pleas at the end sound so pathetic you feel as much pity for him as you do derision.This Boy's Life is definitely worthwhile. Its a wonderful showcase of emotion for Leonardo DiCaprio. Shows you what a great actor he can be when given the right material to work with. And its a surprisingly complex portrait of a thug who felt misrepresented all his life.".

	onyx:emotionText "When the words This Boy's Life and Based on a true story appeared within the first few seconds of this movie I was almost tempted to switch off. Because it looked like something I'd seen in many a TV movie. And I hate TV movies. I've got a real personal bias against them. Because they're so predictable. They dot every i. Cross every t. And they're need for sentiment is nauseating. I was expecting very much the same of This Boy's Life.But then when I saw Robert De Niro's name on the credits that gave me pause for thought. So I decided to stay with the film a little while longer. And was pleasantly surprised.This Boy's Life is a quite compelling portrait of a family on the verge of flying apart. There's not only a strong commanding performance from Robert De Niro but an impressively assured one from a young and then unknown Leonardo DiCaprio.DiCaprio plays Tobias 'Toby' Wolff a rebellious teen of the 1950s. After heading South with his mother Caroline Ellen Barkin they wind up in the charmingly titled Concrete USA.Hoping for a fresh start after breaking up with an abusive boyfriend Caroline gets involved with Dwight Hansen De Niro. The man is an obvious snakeoil salesman. He flatters Caroline constantly. Dazzling her with the use of a lighter. Complimenting her on her Java. And Toby sees right through him.Toby knows Dwight is as useless a father and husband as he is a human being. But Caroline is so desperate to marry into a happier life that it isn't long before she foolishly gets hitched to him. And that's when the trouble starts.Dwight is a bully. Pure and simple. He enjoys antagonising Toby. Beating up on him. Hoarding his paper route money away for a rainy day. And all because he's trying to make a man of him. Or so Dwight says.I suppose This Boy's Life isn't terribly original nor does it do anything strikingly different with the theme of fractured families. But the performances from the excellent cast goes some way towards making up for that.When I did see Robert De Niro on the credits on the one hand it enlivened my original flagging spirits but on the other I proceeded into the film with caution.I'd just recently watched De Niro in Cape Fear a film that contains one of his worst ever performances. A performance so annoyingly over the top he lost all credibility in the role. Even now 16 years later I still can't watch that film without cringing.So it was something of a relief to see him revert to form in This Boy's Life. He mostly resists the temptation to go overboard and thoroughly convinces as an abusive bully.Dwight is quite fascinating to watch. This is a man who feels terminally put upon. He's the victim here. The one who's been shortchanged throughout all his life. He's been left to raise three kids alone. As well as a stepson. His dreams have never come to fruition. So he sees nothing wrong with thwarting the dreams of those around him. Including Toby's.In his breakout role Leonardo DiCaprio works wonders. He brings a superb eagleeyed maturity to Toby. Interesting considering he doesn't always have that quality in some of his later films. But here he's got this character nailed. The way he rotates from frustrated to rebellious and rare moments of happiness is just marvellous.De Niro is careful too the way he shows to us what a thoroughly reprehensible monster he is. Like the little glance he gives us when he learns Caroline's a better shot than him. And then once they're married his grip closes like a vice allowing him to cut loose. He does occasionally lapse into some borderline theatrics but it doesn't ruin the film the way it did Cape Fear.The ending is quite satisfying too.

This Boy's Life is an incredibly thorough movie all the main groups of abuse are represented emotional physical psychological and even financial abuses are present throughout. One of the best scenes is when Robert De Niro crams an old mustard jar into Leonardo DiCaprio's eye to teach him a lesson about wasting condiments.

	schema:reviewBody "Tobias Leonardo DiCaprio and his mother Caroline Ellen Barkin are at loose ends after Caroline's divorce. Caroline has the get rich scheme of heading for uranium mining out west. After this and other other ideas fail Caroline and Tobias wind up in Concrete Washington yes it actually exists where they are getting desperate. In steps Dwight a local mechanic. Dwight seems sincere in his courting of Caroline and since he offers stability and security Caroline is willing to buy what he is offering by marrying him. After the marriage Dwight's dark side surfaces in the major conflict that develops between him and Tobias. Tobias is no angel but to me his behavior was no more out of line than that of your typical rebellious youth whereas Dwight's tyrannical behavior struck me as bordering on the sadistic. The scenes of physical abuse I found hard to watch.Why Dwight's reaction to Tobias is so extreme is open to speculation. In part I think it comes from Dwight's perception of what it means to be a manyou are the ultimate authority one who brooks no opposition. Expanding on that theme Dwight senses that Tobias is not living up to his stereotypical image for example Tobias likes to read books of all things. In some ways I got the feeling that Dwight's behavior was not all malicious some small part of him felt for Tobias and he was trying to impose his vision on him as how to deal with the world. However there is one pivotal scene that said a lot about Dwight to me. While Dwight and Tobias were watching television a news report came on about Lana Turner's daughter Cheryl Crane murdering Turner's boyfriend Johnny Stompanato on the grounds that he was brutalizing her mother. Crane was acquitted on the grounds of justifiable homicide. When that last piece of information was mentioned Dwight looked over at Tobias who was paying intense attention to the program with a look that said Hmmmm could this apply to me? This indicated to me that Dwight knew he had gone over the line in his dealings with Tobias and maybe would pay the ultimate price.The movie takes place in the late 1950s and period details are inserted in order to make that point cars hair styles clothes TV movies music.De Niro is good hereI think you have to be a good actor to play such a thoroughly unlikeable bully as Dwight with such convincing realism. It is no small treat to see De Niro dressed in a scout uniform. Barkin is fine but Caroline moves to deep background once the major struggle between Dwight and Tobias takes center stage. DiCaprio turns in a particularly good performance being able to hold his own against two experienced actors.This is billed as a true story being an accounting of author Tobias Wollf's experiences. I think this should more appropriately be labeled as based on truth since there are some things that don't ring quite true. For example the scene that has Tobias running a table saw in shop class at school is wrong. Not even the most inexperienced novice in a wood class would be passing the wood through the saw in the dangerous way that Tobias was. I was cringing just to watch it. And the injury we see he sustains could in no way be caused by the accident as pictured at the least it would have been more serious. And there was no purpose to what he was doing with the saw to start with. After seeing this I wondered just how well the rest of the movie had been researched. To say that something is a true story is riskynot even most documentaries are without bias. What an author says in an autobiographical text has to be taken with some reservations as to the truthI am left wanting to read the book since I am sure the relationships are more complicated than what can be presented here in two hours. We don't get to know Caroline very well and how Dwight's kids from a previous marriage fit into the family is hardly treated. In particular I wanted to know more about Dwight's relationship with the other kids especially with his son.

	onyx:emotionText "Tobias Leonardo DiCaprio and his mother Caroline Ellen Barkin are at loose ends after Caroline's divorce. Caroline has the get rich scheme of heading for uranium mining out west. After this and other other ideas fail Caroline and Tobias wind up in Concrete Washington yes it actually exists where they are getting desperate. In steps Dwight a local mechanic. Dwight seems sincere in his courting of Caroline and since he offers stability and security Caroline is willing to buy what he is offering by marrying him. After the marriage Dwight's dark side surfaces in the major conflict that develops between him and Tobias. Tobias is no angel but to me his behavior was no more out of line than that of your typical rebellious youth whereas Dwight's tyrannical behavior struck me as bordering on the sadistic. The scenes of physical abuse I found hard to watch.Why Dwight's reaction to Tobias is so extreme is open to speculation. In part I think it comes from Dwight's perception of what it means to be a manyou are the ultimate authority one who brooks no opposition. Expanding on that theme Dwight senses that Tobias is not living up to his stereotypical image for example Tobias likes to read books of all things. In some ways I got the feeling that Dwight's behavior was not all malicious some small part of him felt for Tobias and he was trying to impose his vision on him as how to deal with the world. However there is one pivotal scene that said a lot about Dwight to me. While Dwight and Tobias were watching television a news report came on about Lana Turner's daughter Cheryl Crane murdering Turner's boyfriend Johnny Stompanato on the grounds that he was brutalizing her mother. Crane was acquitted on the grounds of justifiable homicide. When that last piece of information was mentioned Dwight looked over at Tobias who was paying intense attention to the program with a look that said Hmmmm could this apply to me? This indicated to me that Dwight knew he had gone over the line in his dealings with Tobias and maybe would pay the ultimate price.The movie takes place in the late 1950s and period details are inserted in order to make that point cars hair styles clothes TV movies music.De Niro is good hereI think you have to be a good actor to play such a thoroughly unlikeable bully as Dwight with such convincing realism. It is no small treat to see De Niro dressed in a scout uniform. Barkin is fine but Caroline moves to deep background once the major struggle between Dwight and Tobias takes center stage. DiCaprio turns in a particularly good performance being able to hold his own against two experienced actors.This is billed as a true story being an accounting of author Tobias Wollf's experiences. I think this should more appropriately be labeled as based on truth since there are some things that don't ring quite true. For example the scene that has Tobias running a table saw in shop class at school is wrong. Not even the most inexperienced novice in a wood class would be passing the wood through the saw in the dangerous way that Tobias was. I was cringing just to watch it. And the injury we see he sustains could in no way be caused by the accident as pictured at the least it would have been more serious. And there was no purpose to what he was doing with the saw to start with. After seeing this I wondered just how well the rest of the movie had been researched. To say that something is a true story is riskynot even most documentaries are without bias. What an author says in an autobiographical text has to be taken with some reservations as to the truthI am left wanting to read the book since I am sure the relationships are more complicated than what can be presented here in two hours. We don't get to know Caroline very well and how Dwight's kids from a previous marriage fit into the family is hardly treated. In particular I wanted to know more about Dwight's relationship with the other kids especially with his son. More details on Tobias' relationship with the effeminate Arthur would be interestinghow did he square that relationship with his other tough friends? Was Arthur as stereotypically gay as shown?Overall I found this to be well acted and absorbing. It reminds me of the fatherson battle waged in the 1979 movie The Great Santini.";

	schema:reviewBody "A few years ago when it was cool to hate Titanic I picked mercilessly on Leonardo DiCaprio as all males at the time did. I criticized his performances in every film I saw mainly Titanic. Even though I liked the film if you were a guy and admitted to enjoying it you were automatically labeled gay.Over the years I found new respect for DiCaprio as an actor. After I saw him in Catch Me If You Can I realized he had a great deal of natural talent and was striving to abandon his pretty boy roots. Then I saw Gangs of New York and felt he was strangely miscast.Going back to This Boy's Life we catch an early glimpse of DiCaprio and one of his finest performances to date. He is totally convincing in this film set in the 1950s based on a true story.Unfortunately the rest of the movie is not so lucky. The typically reliable Robert De Niro delivers one of his worst performances ever as a crazy kook from Seattle named Dwight who falls for Toby's DiCaprio mother Caroline played by Ellen Barkin.I applaud De Niro's recent ventures into comedy and disagree with the critics who claim he has sold out. But his performance in This Boy's Life is simply unacceptable. It starts out fine enough and his Seattle accent is impressive. But as the film progresses he turns into a strange comical character he is supposed to be scary and intimidating but he is neither.I feel the greatest flaw of this film centers around De Niro's character and performance. First of all Toby Leo acts like a jerk. We don't find much sympathy for him. When he falls into the hands of Dwight we eventually feel a bit of sympathy but because Dwight never seems very cruel or scary it's hard even then.There have been some very good child abuse movies made in the past. Radio Flyer was not a great movie by any means but by portraying child abuse through the eyes of a child and portraying the guilty as a truly cruel human being it succeeded and made us feel for the boys.This Boy's Life doesn't work because it's a bit too sarcastic knowing and selfassured. De Niro is not scary. In fact many times I agreed with his character. He rarely abused Toby in the film anyway and at many times even though he was drunk offered good advice.And the scenes such as the one in which he steals Toby's boy scout outfit aren't upsetting. They're humorous. It's hard to find fear and sympathy for a boy when we're laughing at his plights.The ending was the icing on the cake as far as I'm concerned. Throughout De Niro had managed to retain some level of dignity and realism but at the end he just let loose and turned into a screaming howling crybaby of a man obsessive paranoid and crazy. And he's still not scary because he's so pathetic that we're laughing at him. And by then the accent has become so corny and the dialogue and happyface gestures so hysterical that the film totally negates whatever its point was and becomes a halfhearted bittersweet comedy with a great performance by Leonardo DiCaprio and unimpressive elements elsewhere.Overall This Boy's Life is a mixed bag of a film that doesn't know whether to find sympathy for Tobias Wolff or humor in his situations. If you're a fan of the actors give it a go otherwise I recommend Radio Flyer.".

He is a barbercobbler who is literally hounded by a dogwith a mysterious blue spot on his head. Our hero does not like dogs and spends a great deal of energy shaking it off including when it follows him into a church service and disrupts the liturgy. The man almost shoots the critter but someone beats him to it. The injured dog limps away and with increasing remorse the man tries to find his lost devoted friend. The sequence is a poignant one I must confess and is the one I like best. It is a nod to that other gentle mandog film Vittorio De Sica's Umberto D.The second episode third in the U.S. release is called Snow on Fire  Il fuoco sulla neve by Marco Tullio Giordana and is a tale of sexual voyeurism in which Maddalena Fellini observes her son and daughterinlaw having sex. She watches though a hole in the floor above the couple's room.The experience stirs long lost longings in her in a way that is incredibly quite moving and tender. And the young wife's awareness that she is being seen adds fervor and intensity to her conjugal coitus.The third piece second in the U.S. release is called Especially on Sunday  La domenica specialmente. It was directed by Giuseppe Bertolucci and has Ornella Muti attracted to this stranger Bruno Ganz in a Mercedes but her weird companion hinders any sexual intimacy between the two. The segment is a minorkey dissertation on the demands of libido and I found it to be tiresome.The final episode is called Wooden Churches Le chiese di legno and was directed by Francesco Barilli . It is about 12 minutes long and has an aimless Sergio Bini gawking at all the flesh at a city carnival before rushing off to a beach where three floating wooden churches are lit up with candles. It is a Felliniesque exercise with some appealing visual flourishes and not much characterization. It was cut from the U.S. release.Framing the entire film is a story The Man of the Birds  L'uomo degli uccelli in which a man on a motorcycle shows a little boy some birds. It too was directed by Giuseppe Bertolucci. It doesn't add up to a plate of fagioli but is cute and lyrical.".

Director John Frankenheimer does leave Peck's fate as uncertain at the end but the viewer will not think of any good options for him.Mixing films like The Blue Angel and Thunder Road doesn't quite jell. Tuesday Weld is certainly one seductive sight but somehow I could never wrap my mind around Gregory Peck falling for her. Maybe then we're all vulnerable even Atticus Finch.The film didn't do much for the careers of the folks behind and in front of the camera. Then again Peck was not getting too many good film offers at this point in his career. But if you like Johnny Cash this is your film his singing is the best thing about it.".

He is wound so tight in this part it seems like he will explode any minute. His eyes and silent desperate yearning when he is looking at the truly beautiful Weld tell's the desperate needs of the man he portrays.

	schema:reviewBody "Not to be confused with the 2005 Johnny Cash biopic Walk The Line this 1970 film directed by John Frankenheimer tells the story of a middleaged smalltown sheriff Henry Tawes Gregory Peck  who finds himself becoming increasingly disillusioned with his life as a husband and father and coming to resent his humdrum existence. It could also be argued that he is entering a midlife crisis and one day he stops the daughter of a local moonshiner played by Ralph Meeker pretty Alma McCain Tuesday Weld and her younger brother for driving without a permit. Captivated by her beauty he begins a secret affair with her all the while turning a blind eye to her family's illegal activities. Things become increasingly out of hand as inspectors begin to investigate the goings on in town and Henry's devious deputy Charles Durning discovers the liaison and the McCain family's profession. Henry also finds his distraught wife Estelle Parsons has also discovered the affair and he decides to throw all caution to the wind and run away with Alma. Torn between her affection for Henry and her loyalty to her family Alma's choice and Henry's recklessness result in tragedy and heartbreak.This movie was very much overlooked when it was first released but it is a good flick and the performances are superb. The production was shot mainly on location in Tennessee and Johnny Cash provides the soundtrack. This role was a very different one for Gregory Peck especially at this stage of his career but he embodies the tightlywound sheriff expertly. Tuesday Weld is convincing and captivating as a young woman caught in a way of life that not only limits her opportunities but also her choices. Used by her father to keep Henry smitten in order to keep the family business secret she makes the only choice she feels she can make but not without cost to Henry.Columbia released the movie on DVD a few years back and it is unforgivably very barebones there isn't even a menu but it is in widescreen and the transfer looks wonderful capturing the bleak yet lush countryside.If you're a fan of Gregory Peck and Tuesday Weld this is a film that must be viewed.".

The assumption being that there would be an intriguing chemistry between these polar characters who both in life and on screen symbolize solid upright morals versus the wild spirit of youth.The film could only have worked had this assumption be proved true. Unfortunately this totally backfired entirely due to Gregory Peck whose tendency towards wooden acting has never been more evident. He is simply hopeless in the role. Director John Frankenheimer amongst his many misses in the latter part of his patchy career has been known to elicit some truly memorable performances from his actors. He is at a total loss with Peck who makes what should have been a conflicted interested character a hollow vacuous entity. Tuesday Weld never more beautiful is as always terrific. Whereas she gives herself completely in each scene Peck is less than half hearted about the whole thing. No matter how convincing a performance it needs the interaction of the other players to  be fully realized. You cannot go it alone. Weld does her best but Peck is an unwilling or incapable partner. He simply should have turned down this one. In an interview Weld mentions that in what was supposed to be an erotic love scene Peck insisted on keeping his shoes on in bed need one say more? There are what seem to be pointless and endless shots of the rural south to the songs of Johnny Cash which serve as fillers for the directionless narrative. There's good support from Estelle Parsons and Ralph Meeker but the boring and probably bored Peck deflates everything leaving a film of missed opportunities.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is set somewhere in the South though the film never indicates exactly where. I assume it's Tennessee or Arkansas as it's very hilly and the accents of most of the people would indicate that. The local sheriff begins an affair with the daughter of a moonshiner and this all leads to terrible consequences.I just read through the reviews on IMDb and I seem to be in the minority here as I wasn't particularly happy with this filmsome of it due to the odd casting of Gregory Peck. The reason I chose to see it was the presence of Peck. Heck the man could read from a phone book on film and I'd watch it!! I've seen him in some campy films later in his career such as THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL and THE OMEN simply because even with these silly roles he still managed to transcend it all. However despite my love of his films this one disappointed me very much. Instead of the strong and decent persona he played in such films as 12 O'CLOCK HIGH TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRDTHE BIG COUNTRY and other films here he manages to be a rather unlikable and difficult to understand character. I think the blandness of the guy he played was the biggest deficit in the film and for once he was miscast. I really think that Ralph Meeker who played the moonshiner in the film would have been better in the role as he had a long career out of playing morally ambivalent charactersplus he was a heck of an actor in his own right despite not being a household name. Charles Durning a supporting actor in the movie also could have carried off this role very well.Perhaps one of the best performances in the film was that of Estelle Parsons. For once she had a part that seemed very suited to her. Her roles in films such as BONNY AND CLYDE and DON'T DRINK THE WATER among others didn't do a lot to allow her to do much character acting though she did get the Oscar for BONNY because apparently they liked to see her shriek. Here however she is amazingly believable as a sad and lamentable wife who's losing her husband to a young nymph.Overall despite bad casting this isn't a bad filmbut it also isn't a very good film. Its pluses are gritty realism and some of the Johnny Cash music particularly the title song. Minuses are Peck and the vagueness of his character and the unbelievability of the affair between him and Tuesday Weldtwo actors that don't exactly seem at place in the hills of the South. Simply put the script wasn't exactly firstrate.".

I suppose it's happened before but man how would one look in the mirror in the morning? The soundtrack mostly performed by Johnny Cash lends particular resonance to the story. Being a fan I was somewhat surprised that the only song I'd heard before was the title tune all the rest complemented the story well but don't appear on any of Cash's big hits albums. The one that really clicked for the conflicted Sheriff Tawes Peck was 'Face a New Day Dawning' one of it's lines described his angst in relation to his marriage to Ellen Haney Estelle Parsons  She knows that something's wrong and I don't care. You could feel the palpable tension in the sheriff who didn't even try to sort out his feelings once the young temptress made her move.The one scene that creeped me out though was the tease that occurred by Alma's Weld bedside when her father Carl Ralph Meeker sidled up along side her to offer comfort. If he'd have kissed her I think I would have jumped out of my chair. There was this feeling I had throughout the picture that some form of incest might have been going on but it was more provocative to offer it up as a possibility rather than a fact. Could you just imagine the sheriff if that had been the case? With the character of the Federal man Bascomb Lonny Chapman I had to chuckle a bit as it brought me back to my childhood days reading the L'il Abner comic strip. Exposing moonshiners for unpaid taxes was always a favorite theme and would have been that much more comical here if someone had called Bascomb a 'revenooer'. Why didn't someone think of that?".

Convicted of murder  He and his cohorts had no weapons he wasn't even in the room when gunfire went off and the only ones to do the shooting and killing were the cops. Even if he's considered an accomplice no one was murdered they were all killed by cops. OK it was Texas so perhaps he had some marijuana on him.2. After his lethal injection we next see him on a road in Oregon and a priest picks him up asking him if he's the new groundskeeper. He says he is. How did he get to Oregon? Or to this road? Let's say he was drugged and just placed on the road  so how did he know he is the groundskeeper? He never even asks anyone what they mean by he's being given a second chance.3. He gets on a bus out of town to go back to his family. Some stranger tells him that if he stays on the bus he will die. Even though he wants to see his family more than anything he gets off the bus because of what the stranger says.4. Near the end the doctor explains how this is a program to rehabilitate violent murders. We've already seen that he wasn't even a murderer but he also had no history at all of violence. So of the thousands of violent murderers they could have chosen they picked him who needed no rehabilitation anyway? 5. They let him go when he says he mailed the info on the project to someone and they will be exposed if they don't let him go. So they let him go??? Don't they think it's a bigger risk to have him walking around blabbing his mouth off? 6. He returns home and his wife goes out to give him a hug. No questions about if he's ghost or a clone or whatever just a hug. And really how are they going to explain to the authorities not to mention friends and family why a convicted executed murderer is back living with his family? All of the above action takes up about 10 minutes of the film. The rest of the time is used for shots of him thinking. Or walking slowly. Or having a coffee. Or giving oneword answers to questions.A terrible terrible movie. 2 stars because the acting was OK and the direction and cinematography was not as bad as the plot.".

He gets on a bus out of town to go back to his family. Some stranger tells him that if he stays on the bus he will die. Even though he wants to see his family more than anything he gets off the bus because of what the stranger says.4. Near the end the doctor explains how this is a program to rehabilitate violent murders. We've already seen that he wasn't even a murderer but he also had no history at all of violence. So of the thousands of violent murderers they could have chosen they picked him who needed no rehabilitation anyway? 5. They let him go when he says he mailed the info on the project to someone and they will be exposed if they don't let him go. So they let him go??? Don't they think it's a bigger risk to have him walking around blabbing his mouth off? 6. He returns home and his wife goes out to give him a hug. No questions about if he's ghost or a clone or whatever just a hug. And really how are they going to explain to the authorities not to mention friends and family why a convicted executed murderer is back living with his family? All of the above action takes up about 10 minutes of the film. The rest of the time is used for shots of him thinking. Or walking slowly. Or having a coffee. Or giving oneword answers to questions.A terrible terrible movie. 2 stars because the acting was OK and the direction and cinematography was not as bad as the plot.";

	schema:reviewBody "This film is one of the most underrated films I have seen that came out in recent years. I found the subject matter very original and thoughtprovoking. Paul Walker plays a man who experiences something which seems to be fatal and is transformed into a new life with a second chance but can't figure out if he actually died an is reborn or if he survived the incident but is given a new life. It has a nice psychological appeal to it as well as fresh cinematography and musical score to go with it. Kudos to Jerzy Zielnski for shooting it well an Brian Tyler's suitable music.I can't say Paul Walker was stunning in the lead but he was convincing as he was in Running Scared which is another great film. I thought Lazarus Project is an original innovative entertaining thriller that still manages to make some interesting arguments rather than just being about special effects action and the usual Hollywood antics. I was impressed. 910 184 on my list of all time favorite movies.".

Ben has recently been released from prison after a fair amount of time served. The film then moves onto showing the audience how Ben is rehabilitated and trying to make a good life for his family and himself. I wont say anymore to spoil anything but something quite unexpected takes place to shake up the plot and from there you're off. This movie has great cinematography for its settings and Paul Walker though still in a normal Paul Walker role does show some potential talent in every necessary scene.All in all if you have a means of seeing The Lazarus Project I would also highly recommend it to you. Follow along throughout and when the credits role you too may have that feeling of an unexpected treat.".

Hence there was never any true dilemma as to how the film would end. Toward the end there was a brief attempt to sidetrack the viewer into thinking that Walker's past wasn't what we thought it was but that quickly fizzled out and not much later does he escape the premises with absurd ease  don't they know he is a masterburglar?.Far more ridiculous than Walker's leisurely escape is the premise. Given a supernatural twist I'd be willing to overlook almost any nonsense but because the story contains nothing out of the ordinary we are left with an idea that doesn't hold any water no matter from which angle one looks at it. Why would the government ANY government waste that many resources on rehabilitating a handful of hardcore criminals? Why would they risk so much to help a few psychopaths and misfits nearly all of them murderers? Why the hell would they be sent off to a remote town from which they could leave any time they choose? In the last scene Walker's wife upon seeing that he is alive reacts as if he'd been away for a business weekend. Not very realistic... Perhaps she's had several husbands before Walker all of whom were convicted murderers all of which escaped the Lazarus Project and came back to her... Perhaps she just thought Yep he's back.

A reformed criminal out on parole is beset by bad luck and finds himself sentenced to die by lethal injection. Strange then that once the lethal dose is administered he wakes up working as a groundskeeper at a psychiatric hospital John Glen's first directing assignment is very much a mixed bag but if landing in the DVDBluray players of the right audience it could well gain some momentum in the wake of Walker's untimely death. It's one of those films that operates at a funereal pace and thrives on other worldly atmosphere. After the introductions to the main character and his psychological makeup is out the way pic shifts into a realm where we as well as Walker's character are never sure what is real or what is going on. Is he in some afterlife place? Is it all in his head? A dream? Drug induced? And etc. One of the smart things about the movie is that it binds the audience to the mystery by asking us to fill in the gaps with our own logic. While crucially the reveal comes at the right time so as to give us viewers the opportunity to reevaluate the various quandaries that the piece has thrown up. For those who like films like Jacob's Ladder Shutter Island The Jacket et al then this has to be at the very least of interest to warrant the chance to sell itself to those particular subgenre fans besides which it also shows a string to Walker's acting bow that was rarely tapped into by other directors. And it's beautifully shot by Zielinski too. Contemplative intriguing and even chilling as regards the various themes it deals with this Lazarus deserves its own second coming. 710".

The first 20 minutes of the movie is not much more than giving the audience some background information. The man Ben served time was on probation but soon off had a decent job and had a loving wife and daughter. His brother Ricky and just released from prison makes a visit and tries to get Ben to come in on some job. Of course Ben says no since at this point in his life everything is good. But then Ben gets fired because of his past and now we're finally ready to go with our story. Ricky convinces Ben to do a job and does so by saying that if Ben does not help then Ricky's a dead man. Of course the worst happens and Ben in convicted of the death of 3 people. Yes the entire pace of the movie was slow and the first 20 minutes were actually kind of boring but there was anticipation as to exactly what was what as the movie moved along and throughout until the last few minutes the audience is kept guessing as to just what is what. I think this movie was meant to be slow not because it was a thriller but because life in general especially if you are in a mental institution either as a patient or as staff is slow. Well other than those times when patients run off. The acting was okay considering but IMO there were too many scenes where it was too dark to even see that there was something out there keeping an eye on Ben and his flashbacks were too fast and with muddled dialogue to really know what was going on. What made me rate this movie so low was not the story as I felt in general the concept was okay nor the adequate acting but the fact that a convicted killer is not only given a second chance which is believable they are called stays but the way it was done and then the final scenes where Ben finally does leave the facility. As others have noted one day your husband and father has been sentenced to die and you are told he is dead and you bury him and a year later he just shows back up? Wouldn't you want to know why? The audience is left wondering Will he get a job? How do you explain the appearance of someone put to death all at once back in the world? How to explain what happened to others? I know in a lot of movies we are to leave plausibility at home but I think the makers of this movie could have given us something a tad different that would have been believable or at least left us hanging and wondering. It was just a bad ending to what could have been a fairly decent movie.".

The first 20 minutes of the movie is not much more than giving the audience some background information. The man Ben served time was on probation but soon off had a decent job and had a loving wife and daughter. His brother Ricky and just released from prison makes a visit and tries to get Ben to come in on some job. Of course Ben says no since at this point in his life everything is good. But then Ben gets fired because of his past and now we're finally ready to go with our story. Ricky convinces Ben to do a job and does so by saying that if Ben does not help then Ricky's a dead man.

This was also John Glenn's first directorial effort Its OK for a first effort.The star is Paul Walker he too does wellhe has a limited acting range  this role suits him.

I really like Cameron Crowe though so I expected it to be good from that. I have to admit that this was one of the best family movies that I have seen in a long time. The movie had enormous heart depth and tackled real world issues while still appealing to all ages. The writing and the acting were great and the movie absolutely won me over a half hour in. I highly recommend this one. Overall this is a must see for families and is one to buy so you can watch over and over. I give it an A.".

The film came out yesterday and to my luck my mother invited me to go and see it with her this evening. I was thrilled to see that the music throughout the film was performed by a favorite Icelandic musician Jnsi with a perfect selection of Holocene from Bon Iver's new album. It was little details such as these that kept me appreciating the film from start to finish.The plot may have been at times predictable but they were predictions you wanted to happen conflict you wanted to be resolved and rain you wish would stop. Coming into the theater already a Matt Damon fan I was interested to see how he was going to fill the widowed father role. A few things a noticed Matt does look older he is still as handsome as ever and he should stick with a shorter haircut. Aside from my personal opinion I think anyone leaving the theater could agree he played the roll wonderfully. The warmhearted character of adorable Maggie Elizabeth Jones melted my heart every time she was on the screen. Her character Rosie was the seven year old whose dreams came true her Dad moved them to a zoo. My favorite scene is when the Realtor tells Matt Damon's character Benjamin that the house they wanted to buy was also a zoo. As Benjamin stood there dumbfounded Rosie Jumped up and down as any seven year old would shouting Yay!. Seriously the cutest thing ever.If the cast didn't win you over the animals did. Tigers lions bears snakes monkeys owls otters peacocks etc. The list goes on and on. Each personality portrayed in a relatable way as if you were on the team helping run the zoo itself.If you and your family are wanting to go see a movie this holiday season go and see We Bought A Zoo.

I almost passed this delightful movie up because all I could think of was if this is the best there is...I don't think so. I'm so glad I opted to see it in spite of my reservations.

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. Director Cameron Crowe has finally emerged from his cocoon  7 years after the abysmal Elizabethtown. Yes he has had a couple of projects in that time notably the Pearl Jam documentary but he has avoided anything related to his dramatic film roots of which produced Say Anything Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous. This time he delivers a feel good family appropriate sentimental crowdpleaser that should play very well to the holiday crowd.Please know I do not use sentimental as a derogatory term. Sure there are moments where the actions and dialogue seem contrived and manipulative but some of the best crowdpleasers throughout Hollywood history have these same traits. This film is based on a true story and uses Benjamin Mee's autobiographical book as the basic source material. The real Mee family and their zoo are stationed in England not southern California as Crowe presents them. What I can tell you is that this version of the Mee family and the zoo staff is interesting and entertaining even if you just have to let go and allow yourself to be guided through.Matt Damon plays Benjamin Mee and the story picks up after his wife dies. He soon quits his job and moves his two kids to the country so they can work through their grief and start fresh. His teenage son Dylan is played with blazing anger by the talented Colin Ford. The precocious 7 year old daughter is played by scenestealer Maggie Elizabeth Jones. This family experiences the realities of struggling with their pain and difficulties in communicating.As for the zoo it is in major disrepair and in danger of closing if it doesn't pass its pending inspection. Benjamin works with the ragtag staff including head zookeeper Kelly Scarlett Johansson to bring the facility up to code and nurse the sick animals back to health. As the zoo is rehabbed so are the individuals. No surprise there.The main conflict in the story comes from the hardheadedness of Benjamin and Dylan as they ignore their inability to communicate and connect as father and son. A couple of their scenes together are the best in the film for acting and realistic dialogue. At the same time Kelly acts as a quasilove interest for Benjamin while Lily Elle Fanning uses puppy love to help Dylan through his misery. That subplot is where Crowe missed a real chance. Ms. Fanning is one of the top young actresses working today and her contributions here are limited to that luminescent smile.The wild cast of supporting actors includes wisecracking Thomas Haden Church as Benjamin's brother JB Smoove as the Realtor Peter Riegert as Mee's editor Patrick Fugit from Almost Famous as the guy with a monkey on his shoulder Angus Macfadyen as the colorful zoo maintenance man and John Michael Higgins as the snooty zoo inspector who knowingly holds their future in his smarmy hand.As always Crowe uses music better than most any other director. This includes his use of score and soundtrack to compliment a scene or drive the setting and mood. What really makes this film work is Matt Damon. His character is the heart of the film and the soul of the family. His performance is strong enough to prevent the film from lapsing into pure sap and makes us care for him his family and this zoo. Don't expect some cutting edge independent sulk fest. Just accept the movie for what it is ... a feel good story delivered for the holidays.".

	schema:reviewBody "You can't get more obvious what your film is about with a title like 'We Bought a Zoo' but fortunately director Cameron Crowe's adaptation of British journalist Benjamin Mee's autobiography possesses much more subtlety and nuance than what its title would suggest. The story of a grieving widower who makes the unusual decision to buy a rural property whose 18 acres includes the Rosemoor Animal Park it is also Crowe's first feature since his 2005 flop 'Elizabethtown' and the feelgood family movie represents a welcome return to form for the talented filmmaker behind such classics like 'Say Anything' and 'Jerry Maguire'.Working off a script by 'The Devil Wears Prada' and 'Morning Glory's' Aline Brosh McKenna Crowe grounds the highconcept tale in a heart warming story about a lonely widower trying to overcome his grief for his bereaved wife while attempting to reconnect with his teenage son Dylan Colin Ford and young daughter Rosie Maggie Elizabeth Jones. Crowe is better than to take the easy route of mawkish sentimentality instead there is genuine humanity and optimism in his storytelling complemented by some outstanding performances that he coaxes from an ensemble cast in particular his lead actor Matt Damon.Though the 'Bourne' trilogy has cemented his reputation as a thinking man's action star Damon has been and still is a strong dramatic actor. The astute actor confidently matches the emotional beats that Crowe chooses for his character every step of the way from sanguineness at a change of scenery early on to dismay later on when one thing after another goes awry. His is a heartfelt performance that packs a powerful emotional wallop in his understated delivery of a father struggling to do it right by his children and nowhere is this more evident than in a powerful scene where Benjamin and Dylan address their fractured relationship headon which is guaranteed to bring tears to your eyes.The conviction that Damon brings to his role is a huge reason why the film achieves its intended poignancy. A scene where his character finally overcomes his fear of looking at past photographs of his wife and their happy days together as a family is simple yet moving and appropriately filmed in closeups while the film's last scene where he reminisces his first encounter with his deceased wife to his children also works brilliantly thanks to Damon at his earnest best. He also shares great chemistry with each of his costars whether Scarlett Johannson's perceptive zookeeper Kelly or Thomas Haden Church's wry older brother Duncan.Both Johannson and Church are also individually outstanding in their supporting roles alongside other equally incomparable veterans like Angus MacFadyen as the groundskeeper with a longstanding grudge for park inspector Walter Ferris John Michael Higgins and Patrick Fugit who played Crowe's alter ego in 'Almost Famous' as one of the zoo staffers with a capuchin monkey perpetually perched on his shoulders. Crowe has also assembled an impressive teenage cast Ford brings a raw edge to his character's anger counterbalanced perfectly by the ebullient Elle Fanning as Kelly's cousin as well as an impossibly adorable Maggie Elizabeth Jones sure to melt your heart.Aided by an outstanding cast Crowe drives the narrative along with a sure confident hand. Alongside the running themes of grief and parenthood are wellinserted vignettes of Benjamin and his crew's obstacles at getting the zoo up to inspection standards in time for a grand reopening on the seventh seventh or the seventh of July among them the escape of the zoo's 650pound grizzly bear Buster the fate of the zoo's 17yearold ailing tiger Spar and of course Benjamin's impending bankruptcy that we admit is over all too soon by a dues ex machina. Still there is genuine feeling in every scene and Crowe's choice of music a mix of oldies with more contemporary tunes as well as Jnsi's of Icelandic cult band Sigur Rs eclectic score works perfectly in complementing the mood of the film. And even though it's tinged with sadness the tone of the film is never depressing Crowe making it sure that the film steers clear of both overdramatic as well as melodramatic moments. There's hope and affirmation abound in this inspirational tale and just because its message of acceptance and reconciliation may sound familiar doesn't mean it is less authentic or touching for that matter. It wears its heart on its sleeve but thanks to Crowe's deft hand as well as Damon's heartfelt performance even the cynical will find themselves moved. www.moviexclusive.com".

	schema:reviewBody " www.Ramascreen.com And the 2011 most feelgood movie goes to WE BOUGHT A ZOO. It's one of the most heartwarming delightful pleasant family films you'll see this Holiday season. It's also an excellent griefthemed movie. Great ensemble cast across the board. This is much lighter than what we usually expect from Cameron Crowe who brought us Jerry Maguire Almost Famous and Vanilla Sky but after leaving us with the meditational Elizabethtown which I didn't enjoy very much and then 6 years hiatus WE BOUGHT A ZOO is a very sweet very nice comeback a breath of fresh airWhat I enjoy about Crowe's movies is that there's always something personable about them and it's no different with WE BOUGHT A ZOO. This film is not preachy it doesn't hit you like a ton of bricks it doesn't drag it doesn't get too sentimental either. It's tender yet firm a bit predictable yet entertaining. It's one of those movies that make anything seem possible somewhat of an underdog story the kind that's generally liked it's a good way for Crowe to tell the world that he's still in the game without having to alienate his old fans while embracing some new ones. Be glad that this is not a talking animal movie. The animals in WE BOUGHT A ZOO serve as a way to challenge the humans on their road to healing and triumph.Matt Damon is a fantastic actor because he can be action man in one movie and he can be your next door regular neighbor joe schmoe in another. As the single dad Benjamin Mee Damon channels a certain vulnerability that comes with fatherhood. And Damon shows the sorrow and exhaustion of a newly single parent. I think it's great to see Scarlett Johansson utilizing more than just her good looks. She shows some range that we remember from Lost In Translation Girl With A Pearl Earring and The Horse Whisperer. Johansson is not believable as a zookeeper I mean let's face it.. if you were to name someone who handles a zoo or cleans animal crap for a living Johansson would probably the last person on your list but she seems selfcomposed which allows her character to be Mee's listening ear. Outstanding work by the teens in this film Colin Ford who plays Mee's angry son Dylan and Elle Fanning who plays the socially awkward Elle Fanning. Their characters embody stereotypical teens and their usual problems with parents and also with peers their age. Ford and Fanning are actors who are going to rock Hollywood someday you just wait and see.Some things don't work for me although I admit Maggie Elizabeth Jones who plays the little daughter Rosie is absolutely adorable I think the film plays out her cuteness way too often way too much. And I think it's sad that Patrick Fugit who was practically the star of Crowe's 2000 Oscar worthy movie Almost Famous doesn't get to have a substantial role in this film. All he mostly does is stand there in the background with a monkey on his back how sad. Aside from the zoo aspect the story itself in its core is nothing unique but that doesn't necessarily mean a bad thing. It's about difficulties of moving on. The loss of his wife the mother of his children leaves a mark that can't easily be replaced by the appeal an unconventional new home. But as the film suggests sometimes plans change and all of a sudden it's not about you anymore. And it's not a Crowe movie without such memorable lines like 'Show me the money' and 'you had me at hello' WE BOUGHT A ZOO has a hopeful message of taking chances and gambling on life through 20 seconds of insane courage loving people and adventurous unadulterated joy. And if you're still asking why you should watch this movie just say to yourself.. why not?! www.Ramascreen.com ".

And I think it's sad that Patrick Fugit who was practically the star of Crowe's 2000 Oscar worthy movie Almost Famous doesn't get to have a substantial role in this film. All he mostly does is stand there in the background with a monkey on his back how sad. Aside from the zoo aspect the story itself in its core is nothing unique but that doesn't necessarily mean a bad thing. It's about difficulties of moving on. The loss of his wife the mother of his children leaves a mark that can't easily be replaced by the appeal an unconventional new home. But as the film suggests sometimes plans change and all of a sudden it's not about you anymore. And it's not a Crowe movie without such memorable lines like 'Show me the money' and 'you had me at hello' WE BOUGHT A ZOO has a hopeful message of taking chances and gambling on life through 20 seconds of insane courage loving people and adventurous unadulterated joy. And if you're still asking why you should watch this movie just say to yourself.. why not?! www.Ramascreen.com ";

	schema:headline " An Inspiring Family Film";
	schema:reviewBody "This holiday season brought audiences several great movie options to see. Out of all of them earlier today I believe I shave seen my favorite. Not War Horse Sherlock Holmes Tintin Mission Impossible or Alvin and the Chipmunks. The winner is We Bought a Zoo. Now to be fair I haven't seen Mission Impossible 4 but despite all the great things I've heard about it I don't think it will strike a chord with me like We Bought a Zoo did. It is such an inspirational story with a powerful message. And it gets quite emotional in several spots. Now I'm not an emotional person typically and I've never actually cried in a movie but this movie almost broke me. My mom who cries a lot during movies certainly was crying in a few spots so its a tearjerker.We Bought a Zoo is based on a true story. Specifically the memoir of Benjamin Mee which is his story of as you can guess him buying a Zoo. There are some noticeable differences in the movie and in the real life story as I have looked at it afterwards but those changes were adapted only after the approval of Benjamin Mee himself who still owns and lives in the Zoo he purchased. In the movie Benjamin played by Matt Damon is going through some serious family troubles. Namely his wife the he dearly loved has just recently passed away which has made life for his young family really difficult emotionally especially for him and his teenage son. Seeking to get away from life a bit he decides that he wants to move and falls in love with a certain country house some 9 miles outside town. Before purchasing it he quickly learns that it is a somewhat broken down and struggling Zoo. Despite his background as an adventurous person he has no knowledge of Zoology. However he decides to take on the task to help renovate and reopen the struggling Zoo. With that said yes it is a story about a Zoo but telling a story of how a man renovated a Zoo is not the point of this movie. It is a story of courage. A story about moving forward in life despite the difficult times. Lastly it's a story about maintaining good relationships with your family and those around you. There are a few taglines in the movie that really just jumped out at me that I will remember and use in my own personal life to help me.Now We Bought a Zoo isn't without its flaws. There are times when I was slightly bored with it and times where it seemed to move slow. I wasn't a big fan of some of the acting by several of the more minor characters. But overall it was a very well done film. The strongest part of the movie was certainly Matt Damon. He has become one of my favorite actors recently and in this he gives a very good performance. If the Academy Awards were up to me I would give him the Oscar for best Actor after this performance. I hope he at least gets nominated because he deserves it. The cast around him was also superb for the most part. Scarlett Johansson did a great job in the lead female performance that being Kelly the lead Zookeeper. Elle Fanning did a great job acting as one of the younger crew members of the Zoo. Lastly Benjamin's two kids ages 14 and 7 were done quite well. His 14 year old son Dylan played by Colin Ford even looked and acted like a young Matt Damon. The score in this movie was absolutely beautiful. It really made the movie. In my opinion it is one of the best scores of the year. The cinematography was also great. I especially loved the animal shots in the movie.In conclusion We Bought a Zoo is no actionpacked high suspense adventure movie. If you are looking for that go check out Mission Impossible or Sherlock Holmes. What it is is an inspirational family movie that I really enjoyed. I highly recommend you check it out. I give it an 8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Why should I like We Bought a Zoo? On paper Cameron Crowe's latest selfdiscovery romance is a mess it's sentimental manipulative and selfconscious  no different from countless other inspirational family movies from 2008's Marley and Me to 2011's inexplicably successful Dolphin Tale. And yet against all logic We Bought a Zoo doesn't fall into that trap. The difference between this and say The Blind Side is that in the former at least for the most part the romanticism feels genuine not a cheap method of pandering to parents in search of a familyfriendly movie for the record I don't imagine that many children will find We Bought a Zoo all that interesting despite numerous shots of animals. Thanks to a capable cast Crowe's spirited direction and of course the pitchperfect soundtrack We Bought a Zoo is far better than it has any right to be.Whether you enjoy We Bought a Zoo most likely depends on how you feel about directorcowriter Cameron Crowe. After the dark bizarre Vanilla Sky and the meditative Elizabethtown this represents Crowe's return to the energetic lighthearted fare that made him popular and features many of his usual tropes including the memorable somewhat cheesy dialogue the aimless male protagonist the quirky sense of humor the precocious child. Having fallen in love with Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous I was both excited and anxious for We Bought a Zoo hoping for a career comeback for Crowe but also accepting that the chances of it being a widespread success were slim. The result is similar to what I anticipated a heartwarming if occasionally schmaltzy ode to the power of love. Although lacking the vivacious wit of Jerry Maguire and the nostalgic ease of Almost Famous We Bought a Zoo has a charm of its own in its belief in happy endings and the strength of the human spirit. Thus while those who dislike Crowe's brand of allAmerican naivet will probably find the movie intolerably sentimental and disingenuous those like me who are less opposed to starryeyed optimism will discover moments of surprising emotional honesty.Much kudos must be given to the cast particularly the five main actors. Matt Damon is a perfect fit for Cameron Crowe imbuing his character with just the right blend of cheerful vitality and quiet sorrow to prevent him from becoming cartoonish and delivering even the most questionable lines with tireless aplomb. Once again he proves his ability to seamlessly inhabit virtually any role as with his graying hair and pudgy physique he is one of the few Alist actors that can convincingly play a completely ordinary father of two. Taking over the prerequisite friend role Thomas Haden Church puts his dry pragmatism to good use evening out the bubbly dynamism that saturates the rest of the movie and although not as impressive as in J.J. Abram's Super 8 Elle Fanning displays admirable maturity for an actress her age proving that she is undeniably one to watch out for. Nonetheless the biggest surprises are Scarlett Johansson and Colin Ford. The matteroffact foil to Damon's idealist Johansson goes against type shedding her usual sylphlike sensuality in favor of something more downtoearth and restrained displaying a subtle composure evocative of her work in such films as The Horse Whisperer and Ghost World. As the bitter volatile Dylan arguably the juiciest part in the movie newcomer Colin Ford whose most notable credit so far is a recurring guest spot on the TV show Supernatural displays considerable selfcontrol turning what could have easily been a stereotypical angstridden teen into a complex person. Like Alex Schaffer who had a similar turn in Win Win he joins an astonishingly long list of promising young performers this year.We Bought a Zoo is not perfect. Unlike the aforementioned actors young Maggie Elizabeth Jones does not fare so well as Mee's innocent outspoken daughter. She is undoubtedly adorable yet she is never quite believable and fails to transcend the angelic child clich the way Jonathan Lipnicki did in Jerry Maguire and some of her scenes are almost cringeworthy in their excessive cuteness. The first thirty minutes are uneven relying too heavily on hamfisted idiosyncrasies and rather clumsy attempts at humor which is a shame since it is precisely those moments that Crowe handled with perfection in romantic comedies like Jerry Maguire and Say Anything. The scenes involving the amateur real estate agent are especially unpleasant luckily there are only a few. Only after the family moves into the new house and begins to interact with the zoo workers does the movie find its groove.The 2011 movie year has brought a surprising trend a return to optimism. From the wideeyed wonder of Super 8 to the whimsical nostalgia of The Artist numerous films have displayed a willingness to break from the dark cynicism that has suffused recent cinema and embrace a newfound sanguinity. Maybe then We Bought a Zoo could not have been released at a better time. With its boundless energy and cando attitude not to mention radiant cinematography and sweeping score composed by none other than Jnsi of Sigur Ros fame this is the epitome of exuberance a bright declaration of faith in humanity rarely seen in modern film. At first I was hesitant to accept We Bought a Zoo something about its brazen cheer felt outdated contrived yet around the halfway mark I realized that I was tearing up. Then during an unexpectedly raw argument scene I outright cried. Maybe the movie is nothing but a cheap ploy for emotion a series of scenes designed to manipulate viewers into experiencing feelings inorganic to the story and characters an inauthentic condescending portrait of false ideals. In the end though I couldn't help but succumb to the film's bold sensitivity its simple tale of triumph over adversity and redemption through love. To answer the question posed at the beginning of this review I will say what Benjamin Mee would probably say Why not?".

	schema:headline " We Bought a Zoo but should you buy a ticket?";
	schema:reviewBody "Cameron Crowe's We Bought a Zoo is a harmless movie about some very nice people who yes end up buying a zoo when they go looking for a new place to live. Unfortunately while the movie is harmless it's also not very interesting. Same goes for the people. They're nice and all but don't seem to have a lot on their minds. Even the zoo animals seem kind of bored. This certainly isn't a bad movie just a very familiar one.The film is based on the true story of Benjamin Mee played here by Matt Damon a single father who is coping with the recent passing of his wife and having to raise his two children on his own. His teenage son Dylan Colin Ford is your typical isolated young man who expresses himself by getting in trouble at school and drawing graphic pictures of death in class. His younger daughter Rosie Maggie Elizabeth Jones is one of those cloying little movie kids who always has something cute or clever to say on cue whenever the camera is pointed at her. He also has a supportive brother Thomas Haden Church who is mainly there for sarcastic comic relief. Benjamin decides the time has come for a change when Dylan is expelled from school and he himself becomes fed up with his newspaper job and walks off. He wants to start a new life for himself and his family.He finds the perfect home somewhere in the Southern California countryside. Naturally it's the one that the realtor seems the most nervous about due to the fact that the house comes with its own struggling private zoo. In what has to be one of the biggest impulse buys in the history of cinema Benjamin decides to buy the house when he sees how happy his little daughter is around the animals. I certainly hope there was more than that behind his decision to buy the property in real life. The family moves in and they take charge of the zoo which comes with its own staff of colorful stock characters. There's Kelly the zookeeper Scarlett Johansson who serves as somewhat of a love interest for Benjamin. The zoo's staff even has a teenage zookeeper Elle Fanning to act as a love interest for Dylan. There's an attempt at a subplot about Fanning's character trying to help Dylan come out of the emotional shell he's been in since his mother died. Too bad it never really works on an emotional level. Maybe if she had been written as an actual character rather than someone whose main character trait is to smile a lot.The rest of the staff is made up of eccentrics and oddballs that the movie can't think of anything to do with so they're not worth mentioning. I understand what Crowe was going for here  He wanted to make a bighearted movie about a family's emotional healing after a crisis and how this family adventure of trying to run the zoo brought them closer together. You can literally see the screenplay cowritten by Crowe trying its hardest to push our emotional buttons. You can also see him throwing just about every audiencepleasing trick in the book. A cute child a shy teen romance the struggle to save a sick tiger a monkey who makes cute little reactions to what the characters say a father trying to move on from his painful past as well as connect with his emotionally distant son...It gets to be a bit much. I have not read the book that inspired this film so I don't know if things actually happened this way. But it felt awfully manipulative and contrived to me.I was also put off by the severe tonal shifts that go on throughout the movie. The stuff concerning Damon and his son are actually pretty good and there are some honest moments. But then there are a lot of moments that are so overly sentimental or broad that they seem like they belong in a different movie. Thomas Haden Church is one of my favorite actors but his role as the drywitted brother is out of place. He's like a character on a sitcom his every word a sarcastic quip. Equally out of place is John Michael Higgins who plays the film's villain a safety inspector who wants to close down the zoo and does his best to find problems with it. Higgins plays the part too broad. As soon as he steps out of the car with that confident and smug smirk plastered on his face you know what role he's supposed to play. And that smirk never leaves his face. It's like he's silently telling us at all times Yep I'm a jerk. How can I be so terrible to these nice people? Don't you just hate me? We Bought a Zoo wants to wear its great big heart on its sleeve and it does. But then for some reason it thinks we don't notice so it keeps on hammering good sunny feelings into each scene to the point that I started to feel assaulted by the film's manipulations. Like I said I have not read the book that the film is based on but I have a sneaking suspicion it's more honest and subtle than what's up on the screen. It has to be because it's real life. This movie is an overly sunny sitcomlevel imitation of real life.".

	schema:reviewBody "Matt Damon stars in a wonderful family film where he plays a widower dad who buys a zoo on life support. Rather We Bought A Zoo since it becomes a project for the whole Mee family that includes his son and daughter. It turns out to be a learning and healing experience all around.All this because Damon wants to get away from all memories associated with his late wife. So the family Mee packs up kit and kaboodle and moves out to the country where he buys a ramshackle country estate type of dwelling. The house is on a large piece of property which contains a zoo. Instinct tells Damon to move in and try and save the animals there.Zoos are a lot of fun but when man takes the animals from the wild he assumes their responsibility. It's a lesson that Damon's character Benjamin Mee learns and while it would be easy to dump the animals to a euthanistic fate probably it would be ducking a responsibility. And the responsibility that the Mee family comes to love and rejoice in.Helping Damon out is his staff that includes Scarlett Johansson as the zoo keeper. She gets Damon out of widower funk as well.Young Colin Ford as Damon's son is well cast and a lot of that is due to him really resembling Damon at an age before he was playing Will Hunting. I'm sure up the family tree you'll find them related if you do a genealogical trace for both. He's got some real relocation issues but in time he comes around.Definitely either buy or rent this DVD. It has to be in Red Box by now.".

I loved how the plot was so simplistic and low key that nothing could really stop you from watching it with a heart. The first thing I really loved was the cast. We have Matt Damon great actor with great diversity Scarlett Johansson pretty actor that I've known and loved from Lost in Translation and lots of others underrated actors. They all did a great job playing their parts albeit some scenes coming across cheesy. And that reminds me the style of the film.. It really doesn't want to be as complex as you think and the acting isn't bad at all. People may glance at it and think it is but I thought the acting contained lots of heart and soul. It takes a lot for that to happen. Everything else was done with a similar fashion and the film is glossed over with some emotional aspects. And for a family film it was really refreshing to see. And to keep this alongside the film I'm not going to go into full details. The movie was simplistic sweet and hopeful. So will this review. I liked it I'm sure you will too.710.".

After his release Valjean is treated as a pariah but finally finds shelter in the home of a kindly bishop. Valjean repays the clergyman's generosity by stealing his silver plate. He is apprehended by the authorities and returned to the bishop but is amazed when the kindly old priest tells them that the valuable plates were a gift. This becomes a transforming experience for the exconvict who establishes himself under an assumed name in a small country village as factory manager and ultimately mayor.

Despite Milestones involvement this one displays more surface gloss than genuine style  with the script itself being much more prosaic. Still theres an intermittent evidence of talent throughout  for instance in the rather effective final shot which frames the mirror image of the protagonists between the allimportant candlesticks also worth noting is the score by Alex North which particularly at the climax feels like a dry run for his Oscarnominated work on SPARTACUS 1960.Michael Rennie and Robert Newton are fine actors but their performances here are no match for Fredric March and Charles Laughton in the earlier film though Newton is remarkably restrained his role has been somewhat diminished to accommodate the sappy romance involving Debra Paget and Cameron Mitchell! Besides its compromised by the loss of two small but important scenes from the 1935 version which in this case robs the character of essential depth a when Javert is humiliated by his peers for his lowly background and b when he blackmails newlyappointed Mayor Jean Valjean a former convict in his office unbelievably it substitutes the first by having Javerts own father serve a prison sentence on the galley to which hes himself assigned!Other conceptual flaws include Edmund Gwenns pivotal role of the Bishop which comes off as whimsical alongside Cedric Hardwickes haunting turn in the earlier film Valjean is depicted as an illiterate who receives schooling from the intellectual played by Joseph Wiseman his Method approach feels out of place in a 19th century French setting! Javerts consciencestricken demise here is disconcertingly brought about by his brief conversation with James Robertson Justice as Valjeans righthand man missing from the narrative though is the poignant character of Eponine whose role gave a plausible melancholia to the romantic angle in the 1935 film.Ultimately I wouldnt call the 1952 LES MISERABLES unnecessary considering that its made with undeniable professionalism and the fact that countless other film versions have followed it perhaps the late eminent critic Leslie Halliwell summed it best in his claim that its lacking the spark of inspiration.".

He seems badly miscast here.Much of the story has been altered in this version but whenever the concentration is on the story of the haunted central character the film is lifted to another dimension. Rennie as the convict in the early sequences is especially good at conveying all the pain and humiliation his character feels.Too bad that subplots take away from some of the story's strength especially the one involving Sylvia Sydney's character which is probably among the weakest roles of her career. Her reunion scene with daughter Cosette is almost laughable.A deeper more penetrating exploration of Valjean and Javert would have given the film a stronger feel.

	schema:headline " No Love For Javert";
	schema:reviewBody "Michael Rennie and Robert Newton have a go at playing the classic roles of Jean Valjean and Inspector Javert in another version of Les Miserables. The story was far better told on Broadway and in the 1935 film with Fredric March and Charles Laughton.Not the fault of the actors Michael Rennie is the restrained voice of civilized humanity in Jean Valjean proof that a man can overcome a bad start in life and make a contribution to mankind's betterment. Holding the opposite view of course is Robert Newton as the ruthless Inspector Javert who in fact did have a bad upbringing the child of a convict but refuses to believe that anyone else can. His negative view of mankind doesn't bring anyone any love in their lives. This I've always felt is the key to Javert be he played by Charles Laughton or Robert Newton.What I didn't like and was not in the MarchLaughton version was the idea that the Valjean character had more than a fatherly interest in Cosette the child of the doomed Fantine who Valjean adopts. Those are the major female roles in Les Miserables and are played here by Debra Paget and Sylvia Sidney respectively and well. I don't think it was necessary at all to have Paget's young suitor revolutionary student Cameron Mitchell make that accusation.It's not a bad film but after March and Laughton this one seems like a local stock company production.".

	onyx:emotionText "Michael Rennie and Robert Newton have a go at playing the classic roles of Jean Valjean and Inspector Javert in another version of Les Miserables. The story was far better told on Broadway and in the 1935 film with Fredric March and Charles Laughton.Not the fault of the actors Michael Rennie is the restrained voice of civilized humanity in Jean Valjean proof that a man can overcome a bad start in life and make a contribution to mankind's betterment. Holding the opposite view of course is Robert Newton as the ruthless Inspector Javert who in fact did have a bad upbringing the child of a convict but refuses to believe that anyone else can. His negative view of mankind doesn't bring anyone any love in their lives. This I've always felt is the key to Javert be he played by Charles Laughton or Robert Newton.What I didn't like and was not in the MarchLaughton version was the idea that the Valjean character had more than a fatherly interest in Cosette the child of the doomed Fantine who Valjean adopts.

	schema:reviewBody "As a huge fan of the book and the musical I have made it one of my priorities to see all of the movie versions of Les Miserables that I can. I can officially say now that this version is probably the furthest from the book except perhaps the 1998 version. I cannot blame the actors but I do blame the screenwriter and director for this slaughter of a classic.The movie was okay up until the judge sentenced Valjean to ten years in the galleys. Valjean doesn't go to the galleys he goes to TOULON a PRISON CAMP where he does HARD LABOR. I could forgive this however except that the movie only went downhill from there. The incident with the bishop is fairly similar...save that the dialogue seems to have been taken almost word for word from the 1935 version and that Mme. Magloire appears about twenty. Valjean is somehow able to buy a pottery plant after his brilliant idea to have everyone work on what they are best at. So much for glass beads. At this point he meets the entirely nonexistent Robert who becomes a close friend that lives with Valjean for the rest of the movie. Why did they decide to make up characters WHY? It was wholly unnecessary! Well...it would have been if they had stuck to the book. The way this script was going it was probably necessary.Fantine of course does not sell her hair. Or her teeth. Because apparently audiences of the 1950s do not want to hear about such things. In fact she looks quite good for a woman living on the streets. Fantine is not a prostitute either because it's bad to promote prostitution as a way to survive when you cannot support your starving child any other way. And because everyone has to believe that good things happen to dying people Valjean goes and fetches a notsoyounglooking Cosette who is reunited with her notsosicklooking mother. Bear in mind that this sequence is not shown eliminating the Thenardiers entirely as well as images of a malnourished Cosette. Apparently everyone is well aware Fantine is going to die yet they go about their day eversohappily.They end up at The Convent of the Child Mary because Petit Picpus is too hard to say. The sequence of meeting Marius in the convent is rather random as is Marius' later accusation of Valjean being in love with Cosette. This IS NOT TRUE. Why? Why do so many directors and screenwriters think he's in love with Cosette? It's not TRUE. Anyway Marius not seeming overwhelmingly disheartened when Valjean won't let him marry Cosette and also says they're leaving for England ends up at the barricades. It's not really ever explained why there's a barricade in the first place. There just is. It's just a bunch of random people and by that I mean about five times as many in the book. It's 40 not 200 So Valjean intercepts Marius' letter to Cosette...which says something to the effect of Your father is a jealous horrible person. If I live you should run away and elope with me. Totally opposite of course from the I'm going to die and I love you letter that should be sent. Valjean seems to go to the barricade more to convince himself he's unselfish than to save Marius.Then comes the sewer chase. The sewer chase upset me for one reason and one alone. There was a skull on the sewer ledge. Just a skull. Not even a skeleton. Because so many people go down into the sewers and some how decapitate themselves such that their head remains on the ledge and their body floats away. It was so CORNY! I laughed very hard when I saw that skull. It also appears to be a flashback to the 1935 movie where there was one present in those sewers as well.Thanks to bad character development and a bad script in general Javert's suicide seems entirely uncalled for. And Valjean watches. And the movie ends. And I start to cry and laugh simultaneously.I am very upset at the plot changes as well as the cuttings of Enjolras Eponine and the Thenardiers. I am upset that Valjean was a brute with few redeeming qualities throughout the movie and that they did not show his confession to Marius nor his death. I am upset at the horrid characterization of Javert who was among other things short rotund and nonmenacing. I am upset that Fantine looked perfectly fine and got to see a thirteenyearold Cosette again. I am upset that Marius was an unattractive 35yearold man without a background story to help you understand his character. I am upset at the addition of Robert into the story. I am upset that absolutely no one in a movie about the poor and miserable was poor and miserable except the galley slaves. In fact Gavroche may have been the only character whose original attitude and appearance remained the same though many of his scenes were cut entirely and he served more as a messanger than anything.Some other unexpected defects in this wretched movie were the costumes. The costumes did not look at all like the clothes of 19th century Parisians except for the National Guard uniforms. The hats in particular were very wrong for the time. It was saddening that no one did any research on this kind of thing.The trailer advertised it as A movie as great as the book! The people who created this trailer must have never read it.".

This is not a bad film far from it. As an adaptation it's not great but when judged on its own it's one example of a film with many merits but falls short. Debra Paget makes one of the least interesting characters of the book even blander if she wasn't so beautiful she would have been completely forgettable while I do agree that Cameron Mitchell is similarly stiff. The film suffers also from too much of the film being focused too much on Cosette and Marius and not enough on Valjean and Javertwhose story is much more interesting and important seeing as Paget and Mitchell are so unconvincing in their roles it does hurt the film. Valjean and Javert do have some good tense chemistry together but you wish there was more.Some may say the film is pedestrian I personally think the opposite and that it's rushed it maintains the pacing of the book well but the effectiveness of the different subplots is mixed and the characters don't ring true as much as other adaptations because the film does feel rather superficial at times. The ending was abrupt I missed the emotion and irony that the 1935 film's had and made Javert's suicide almost pointless Marius' accusation seemed out of character and unnecessary and the omission of Enjolras and Eponine the waste of Gavrochebetter than omitting him like the 1935 film a much better film but still and the addition of Robertwho didn't add a whole lot added to the lack of story depth.You might think reading all this that Les Miserables1952 is a bad film. As said already it isn't. It is very handsomely mounted with authentic sets and costumes and lovely cinematography. The final shot is a notable example. The music score from Alex North is a mixture of rousing haunting and beautiful. The script is a very thoughtprovoking one that respects Hugo's writing. The story did lack a fair bit but it did have its very good moments. Fantine's story is still very poignantthough much more so in the book and in other adaptations the film is set up very well Valjean and Javert's conflicts make for some good tension and the sewer chase is thrilling. The storytelling also may be lacking in detail but the spirit of the book is present.Michael Rennie is a very noble Valjean who also gives the character real truth and emotion which makes him one of the film's most sympathetic charactersthe other being the bishop. That goodness doesn't always come easy to Valjean is not absent either. Robert Newton's Javert is equally excellent he is menacing and authoritative but like with Valjean the film doesn't forget to give a sensethough not the most powerfully depicted that Javert can't catch Valjean despite getting very closeespecially at the endwithout breaking what he stands for and also that Javert cannot accept that Valjean has changed. James RobertsonJustice does have a warm presence and makes an effort to make Robert like he was part of the story already it doesn't work in that respect but Justice still gives a good account of himself. Sylvia Sidney is affecting as Fantine and Edmund Gwenn brings humanity and benevolence to the bishop.In conclusion a decent film that could have been better. 610 Bethany Cox".

I've seen a few and each version seems to have their own strengths and weaknesses. In the 1952 version the strengths are the two leads playing Jean Valjean and Inspector Javert Michael Rennie and Robert Newton. Michael puts his whole heart into this movie and tries as hard as he can to make it better and of course Bobbie is always a wonderfully menacing villain.The weaknesses I'm sorry to say are quite large. Sylvia Sidney isn't bad as Fantine but unfortunately she has a very small part. The larger female lead is the role of Cosette. Debra Paget who should never have been cast in a drama let alone a period piece plays Cosette. She could easily be the worst one in the movie but her romantic scenes are paired with Cameron Mitchell as Marius. The character of Marius is supposed to be rather innocent handsome strong hopeful and above all easy to root for. Cameron Mitchell is none of those things! I would have laughed at the idea that he was supposed to be trustworthy and sincere but I was too busy cringing.Everyone likes to put his own spin on things so as you might expect there are some slight differences to the plot in this one. As hard as Michael and Bobbie try to make their performances the only ones the audiences will remember Cameron and Debra are overwhelmingly contemporary and miscast. This one isn't my favorite but I've yet to see a perfect version. With so many characters there are bound to be actors in every adaptation who threaten to ruin the rest of the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I guess this is about the most filmed of Hugo's novels and it's understandable. It probes the distinction between the law and justice which aren't always concordant.The story must be fairly familiar. The Fugitive was a shameless rip off. The tattered exhausted starving bitter soulless Jean Valjean Rennie just out of prison for having stolen a loaf of bread is taken in by a kindly Bishop who cares for him and gives him a bed. In return Valjean gets up early steals all the silverware and makes off with it. He's caught by the police but the Bishop lies and claims the silver was a gift. It's one of the things I like about the story  and about many of Dickens' tales too. The poor lead wretched lives but they're hardly all heroes. These stories probe the distinction between adult stories and propaganda. Sent away with the silver and the Bishop's blessings Valjean gets himself cleaned up and becomes part owner then full owner of a pottery shop that prospers under his management. He becomes so well known that he's elected mayor. But in doing so he breaks his parole and if he's caught will spend the rest of his life in prison. The likelihood of that's happening increases when the mentally rigid Inspector Javert Newton is assigned as head of the district's police force. The son of a convict himself Newton was one of Rennie's guards in the prison galleys and considers him suspect. His suspicions are confirmed when Rennie sacrifices himself in order to save a confused old man who was mistaken for him.Thereafter the story gets more complicated  it's based on an almost endless novel more than 1400 pages divided into more than 300 chapters.Rennie's adopted daughter Cosette Paget takes up with a young revolutionary Mitchell and conflicts ensure. This plot thread probes the difference between romantic love and familial love because for all we know the young Debra Paget being the dish she is she may be Lolita to Rennie's Humbert Humbert. That's what Mitchell thinks anyway. For some reason I never cared much for Mitchell as an actor or for his sympathetic but hotheaded character Marius. They were rebelling against the captains of industry and the robber barons who were making fortunes at the expense of everyone else just as in much of the rest of the industrialized world okay but violence tends to beget violence. Besides I can't remember a single powerful performance from Cameron Mitchell. He may have been a nice guy in real life loved his dog collected pressed roses. Let's see. I think I've covered the Cameron Mitchell business. Ah but the strawberries. The strawberries! That's where I had them! You should see me do Humphrey Bogart. My son tells me it's terrific although I have to beat him into saying it.In the end it's hard to compare the various filmed versions of Les Miserables. For one thing I haven't seen that many of them. For another the main theme of pursuit by a singleminded neurotic aside there are so many plot threads to be followed with varying degrees of detail that each version is almost like a different movie. The most realistic version that I've seen is unquestionably the rendition starring Liam Neeson as Jean Valjean and Uma Thurman as Cosette's prostitute mother who dies of tuberculosis. When Thurman coughs she spits up blood. And Geoffrey Rush as Javert was superb. The version with Frederick March like the one under discussion is given the broad Hollywood treatment and is nice and taut but tastes differ.".

	schema:reviewBody "Les miserables 1952  out of 4 Slick production of Victor Hugo's classic novel has Michael Rennie in the role of Jean Valjean and Robert Newton as the Inspector hounding him for decades. This is only the second version of the novel that I've seen the 1935 being the first so it's hard for me to compare various versions but it's interesting some of the changes made here. Of course we get small changes like the amount of money owed Valjean after he's released from jail but the final chase through the sewers is changed a bit and some of the overall attitudes towards the two leads are also changed. I think these type of changes always make for an interesting viewing experience when it comes to often filmed stories like this one Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and various others. While there's a lot to enjoy here I think the biggest issue is the performance of Rennie. He has proved that he could be great in certain roles but I found here pretty bland here and not the least bit interesting. His performance here will remind plenty of his one in THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL but where that laid back approach worked for that classic it really hurts this film. I never really bought him in the role and instead of seeing and feeling the character it felt more like I was watching an actor struggle with a part. Newton on the other hand is one I really enjoyed. He played the part with a nice coldness that comes through quite well but he also adds a stern fatherlike touch that make the character stand out. Debra Paget Cameron Mitchell and Elsa Lanchester round out the cast. The music score is an effective one and the cinematography is topnotch. Milestone handles the material quite well and he really makes a beautiful looking film with plenty of style and some really good looking shots. I think it would be fair to say that this is a handsome production but it's missing some of the heart and soul of the earlier version.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been a diehard Marxist for several years now. After I watched their first seven films to the point where my tapes were in tatters I sought out their later films the lesser productions Room Service thru Night in Casablanca. After that I still wanted more so I finally gave in and watched the one film that I KNEW would be painful Love Happy. Virtually every review has smeared this film and ripped into it with full claws so I braced myself and bought the DVD.Now let me tell you something this movie is great. Of course it's not in the ballpark of the Paramounts but it fits nicely with their later films and is a real delight. So why the negative rap? Well this movie was originally intended as a solo vehicle for Harpo Marx. Chico joined on when he needed money to get out of debt. Groucho was never supposed to be in this film but the sponsors said that they wouldn't release it unless he was so that they could bill it as a Marx Brothers picture. So footage of Groucho narrating parts of the story were shoehorned into the finished product. The result? Chico and Harpo are just as enchanting as ever and Grouchodespite being displayed prominently on the movie postersis relegated to a commentator. Since most Marx fans are Groucho fans first ChicoHarpo fans second this setup comes as a slap in the face and the film gets trashed.As such if you watch the Marxes mainly to see Groucho's witty quips this movie will bore you stiff. However if youlike melove the others just as much as Groucho for me Chico will ALWAYS be the funniest Marx Brother! you'll be surprised at how good Love Happy really is. I'd go into the plot but with a Marx movie who really cares about the plot? It's our boys we're after. Chico plays an uproarious pianoviolin duet lusts after Ilona Massey has some tootsyfrootsy ice cream and does some flawed mindreading Harpo tumbles through a washing machine turns his fingers into candles pulls a dog out of his coat and lusts after Ilona Massey. And Groucho narrates searches quips ponders the situation and...lusts after Ilona Massey. Oh!and did I mention this film started the career of a young Marilyn Monroe? In short to a ChicoHarpo fan this movie is as good as and often better than At the Circus or A Night in Casablanca. To a Groucho fan...well that's why we have remotecontrols.".

Virtually every review has smeared this film and ripped into it with full claws so I braced myself and bought the DVD.Now let me tell you something this movie is great. Of course it's not in the ballpark of the Paramounts but it fits nicely with their later films and is a real delight. So why the negative rap? Well this movie was originally intended as a solo vehicle for Harpo Marx. Chico joined on when he needed money to get out of debt. Groucho was never supposed to be in this film but the sponsors said that they wouldn't release it unless he was so that they could bill it as a Marx Brothers picture. So footage of Groucho narrating parts of the story were shoehorned into the finished product. The result? Chico and Harpo are just as enchanting as ever and Grouchodespite being displayed prominently on the movie postersis relegated to a commentator. Since most Marx fans are Groucho fans first ChicoHarpo fans second this setup comes as a slap in the face and the film gets trashed.As such if you watch the Marxes mainly to see Groucho's witty quips this movie will bore you stiff. However if youlike melove the others just as much as Groucho for me Chico will ALWAYS be the funniest Marx Brother! you'll be surprised at how good Love Happy really is. I'd go into the plot but with a Marx movie who really cares about the plot? It's our boys we're after. Chico plays an uproarious pianoviolin duet lusts after Ilona Massey has some tootsyfrootsy ice cream and does some flawed mindreading Harpo tumbles through a washing machine turns his fingers into candles pulls a dog out of his coat and lusts after Ilona Massey. And Groucho narrates searches quips ponders the situation and...lusts after Ilona Massey. Oh!and did I mention this film started the career of a young Marilyn Monroe? In short to a ChicoHarpo fan this movie is as good as and often better than At the Circus or A Night in Casablanca. To a Groucho fan...well that's why we have remotecontrols.";

As a comedy Love Happy is soso with Harpo providing some genuine laughs particularly during an interrogation scene with villains Raymond Burr Ilona Massey Eric Blore and Bruce Gordon and in the rooftop finale with Harpo offering the same kind of outrageous physical humor that he had demonstrated in the classic MGM comedies. But the rest of the plot while mildly entertaining is simply a musical variation of Room Service as an impoverished group of performers headed by Paul Valentine and future star VeraEllen struggle to put on a Broadway musical.The back story of the film is possibly more entertaining than the movie itself Harpo had wanted to make a solo film throughout the forties and had tinkered on the script for several years while soliciting financial backing for the project. Chico meanwhile was running up huge gambling debts as was often the case while a brilliant card player he was a notoriously bad gambler and just as the Marxes had made A Night in Casablanca in 1946 to pay off his debts at that time Harpo brought him into Love Happy to do the same. Unfortunately the end of the decade was a depressed time for film making with television making inroads into the ticketbuying public and backers would only fund the project if all three brothers would appear in the movie.Groucho by now a genuine TV star thanks to the You Bet Your Life quiz show hated the script of Love Happy and had little desire to costar in the film. He was however loyal to his brothers and finally reached a compromise he would only appear briefly would not have to wear his trademark greasepaint eyebrows and mustache and would have final approval of his dialog and the performers working with him. He could honestly say he helped 'discover' Marilyn Monroe at an open audition watching two other starlets walk across a stage followed by Marilyn when asked for his pick for a small role he raised his eyebrows and quipped You're kidding right?Be warned While Love Happy is not terrible it certainly is no Night at the Opera or Duck Soup!".

	schema:reviewBody "i'm a big marx bros fan and love most of their films especially the early paramounts and a day at the races and most of the others so thats pretty much all of them i guess. Room service is the weakest of their output as far as i can tell..If I was mainly a Groucho fan which most of the reviewers of Marx Brothers films seem to be I'd be giving this movie between 1  3 stars. His part is minimal not very funny and is mainly famous for the scene with Marilyn Monroe in one of her first speaking roles which lasts a few seconds...I've just read a review for this film calling it unfunny. Maybe they were watching a different movie? I am completely fed up with reading the nonsense that's been written about this film by people who probably haven't even watched it...I'm a Harpo fan.........I really think he's a true screen genius the greatest one of his kind. When he's on screen for me its pure magic.This film has a special place in my heart.. The screenplay is based on a Harpo story and he is the main star originally the film was to be a solo vehicle for him. Chico's and Groucho's appearance was an afterthought..Chico performs well and the scenes when he's with Harpo are great and are the equal to any other marx movie. Harpo doesn't disappoint with so many great hilarious scenes that were mainly devised and performed by himself he did most of his own stunts...quite amazing considering he was in his early 60's at the time....The story revolves around a theatre production called 'love happy' and a missing diamond necklace in a sardine tin. The other cast members perform well and the songs are not too cheesy. Chico does a great piano duet with a violinist and harpo plays the harp as beautifully as ever..If I was hoping to see and hear Groucho in his element i'd be very disappointed with Love Happy. But on every other level its a classic. So please give it a chance  its worth it............".

	schema:reviewBody "This day being the one Groucho Marx died 30 years ago 3 days after Elvis I decided to watch some of his movies that I either have on tape or just checked at the library. Love Happy I taped 12 years ago from AMC. This movie came 20 years after Groucho and his brothers' talkie debut in The Cocoanuts. His participation is limited here which is just as well since he doesn't have many funny lines except with the villainous Ilona Massey and in her brief part a wellendowed Marilyn Monroe. Says Groucho to her Is there anything I can do for you? turns to audience as he seesaws his eyebrows What a ridiculous statement! The story mainly concerns Harpo as himself as he steals plenty of sardine cans as they're being thrown at him unknowingly by Eric Blore. One Blore doesn't throw but has stolen unbeknownst from him by Harpo has some valuable diamonds. There's also a plot about a musical show with dancer VeraEllen and singer Marion Hutton Betty's sister that's for the birds. Best parts of those segments concern Chico's piano playing with violinist Leon Belasco though there's also a sexy VeraEllen number that got my temperature rising. Worst parts for me were Chico's wooing of Ms. Massey and VeraEllen's constant crying in front of Harpo. Most interesting part was the chase sequence at the end where Harpo rides on lots of billboards in one of the rare instances of product placements of the period. Many of those gags probably came from former animation director Frank Tashlin a cowriter of the script. While there's one scene with Groucho and Harpo the one with Chico at the end probably was shot on separate occasions since they don't share that scene together just a cut to Chico after Grouch calls out to him. So technically this isn't really a Marx Brothers picture just Harpo starring with Chico in support and Groucho in an extended cameo. Having not seen The Big Store I reserve judgment on whether this is the worst movie of their career but Love Happy is certainly one of their lesser ones. P.S. Raymond Burr is one of the henchmen.".

	onyx:emotionText "This day being the one Groucho Marx died 30 years ago 3 days after Elvis I decided to watch some of his movies that I either have on tape or just checked at the library. Love Happy I taped 12 years ago from AMC. This movie came 20 years after Groucho and his brothers' talkie debut in The Cocoanuts. His participation is limited here which is just as well since he doesn't have many funny lines except with the villainous Ilona Massey and in her brief part a wellendowed Marilyn Monroe. Says Groucho to her Is there anything I can do for you? turns to audience as he seesaws his eyebrows What a ridiculous statement! The story mainly concerns Harpo as himself as he steals plenty of sardine cans as they're being thrown at him unknowingly by Eric Blore. One Blore doesn't throw but has stolen unbeknownst from him by Harpo has some valuable diamonds. There's also a plot about a musical show with dancer VeraEllen and singer Marion Hutton Betty's sister that's for the birds.

There's once again another loony but halfbaked crime plot here involving stolen diamonds in a can of... sardines I think Chico on piano and a musical that is on thin ice as far as being produced. Objectively this isn't as good a movie as I'm rating it but I'm being generous because when these guys do click in their scenes they are just that funny.

	schema:reviewBody "Taken as the final Marx Brothers movie then Love Happy can't help but disappoint. But the enjoyment contained in this pleasant diversion of a film is perhaps directly proportionate to how you approach it. Really the film based on a story by Harpo is a solo Harpo Marx vehicle and the first one in which his character shares the same moniker as his stage name since Monkey Business. I've reviewed three Marx Brothers movies on the IMDb over the last decade or so and in some of them I've been pretty mean about Harpo's character. As a relative Marx Brothers novice though as said I've still been watching them for around a dozen years now maybe it took me a while to get used to him or maybe he really is just more likable in this one? Certainly his affectations around women seem more genuinely innocent and charming than the wouldbe sex pest of the earlier vehicles. Though this is of course the whole point the Harpo Marx in this film isn't really the uncontrollable force of nature from earlier ventures but a more passive and selfless man played by an actor now in his sixties. You're no longer watching THE Harpo but A Harpo. One inconsolable issue I've always had with the character is that the inner beauty he allows us to see during his harp solos isn't reflected in the regular persona. So the sweet and gentle look in Harpo's eyes comes from a different place to the guy causing violent mayhem or female harassment. By the time of Love Happy both sides of the character finally meet in the middle as Harpo begins to embrace the kind of naked sentimentality so beloved of Chaplin particularly towards the end of his career. And as Harpo ages he begins to bear more than a passing resemblance to Chaplin particularly as Charlie played other characters with his own white hair during the 50s.So if we can take this film on its own terms and lower expectations accordingly it becomes more palatable. Then we factor in that it has a minor role for Chico. The brothers had previously come out of a five year retirement for A Night In Casablanca 6 reputedly to help clear Chico's gambling debts. Chico doesn't get away with this scott free as in Casablanca and this movie he's forced to take parts in scenes that involve him gambling. Love Happy even has him losing with a There goes my coat. And in an age of product placement then the mark of the financial backers is even sent up with Harpo amusingly using most of the advertising billboards during the climax as makeshift fairground rides.With all this in mind it's a likable enough movie that features the final film performance of Harpo Marx with a guest appearance from his brother. Except by this stage the financial backers want the obvious and Groucho is also drafted in. Yet Groucho isn't properly integrated into the narrative and just does introductory monologuesvoiceovers and gets to share hardly any screen time with his brothers at all not even being seen on screen with Chico even though they're supposed to be in the same scene. Even worse Groucho couldn't make his disinterest any clearer if he'd tried. While he appeared reinvigorated for Casablanca  for my money better than any film they took part in since A Day At The Races  here he's just there to help out his brothers a deeply bored man sans greasepaint more interested in his TV quiz show than this not really a Marx Brothers movie.Certainly even less of a Marx Brothers movie is an endeavour they all did eight years later  Irwin Allen's The Story of Mankind 5 featuring all three brothers playing minor roles in vignettes where they do not meet. A film that looks part epic thanks to reused stock footage part cheap episode of Star Trek it has some amusing moments for a onceagaintrying Groucho a blink and you'll miss it secondary part for Chico and two minutes of Harpo as Isaac Newton. The only time they were shot in colour  in this case the lovably dated and garish Technicolor  you finally get to see them in their splendour although Groucho once again appears without his makeup and all three are pushing seventy. It's by no means a great film and by no means a Marx Brothers movie though it's probably better than its reputation even if only by default.So for the final three Marx Brothers pictures after their return from retirement we're left with the unsettling prospect that only one of them can genuinely be regarded as a Marx Brothers movie. Love Happy then. It's a terrible Marx Brothers movie. But as a movie in its own right it's really quite charming.".

The scene near the end on the rooftop amid the Times Square advertising signs is delightful. There seems to be an obvious element of product placement though I don't know whether the filmmakers got paid for this but that all adds to the peculiar humor of the scene. It's been a very long time since I first saw the classic Marx Brothers films at least as an adult who could appreciate them. Back then they were funny. But I can't say they crack me up these days as the gags have gotten old. So it was wonderful to find this Marx Brothers film I hadn't seen and to laugh at them again. This is a funny film. Period.It is a bit sad knowing this was their last film also knowing the great young comedy writers who were about to get started in live television including Mel Brooks and Woody Allen. If only their talent could have been turned to writing more scripts for the Marx Brothers. Instead they wrote for Sid Caesar's television shows which in some ways were the heirs to the Marx Brothers humor. I think I will watch Love Happy again soon. I want to watch Harpo's performance more closely. It seems to me he was the last of the silent film comedians in the tradition of Chaplin and Buster Keaton whose humor was all in their body language.

	schema:reviewBody "This film marked the finale for the Marx Brothers glorious career in movies. Of course Love Happy does not compare with their classic work which was much wittier than what comes out here. It almost appears the movie was a vehicle for Harpo Marx more than a collaboration of the trio that made us laugh.The plot is paper thin but there are moments that work like the chase sequence at the end and the Kleptomaniacs performance by Harpo as the film begins. Groucho is only seen as an afterthought. Chico Marx has nothing to do in the film. The lovely Ilona Massey adds a sinister tone to the comedy with her Madame Egilichi who is after the Romanoff diamond necklace that has been smuggled in a can of sardines.As directed by David Miller with an uncredited help by Leo McCarey. The production shows it might have had problems which probably means that Mr. McCarey came to make the film more appealing to audiences. The same can be said about the screenplay by Frank Tashlin and Marc Bedoff as an uncredited Ben Hecht was brought in to help with the project.The cast shows two surprises. Raymond Burr is seen in one of the many heavy types he played at the start of his days in Hollywood. Marilyn Monroe is ravishingly fresh and fun as an aspiring actress. Vera Ellen Eric Blore Marion Hutton Melville Cooper and Paul Valentine have featured roles.In spite of all its flaws Love Happy is a must see for all Marx Brothers fans.".

It almost appears the movie was a vehicle for Harpo Marx more than a collaboration of the trio that made us laugh.The plot is paper thin but there are moments that work like the chase sequence at the end and the Kleptomaniacs performance by Harpo as the film begins. Groucho is only seen as an afterthought. Chico Marx has nothing to do in the film. The lovely Ilona Massey adds a sinister tone to the comedy with her Madame Egilichi who is after the Romanoff diamond necklace that has been smuggled in a can of sardines.As directed by David Miller with an uncredited help by Leo McCarey. The production shows it might have had problems which probably means that Mr. McCarey came to make the film more appealing to audiences. The same can be said about the screenplay by Frank Tashlin and Marc Bedoff as an uncredited Ben Hecht was brought in to help with the project.The cast shows two surprises. Raymond Burr is seen in one of the many heavy types he played at the start of his days in Hollywood. Marilyn Monroe is ravishingly fresh and fun as an aspiring actress. Vera Ellen Eric Blore Marion Hutton Melville Cooper and Paul Valentine have featured roles.In spite of all its flaws Love Happy is a must see for all Marx Brothers fans.";

Plus given their age the team just seems old and tired with the exception of Harpo.However despite these major drawbacks there are a couple sight gags that are marvelous. HOWEVER DO NOT READ FURTHER AS THERE ARE SPOILER!! When Harpo is being searched the stuff they find in his coat is amazing! So I guess it can be said that this is Harpo's movie.

	schema:reviewBody "By no means vintage Marx but worth savoring for two reasons The second is that it was the Brothers' last film even if Groucho's role is smaller and he meets up only fleetingly with Harpo and has but two short scenes with Chico. The first reason is Groucho's encounter with Marilyn Monroe. There is an unexpected knock on the door of his seedy office while he is in the middle of his sandinthehourglass scene with Ivan. Groucho opens the door and who should be standing there in a white offtheshoulder evening gown? She saunters in. I want you to help me she pleads. This is a cue for a typical leering question from Groucho. Some men are following me she explains  an amazing camera setup in which she exits smiling radiantly knowingly right into the left hand side of the screen. Groucho ushers her to the door. She undulates innocently seductively teasingly  a superbly contrived performance in which her charismatic attraction is undimmed no matter how many times you run the scene backwards and forwards. Groucho's performance on the other hand becomes more and more mechanical. All the same this is one of the alltime great scenes in film history. Add it to your list of the great hundred joining McDonald directing Bells of Rosarita and Cagney dancing his elative Give My Regards to Broadway.Ilona Massey fans will also find Love Happy of uncommon interest. They may bridle at finding their idol stooging for Harpo but Ilona plays the grand lady as if to the manner born yet slinking and vamping most appealingly in some of the lowestcut costumes ever seen in a Hollywood film. Nice to notice Raymond Burr as one of her henchmen and Melville Cooper traipsing amusingly through his scenes as the harassed manager.Musically Love Happy provides not one but two piano interludes for Chico. Firstly he partner's Leon Belasco's violin interspersing his usual deft playing with clever wisecracks. Secondly he does the Marche Militaire with some delightful comic business in popping diamonds. Harpo has his usual solo and Marion Hutton Betty's oneyearolder sister gets to sing a typical Hutton number Mama Wants To Know which she does most effectively if less stridently than her famous kid sister. Chico played piano for a more elaborate Hutton production number Willow Weep For Me which was deleted before release. You can still see the cut early on in the film where the clumsily substituted dissolve transition doesn't make visual sense. It was probably thought that a surplus of musical numbers would bore the audience. Unfortunately this leaves VeraEllen with very little to do. Newcomer Paul Valentine has more dancing than Vera who is even robbed of a climactic number as we cut to the sporadically amusing but overlong rooftop scene.Despite its faults the script is often despite the strenuous efforts of all the players stubbornly unfunny. The comedy scenes and business are usually extended way beyond their capacity to amuse and one of the straight plots  the strugglingtoBroadwayonashoestringplayers  has little interest Love Happy was enormously popular enjoying a second lease of life when Paramount reissued their vintage Marx comedies in the midfifties.For a fuller account of Harpo's onscreen capers in this film  he wrote the story I would guess primarily to showcase Chico and even more particularly himself Groucho's role reads like an afterthought  I warmly recommend The Marx Brothers Their World of Comedy by Allen Eyles published by Tantivy Press London 1966. Oddly Harpo himself doesn't even mention this film in his autobiography Harpo Speaks.".

There are some chuckles spread throughout and the movie does move from scene to scene pretty quickly that ALMOST hides the fact that there isn't a terrible amount of plot. Still it's a far cry from the brothers' movies from the previous decade.

Being a transvestite in the late 80's would have been difficult everywhere but in Palermo where the Catholic Church is amazingly strong very influential in every aspect of every day life and diffused in the territory these difficulties were at a higher level because of the involved social stigma.Most of the actors are not professionals. They are real streetkids that were asked to perform themselves in these two features. What is really sad is that many of them in their real lives kept on ending up in prison with more and more serious charges. Some also died either killed in some gang related homicides or because of drug abuse.The kids talk in a very strong dialect. I am from the North of Italy while the main characters are from Sicily. When I watched the movie with my friends in Milan we could not understand a single word and we had to turn on the closed captions for the hearing impaired which luckily were in plain Italian to understand most of the dialogues. This is to say that the director has been very honest in this respect making the people talk as they would be doing in their turf.Unfortunately the movie describes in a very precise and realistic way the poor neighborhoods of Palermo which are not very different from the ones you would find in other large Italian cities particularly in the South which is economically disadvantaged.".

I just have to figure the commenters are a bunch of Yankees who never set foot in the South and have no feel for the slow quiet humor that this fine film represents.But even that cultural adjustment doesn't explain the complete failure of these other reviewers to appreciate a really finely drawn comedy from beginning to end. This is a wonderful work by the fine writer and director Robert Benton who defies the axiom Comedy is hard. He makes it look easy.What he did was simple looking back but so very hard for most people to do He set up a funny plot and kept it funny from one scene to another by keeping it low key and letting the characters carry the humor lightly one slightly ridiculous moment after the other thus avoiding the great comedic danger You can kill comedy by overworking it.Benton takes a plausible story about some Texas corruption and discovered maps with some amusing twists to it and jacks it up with some great dialogue and some fine actors  mostly Southern as it happens the fine actor Rip Torn birth name Ripley J. Torn Jr. Texas and Kim Basinger Alabama. Robert Benton himself is from Waxahatchie Texas and wrote the screenplay with full knowledge and confidence of the plausibility of the plot and the reality of his characters.Folks I know lots of people like these characters. So do you. Good people simple people women who on the phone who soon ask How's yer Mom 'n 'em? And Benton has given them a moment of great adventure and humor.A few gems Jeff Bridges I'm not in the Vernon Darlin' business anymore. Basinger naming her early fetus Doris Isabel and talking to her. Rip Torn Why is it you work your butt off all your life to get ahead and it takes two nitwits about ten minutes to screw the whole thing up. And in her most glorious beauty Glenne Headley as the girlfriend full of Texas spunk.I truly pity the Yankees and Californians west of Bakersfield who cannot see the beauty of this film.

	schema:headline " Great Overlooked Performance by KB!";
	schema:reviewBody "Okay so this movie didn't do great when it came out in the late eighties. I think it was because it was set in another era. But I happen to think this is one of those movies that once you've seen it it stays with you. The plot is predictable the action is a little on the slow side and it veers off funny a few times. However that being said Kim Basinger single handedly MAKES this movie. Don't get me wrong Jeff Bridges does a great job too but it's Nadine that gives the movie it's spark and it's wittiest moments. Basinger is picture perfect because YES she is beautiful but she REALLy inhabits the dialogue and her character. She acts beautifully and really seems to be having a great time. My favorite two scenes are when Vernon and Nadine are driving to the photography studio and later when they are alone in his trailer. The scene in the car is all about dialogue and establishing who these two are to each other and it's done amazingly well in a short time. Basinger's dialect alone will make you laugh.

	onyx:emotionText "Okay so this movie didn't do great when it came out in the late eighties. I think it was because it was set in another era. But I happen to think this is one of those movies that once you've seen it it stays with you. The plot is predictable the action is a little on the slow side and it veers off funny a few times. However that being said Kim Basinger single handedly MAKES this movie. Don't get me wrong Jeff Bridges does a great job too but it's Nadine that gives the movie it's spark and it's wittiest moments. Basinger is picture perfect because YES she is beautiful but she REALLy inhabits the dialogue and her character. She acts beautifully and really seems to be having a great time. My favorite two scenes are when Vernon and Nadine are driving to the photography studio and later when they are alone in his trailer. The scene in the car is all about dialogue and establishing who these two are to each other and it's done amazingly well in a short time. Basinger's dialect alone will make you laugh. I don't know Vernon she look a little on the chubby side to be Pecan Queen and You know me Vernon they don't bother me I don't bother them. She's referring to her spark plugs. I don't know why but I LOVE her in this scene. It's just seems effortless. And the scene in his trailer where they are too close for comfort and it starts rekindling that old flame.

	schema:reviewBody "It's Austin Texas 1954 and Jeff Bridges's biggest ambition is a gaudy neon to topoff his tacky nobusiness beer bar while estranged wife and apprentice hairdresser Kim Basinger sends her art photos to Playboy magazine. Obviously they're made for each other. Meanwhile her sleazo photographer turns up dead and they're on the run. It's delightful madcap as they bumble their way through a series of misadventures. Their subtly affectionate sniping reminds me of a bad grammar version of Nick and Nora Charles in the uptown Thin Man series. Surprisingly the California born Bridges has the good ol' boy drawl down pat while even the usually snooty Basinger manages a convincing honkytonk queen.

	onyx:emotionText "It's Austin Texas 1954 and Jeff Bridges's biggest ambition is a gaudy neon to topoff his tacky nobusiness beer bar while estranged wife and apprentice hairdresser Kim Basinger sends her art photos to Playboy magazine. Obviously they're made for each other. Meanwhile her sleazo photographer turns up dead and they're on the run. It's delightful madcap as they bumble their way through a series of misadventures. Their subtly affectionate sniping reminds me of a bad grammar version of Nick and Nora Charles in the uptown Thin Man series. Surprisingly the California born Bridges has the good ol' boy drawl down pat while even the usually snooty Basinger manages a convincing honkytonk queen. Good period detail without the distractive sounds of Golden Oldies.  With a delightfully arch Rip Torn as the slyly superior villain. It's amazing how these little gems keep getting produced with little or no recognition. All in all great escapist fare for a slow evening at home.";

Jeff Brides plays her estranged husband Vernon Hightower who owns a bar in Austin Texas circa 1954 that is not doing much in the way of business. He is one of those guys who dream of making it big financially in business as a proof of his manhood a guy who has always just gotten by on his good looks a guy who often lies and cuts corners and can't be trusted but a guy with a smile to charm a rattlesnake. These two really love each other but are currently in the process of getting divorced and Vernon has a girl friend Renee played with eager finesse by Glenne Headly that he wants to marry he thinks.The plot begins with Nadine going to a photographer's studio and demanding to get back some art studio shots of her that were taken under the guise of being shown to Hugh Hefner at Playboy. The photographer is murdered and Nadine mistakenly ends up with some photos of the plans for the new Interstate that will be built nearby plans that Buford Pope Rip Torn and his thugs want for themselves because if you know where the highway will be built you can buy up the property near it on the cheap and then sell it later for a big profit. Vernon knows this too and when he finds the photos in Nadine's purse he takes off with them.The questions that the plot will answer are 1 Will Vernon and Nadine escape from Buford Pope and his strongmen with the photos and their lives? and 2 Will Vernon and Nadine realize they really love each other and find true love and happiness together? There is a shootout in a junkyard near the end that's...different and there's a neat car chase and...well the movie that started out so well deteriorates into something ordinary but not all that bad.Robert Benton who wrote the script for Bonnie and Clyde 1967 and both wrote and directed Kramer vs. Kramer 1979 directed. He has a fine feel for character and can write authentic and witty dialogue. He is not at his best here nonetheless this is definitely worth seeing mainly because Bridges and Basinger do such a great job of filling up the screen. Basinger in particular is wonderful. See it for her.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

	schema:reviewBody "If watched in 1987 Nadine could be labeled as one terrible movie which only wasted time energy money and a good cast on a loose plot. But when one watches this now one must see it in a different light. It's far from being bad. It's very cool actually. Take two attractive actors make them as an unusual pair in between loving and hating each other trying to survive dangerous people and thrilling situations then you have a movie. And quite a short one 78 minutes. What prevents Nadine of being found good by viewers relates in seeing who's involved in it and why they're stuck with such a heavily clichd flawed picture. Why Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger would star in something like this playing loud talky cheap characters who try to be smarter than smartness itself? Or why Academy Award winner Robert Benton would go forward in writing and directing such a strange project? The conclusion reached was that this was a way of doing something fun a child's play. Hollywood indulging itself with plenty of fun in the making and hoping people notice that and perhaps enjoy it for what it is. In this department as being a fun work it succeeds despite the pros and cons. Today it's easier to make things like this and with better results Ocean's Eleven is a living proof of this a movie made among friends very easy and it became quite profitable going with two more sequels. How come no one notices that in this film? It's not trying to convey messages or have a higher purpose it's just a small entertainment fine. It's the kind of story presented time and time again in countless pictures Nadine Basinger testifies a murder then she gets chased by people involved in it who want something she might have taken out from the victim something that belongs to them. Endangered and with nothing better to do she contacts her soon to be exhusband Bridges a lousy bar owner drowned in debts and misunderstandings who's desperately for divorcing his wife to marry his new girl Glenne Headly as fast as possible. Fun thing about this is seeing the story made in the 1950's for whatever reasons. Basinger and Bridges make a very exciting couple they're pretty good together. Hearing their accents might be a problem to many I think it's quite hilarious at parts. Not much of an intelligent brilliantly written comedy it just goes in presenting goofy situations and bright action sequences final shootout is the best and also the bit with the snakes in the room. Final analysis it never gets great as it could be and even gets weary in such short running time but it's an amusing film well acted by everyone involved and with a nice soundtrack. Let go of everything and just enjoy the show. It manages to save the day. 610".

This charming movie gets everything right. What makes The Happy Time' unique is its portrayal that the end of childhood not as a time of regret but as something to be enjoyed. Especially when you grow up in a terrific family.  Bobby's character falls in love with the new maid who is also the object of his Uncle Desmond's affections. Gently and wisely Dad and the family guide the young man's affection toward the nextdoor neighbor's daughter Peggy who is already in love with Bobby's character 14yearold Bibi. The last scene of the movie is wonderful Bibi has received his first pair of long pants and then Mom catches him kissing Peggy who then flees. Papa walks in on both of them and just when Bibi starts to explain his voice starts to crack. Dad takes Bibi in his arms and unabashedly cries. What a wonderful movie now I remember why I liked it 30 years ago. Everybody deserves a family like that. Which goes to prove that happiness is easy when you only have to look nextdoor to find it and your family is willing to give you directions so you don't get lost.".

But the writing and characterization are so true to life and moving that one gets utterly caught up.The movie was based on a successful Broadway play with Kasznar reprising his stage role along with the young actress who plays girlnextdoor Peggy which in turn was based on a series of stories by Robert Fontaine about his own growingup. The atmosphere is imbued with a certain French sophistication but even more with the love and compassion all these members of the family have for each other. The conversation that the father Jacques has with his adolescent son Bibi as he tries to explain the tension between love and desire could be used successfully as a template for any such talk in any family on earth. But it is not just moving much of the dialogue is as funny as in any family comedy you can think of.I had never heard of this film and only discovered it via Turner Classic Movies guest programmer. Sadly it is not available in any video medium I can't think of a better family film. If it comes around again on TCM be sure to give it a try!".

Boyer goes to see the teacher and discovers that the latter has made a mistake that can be misconstrued as illegal behavior.

Take special note of director Richard Fleischer's range everything from Dr. Doolittle to the ultracreepy 10 Rillington Place. In view of his parentage though prodigious talent is no surprise  his pop was Max Betty Boop et al. Fleischer!

Not only did Hollywood rarely talk about Canada...but setting the story in Frenchspeaking Canada...that's unusual. I can only think of one or two other films like this.If you look past the fact it's set in Canada the story is essentially a slice of life tale much like other Hollywood products. If you enjoyed watching Life With Father Meet Me in St. Louis or How Green Was My Valley you pretty much should like this one as well. The story is about the Bonnard familymade up of French and American actors though no French Canadians sadly. They are decent folk and the story centers on the adolescence and blooming sexuality in Robert Bonnard Bobby Driscoll but you enjoy seeing various other family members and their predicaments. Overall very enjoyable and well made.By the way it was a bit sad watching the film because I knew about the life of Bobby Driscoll. He went from a young star in Disney films to dying alone and unidentified at age 31....what a waste.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Happy Time 1952 is one of those little darling gems that I had no plan to watch decided to watch due to the happy tune knew nothing about read nothing while watching it so that I would just enjoy it and now deserves to be shouted from the rooftop Everyone should see The Happy Time!!!The film is set in Ottawa Canada. It's actually a coming of age film for Bobby Driscoll. He's super darling and plays the perfect 50's teen on the cusp of manhood. He has trouble at school a crush on the wrong female ignores the right female and finds himself caught in a few misunderstandings that make for some comedic moments.But enough about Bobby. This film is so charming due to his exuberantly wonderful FrenchCanadian family. His grandfather is so dear his mother and aunt are worriers but his father and uncles really put the jewel in the crown. Charles Boyer Louis Jourdan and Kurt Kasznar play his father and uncles respectively. Individually they are entertaining but when these three get together they are hilarious and happy.Their French joie de vivre comes shining through and they band together to help solve the teen angst dilemmas. There is a side romance with Jourdan and a beautiful woman employed by Bobby's family. Kasznar has a subplot where he keeps getting kicked out of his home for being a drunk. It sounds sinfully wrong but it is done in such a lighthearted comical fashion that it doesn't detract from the film. The birds and bees talk at the end is one of the cutest and absolute sanest explanations for sexual desire I've ever seen. Two of my sons got home about that time and I replayed it for them. They thought it was a hoot. I would never want to give it away. You just have to see it.If you get a chance to see this delightful gem with some very handsome and talented Frenchmen then look for The Happy Time. You'll be humming the little ditty and not be taking the little things too seriously afterward.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was one of the last films starring the fabulous actor Bobby Driscoll no longer as a child but as a teenager and already with a changed voice exactly the same voice as in 'Peter Pan'. Despite being clearly more grown up here he is still instantly recognizable. His face and features didn't change. Plus come to think of it he does look like Peter Pan. Of course that in 'Peter Pan' they exaggerated some of his traces.Even as a teen Driscoll was a goodlooking guy. He was an actor that really loved what he did. Acting was his passion. And his dedication to it matched his extraordinary talent. Here he was still happy and healthy certainly still far from imagining what his life was about to become. There aren't actors like him today.I read many good things about this film. Because of that and because Bobby Driscoll is in it I decided to watch it. It's not that I was vastly disappointed but I found this movie somewhat trivial although with its points of interest.Bobby Driscoll plays a coming of age role feeling the urge and curiosity to try and experience new things without really knowing why and without understanding what's going on with him. It happens to all teenagers. The character he portrays is Robert Bonnard also known by the ridiculous nickname Bibi member of a frenchCanadian family. An interesting and different role for this fine actor who sadly is long gone.Some things I disliked about this movie were for example the selfish behavior of the character Peggy who causes even more trouble for Bibi by falsely claiming she saw him drawing a dirty picture. Of course the poor guy tries to defend himself but the school's principal does not believe him gives him corporal punishment and threats to repeat it every day unless he confesses. How Bibi still forgives Peggy is beyond me. I wouldn't.On the other hand one of the best bits was when Bibi feels the urge of kissing a woman he is attracted to and he really does it while she's sleeping and runs away and she doesn't know it was him. That was cute.I rate this as a 7. I think it's a fair enough rating.".

	schema:reviewBody "An unscheduled afternoon's rest put me back in touch with The Happy Time. The film was several minutes into itself but I recognized a good thing when I saw it again. To be honest not quite. For a moment I was remembering Charles Boyer in another comicdrama whose title I've never been able to recall. In it he says Nuts to the squirrels several times so that it becomes a catchphrase for Live and let live. So here I am getting reacquainted with Boyer Louis Jourdan Kurt Kazner Marsha Hunt and the growingup Bobby Driscoll. Along comes a scene which is one of filmdom's best for sorting the difference between morality and moralizing. Driscoll as the son entering puberty reveals a strop beating by his school master. Not severe physically but emotionally hurtful. He had taken to school a sort of French postcard. It was in the house as one of an uncle's possessions. At school someone had sketched it dirty so to speak. But it's merely risqu. This FrenchCanadian family has retained all of its French. Therein is the theme of tolerance for humanity's differences including love in its varieties explained in our Classical history by the Greek three of agape philos and eros. In a scene which could be used for a fatherson banquet Boyer is at his best in a dialog with his son Driscoll composed by film writers Robert 'Bibi' Bonnard There is something more but I don't know what it is. Jacques Bonnard Ah. Well. It is this 'something more' of which we shall speak. Now you see Bibi this... desire you have it's a natural one and since it is natural it cannot be bad. It becomes bad only when the reason is bad. That is why so many people are mixed up Robert 'Bibi' Bonnard I too am mixed up. Jacques Bonnard Well of course! So am I. Well let's try to unmix ourselves shall we? Now Bibi we speak now of love. And where there is love there is also desire they go together. Love must have the desire I don't believe there can be love without it. But it is possible to have the desire without love and this is where the world falls apart. For instance you don't understand why the principal of your school beat you. Robert 'Bibi' Bonnard No papa. Jacques Bonnard Well it is because he has been brought up to believe that the desire is wrong. And since he himself has the desire he's even more mixed up than we are! He has been brought up in a world where the desire has been used so badlyso badly believe methat it itself is thought to be bad and this is wrong. This is wrong Bibi. And you know the reason for this condition? It is because so many people are without love. ... In a way the world comes down to a house and a room and a bed. And if there are two people in love there then that is the whole world. Of course you won't know this for many years. You know it is possible never to know it? I hope you will. If you are as lucky as I am you will. ...the secret is not to imitate. Look for your heart's need and then she will come. Well I've talked enough and still you don't know what I wish to say. ... Well perhaps when we speak again I will find better words. This of course is merely a taste of the whole fruit delivered so deliciously by Boyer. And of course a girl has put Bibi into these troubles at school as she works her way into his attention. Of course also this young thing appears in the next the scene. She and Bibi stand alone and gaze and they kiss. And the mother of course walks in on them of course. While there is surprise there is no trouble because they are French. They understand.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film about a boy coming of age in a FrenchCanadian family is based on a popular stage play. The characters are so welldrawn and the performances so engaging that one hardly notices the less cinematic aspects of the picture. The dialogue allows both English and French to convey the characters' thoughts and actions. The cast is mostly bilingual and each performer brings a lively energy to his part. In particular Charles Boyer shines as a responsible but liberalminded father. Louis Jourdan who plays Boyer's playboy brother provides a delightful contrast and both men do well to anchor a story that revolves around Boyer's teenage son Bobby Driscoll. A highlight of this triangular relationship is the scene where Boyer and Jourdan visit Driscoll's school to deal with a harsh corporal punishmentminded school official. Much of the drama is easily solved and this is indeed a happy time for each of them. Plenty of drinking scenes add to the merriment in case anything ever gets too serious. Maybe some won't like the uncle next door Kurt Kasznar whose enjoyment of wine leads to frequent intoxication but it is all fairly harmless. It would have been nice had there been a sequel but maybe they were too drunk to make one.".

And even Grandpa is a fanciful man who tries to keep young by being interested in the opposite sex. Boyer and Hunt as the parents provide much of the film's stability and the film has some of its best moments centering on the boy. But it seems a bit uneven because some of their characters are not as interesting as others. And I found myself thinking it was a bit too whimsical with not enough depth. But then in the end Boyer has a great talk with young Bobby about the right kind of love and how the world suffers from having our natural urges without love. All in all I feel I discovered a good little film which I think I will love more and more each time I see it.

This is one of my favorite performances by Gulshan Grover and a must see for his fans! This role may be more low key and not as flamboyant as his big movies where he's the villain but he gives the best performance in the entire film.There is a particular scene with a Mohd. Rafi song  great song and tribute. That itself made the scene very romantic  my favorite scene of the movie.In comparison to many Hindi movies  the plot in this one isn't so bad. Actually I praise it for having a realistic component unlike many movies where the heroine gives up everything for love. In this film does she or does she not? It isn't so predictable.I don't think there was copying of SRK by Shahid Kapur. Actors do some things in common. In a sad scene all actors are frowning not smiling. That is the kind of similarity I would say the two have  a fundamental one. Although I do agree that he tried to pick up a few thins from Tom Cruise but no matter.It was good entertainment.".

This is 1st film of Soha Ali and sadly she has done a bad job. The film plot revolves around Shahid who always land up in wrong situations at a right time. His first girl friend leaves him for a career. Second get a new bf. Third......hmmm she accepts him. but have to go through a lot turmoil seeing he also sees other two. All wells that end's well.

Now we have a soso film DMM. OK first first. This film is good. not a timepass and not even a blockbuster. Shahid has done a good teen stuff acting. All heroines are good too especially Ayesha. This is 1st film of Soha Ali and sadly she has done a bad job. The film plot revolves around Shahid who always land up in wrong situations at a right time. His first girl friend leaves him for a career. Second get a new bf. Third......hmmm she accepts him. but have to go through a lot turmoil seeing he also sees other two. All wells that end's well.

Hairstyle body language Face expressions and tries to do the innocence that Shahrukh Khan does to imprees the girls. Anyway moving on to the film Dil Maange More is a little bit of a childish fairy tail love story. Boy love girl 1 Girl 1 not serious about him Girl 1 chooses career and leaves him. Girl 2 is his colleague she uses and abuses him to make her ex jealous. Boy is heartbroken again till he meets Girl 3. He finds out that girl 3 loves him so he goes out with her. Suddenly Girl 1 comes back claiming too love him. Even Girl 2 tells him that she loves him. In the end he goes with true love which is ever so predictable. Shahid's performance is an imitation of Shah Rukh Khan so i will say not original but poor. Soha Ali Khan gives a average performance as a unusual stupid character. Tulip Joshi gives a crap performance with a weak character. Ayesha is the prettiest out of the girls and gives the best acting out of them all. Overall not too bad not Good but just below Average".

	schema:headline " Trailblazing Saddles";
	schema:reviewBody "A few years ago Broadway producers decided to adapt a Mel Brooks comedy and made a bundle. Could it happen again with 'Blazing Saddles?' The movie already has four great songs a halfdozen more of similar caliber would make for a strong score. 'Blazing Saddles' has a readymade cast of overthetop characters strong audience identification and some minor problems for a theatrical production like blowing up the phony Rock Ridge which are easily overcome.But 'The Producers' was a cult film that never made it to Main Street and needed the second act of a Broadway musical to give it a place in popular culture. 'Blazing Saddles' could never open again as big as it did in 1974. In the summer of Watergate and Patty Hearst here was one bit of madness people could enjoy. And it wasn't just random kookiness but a film that broke barriers and courted controversy like no other majorrelease film of its time. No other movie had characters that were basically likable if stupid throwing around the 'N' word before. In fact it hasn't happened since and I doubt it would on Broadway today. The whole notion of white people and black people living together was not new but the approach of 'Blazing Saddles' was certainly new. In order to live together we have to laugh together first. The only way this film was not a trailblazer was in that it blazed trails untaken by any film that came after.Was Cleavon Little then a civil rights pioneer for the 1970s in a way Martin Luther King and Malcolm X were the decade before? He's very good bringing a lightness to the role that's equal parts Shaft and Bugs Bunny. Richard Pryor was one of the film's writers and Brooks' first choice for Sheriff Bart but Pryor wouldn't have played the role in the same smooth way. Little is an amiable actor one step ahead but never cocky about it. He makes for a sympathetic center and he is flash in those corduroy threads.Little didn't work much after 'Blazing Saddles' which makes no sense. It was only the highestgrossing Western of all time and Little was the lead actor in it. Maybe institutional racism wasn't the sole cause. After all he had a distractingly rocksolid cast around him particularly Harvey Korman as Attorney General Hedley Lamarr. Growing up in the '70s it was a shock the first time I saw the unedited 'Blazing Saddles' with all the casual vulgarity spewing from the mouth of Tim Conway's slapstick buddy on the ultra Grated 'Carol Burnett Show.' 'You will be only risking your lives whilst I will be risking an almostcertain Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor' he tells his gang before they ride off to pillage Rock Ridge. If only the Academy didn't penalize comedies so that might have been true.Madeline Kahn did get nominated for Lili Von Shtupp and deserved her Laurel and Hardy handshake for sure. Her Baba Wawa meets Marlene Dietrich performance is a comic masterpiece and it takes guts to wear that deadweed lingerie in which she performs 'I'm So Tired.' Slim Pickens Taggart Burton Gilliam Lyle Dom DeLuise Buddy and Brooks himself as 'the Gov' all shine and the level of comic acting remains high all the way to the smallest roles like the guy playing Hitler 'They lose me right after the bunker scene' and the cowboy who chews gum in line 'I didn't know there was gonna be so many people!'Gene Wilder is a little young and ironic for the bitter exgunslinger known as the Waco Kid but he grows into the role well enough. Certainly he was in tune with what Brooks was doing more than Gig Young or Dan Dailey would have been Brooks' earlier choices for the part with Young making it all the way to the first day's shooting before it was discovered he wasn't just acting the part of a hopeless drunk.'Blazing Saddles' doesn't make the IMDb top 250 but it's still one of the most significant video titles because it rewards repeat viewings so well. The wholeness of the film's comic spectacle is too dense to be absorbed in one viewing especially when you are laughing too hard. It's a cultural landmark yes but it's even funnier now than it was 30 years ago one of the funniest comedies that exist today. Making it into a musical now would almost be demeaning but I suspect it will happen anyway.".

I'll get this out of the way first To all of you pc commies out there... the racism in this film is there to MAKE THE WHITE PEOPLE THE BUTT OF THE JOKES!!!! There is not a single person of color in this film who plays a negative character. The rednecks are what this film is really making fun of. I think most people realize this hence the 7.7 but there are still a few who don't.This is such a funny film. From the opening scene along the railroad tracks to the shot of Gene Wilder and Cleavon Little riding off into the sunset in a limo the film provides an endless stream of laughs. Every time a person views this film they can notice something truly hilarious that they may have missed the last time. Mel Brooks doesn't always hit the mark with his comedy but this film was by far his best effort.Cleavon Little and Harvey Korman give the best performances in my opinion. I think Cleavon Little stole every scene in every film I saw him in. He died way too young and I wish he could have acted in more films. Korman's Hedley Lamar character is a real hoot. By the end of my most stressful days at work I often find myself talking to everyone in his voice. So evil and so calculating! He and Slim Pickens played off each other flawlessly.Good luck catching an unedited version of this classic anywhere but on the DVD. Forget about any kind of an effective remake either. Not in this day and age.Don't miss this film! 10 of 10 stars.So sayeth the Hound.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mel Brooks found a way in 1974 to direct two of the greatest comedies of all time. And in that one year he found a way to cram as many movie parodies and not have any overlap as any director can in Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles. What Young Frankenstein was to the 1930s horror movies Blazing Saddles was to the Westerns of the 1960s. And add in there the oppression of blacks during the same time and you have a biting satire on the role of blacks in society if not in 1974 at least the way it was in 1874. Cleavon Little by the way he's black plays Bart a slave laborer for Hedley Lamarr's Harvey Korman in a GREAT performance as a scheming government employee railroad who needs to cut through the town of Rock Ridge for completion. The townspeople won't sell their land so Lamarr has the sheriff killed and replaced with Bart. He's not really welcomed into the town but with help from Jim the Waco Kid Gene Wilder he is able to earn's the town's trust. Standard plot and a plot that does not really matter. The humor is so scatological from so many periods of time that we know it's a movie and the characters in the movie know they are in a movie. Take Slim Pickens when he cries out What in the wide world of sports is going on here? And the final 10 minutes of the movie is just odd in any other movie but somehow works in Blazing Saddles. So much humor is cut out of the TV versions so don't waste your time with it. It has to be seen with the language and sexually suggestive scenes to be fully appreciated.".

But the main credit should go to the late Cleavon Little.  He was perfect as Bart.  He took the role when many thought it should have gone to Richard Pryor who was a cowriter on the film.  However I think Pryor might have been a little too over the top for the role.  Little played it more low key and not as militant as Pryor might have.Also this film was rated R when it was first released back in 1974.

It's a bit overrated but just a bit I know a lot of people look on this as the funniest movie of all time but I can't go THAT far. But it is ONE of the funniest movies of all time and for two such movies by the same director with the same star to come out the same year to be on that list is quite an achievement.The residents of Rock Ridge all named Johnson need a new sheriff. They get one... Bart played by Cleavon Little who happens to be black. It's all planned out by Hedley Lamarr don't call him Heddy! an employee of the governor Mel Brooks in a plot to run the residents out of town so he can have a railroad run through it. At first the townsfolk aren't happy about this development but when Bart endeavors to save them from the evil Lamarr who's played to slimy perfection by Harvey Korman they warm up to him. Also thrown into the mix is Wilder as The Waco Kid a gunslinger who's lost his knack for shooting Alex Karras as a huge idiot named Mongo  and Madeline Khan as Lily von Schtupp a parody of Marlene Dietrich complete with ridiculous German accent. She stands out heads and shoulders above everybody else in this movie I think and her song I'm Tired I'm not a wabbit! I need some west! is possibly the funniest song ever to appear in a film. This is no doubt the funniest part Madeline Khan has ever had and she ALSO appeared in Young Frankenstein!. It's also a kick to see a preMagnum PI John Hillerman as Howard Johnson with an ice cream shop with a sign that screams 1 Flavor and Slim Pickens Taggart another bad guy is always a hoot.The plot is just an excuse to make fun of westerns racism and moviemaking in general as demonstrated in the extremely wacky fourthwall breaking finale Watch for Dom DeLuise in these scenes. None of this is really supposed to make sense or be realistic it's just supposed to be funny and for the most part it is. It's one of the crassest and crudest mainstream movies in history and that's it's strength it often plays just like a Mad movie parody. One example of this that really sticks out is the famous farting scene which somehow manages to be one of the funniest scenes in the movie and probably the funniest fart scene ever. But the focus is on the way blacks were treated in the postCivil War old west and the movie is merciless in the way it has its ignorant white characters treat the black characters throwing the nword around without abandon and giving them the dirty work at one point a character says We can't afford to lose any horses! Send a couple of nrs!. The movie finds its heart in the way the initially racist townspeople of Rock Ridge become fond of their black sheriff.Its spirit however is in the hilarious and crude jokes that are thrown all through. This is one funny movie and with Mel Brooks that's what's really important.".

Downsides are the overuse of swear words which were funny in the early 70's because of their shock value during those censored times but today are just annoying and unnecessary.

	schema:headline " A funny satire ... punctuated by a few hilarious moments ... too few ...";
	schema:reviewBody "Blazing Saddles reminds me of a French expression that can be translated as it was dumb but no one ever thought of it as if it would take a certain genius to create an impact from very silly things. No one ever thought of making fun of Hitler yet it inspired The Producers one of the funniest comedies ever Blazing Saddles works on the same principle only in a smaller proportion no one ever thought of a Black sheriff Cleavon Little in a small Western town Brooks did.As usual Mel Brooks embraces political incorrectness with the enthusiasm of a little child getting away with so many frank lines like I like rape Where's the white women and I won't do a drinking game with the number of times the Nword is uttered hell it's almost like a punctuation mark. Mel gets away with that because it betrays his profound desire to make us laugh by any means not wasting any frame any minute without a gag visual or verbal slapstick absurd and at some points so blatantly racist I hesitated to qualify him as desperate for a laugh or irreverent genius. Maybe it takes some irreverent genius to be so desperate for a laugh or maybe Mel Brooks' comical mechanisms work on a Freudian level in the way they invite our most shameful impulses to laugh at the unlaughable. I more enjoyed Blazing Saddles for the gags that satirized the Old West myth than those involving racial stereotypes simply because they were much funnier and all the racist jokes combined together would never beat the part where Mongo Alex Karras punches the horse probably one of the most defining moments of American Comedy's history. It's so unexpected so perfect in the timing that the joke works with the same level of perfectionism than the wall falling on Buster Keaton in Steamboat Willie Jr. and these are moments that lack in Blazing Saddles moments of comical discipline and precision. I don't mind cheap jokes but sometimes they tend to make us forget how the setup is almost as important as the payoff.Where would I classify the infamous campfire farting scene? This one reminded me of some of the best Simpsons jokes when it starts being mildly funny then it's annoying but the scenes drag so long that it becomes funny again and almost hilarious. The timing is perfectly handled in the scene but the same can't be said for all the other jokes. I get it that it's funny if a Black man says he's got a Dutch grandma or if an Indian chief speaks Yiddish but it's only funny if the film doesn't contain other racial jokes hell Blazing Saddles is loaded with them. I reckon that the story is about a black Sheriff and in a way Blazing Saddles can be considered as a film dealing with racism and a landmark in political correctness but all the political incorrectness in the world can't beat the hilarious wagon train moment I laughed us so much I almost choked up. I appreciate political incorrectness but I hate the way its card is used as an alibi by the hardcore fans to justify why the movie is so great as if it was impossible to love The Producers and consider Blazing Saddles inferior. I loved Blazing Saddles for its satirical aspect for the way it extended all the limits of parody. It uses as some point a gag  la 'Looney Tunes' with the same music while I believe Mel Brooks owes more to Tex Avery. The Yiddishspeaking scene reminded me of the Oxford English speaking Indian in Big Wheel Watha and the Indians attacks of Homesteader Droopy or Goofy's unforgettable Californy'er Bust These are my references in humor and I felt that they inspired the best of Blazing Saddles. Mongo uttering the famous Mongo only pawn in the game of life is pure comical genius not to mention the song of Lili Von Schtupp Madeline Kahn perfect as a Marlene Dietrich or the poor or Gene Wilder proving his shooting skills.The rest is just a bit overused but never unfunny. If I wasn't laughing I was at least smiling. Mel Brooks signed a film that was begging for laughs and for not to be taken seriously and it couldn't have had a better ending to illustrate the fact that it's a big joke. I used to dislike the ending but now I feel it's one of the most surrealistic extents of the limits of metareferential satire. But while Monty Python  the Holy Grail did it with a certain level of sophistication Brooks doesn't embarrass himself with that he's like a craftsman who builds a beautiful oeuvre d'art and then took a hammer and starts destroying it and it takes some genius to have the guts to ruin the premise of a film for jokes. And apparently it worked since the film was the highest grossing of the year. People laughed and that's that.I like the film but I sometimes dislike the reasons for which it's loved by its fans. Blazing Saddles delivers what we expect from a comedy but at some point it just forgets to be a film with a story something that some of the best parodies did Naked Gun! Top Secret! Airplane! and how about Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein which is in my opinion his best film precisely because he wasn't overdoing it each joke has its time each character a moment to shine and the film had an atmosphere a little something that elevated it above the comic genre. Young Frankenstein is like a delicious pie served in a beautiful plate while Blazing Saddles is no less delicious but is thrown at our face.That's all folks!".

	onyx:emotionText "Blazing Saddles reminds me of a French expression that can be translated as it was dumb but no one ever thought of it as if it would take a certain genius to create an impact from very silly things. No one ever thought of making fun of Hitler yet it inspired The Producers one of the funniest comedies ever Blazing Saddles works on the same principle only in a smaller proportion no one ever thought of a Black sheriff Cleavon Little in a small Western town Brooks did.As usual Mel Brooks embraces political incorrectness with the enthusiasm of a little child getting away with so many frank lines like I like rape Where's the white women and I won't do a drinking game with the number of times the Nword is uttered hell it's almost like a punctuation mark. Mel gets away with that because it betrays his profound desire to make us laugh by any means not wasting any frame any minute without a gag visual or verbal slapstick absurd and at some points so blatantly racist I hesitated to qualify him as desperate for a laugh or irreverent genius. Maybe it takes some irreverent genius to be so desperate for a laugh or maybe Mel Brooks' comical mechanisms work on a Freudian level in the way they invite our most shameful impulses to laugh at the unlaughable. I more enjoyed Blazing Saddles for the gags that satirized the Old West myth than those involving racial stereotypes simply because they were much funnier and all the racist jokes combined together would never beat the part where Mongo Alex Karras punches the horse probably one of the most defining moments of American Comedy's history. It's so unexpected so perfect in the timing that the joke works with the same level of perfectionism than the wall falling on Buster Keaton in Steamboat Willie Jr. and these are moments that lack in Blazing Saddles moments of comical discipline and precision. I don't mind cheap jokes but sometimes they tend to make us forget how the setup is almost as important as the payoff.Where would I classify the infamous campfire farting scene? This one reminded me of some of the best Simpsons jokes when it starts being mildly funny then it's annoying but the scenes drag so long that it becomes funny again and almost hilarious. The timing is perfectly handled in the scene but the same can't be said for all the other jokes. I get it that it's funny if a Black man says he's got a Dutch grandma or if an Indian chief speaks Yiddish but it's only funny if the film doesn't contain other racial jokes hell Blazing Saddles is loaded with them.

Anyone that's seen Blazing Saddles knows that it really pushes the racial envelope. So Mel Brooks saying that it couldn't be done today... I'm surprised he got away with it in 1974.The movie was released before I was born but I got a chance to see it in '07 or '08 and found it amusing. It's not my favorite comedy but I'd say it held its own for it to be funny to me and I'm from a different generation.The humor was cartoonish at times but it worked. The characters were good and the actors to play them were spot on. The exfootball player and Webster's adopted dad played a good Mongol. Cleavon Little was great as Bart and the incomparable Gene Wilder was good as always as Jim. I still prefer Mel Brooks' Spaceballs and Men in Tights because those were both more relevant to me but Blazing Saddles was nevertheless a plus movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen this film many times before and it has always amused me. It's not a great piece of filmmaking by any stretch of the imagination but I have always got a lot of pleasure out of it. I guess I have to admit to being a bit of a fan of the work of Mel Brooks he has a pretty unique way of looking at things. His take on the Western is a prime example lots of jokes about race and class but never in bad taste.When politically connected bad man Hedley Lemar hears the railroad is to go through the small town of Red Rock he decides he wants the land for himself. In his words It will be worth millions!. When the townsfolk petition the governor to give them a new Sheriff Hedley forges a plot to make the townsfolk leave by giving them a new Sheriff of his choosing a new black Sheriff. He has chosen a troublemaker called Bart to fill the post and he is keen to impress the townsfolk. Things don't go according to plan and Bart is left in the Sheriff's office with his deputy a drunk called Jim. Now Jim is a former gunfighter called the Wako Kid but those days are behind him now. Can Bart get the townsfolk on his side? Will Jim stop drinking and take up his guns again? Why does everyone in town seem to have the surname Johnson? All these and many more questions are answered in the film 'Blazing Saddles'.What I like about this film is the fact that Brooks doesn't restrict himself to spoofing Westerns. No genre is safe there are lots of references to the Nazi's for instance. Good performances all round Cleavon Little as Bart Gene Wilder as Jim Slim Pickens as Taggart Harvey Korman as Hedley Lemar Madeline Kahn as Lili Von Shtupp and of course Mel Brooks as Governor William J. Lepetomane  Indian Chief.The ending of the film is a bit of a mess with a fight in the town spilling over into other sets on the film studio. I can forgive that though because this film has given me and my friends so many quotes over the years. It's not only the spoken gags though it's the visual ones as well. The scene where a man and his horse are about to be hung I find hilarious. As a piece of filmmaking it's a bit of a mess it all seems to have been a bit rushed but I love it! Recommended.My Score 7.810".

I was amazed at how funny this movie still IS.Although I've never found humor in flatulence that scene is a classic the bad guys all sitting around the campfire eating beans and ripping loud ones while Taggart Slim Pickens attempts to contrive a new scheme for ridding them of the new Sheriff of Rock Ridge. Well what about Mongo? I always felt uncomfortable with the use of racial slurs and this movie made me uncomfortable in that way but it was Mel Brooks's intent to make us uncomfortable with racism. You can't correct a problem until you drag it out and lay it on the table which is precisely what he did. He left no stone unturned and even took a few pot shots at himself in the process.This movie should have won about a hundred awards for its edge wit boldness and the wonderful performances brought to the mix by these veteran actors. While Madeline Kahn did win a nomination for her portrayal as Lily von Shtupp she should have won..and won..and won.That is my favorite scene in the entire movie.Gene Wilder is brilliant as the Deputy Spade. While he was a bit young to be cast as a washedup gunslinger he molds himself into the role very quickly and lends a strong endearing presence to his character. Endearing is a good word. It fits Clevon Little's character as well. He was honorable clever and completely smooth as the Sheriff of Rock Ridge. I highly admired his performance and still do.The dark humor in this movie is astounding. Brooks leaves no ethnic group unscathed by his cutting wit. There is no wonder this is the top grossing western attempt to be put on film. In the 1970's when this was first released America needed this form of release. There were serious racial tensions throughout the country Watergate was still ringing in our ears and the drama that was Patty Hurst's life for a time was still very much front page news. We as a nation needed a diversion which was not afraid of controversy and harsh reviews. The box office gross demonstrated just how much we DID need this movie at the time it came out.For that being there for us when we needed it most many thousands if not millions are loyal to Brooks and his productions regardless of the subject matter. The laughter and lightheartedness he gave to us lives on. I was so pleased to see this movie redistributed on DVD.Now another generation can see and enjoy it as much as we did. Though they may not understand how we could laugh at a bunch of idiotic rednecks singing slave songs using the N word every other line and comparing anyone with any level of culture to a bunch of Kansas City fagots hopefully the humor will not be lost to the misunderstanding that these slurs were meant to be taken seriously. The intent was to LAUGH AT those ignorant rednecks for BEING ignorant rednecks.Long live Mel Brooks the Crowned Prince of Parody!! It rates a 9.510 from...the Fiend .".

We now talk about that experience from time to time. Over the years it has become my all time favorite movie. Some people would find the humor 'off color' but I just look at it as just plain fun. Don't take things too seriously. Mel Brooks is one of my favorite directorsproducers. The end of Blazing Saddles always makes me cry when they're riding off and them get in to the limo. I have never been involved with the movies but this scene makes me want to do so.".

This comedy classic was made in 1974 and was directed by the once great Mel Brooks. I say once because he really went into decline after spaceballs which was just o.k. This movie was written by Andrew Bergman who also wrote one of my other favorite comedies The Freshman. This is another one of those movies I hope they never remake it just works so why mess with things that work and yes work so well.

Mel Brooks assembled one of the best casts of comic actors this side of It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World and got lifetime performances out of all of them.I've always thought that Mel Brooks for Blazing Saddles borrowed a lot from the surreal quality of the Road pictures and certainly Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder have a CrosbyHope like camaraderie going.My favorite though is Harvey Korman as chief villain Hedy oops I mean Hedley Lamarr. That was the role of a lifetime for him I think his best moment on screen. Following closely is Madeline Kahn as famous saloon entertainer Lily Von Shtupp. You could tell the Code was a thing of the past when a character could have a name like that.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Shaolin Girl";
	schema:reviewBody "Ever since the success of Stephen Chow's Shaollin Soccer in 2001 he's been asked time and again whether a sequel was in the works. There still isn't but he sort of franchised the idea out to the Japanese and served as executive producer so the outcome of the deal was Shaolin Girl.However the net of it all is that while the intent for a quasisequel is there having the Japanese play characters experts in the classic Chinese form of martial arts might seem a little wrong just like how the hue and cry came about with Chinese characters portraying Japanese geishas. But if the source in contention was treated with respect I guess there would be no qualms moving forward though with the way things were treated here you would've pondered whether it was done in jest or in mockery.For instance the numerous Bruce Lee homage. Yes we all know about all things yellow so it's a no brainer here. But to have a lookalike come out as a villain dressed in a white singlet black pants and emulating Lee on the nunchuks was a tad below the belt especially the way he was disgracefully dispatched. A friend of mine said it was perhaps a kick in the face toward all the imitations and wannabes but I'd like to think otherwise. The finale look straight out of Game of Death where our alphafemale do battle floor to floor encountering various martial arts masters but come to think of it they were dispatched with incredible ease. And don't get me started on the corridor of mirrors too which served no purpose other than to show that the filmmakers can.Lead actress Kou Shibasaki from Crying Out Love In The Center of the World in the titular role looks good and cute for the part in order to draw in the crowds and granted she has no martial arts background ala new female warrior Jeeja Yanin in Chocolate she makes up for it with artificially choreographed grace that made her a little believable. What's not believable was her ability to speak Chinese and the Shaolin monks as well because they are clearly Japanese but had to pass off as experts in the language which came off as unbearable and laughable. You might think that director Katsuyuki Motohiro with his Bayside Shakedown pedigree would be deft at handling stories with multiple subplots. However Shaolin Girl bitten off more than it could chew and couldn't decide what it wanted to be. On one hand it wanted to spread the love for Kung Fu or specifically the Shaolin brand of fistfighting. On the other it had to reflect on its supposed predecessor and fuse in a sport different from soccer here it's Lacrosse. And it wanted to weave kung fu into the game only to hold back to prevent itself from being a clone. So while you get a sport there isn't much copycat kungfu styles and stances until the end credit roll when it became obvious.Shaolin Girl Rin Sakurazara was sent as a kid by her grandfather to China's famed Shaolin school of martial arts to learn to curb and control her wealth of potential promised power. What this power was nobody knew except that everyone knew she had to be protected from the villains lest she gets tempted to go to the Dark Side yes so very Star Wars. But she returns upon completion of her training to revive her grandfather's dojo and does so in quite an impetuous headstrong manner that she has a few lessons to learn herself such as humility camaraderie and teamwork before she can impart those martial arts lessons.However despite all that talk about teaming it still boiled down to a onewoman whackfest for the last act. If you're looking for some serious fighting then the first two acts of the movie will bore as you only get teases spruced very much by special effects some bits too especially those involving Lacrosse got too repetitive. Kitty Zhang Chow's new muse from CJ7 ends up in this movie too to provide some lesbian undertones ok so I chose to read it that way but think about it. and although she has a meatier role here as a naive dogooder the role still boiled down to a flower vase in cheongsam.And if you're patient and were waiting to be rewarded with some proper combat for the finale be prepared to be disappointed too. For all the talk about her prowess you'll laugh at what Rin pulled off. Not that it's a comedy and you're supposed to chuckle but you're laughing at its delivery instead for all the wrong reasons. Never have I seen something that hokey and anticlimatic as well. Not only that the fights were unimaginative and horrors boring too while the villains were all reduced to mindless goons ala Crazy88 style with some tendencies to caress man boobs and totally unmenacing with lead villains having zero motivation other than to desire to fight. I nearly fell off my seat when it ventured close to The Promise territory with its take on the tykes.Even supporting appearances by characters from Shaolin Soccer couldn't save the day and became ridiculous caricatures of themselves. Perhaps what could rescue Shaolin Girl was a cameo by Chow who probably might have upped the credibility of this flick but alas knowing that it would stink he rightfully kept his distance. And so should you unless you're a fan of either Kitty Zhang or Kou Shibasaki then you can lap up all the closeup shots.".

It's rare that I come across films that effectively explore spiritual concepts in a way that is accurate humorous and ambient.This is a hard film to explain but I will try.The film is a light hearted analysis of vedic dharma. In this film the seemly unlikely application of dharma is martial arts. This dramatic irony sets the basis for some at times slapstick humour. Without this the spiritual message of the film would would have been bleached out by intense and heavy vibes.The heroine spends the majority of the film battling her subtly understated self doubts. These manifest themselves in her actions as bizaar clumsiness. Eventually she is cornered into a situation and she bas no choice but to reluctantly act. Stripped of choice her self doubts disappear by serendipity all of her dharmic clumsiness focuses into an apex of enlightenment. Now armed with good intention integrity action and her prior training there is no weapon in the world that can prevent her obtaining her goals! I would definitely recommend this film.".

	schema:headline " Shaolin lacrosse";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those rather strange movies that brings to mind a trendy hope still is term of genredefying. I don't know how the project got started nor do I care but it seems like someone seeing the success of Shaolin Soccer decided to do a Shaolin lacrosse. In the process they threw into the pot whatever is their fancy at the moment and didn't even bother with stirring.Never mind how a Japanese Shaolin Japan teacher in a small town in Japan gave up martial art altogether to become the operator of a small restaurant and double up as a lacrosse coach in a local girls' school. And if you try to figure out what kind of a traumatic experience this guy had that made him send his most talented student a little girl called Rin Kou Shibasaki to China to master the martial art of Shaolin kung fu you're in for big trouble because as the story unfolds there'll be a long line of unexplained or unexplainable event and things as long and confusing as this sentence.The first half of the movie looks loosely like a comingofage story with a bit of team spirit conforming getting accepted that kind of stuff. On the other hand parallel alternating scenes lurking in the background suggest an ominous side a painfully clear reminder of Anakin Skywalker. As the action intensified towards the end the movie jumps awkwardly between seriousness and farce bringing you more things familiar. Painfully obvious is Bruce Lee's Game of death 1978 minus the brilliant action sequences. As a matter of fact there's really nothing to say about the action sequences in this entire movie of Shaolin girl. What is a little more watchable is the CGIfu particularly the use of water although it is not quite as brilliant as what you see in Hong Kong's A man called hero or Zhong hua ying xiong 1999 or Korea's Volcanic high 2001. Then the whims of the movie makers keep coming and at the climatic duel they even throw in a bit of Sigmund Fraud for good measure.I like watching Kou Shibasaki and I am happy to see her moving from tragic to comic roles. She is heartbreaking in Crying out love in the centre of the world 2004 and The sinking of Japan 2006 the actress not necessarily the movies. Then it was delightful to see that she can be so much fun in Dororo 2007. Shaolin girl is sort of a filler and a reminder to watch out for the sequel for Dororo which hopefully will be made.".

I loved the unnecessary references to Star Wars The Matrix Bruce Lee and probably some others i missed  as well as the usual trademark stuff from Stephen Chow nobody stepped on an eagle though which would have been epic.Basically the film's got comedy cute Japanese girls with lesbian overtones and martial arts.

	schema:reviewBody "Now a lot can be said about Shaolin Girl aka Shrin shjo but comparing it to Shaolin Soccer is hardly appropriate because they are two very different movies. And yes Stephen Chow did produce this movie but this is not a sequel.The story is about Rin a Japanese woman who has studied the art of Shaolin Kung Fu in China and now has returned to Japan to honor her grandfather but Things are very changed from before when she went to China.Shaolin Girl is a fairly average movie which never really managed to strike a lasting impression. The movie just lacked finesse an interesting storyline characters to captivate the audience and any outstanding acting performances. So it was a very mediocre movie experience.Several times throughout the movie did I find my focus and concentration to drift away from the movie. There just wasn't anything to thrill or excite me enough to keep me entertained.It was the production level that kept the movie afloat. But a production level can only go so far. A movie is supposed to be entertaining and that is where Shaolin Girl failed.There were surprisingly little Kung Fu in this movie and it was mostly just about lacrosse and drama. So the movie was somewhat misleading in terms of what you would expect from it given its title and synopsis.If you enjoy Asian movies then there are far better much much better movies available. I can't really come up with a valid reason to recommend Shaolin Girl to others.".

In fact some of the characters may have come across far less annoying if some of the actors had put in better performances.I quickly realised this was more of an odd kind of drama than an action film as it seemed to take forever before Rin's fighting abilities were even displayed. I kept waiting for a decent fight sequence. And waiting and waiting and waiting...And when the moment finally arrived after a whole hour the choreography was disappointing to say the least one could almost say laughable.I realise this is not a movie that takes itself seriously but it would have been better if it had thrown itself fully into the Lacrosse aspect of the film which was more prevalant than anything else anyway but it even failed to commit itself properly to that. It could have been to Lacrosse what Shaolin soccer is to... well soccer. But in the end it was neither here or there.As for the final battle well what can I say except 'KungFu Hustle'!!! The last scenes were almost identical. Shamefully so in fact. Having said that maybe Shaolin Girl should have actually borrowed more from the brilliant KungFu Hustle and at least may have injected some fun into the whole affair.Overall a real shame. I truly expected to enjoy it. It had potential and it did have it's rare moments but sadly it was  as the saying goes  a damp squib.".

A lot isn't explained in this film i.e. they'll show you something leave it alone for a long time sometimes never addressing what it was all about or just show you some arbitrary scene just to fill time.I liked the film and think that anyone who wants to see a fun film in the similar vein of Shaolin Soccer or The Last Dragon should check it out. Don't expect anything too serious and try to ignore the cheesy acting you get from some characters.

A bad guy who seems to be in control of a corporation that is developing the strongest and the best. Add a team of cute girls from the lacrosse team. Sounds like we have a winner here.Unfortunately after that intro...probably first 15mins of the film it goes downhill. There is no character development. I mean totally NONE. As to her inner power don't see any of it nor any inclination she may be turned to the dark side. In fact she is all earnestness and sweetness throughout.The bad guys sole purpose is to fight her to see how good she is and to challenge himself. Thats it no other purpose other then an ego boost. The fight scenes are not bad but some clever camera angles and editing made them passable. A lot of use of CG some very bad. The last bit was horrible. The bad guy kept telling her to turngive in to the dark side...when did he bleeping become Darth bleeping Vader plus at no point did she show any inclination of darkness or inner conflict. And the ending.... all I can say is what the bleeping bleep is that bleep This movie had a certain B movie feel to it lol I kept expecting for the locker roomshower scene with the girls from the team. Unfortunately it never happened. lol.In summary this is a Kids movie. They will find it exciting. Not horribly bad but far from good.".

	schema:headline " Very interesting document about an Italian mystery";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1978 Italy faces its most dramatical period since the end of World War II the kidnapping of Democratic Christian party leader Aldo Moro by the Red Brigades Brigate Rosse. That year Moro is going to form a government with the Italian Communist party it's an historical compromise. On March 16 in the morning Aldo Moro is traveling with his escort from home to the Parlament where he's supposed to start formally the new government. During the travel there's an ambuscade all the escort men are killed whereas the politician is kidnapped. A 55 days period of anguish begins. Whereas police search for Moro's den the terrorist organization of the Red Brigades ask the Italian State a political recognition and the freedom for some political prisoners. Otherwise Moro will be killed. But Italian government chooses not to negotiate with terrorists. Moro is found dead in a car's boot on May 9 1978.For people who don't know Italian facts this could be only a thriller story but that's reality.Il caso Moro was made 8 years later in 1986. The film is very interesting because it describes an episode which shocked completely Italy and the rest of the world. We don't know if the film gives an exact portrait of what happened. I think it's impossible because many things of this story are not yet clear after almost 30 years. The movie shows different inexactitudes and mistakes that Italian government consciously made during the investigation for Moro's prison. Moro was let die because he was an adversary for everyone... His political feelings were too open to the Left and many people in his party and outside it were not happy for. Italian Secret service as well wasn't happy. CIA too. Many Italian authorities who were supposed to save Moro's life were part of P2 Lodge an extremely right wing organization connected to Police Secret Services and CIA... The film tells that all these people wanted Moro to die.As I said the truth is still unknown. What the movie says are a group of hypothesis although many have been proved right. But the complete truth still doesn't exist.Many people don't agree with director Giuseppe Ferrara's point of view and when the picture was released everyone as always in Italy was unsatisfied and spoke of a scandalous movie! The film has by the way the merit of asking questions.It's interesting to compare this film with Marco Bellocchio's Buongiorno notte which treats the same subject and was made later in 2002. there are some differences because meanwhile new fragments of truth has emerged.Il caso Moro is written like a thriller and works very well. There's a lot of passion and drama obviously but nothing seems exaggerated. Because above all this is a story of ldo Moro's loneliness as a human being. It's a man who feels betrayed by the ideal he has fought for and feels let alone by his friends politicians.Only one actor could be so wonderful in this performance Gian Maria Volont who gives us another lesson of acting. That's another milestone in his career".

Of those I've seen this and the one before korpen flyger and i think that they are the only true viking movies up to this point.This movie has pretty bad image and sound quality which is understandable since its old. But it wins my heart for it's story it follows a kind of norm in viking tales basically an eye for an eye. This movie is a followup on the story told in Korpen flyger so that one should be watched first in my opinion.I am no expert in vikings or history but i have read a lot about them and many sagas if not all from the Edda anyways i liked this movie because it feels natural and real.Some warnings though 1. It may not be so interesting for you if you're not interested in vikings. 2. They speak Icelandic and the one i saw had Swedish subtitles only so beware you may not understand a word.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another great film from Iceland. What a beautiful and deep work! I saw it many times in my home country Russia as it was shown on central TV quite often in 19992001. The story is breathtaking  Trausti who has become a Christian returns to Iceland from Europe but then he is thought to be lost at sea and while he is still not found his house is looted his people are murdered and he is virtually alone. Then his revenge starts. Trausti finds new people who will help him to avenge his family and friends. Finally he uses a very sly method with the help of nature  in fact a geyser that is used as a water heater there. Then mostly all of his enemies are destroyed and although Trausti is revenged the film leaves you with a heavy heart as so many people are dead. What is great in this film is the brilliant severe nature with terrible rains all the time. It is not merely a background for the action no it acts and work out as a real hero there too. Other big plus is the role of the fat greedy Bishop who is the actual master of the lands and he is a vile sinful horrid creature with no drop of Christian mercy inside. His power is enormous and his deeds are so gruesome that you feel a deep disgust to him. The very fact that even in a baptized land people still pray to hidden statues of Thor explains much in this film. The faith has not come and the nominal religion is used for masking the bloody crimes. Watch this splendid and breathtaking film you really must do it.".

Gee...I'm still in the XI century with all that people fighting against that landscape and those brave men.

The same theme revenge is treated in a much more interesting way here. One key way in which this movie is more effective is that we get to know the characters before they die. We see treason. Therefore when the main character wants revenge it doesn't seem completely gratuitous We actually understand his motives and even root for him.The Christianity in Iceland theme which was already here in the precedent movie is also much more interestingly developed. Trausti is a believable convert He professes his Christianity and he wants to believe in Jesus Christ but in the end he is a Norseman who presumably grew up with Nordic beliefs. He believes in Vengeance he believes in Jesus Christ but isn't entirely indifferent to Odin and for someone raised in a polytheistic faith this is only natural. It doesn't hurt that most of the first movie's ridiculous synthperuvianflute score has been abandoned in favour of more timeappropriate medieval tunes. The camera work is also much better with beautiful landscapes and the feeling that Iceland is bigger than that one shore. All around a surprisingly good movie even though the best Viking movie around in my opinion still is by far Utlaginn.".

However I find an odd entertainment value in this genus of southern cheese. An aging professional highway showoff an even more annuated hick sheriff in hot pursuit an oddly swift and resilient Trans Am a very talented yet dumbed down leggy sidekick a country singer turned epitomal southern truck driver Dom Deluise and an elephant. Add plenty of incompetent law enforcement officers and marlboro reds and you have the makings of one fine redneck crosscountry chase movie. I don't know why but I actually enjoyed this. It's really about the stunts I think and when it comes to Hal Needham you never can have too many car crashes. In the spirit of Cannonball Run and the Dukes of Hazzard there is an odd appeal in watching good IL boys tear up backroads to the tune of Hank Williams and police sirens. And of course there's always a way out leaving a pile of police cruisers in the dust behind. It's an action flick and as such you shouldn't expect it to be anything other than what it is it's just fun to watch. You may notice it does have some very talented actors so it begs the what were you thinking doing this film? question. Perhaps. But on face value it's all about the car chase. And who doesn't love a good car chase?".

But no the producers and writers chose to create an entirely new exploit which is basically a rehash of the route traveled in the first but going in the other direction and pretty much at the speed limit! First off the Enoses could have hired anyone for a lot less money as obviously time was not of the essence. Afterall after they accept the job considerable time is spent getting the Bandit back into shape! Or did the writers expect us to believe it only took one day? They may have considering they also threw in a scene where Burt during his rehab outruns a racehorse. And what were they thinking having Carrie marrying Junior again? Sheriff Justice said at the end of the first he wasn't giving up his pursuit of Bandit so he didn't need this motivation again.So obviously instead of a good ole' boy movie like the first we have a cartoon with humans! See Jackie Gleason utter sombitch 6 dozen times! Hear Dom Deluise spout nonsensical Italian phrases! Watch truckers run over police cruisers with no regards to consequences like causing lawman's death! Become aghast at Jerry Reed turning into a tough guy life coach. Experience Burt Reynolds trying to show he has a heart! Look at Sally Field's expression of disdain for her agent! And don't miss the ending blooper reel!This was the beginning of the end for Burt as he started becoming a caricature of himself.

When good ideas get scarce they try to fill the gaps with gags on a common theme.  But like any good joke it's only funny when it is at least semiplausible.  That's what made the original Smokey and the Bandit so much fun.  But StB II is just TOO unbelievable to be funny any more. It might appeal to 12 year olds but the original audience of 1625 year olds just don't find them funny.All the negativeness of the above aside StB II is still better than part III.

From highlights in Boogie Nights and The Mean Machine to real clunkers like Striptease Reynolds has never been consistent in his movies with the exception of being consistently inconsistent. Redneck rampage classic Smokey And The Bandit was one of Burt's best so it was no surprise when the predictable sequel arrives and it's a serious test of how much vehicular destruction you like in a movie. It also proves that a movie needs much more than comedic cops and smashed squad cars to make a plot.Reynolds returns as the legendary Bandit a hero among the highspeed CB radio community. Washed up and a wreckage of a man after Carrie Sally Field once again leaves him Bandit is reunited with his old buddy Snowman Jerry Read and Carrie in order to transport an elephant from Florida to Texas in three days. The promise of a substantial reward is apparently motive enough because I couldn't find any other reason to do this. Anyway Bandit is tracked every mile of the way by persistent Sheriff Buford T Justice Jackie Gleason and his wetbehindtheears son Mike Henry and this time he's brought a few family reinforcements...You can picture the meeting of the producers before shooting began. Let's get everything that made the first film great and double it. So we have more cars and crashes more stunts and jumps more trucks a prolonged lovehate story between Field and Reynolds as well as Dom DeLuise as a slightly eccentric Italian doctor more Buford T Justice and oh yes even more crashes. Sadly the mix is a mess. The film's plot veers this way and that like one of Buford's pursuits and very little ever makes sense. Coupled with a comicbook approach to the story Burt doing a standing backflip onto the back of the elephant? and the first film's action gives way to simplistic and unconvincing setpieces. Gleason easily acts everyone else off the screen which is not good when you sympathise with the baddie of the piece while watching our crew of redneck racers with ambivalence. Come the film's climax there is an overwhelming sense of 'deja vu' as increasingly chaotic scenes fail to impress.In truth there wasn't much they could do with the sequel. The first while hardly a classic itself pretty much covered all the bases when it came to road movies so what Smokey And The Bandit 2 thought it could add to the mix remains a mystery because this film does nothing but improve your opinion of the first if you've seen it anyway. Like the first this is a mildly diverting film in a justreturnedfrompub kinda way but quite frankly you'd be better renting something else or rewatching a DVD. Stick with the first but don't touch this or the third unless you're an extremely forgiving viewer. And Reynolds really should have trimmed that moustache...".

I once walk in the rain to see it I took my first date to see it and I have probably seen it 100 times on TV and Video.With all that said I think I have the right to critique the sequel. I remember waiting 3 yrs for part II I remember hearing there might be one in 1977 and I was so excited. Well I remember I thought something was going wrong early in 1980 when I herd reports they wanted to call it Smokey and the Bandit have a Baby But I was still eager to see it I rushed to see it the first night it was released I remember it was a packed house and I was really excited. Then it happened while watching it I couldn't help thinking this thing was awful!It had nothing what so ever from the first one they went for nothing but laughs goofy plot goofy gags goofy jokes and transporting an elephant for 400000 was so stupid! At first you might say well wasn't the first like that? NO!!. Watch the first one again after watching the sequel First  The Bandit was cool thru the whole movie never lost his cool never went for just a laugh He was kinda the straight man. Even Jerry Reed Snowman had a really cool seen where he gets beat up and this was a serious seen and then runs over all the bikers bikes that was great!! I remember the audience cheering when that happened. You even believed the Bandit and Frog really fell in love. True it had a lot of slap stick screw ball humor but that was all from the sheriff's Buford T. Justice character and it was all really funny. They could have really done a lot with this movie like in most sequels they forgot the first rule  Continue with the original story! Don't repeat it!! The trick is to make it look like one whole movie cut in half not a remake done badly. for more research on how Not to make a sequel see Another 48hrs".

Well he's back and this time he's an alcoholic burnout who makes bad career choices and treats his friends like trash. So he's basically Burt Reynolds from 1980Boogie Nights. Remember how much free wheeling fun and energy the first film had? Well this sequel has all the energy of a pregnant elephant. Speaking of elephants Dom DeLuise is in the film. And a pregnant elephant. The entire cast looks like they can't wait to get paid it's such a go through the motions film reminiscent of another sequel Ghostbusters 2. The final police car pile up is impressive but even that outstays it's welcome after a while. No it's not one of the worst sequels ever it's just so gosh darn bland and average.".

I would have much rather seen Bandit Carrie and Cledus's trip to Boston to pick up some clam chowder sans the Trans Am and rig than see the weak effort put forth here. In some places the film is a sloppily done rehash of the original Carrie is about to marry Junior again Buford T. is hot on the trail of the Bandit with Junior in tow as a result and the Bandit is driving alongside Cledus in a black TransAm. Given the situation in this movie why was the Bandit even needed? They drive the speed limit most of the movie! Cartoonish elements missing from the original include Buford's summoning of his brothers to help him catch the Bandit a man falling out of an ambulance in a most strange looking gurney and Sheriff Justice's car being dropped from a toll bridge only to appear again unscathed later in the film. It seems the writer of this piece of garbage said Let's take what worked in the original increase its outlandishness 100 times over add some weak one liners and throw in something for the kids while we are at it. Honestly what minister answers a phone during a wedding ceremony? Everything that worked in part one was forgotten in part two.".

Being an enormous fan of the first and even finding some enjoyment from the third I still can't say I like this one.  I don't know what happened here.  Everyone was back inculding the director they had the money to back it up and they still couldn't get it right.  What made this film so atrocious?  Well I have to blame it on the writers.  I also have to blame the rest of the cast for going along with it.  Seriously when the characters behave NOTHING like they did in the original and the objective is to haul an elephant! you know you're in trouble.  I cringed every time Frog and the Bandit squabbled and I cringed whenever the Bandit would lose his cool and do something stupid.  I mean what happened to the mildmannered likeable laidback country boy that we all knew and loved from the first one?  Why in the HELL did they have to make him into and alcoholic washedup egomaniac? I don't know how but they managed to make him into one of the most unlikeable protagonists in cinematic history. There's even a ridiculous training scene where the Snowman and Frog whip the bandit back into shape to make the big run. I guess it was supposed to be funny.  I found it to be a slap in the face.   Sometimes Hollywood really has me scatching my head.  Now for the Justices.  Two words  Good grief.  They made them even dumber than in the first and while there are a few funny lines it goes into overdrive and messes the whole thing up.  Another thing Buford's Canadian cousin I forget his name was a disgrace.  Was he supposed to be gay?  If so that wasn't funny either.I guess I've trashed this one enough.  On the bright side there were a few moments that made me giggle but I can't remember the scenes to save my life.  Please if you consider yourself a fan of the first avoid this one.

Justice Jackie Gleason is on their tail all the way in pursuit...Also known under the title Smokey and the Bandit Ride Again here in the UK this was directed by Hal Needham this is your pretty average more of the same sequel to the original hit Smokey and the Bandit 1977 which I didn't like that much anyway I can't say Smokey and the Bandit II was any better but I can't say it was any worse either. Like a lot of sequels that try to leech of the original's success Smokey and the Bandit reunites all the main character's including the Bandit Snowman Carrie  Sheriff Buford T. Justice along with Big  Little Enos who again hire the Bandit for some ridiculous run across states instead of beer like the original this time around it gets even sillier with a pregnant Elephant that develops a crush on the Bandit yeah that's the level of sophistication in this sequel. The comedy  gags are just lame with many being direct ripoffs of the original especially a lot of Sheriff Justice's lines I really don't think I laughed once during this  if the film wasn't silly enough there's this annoying Italian doctor. The script tires to have a little more humanity this time around with it wanting us to feel sorry for the animal  the ongoing more pronounced romance between the Bandit  Carrie but it's all lost in a horrible plot that is just too ridiculous for words  really unfunny comedy. At almost 100 minutes it goes on for too long as well the pace is average with not that much actually happening  only the big showdown between the police  truckers in the desert at the end is worth watching this for. The character of the Bandit is also significantly different here here he's a drunk burnt out depressed has been unlike the first  it's hard to warm to him or want him to succeed.A lot of the time is spent with the Elephant  it's problems rather than the driving aspect in fact the cars seem almost secondary here until the end  that desert pile up which even then is silly  hardly makes the thing worth watching. A rollercoaster is destroyed in an OK scene but otherwise this is quite short on action. Again Sheriff Justice swears quite a lot  again the dubbed TV versions are apparently quite funny. Better made than the original the coverage of the stunts is better but still rather static. Country and Western singer Don Williams  his band make a cameo I still thought the Country and Western soundtrack was awful though  really can't stand the stuff.Filmed mostly in Florida this has good production values as I am sure the budget was bigger than the original's but that didn't help make this any good did it? The acting is OK Reynolds is in cruise control Sally Field still looks nice Jackie Gleason is still over the top while Dom DeLuise is simply awful.Smokey and the Bandit II is much more of the same really only sillier  even less funnier than the original the final chase in the desert is alright  it passes the time if you can see it on telly for free I suppose but otherwise there's not much here to enjoy.".

Therefore a sequel was inevitable. In fact... a sequel was the natural evolution considering how the original ended. However what people got was a different beast all together.Instead of directly continuing from the original we have a new tale utilising the old characters. Only it doesn't feel particularly new more rehashed. If it was made now it might almost be considered a 'remake.' The 'Bandit' is back only he's all burned out and only tempted out of his alcoholinduced retirement by the promise of a big paycheque. Again he has to drive across country helping his trucker chum 'Snowman' to safely get his cargo to its destination. It's basically the same story as before. Again it uses the same route. Again it uses the same plot device of 'Smokey' the cop constantly pursuing Bandit only really chasing him because his son's bride has left him  yes again  at the altar to run off with Bandit.It all feels a little like 'rinse and repeat.' Smokey catches up with Bandit. Bandit just so happens to know someone that can help him out. They block Smokey. The Bandit escapes and then it all happens again a few scenes later.Smokey's police car also seems to get completely trashed and yet be perfectly be okay to indulge in yet another high speed chase a little way down the highway. Of course the chases scenes are fun. At the time of production the film boasted about having the most expensive car chase ever filmed for a movie. And there is one that lives up to that titled. Only one. Much of the driving seems to be done at the correct speed limit meaning there's a distinct lack of tension going on.Yes the stars return. And they do add an element of fun to the movie. If you liked them the first time round you'll probably like them again this time. However since they're doing almost exactly the same thing as you saw them do in number one then there's little point in watching them do it all over again right?".

Of course the chases scenes are fun. At the time of production the film boasted about having the most expensive car chase ever filmed for a movie. And there is one that lives up to that titled. Only one. Much of the driving seems to be done at the correct speed limit meaning there's a distinct lack of tension going on.Yes the stars return. And they do add an element of fun to the movie. If you liked them the first time round you'll probably like them again this time. However since they're doing almost exactly the same thing as you saw them do in number one then there's little point in watching them do it all over again right?";

I've always been of the ilk that tries not to judge sequels on the originals but in the case of Smokey and the Bandit II it's impossible.The plot is essentially the same as the first film with the more politicallycorrect elephant replacing 400 cases of good ol' Coors and for a higher stake  320000 more than their original run to Texarkana. While Reynolds Field Reed et al are entertaining and do the best with a mediocre repeat of the original plot the true star here is Gleason. Particularly memorable is the scene where Justice and Junior stop for a toilet break and Junior announces after paying a visit that his zipper is stuck. What happens next is hilarious and I won't spoil it.I agree with one of the other reviews in that the original premise of the characters as defined in the original was completely ignored in this sequel but maybe this was done on purpose. Maybe the writers felt they were giving the characters more depth. This is the downfall of the movie that and the script...especially the inclusion of brothers Reggie and Gaylord Justice.Having said that it's not completely awful. The saving graces are Gleason Dom DeLuise as the leading gynaecologist or gornocolagalist as he pronounces it in Pompeii population 23 on a sabbatical to the Deep South and Mike Henry as the long suffering and equally very dim Justice Junior. The latters' performance while certainly not Shakespeare material is exactly what is called for  bewildered and confused.Everyone who was anyone in the country music industry contributed to the soundtrack including Jerry Reed once again recording the film's theme a virtual carbon copy of EastWest Bound and Down. Brenda Lee and Don Williams make cameos as do Burt's buddies Joe Klecko Terry Bradshaw and Messrs Dudley Remus and Hal Carter.All in all disappointing and disowned by hardcore fans of the original but definitely worth a look for Gleason's contributions. They are what keeps the film going when the rest of it is bogged down and turned into a melodrama of sorts rather than sticking with the winning formula that made the original such a smash and a classic. Beware though it's nearly destroyed towards the end with the inclusion of his twin brothers but that isn't Gleason's fault  blame the scriptwriters and director.

Both do fine although Field sometimes seems like she would rather be anywhere else than in this movie. Can't blame her. She looks lovely though. Jackie Gleason is back and this time playing multiple parts. He starts out OK but quickly becomes unbearable. We also have the comically challenged Dom DeLuise. Reynolds was buddies with Dom and overlooked Dom's obvious lack of talent and got him roles in several of his movies. I've never found Dom DeLuise funny and this movie is no exception.If you're a fan of the first Smokey movie perhaps it's best you just avoid this sequel and for the love of God definitely avoid part 3. This movie doesn't improve upon the first in any way. Hell it doesn't even match it. It's a stinker that happens to have a decent country soundtrack.".

Based on the universal idea of the love triangle it reveals the tangle of relationships that can exist among a community of friends. It also reveals the struggles and contradictions of twentysomethings seeking careers love respect and friendships.Stoltz Tilly and Sheffer are excellent as well as the strong cast of supporting actors. Adrienne Shelly is hilarious and right on in a small role as a party guest.Two scenes in particular are brilliant Parker Posey and Joey Lauren Adams invade the traditional allguy poker game and the final scene which combines comedy slapstick and serious conflict and selfreflection.

I also think that Parker Posey can do no wrong and is great in this film. There are great performances all around by the entire cast.It's just a bit too real. Personally I'm all about films that allow me to escape the grit and drama of daily life. I prefer movies about space marines battling acidbleeding aliens. I even enjoy movies about an ordinary life or ordinary person confronted with an outrageous set of circumstances along the lines of Shallow Hal The Family Man or Click. If I wanted to watch this kind of drama I'd just set up a lawn chair in the front yard and watch the goingson in my own neighborhood. If you're looking for escapism then this movie isn't it. If you want a slice of life as portrayed by an extraordinary cast then this is the film for you. Again the cast is terrific. Their performances are so believable that I could be convinced that there was no script no rehearsal and they weren't even aware that there were cameras present. It seemed more real than most 'reality shows'. It's just not for me. I go to the movies to see what I CAN'T see day to day.".

We love hiding our failures choosing our comfort instead of facing the root of our problems.

It all plays like the opposite of Friends.  The group of friends are less polished and in some respects seem more realistic however in other scenes their activities seem very far fetched and outlandish to be real.  However at the end of the day the central strand of the story around Joe Sarah and Frank is good and interesting.  The only problem with this strand is that more time is spent watching Joe and Sarah experience problems rather than falling in love  this makes their relationship hard to support or believe in.  Whereas in contrast Frank's longing for Sarah is shown to be developing and it makes it easier to support this.The film's main weakness is that the supporting characters are little more than fonts for witty banter and never convince as real people.  Stoltz is actually quite good however Sheffer is allowed more audience sympathy and comes off better.  Tilly is excellent and is very beautiful she brings the torn wife to life.  Of the rest of the cast there are plenty of indie faces but the real stealer is Tarantino in a short cameo as a party guest talking animatedly about Top Gun's homoerotic sub text.Overall it is very rough around the edges and at times feels a little bitty however it is refreshingly free of mushy sentiment and is quite funny.".

	schema:reviewBody "That category being a movie about relationships the undertone of being unfaithful and the small things about relationships which aren't covered by normal big romance movies. Realism indie filmmaking long shots and acting which looks like it's improvised makes a movie for me. I dunno maybe this category of movies is really my all time favorite the other being gangster movies and such because these movies speak to me... Social commentary about my life and my thoughts and my own relationships are all in this movie like they are in Chasing Amy my second all time favorite movie of all time. Resrevoir Dogs being THE gangster movie is the first.In my opinion this really is modern movie making at it's best. Watching films like this I feel like I'm seeing Man Bites Dog again for the first time. Like in one sequence similar to another sequence in the movie Boogie Nights there's a scene which lasts for many minutes and which is shot in only a few shots through the eye of an old black and white camcorder made the hairs on my arm stand up in awe. This is a key scene in the movie and I wont spoil it for you but if you've ever had a relationship and been in these sort of awkward social situations before then you will feel the pain of these characters and be totally in the movie the whole time you see it from beginning to end. Or like another scene where they are all at a very formal and boring party and Frank shows up and it all blows up in everyone's face. This I think was my favorite scene in the movie because of what happens in it how it happens and what happens because of it.There is of course also the Quentin Tarantino cameo which didn't escape my eye either. The movie is worth seeing just for that but the whole film still meant so much more to me than that.I'll wrap this up now with a few things I wanna say about the whole set up of these people's lives. Some are in the movie writing business and some are in the landscaping business but what I found deeply interesting was that we never actually see them at work. It's all just worked into the dialogue of the film which I really liked because that is not the conventional way. Usually you'll have a few scenes of them at work to establish this but in stead this movie focuses completely and utterly on the characters... And what a wonderful set of characters they were.".

Although he is raw and sometimes hard to love because of his ogling' Stoltz gives him a believable personality creating a lot of mixed feelings between Sarah Frank and himself. Great oneliners and generation dialogue in this film creates a fast interesting funny and real experience.  One realizes Joseph's tender side as he watches his wife become giddy at Franks confessions...Honey I'm getting ready to cloud up and rain all over you'...

Although he is raw and sometimes hard to love because of his ogling' Stoltz gives him a believable personality creating a lot of mixed feelings between Sarah Frank and himself. Great oneliners and generation dialogue in this film creates a fast interesting funny and real experience.  One realizes Joseph's tender side as he watches his wife become giddy at Franks confessions...Honey I'm getting ready to cloud up and rain all over you'...  An interesting bit of info... the couch used in Frank's apartment looks exactly like the loveseat Bridget Fonda's character in Bodies Rest  Motion gave Sid the painter  Eric Stoltz.";

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed this film quite a bit and am surprised that it's not better known. It feels as if it could have been considered the quintessential nineties film that summed up the feelings of a generation but somehow it was overlooked. It plays like a cross between Short Cuts and Clerks with as much feeling and raw reality as a John Cassavetes film.The film is about a man who is in love with the wife of his best friend. The story unfolds through realtolife scenes and dialog which gradually reveal more and more about the characters and their motivations. The plot meanders but never strays we never feel lost. The film feels like real life and it is full of fun and memorable scenes and conversations which feel totally real to the point that you almost feel as if you are there in the room observing rather than merely watching a film.The scenes are cut together with intertitlessimilar to many old silent filmsand it's done a charming way that I didn't feel was at all tacky or distracting. Perhaps their use was an afterthought by the filmmakers as a way to jump from one scene to the next but it never feels as if we're being cheated out of anything. That's actually something that I wish was done more frequently but it seems like films these days like to use other methods to transition between scenes instead. It's probably just as well because the intertitles here made Sleep with Me feel more unique and original and helped me really get into each scene and enjoy the film.One of my favorite parts of the film is a brief appearance by Quentin Tarantino in what I consider to be his finest acting role. His performance here has often been called a cameo but it lasts for several minutes and includes at least a few dozen lines of hilarious yet totally believable dialog although the character is not essential to the plot of the film. While I love Tarantino as a director I'm not normally a big fan of his acting work but in this role he nailed it. Although brief it's a part he was born to play.However two of the things that I loved the most about this film were also the main things that I felt detracted from it overall and kept me from giving it a higher score. Those two things were the acting and the dialog. Although both of these aspects were typically great throughout the film and made it enjoyable there were several instances in which they failed. Several pieces of dialogincluding the very last lines of the filmfelt wildly out of place and several bits of acting felt like they should have been scrapped or redone.I got the feeling that this movie was put together quickly and that very few takes were done for certain scenes so perhaps that is why the acting and dialog were not always spoton. Perhaps this was for budgetary reasons or perhaps the director felt the scenes we more spontaneous that way. Or perhaps the reason for these shortcomings was that the film had six different writers who from my understanding each worked independently to a degree to write their own individual scenes. In any case these flaws don't ruin the film. It's not a perfect film but none are and this one is definitely worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "There was a time between Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction where Tarantino seemed to use his new found fame and success to do some little things that he wanted to do.  Now I don't know this for sure it is my speculation. You see he was touching up scripts like Crimson Tide appearing on television shows and making brief but memorable cameos in small films like this one. And I wonder if it is this film that got Eric Stoltz the part as Lance in Pulp Fiction after all he was the Executive Producer on this film so he obviously had a say in Tarantino being in the film.  And I am very glad that he was because his time on screen had me in stitches.  It really did.  But first let's talk about the film because it is a good one.Stoltz and Scheffer have been friends for quite some time and it is only recently that they've experienced a bit of tension because one likes the others girlfriend.  This is a good film that possesses smart insight into dating friendship and other relationships.  Each character has their faults and their positive attributes but I have to admit that by the end of the film I did not like Tilley's character.  Maybe that is the way you are supposed to feel I'm not sure but she wasn't even sure how she was feeling and maybe that is one of the reasons the film is as good as it is. Because it is honest.  But you know what?  I'm going to finish off this short critique of the film by saying that it is good.  You would enjoy this film even if Quentin wasn't in it but my gosh when he enters the picture at the end at the little get together all hysterics breaks loose.Quentin plays Sid and he ends up striking a conversation with one of the party goers and in his short time he manages to completely attack the film Top Gun by saying that it was a movie about homosexuals.  And he does it in a way that isn't meant to offensive towards homosexuals.  It's just that in his opinion the film was more about that than it was about fighter pilots trying to save the world and get the girl.  Now if this sounds confusing and bazaare fine but trust me and many other reviews  including the likes of Roger Ebert  when we say that his monologue will have your stomach hurting with laughter.  He is a manic obsessed guy in this film that tells this poor unsuspecting guy something that he nor us ever thought we could possibly hear.  Think about all the testosterone that was Top Gun and you will start to inderstand why it has so much potential for humour.  This part of the film makes it worth the rental itself.  That is not to say the rest of the movie can't stand on it's own it's just that this added element makes it more worth your time.  Sleep With Me is a film that you should give a chance I think you will be quite pleased.  And Quentin...... well you'll just have to see it for yourself.   You can ride my wing anytime!  No! YOU CAN RIDE MINE!!!!  This is hilarious stuff.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Blob 1988 is an 80's action horror classic remake from Steve McQueen version 1958 film. I love this film to death. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. I was 10 years old and a kid when I saw the first time this film and I absolutely loved it. I saw some owner of the video store that was selling movies on VHS one of those films was this film from the 80's The Blob I wish I could get this film on VHS before it was soled out but my parents didn't give me the money than the film disappeared of the air and I have never saw it or watch it. It was never on TV it took me 20 years to watch this movie recently I found some guys who love this film and I order it on Bluray disc and I got it. I absolutely love movie's from the 80's and I love this flick to death it Is my favorite monster movie. I am putting this flick right between Aliens and Deep Rising right between them as a monster movies. This is my second favorite Chuck Russell film the first one will be A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors 1987 that I absolutely love to death this is the second film I love to death. I definitely appreciate what the original did but yeah the '88 Blob is certainly a feast for the eyes. I have always enjoyed this movie and I had such a fun watching it. It is fun exciting and pure entertaining. Simon West want's to direct the remake of the Blob that is coming out I think this year which is a stupid dumb idea! I don't want to see another remake of this film so no!I love Shawnee Smith as a bad ass  tough cheerleader she is so beautiful gorgeous and sexy I am completely in Love with her! I love her to death in this film. Shawnee Smith will always be Meg Penny for me not Amanda Young from Saw! I don't care about Saw or the franchise none of those horror films are my favorite! I rather watch films from the 80's and the Blob is one of my favorite monster creature movies! I saw this flick as a kid. Shawnee Smith is gorgeous in this film she saved her younger brother she tried to save a younger kid Eddie as well and when The Blob eats and swallows a younger kid in the sever she jumps in the water trying to saves him and she couldn't. She fires a machine gun on the Blob and say's come on you can do better than that!. I love the music score from Michael Hoenig and I love the song on the end of the title Brave New Love by Alien. You also have Paul McCrane in from RoboCop 1987 after seeing him in this film I recognized him right away it is Emil M. Antonowsky from RoboCop! The movie has likable characters fast paced a lot's of action fun bits of humor Paul Flagg Kevin Dillon escapes from those government guys jumps over this little bridge and gives the middle finger when he jumps over the bridge on his motorcycle. I love this scene it was memorable scene I remember it. In the opening scene he crashed down the bridge but now he jumped over which was excellent. Fun bits of dialogue the budget was used very well against great special effects I have no problems with them it is one of my favorites of all time.This film is only shot an hour and thirtyfive minutes which is not that long it is like is said pure entertainment I grow up with this flick and I love it. I disagree with the reviewers who say the original is much better than this version. I think quite the opposite is true. The 80's The Blob along with the 80's The Fly are two of the few remakes that I think far surpass the originals. Sure it's a schlocky 80's horror movie but taken in that context it's damn good!A great script an excellent combination of FX to achieve the look of the Blob and absolute horror and carnage... I love it! This is a horror movie with BALLS. Within the first half hour spoiler alert they kill off the guy we're expecting to be the star! They kill little kids! They kill off innocents characters we like and want to live!This movie takes no prisoners and pulls no punches. It takes the idea of the original puts an interesting twist into the plot injects it with good FX good acting and a decent budget and you have something far superior to the original. Just like Little Shop of Horrors  The cheap and dated original can never hold up to the musical remake.This flick get's a 10 out of 10 by me for been my favorite scifi horror flick of all time.".

I love this scene it was memorable scene I remember it. In the opening scene he crashed down the bridge but now he jumped over which was excellent. Fun bits of dialogue the budget was used very well against great special effects I have no problems with them it is one of my favorites of all time.This film is only shot an hour and thirtyfive minutes which is not that long it is like is said pure entertainment I grow up with this flick and I love it. I disagree with the reviewers who say the original is much better than this version. I think quite the opposite is true. The 80's The Blob along with the 80's The Fly are two of the few remakes that I think far surpass the originals. Sure it's a schlocky 80's horror movie but taken in that context it's damn good!A great script an excellent combination of FX to achieve the look of the Blob and absolute horror and carnage... I love it! This is a horror movie with BALLS. Within the first half hour spoiler alert they kill off the guy we're expecting to be the star! They kill little kids! They kill off innocents characters we like and want to live!This movie takes no prisoners and pulls no punches. It takes the idea of the original puts an interesting twist into the plot injects it with good FX good acting and a decent budget and you have something far superior to the original. Just like Little Shop of Horrors  The cheap and dated original can never hold up to the musical remake.This flick get's a 10 out of 10 by me for been my favorite scifi horror flick of all time.";

Even John Carpenter's well crafted The Thing is a remake but that didn't stop the film from becoming one of his best due to a good visceral interpretation of the story. The same goes for this film  a remake of an old movie with a very visceral and gory style. Featuring topnotch aesthetic and even some obviously aged but nonetheless fun old computer effects it is more of a thorough reimagination like The Thing was.However the film falls a bit on its face when it comes to creating suspense. Many scenes with the title monster are tense and the action good and the gore firstrate but the connective scenes between them surprisingly lack in tension. With material ripe for an eerie atmosphere it is a shame to see this horror element not fully developed in the film. The result is a fun movie but it could have been much better. Also the mad scientistcold war element is a bit stale by today's standards.But overall it is a fun little flick featuring a truly merciless monster that gobbles up just about anyone even kids!.

	schema:reviewBody "In the 1980s there were 3 remakes of Popular 1950s Horror films first there was THE THING 1982 then THE FLY 1986 And in 1988 We got THE BLOB which is often overlooked and considered to be the lesser of the 3 remakes and to me that's really sad because THE BLOB is in my opinion is Just as good as the other two remakes from the 80s The 1950s version of The Blob is a classic BMovie worth watching for a good laugh as for the Remake it is a truly scary film the suspense is there the special effects are incredible to this day the only effects that are dated are the green screen effects which don't show up until the latter of the film and there's only a few of them.The Plot is the same as the original but with a slight twist Like in the original A meteorite hits earth and a strange blob creature oozes out of it and starts to devour anything and anyone in its path the film has 2 heroes played by Kevin Dillon and Shawnee Smith who both do a good job with their roles and the supporting cast is good also.The film succeeds as being a good remake because it gives you something old and something new it pays homage to the original without completely ripping off the original In fact there are only 2 major scenes that are lifted from the original but they are Done in good taste unlike many remakes today where they just add an overabundance of scenes from the original making feel like a total repeat of the original and not add anything new But the real show stealer is the Blob itself the biggest improvement being the special effects the blob has never looked more threatening or scarier.Overall The 1988 remake of THE BLOB is a classic but sadly overlooked HorrorSciFi film The Only problem with it is some cheesy dialog and maybe the new twist on the plot is not the best but the biggest problem is WHEN WILL WE GET A SPECIAL EDITION DVDBLU RAY? It would be good to see some bonus features as well as some remastering they could surely Polish up some of the bad green screen moments. But overall the film is a lot of fun Highly recommended for HorrorSciFi Buffs.810 45".

	schema:reviewBody "Remakes are often frowned upon by film fans and for good reason but Chuck Russell's take on the silly fifties SciFi flick of the same name certainly doesn't disappoint! The film has the fifties plot structure and ideas but it's been updated to the eighties  which means gratuitous amounts of special effects a trashy atmosphere and lots and lots of gore! This remake has sentimental value for me personally as it's the only film in history to make me physically sick. I would have been about seven at the time and watching this film over breakfast isn't recommended for sevenyearold kids! However I did of course get the day off school. I've grown up a bit since then but upon watching The Blob again I've got to say that it's lost none of it's charm only I managed to hold back on being sick this time. The plot follows an asteroid that comes down from space. Upon inspecting it a lowly bum finds himself with a strange organism stuck to his hand! The Blob also takes advantage of the eighties teen comedy craze and after a couple of kids find the tramp on the road they take him to the hospital and that's where the fun really starts The special effects are often silly but nevertheless very effective! The sequences are very imaginative and take advantage of the eighties style humour that make eighties horror films what they are. The way that the blob consumes people is always disgusting and seeing the halfmelted outlines of people inside the creature is lots of fun and makes for some really good horror. Because it was made in the eighties many of the scenes focus on raunchy kids and this gives The Blob lots of room to manoeuvre the central monster into all kinds of hilarious situations. The acting as you would expect is nothing to write home about but the cast approach their roles with gusto and the fun performances help to make the film what it is. Chuck Russell does a great job of creating the right sort of atmosphere for the film and the screenplay is better than you would expect for a trashy eighties horror flick. Some will notice that the script was cowritten by one Frank Darabont who would of course go on to write and direct one of the 'best films of the nineties'. Personally I'd rather this watch this film!".

	schema:reviewBody "A meteor falls near a small town in the USA.  A homeless man goes to see what's in it and a jellylike substance attacks him and starts eating away at him.  He's discovered by local tough kid Kevin Dillon and with pretty Shawnee Smith and prettier Donovan Leitch drive him to the hospital.  There he's eaten alive while waiting for the doctor and the blob is looseeating anything in its path. But in no time flat a bunch of scientists and military men arrive to help...or are they?I HATED the original one...and I don't care if it was Steve McQueen's first film he was always a lousy actor anyways.  It was slow stupid with terrible special effects and a VERY slowmoving blob.  This one has a very funny script that never takes itself too seriously it moves very quickly this blob moves like lightning I was actually getting scared when it chased Smith and Dillon in the dineryou see it following them on the ceilingand GAINING! has some great scary special effects and no crummy CGI proudly gives us an R rated horror film today it would have been cut to a PG13 and has mostly great acting.

Only Dillon disappointshe's pretty wooden in his role.  And I REALLY hated the origin given for the blobit was totally unnecessary.

He's discovered by local tough kid Kevin Dillon and with pretty Shawnee Smith and prettier Donovan Leitch drive him to the hospital.  There he's eaten alive while waiting for the doctor and the blob is looseeating anything in its path. But in no time flat a bunch of scientists and military men arrive to help...or are they?I HATED the original one...and I don't care if it was Steve McQueen's first film he was always a lousy actor anyways.  It was slow stupid with terrible special effects and a VERY slowmoving blob.  This one has a very funny script that never takes itself too seriously it moves very quickly this blob moves like lightning I was actually getting scared when it chased Smith and Dillon in the dineryou see it following them on the ceilingand GAINING! has some great scary special effects and no crummy CGI proudly gives us an R rated horror film today it would have been cut to a PG13 and has mostly great acting.

It even almost has tentacles that can grab people.  We also get to see this blob a lot more than in the original movie.  The story is somewhat the same in the first part as a meteor falls to the earth and an old man finds it and pokes it with a stick.  Like in the original this is when the blob attaches itself to his hand.  Now it starts differing from the original as a host of people gets killed off and the blob gets bigger.  There is a movie theater scene in this one too but it is a lot more gruesome.  Then the military shows up to handle this creature but they seem to have some darker purpose.

Since you get to see the Blob eat people in gory detail it's almost scary. The rest of the movie unfortunately reminded me of formula 80's teen horror. You have the hoodlum the football player the cheerleader the smart aleck little brother the housewife mom of the last two and on and on. The amusing thing is how the original also wallows in 50's teen movies cliches as well. Some things never change in Hollywood I guess. I liked the twist on the plot about the Government agents and their agenda with the Blob. It reminded of similar story lines that XFiles would do a billion times. Only this was before XFileswhich borrows greatly from bad scifi and horror anyway. In a good way might I add. Overall monster A the rest of the movie C".

	schema:reviewBody "THE BLOB follows in the footsteps of THE THING and THE FLY as being 1950s science fiction films remade in the 1980s all of which had mixed fortunes . John Carpenters remake of THE THING totally bombed at the box office  though it's now considered a classic . Cronenbergs remake of THE FLY was a big hit and is still fondly remembered perhaps because there were strong human elements amongst the gore and effective make up . THE BLOB remake from 1988 directed by Chuck Russell opened to very lukewarm reviews and disappeared after spending a total of one week in the American top ten box office . It's not a particularly good horror film but one would have expected it to do better since gory horror were very fashionable in that decade The screenplay co written by Rusell and Frank Darabont  The director of THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION  takes the basic structure of the original and embellish it . Unfortunately whilst the original is remembered as a rather camp affair the remake tries to shock and disturb the audience This is summed up by the scene in the cinema . The heroine Meg sees a patron lying on the ground  she turns her over only to find a face that has been totally eaten away by the blob . Some commentators have mentioned that this film has a mean streak and they're right it's actually quite sadistic . People die graphic deaths . Men  women and children all become victims of the blob regardless if they deserved to die horribly or not  which seems to clash with the light hearted tone in the early part of the movie The is an interesting plot twist that the screenwriters have brought to this version . I say interesting but I don't necessarily think it's a good one and that is the eponymous blob was created by military scientists . It's interesting in that it goes against the grain of what was coming out of Hollywood at the time where John Rambo and his action clones were traveling across the world killing commies . and in many ways this version of THE BLOB mirrors George A Romero's THE CRAZIES with white suited soldiers holding a middle American town hostage . Sadly the villain Dr Meadows is written and acted with no moral ambiguity and is such an obvious baddie that he's impossible to believe in as a real character when the potential for a multilayered character was there Looking on the bright side this is a movie made before the advent of CGI so that means we have a big man eating jelly that wasn't created on a computer . It doesn't always convince however and isn't helped by a lack of internal continuity where some people are dissolved out of existence but some others are still recognisable when they're absorbed like the sheriff during the phone booth scene . Being a 1980s film also means the fashions have badly dated and if you think Kevin Dillion has a bad hairstyle they you'll be shocked to know a mullet was the height of fashion in those days . Now that really is frightening".

	schema:reviewBody "The Blob opens to the eerie and totally deserted streets of a small American town called Arborville. Everyone is at the big game. One of the football players Paul Taylor Donovan Leitch asks an attractive cheerleader out named Meg Penny Shawnee Smith. That night an old man Billy Beck who lives out in some woods near Arborville sees a flaming meteorite land nearby. He investigates he sees a purple jelly substance moving around inside. He unwisely decides to poke it with a stick. The purple jelly slides along the stick and attachs itself to his hand. The towns local petty criminal Brian Flagg Kevin Dillon is repairing his bike when the old man jumps out from behind some tress at him and tries to cut his own hand off with an axe. The man disappears into the woods Flagg runs after him. Paul and Meg are on their date when the old man runs out in front of their car and is hit. Paul and Meg take the old man and Flagg to the local hospital. Before long the old man has been more or less completely eaten by the blob and decides Paul looks tasty as well. The blob is loose it's growing at an extraordinary rate and will eat anything or anyone that moves! The local police Sheriff Herb Gellar Jeffery DeMunn and his deputy Bill Briggs Paul McCrane don't believe a word of their story to begin with but as the population of Arborvile rapidly decreases they have a race against time to stop the blob before it eats the entire town and possibly the whole of America! Then all of a sudden white suited Government agents turn up lead by the sinister Dr. Meddows Joe Seneca and Colonel Hargis Jack Rader and it soon becomes clear that they aren't the towns saviours as they try and make out. Cowritten and directed by Chuck Russell I thought this was a very enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half. I haven't seen the original so I can't compare it but I would imagine this is superior. The script by Russell and Frank Darabont is interesting throughout entertaining not too clichd has just about enough character development without becoming boring and it keeps things moving at a nice pace. Most of the characters are adults with Meg and Brian as the teenage love interest the script plays the film straight without any jokey one liners. Acting is OK Dillon looks a bit uninterested and somewhat flat at times but it's not a huge problem. This also features an early appearance by future Baywatch 19891992 star Erika Eleniak as a character who implodes as the blob oozes out of her. The blob effects are pretty cool and there is a surprising amount of gory deaths including a sequence where an unlucky man named George Clayton Landey gets pulled down a plughole by the blob head first I was impressed. I liked it a good solid 80's horror film all round. Certainly worth a watch recommended.".

The movie is more than just a scare flick. It poses an ethical dilemma the good of the few versus the good of the many. Is there a time when people are expendable? When Hollywood deals with such an serious themes the result is usually poor. But in this case the movie succeeds. As for the blob itself it's a product of questionable research done without proper controls. That is it's about science gone wild and the consequences therefrom. Shawnee Smith and Kevin Dillon perform wonderfully as the lead characters. Smith definitely should have received recognition for the high quality of her performance. Jeffrey DeMunn and Joe Seneca also give notable performances. Candy Clark looked hot in her waitress uniform and the rest of the cast performed wonderfully. After watching this movie one will be more careful with gooey things that move.".

The movie is more than just a scare flick. It poses an ethical dilemma the good of the few versus the good of the many. Is there a time when people are expendable? When Hollywood deals with such an serious themes the result is usually poor. But in this case the movie succeeds. As for the blob itself it's a product of questionable research done without proper controls. That is it's about science gone wild and the consequences therefrom. Shawnee Smith and Kevin Dillon perform wonderfully as the lead characters. Smith definitely should have received recognition for the high quality of her performance. Jeffrey DeMunn and Joe Seneca also give notable performances. Candy Clark looked hot in her waitress uniform and the rest of the cast performed wonderfully. After watching this movie one will be more careful with gooey things that move.";

Something that did movie could had learned a lot from.This is really a hard movie to get into because it simply isn't an either very exciting or interesting one to watch. There are several reasons as to why. First of all the characters just aren't being really likable or well written enough. They are quite flat and bland and it makes you wonder why the movie is focusing on these characters while a different approach with different characters would had made the story at least whole lot more interesting to follow. Which brings me to the movie its second problem it's being too much of a lackluster and too much of a bore. This is not necessarily because there aren't enough killings or action happening but more because there is never really a good sense of danger in the movie. It also makes the movie fall flat as an horror. You could say that this is also mostly due to the treatment of the blob. It seems to pop up at random places for some unexplained reason and is more of a monster with tentacles and all than a scary slow moving all consuming single cell entity there is no escaping off and can't be stopped by anything.So no I just couldn't really enjoy watching this movie despite its hard efforts to still make this a fun movie to watch. It instead makes this movie more often a ridicules one to watch since it allows its story to feature some highly unlikely and just plain silly bad written elements. I'm talking about especially the stuff involving the military. This seriously could had better been left out and it perhaps would had strengthened the small town and desolated feeling and atmosphere of the movie.Needless to say that you are better off watching the original.410httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

It is currently the trend in Hollywood at the moment to remake classics and horror is the biggest victim of all genres. Movies such as Dawn of the Dead the Texas Chiansaw Massacre The Fog When a Stranger Calls and The Omen have all received this treatment and the end is result is always the same. Crap! But in the 1980's some truly classic remakes were released that were superior to the originals in many ways usually because the director was a fan of the original and wanted to pay homage to that. John Carpenter's The Thing and David Cronenberg's The Fly were far more impressive than the 1950's movies they were inspired by and that can also be said for the 1988 remake of The Blob. Inspired by a rather naff Steve McQueen movie Chuck A Nightmare On Elm Street 3 The Mask Russell's reimagining was a fun gorepacked scifi horror that featured Matt Dillon's younger brother Kevin as the lead antihero with Saw's Shawnee Smith as the cheerleadercumheroine who try to save small town America from a jellolike substance that devours everything in its path. While a little cheesy in places this movie is hugely enjoyable and should be a lesson to modern directors that if you're going to remake a movie do it properly!There is a glut of horror remakes rearing their heads at the moment but for my money this is one of the best around and dare I say iteven better than the original Kevin Dillon gives an incredible performance as the leatherjacketed reluctant hero as do the rest of the cast. The storydirection and special effects are similarly impressive and memorable. The sink scene in particuliar sticks in the mind.

	schema:reviewBody "Surprise surprise. I gave 1988's remake of the classic BMovieSteve McQueen The Blob eight out of 10 stars. Why? It didn't lie to me. And that's one of the qualities I love most about movies  truth.Don't lie to me. Don't make this remake of a BMovie into a serious drama of gooattacks. I've heard that Rob Zombie  who had a good track record until Halloween II 2009 is remaking it and I'm sure he'll make it more serious. Make that the only serious Blob movie from the three that I know of The Original Son of Blob and this remake. Laughing out loud he said in a quote  at least this is what I read and I'm paraphrasing that he is going to remakereimagine The Blob without well the Blob. He stated he doesn't think audiences would be scared anymore of a goo or Blob that attacks people. Isn't that like remaking Jaws without the shark inland and about a boy and his dog?Point is sure someone else could come in and make a serious horror flick. And I would still go see it. But for this 1988 remake I was very pleased with the results of making a modern for 1988 and 1980s audiences absoluteBMovie. It had everything bad acting bad dialogue bigbad government bad boy Dillon with a bad cycle pretty prom girl inept cops parked  horny kids ready for slaughter tons of gore suspense Stephen Kinglike Minister who knows the end is NEAR! small town tongueincheek horror movie references crowds well extras scrambling from a giant beast of sorts a strange love story a twist finale and a growing and indestructible monster with a weakness if that makes any sense. For this type of movie who seriously could ask for more?Let's set the scene Small Town USA. High School Football unites community. Players wooing the pretty cheerleaders. Kids want into the latest horror slice and dice. Bad Seed returns on a motorcycle. Bum in the woods collects cans for money andsuddenly a strange meteorite lands and some goo attaches itself to the vagrant's hand with some painful results.Let the gore barely featured in the movie's predecessors begin! He attempts to chop off his arm with an axe to no avail the BLOB simply leapfrogs over the new and obviously painful giant paper cut and continues its digestion of the man's arm.Really from this moment on is Point A to B to C for anyone who's anyone who's seen a classic B movie. Enter the bad boy who shows some heart the cheerleader who wants to save the world and the adults who wouldn't believe them if they wrote their experiences in blood. They try to make people believe in the Blob all the while trying to survive until the inevitable explosive and obvious climax with the equally predictable twist leave it open to a sequel! says the producer finale.It's a small wonder this movie basically made NOTHING at the box office. Perhaps people were expecting what Zombie would direct later. I really don't know why anyone at the time 1988 would have such a problem this movie is quintessential 1980s horror and definitely a late 80's homage to scary movies of the decade past. It even had some true suspenseful moments and a great ending you would expect from a movie of such caliber.Okay okay I grew up on the Blob and it did scare me. For if it happens to touch you  you're GONE. As previously mentioned they prove that theory of mine by the failed attempts to chop off the arm to separate the body from the section being devoured by the Blob. That said I wasn't impressed or liked the additionsalterations to the Blob such as the arms the groans or the color pink. I think this is the direction Zombie wants to take it more alien less goo. Uh it's a BLOB for the love of Pete. It's supposed to be JellO from HellO.Also most of the special effects worked but the ones that didn'twell they REALLY didn't. Sure it's labeled as a BMovie but cartoons don't belong in an alllive action flick.Only recommended to those who read this review and said Oh yeah I loved those times! Like me you'll enjoy this throwback to the good ole preCGI days.Side Note I saw the opening credits and I bypassed Kevin Dillon's name immediately since I already knew who he was and that he was the new antihero of the picture. But then I recognized the name Shawnee Smith and knew I knew that name. Even watching the entire movie I still didn't recognize her. Thank you IMDbaw she was a Saw III or part 1 onward favorite of mine. Man  she does NOT look like she aged much during the decade or so jump from this movie and her first Saw appearance.".

It is a relatively simple and sweet story however flimsy it may be. You find yourself not really caring about the plot as you are emerged in a world of spectacular song dance costume and colour.Three musical sequences stick in my mind firstly Ann Miller's mind boggling tap dance 'Shakin' the Blues Away'. Not only a great song but an incredible dance. Then there is Fred's turn in the toy shop. The timing for that is beyond belief. Everything is perfection  the music the decor the dance. It isn't an ordinary Tapdance because he uses rhythm drums and instruments to give it a more flavour. I honestly don't know how he does it. Lastly 'Down the Avenue' is one of my favourite songs. I laugh every time I see Judy Garland and Fred Astaire  two absolute legends  dressed up as bums!! Some very famous and spectacular dancing  top notch.Along the way there are a few laughs Garland really helps the comedy side but I mainly watch this movie for it's eye candy.

	schema:reviewBody "For the only teaming of Fred Astaire and Judy Garland Gene Kelly had to break an ankle playing touch football although he told the studio it was in rehearsal. So Fred Astaire who after another Irving Berlin musical extravaganza Blue Skies at Paramount got pulled out of retirement for this film. It was a happy accident for film fans.Easter Parade by this time had become the national anthem for Easter and enjoys a grand seasonal popularity as Irving Berlin's White Christmas also. It was originally written for the musical revue As Thousands Cheer in 1933 and sung as a duet by Clifton Webb and Marilyn Miller. Bing Crosby reprised it in Holiday Inn in a very nice number driving a horsedrawn sleigh from church Easter services. But usually when it is presented visually the clip of Judy Garland singing it in the finale is the one always shown.By the way the melody originally was for a lyric entitled Smile and Show Your Dimple which bombed for Irving Berlin. Berlin was quoted as saying that popular songs are a perfect marriage between words and music and in this case the melody got divorced and married a second lyric successfully.Easter Parade is a good mixture of old Irving Berlin material and new songs written for this film. Fred Astaire shines with one of the new ones in Stepping Out With My Baby which is a good followup to Putting On the Ritz which Astaire sang and danced to in Blue Skies. And Judy just shines in Better Luck Next Time.The plot is a pretty simple one and for the MGM opulence that their musicals were known for their are very few actual speaking roles in this film. It's a romantic quadrangle with Fred Astaire being dumped by his erstwhile partner Ann Miller and then taking on Judy Garland in one of those 'I'll show her' moments of bravado. Peter Lawford's around to get whoever Astaire doesn't.The acting honors in Easter Parade go to Judy. For all that talent Judy Garland was a most insecure person in life and she drew from that in bringing Hannah Brown to the screen.Ann Miller's big number is Shaking the Blues Away which Ruth Etting introduced in 1927. Doris Day in fact does it in Love Me or Leave Me. Still Ann makes it more of a dance number than Doris did which is what Irving Berlin originally intended it to be.The thing about Easter Parade and so many other films like it is that all that talent was contracted to that studio. You can't make a film like Easter Parade today because you'd have to pay full market price for the talent even as Irving Berlin's numbers slip year after year into public domain.The Easter parade with women dressed in their finest most tasteful frock is still a New York tradition on Easter Sunday. So is this film.".

Out of such confusion are movie musical miracles born although a bit old to act as Garland's leading man Fred Astaire was coaxed out of retirement. He and Garland had tremendous chemistry EASTER PARADE was a box office smash and Astaire unexpectedly found himself reborn as an MGM star.Set in 1900s New York the film's story line is flimsy but enjoyable. After longtime dance partner Ann Miller abandons the act Astaire hires chorus girl Garland and attempts to recast her in his former partner's molda situation which offers Astaire and Garland considerable comedy and gives Astaire the chance to parody several of his own famous dance of the 1930s. Garland eventually convinces Astaire that she needs to be herself and once the act is revamped they become a hot ticketand once their several romantic complications are resolved romantic partners as well.Astaire is every bit as charming here as he was in his Ginger Roger days and his choreography retains his signature sharpness wit and elegance. Although Garland isn't really a dancer she holds her own with Astaire and she tears strips off a brilliant score of Irving Berlin favorites. Both are well supported by Anne Miller who gives a brilliant turn with 'Shakin' the Blues Away' and Peter Lawford who is quite charming as one of Garland's admirers. Although this really isn't as inspired as the truly great MGM musicals of the late 1940s director Walters keeps it going at a smart pace and the star power clever script memorable score and those legendary MGM production values elevate it well above the pack.

This film affords them the chance to shine both individually and as a duo displaying Astaire's dazzling footwork and Garland's throbbing voice as well as their comic abilities. Irving Berlin provides them with a potpourri of popular tunes and there are several stunning showstoppers especially the A Couple of Swells number with Astaire parodying his usual Top Hat and Tails persona. Garland's voice makes I Love a Piano ring out and Astaire shows that at nearly age 50 he could still dance with aplomb in Steppin' Out with my Baby though why they decided to run part of it in slow motion when this could never happen in the stage production they were presenting is a bit of a mystery. The opening number Drum Crazy is also a little masterpiece since it highlights not only Astaire's dancing but also his drumming abilities and also tells a little story and comments on his character as well all without a word of dialogue. Mention should also be made of the sensational Ann Miller in one of her best roles. The songs some old some new fit very snugly into the fluffy but sturdy plot and the entire package is a nifty delight and a reminder of what musical comedy was like when it reached the heights.".

Easter Parade is certainly one of the best with Fred Astaire doing his amazing flashy but precise dancing Judy Garland using her legendary voice to sing right from her heart into yours and Ann Miller doing her own unique style of dancing and tapping while belting out great songs. And of course everybody in the film uses any excuse to sing yet another song usually dancing to it as well.One of the special sequences has Fred Astaire dancing in slow motion while the rest of the cast dance at normal speed behind him! Sure we can do that these days with computers but remember this film was made in 1948!!Of course there's the usual plot  Boy meets girl they fall in love have a misunderstanding but get together again just in time for the big finishing number. That used to really get the audiences in in those days and they repeated that theme in every musical that ever was.Any weak spots? Several of the film's routines seem a little amateurish by today's standards. For example the waiter tossing his invisible salad just to do a bit of clowning seems a little contrived. Also the film is supposedly set in 1912 so all the 1948 fashions and hairstyles are completely anachronistic  but what does that matter after all it's just an enjoyable romp.I've given this film eight out of ten but if I could just vote on Judy Garland's singing and Fred Astaire's dancing I'd certainly give them ten out of ten. This is definitely a mustsee film just for those two incredible talents!".

Sorry mom.Being a failed drummer myself I absolutely loved this piece. A few weeks ago I saw Daddy Long Legs in which Fred also does a drum solo  dance. Folks this cat really knows how to bang the tom toms. Rhythm is the foundation of dance and Fred really shows his mastery of it alongside his comedic antics.Everything is colourful. Everything is graceful camera work included. The sets recreating 1912 are faithfully and magnificently done particularly the scenes of New York City with horses buggies old storefronts and hundreds of extras dressed impeccably in Victorian attire. This movie will truly sweep you off your feet.I can't wait to have another lousy day so that I can pop this bad boy in the DVD player.".

The sets recreating 1912 are faithfully and magnificently done particularly the scenes of New York City with horses buggies old storefronts and hundreds of extras dressed impeccably in Victorian attire. This movie will truly sweep you off your feet.I can't wait to have another lousy day so that I can pop this bad boy in the DVD player.";

Bitter at being dumped both professionally and personally Don swears that he'll pick any girl off the street and turn her into a dancer to rival Nadine hard to imagine considering who was playing her!. Although he first tries to model her in Nadine's image naming her of all things Juanita he soon realises that the girl with the heartbreaking voice that he's picked up Hannah Brown Judy Garland must remain Hannah Brown. They come up with new routines that suit 'Hannah  Hewes' while Hannah falls for Don as Don's buddy Johnny Peter Lawford falls for her. Things get a little messy for a while when Don can't seem to get over Nadine Nadine has a lascivious eye out for Johnny Johnny carries a torch for Hannah and Hannah pines for Don. Still the square doesn't remain a square for long. In a lot of movie musicals one tends to get the feeling that the writers are struggling to pad the plot with songs. There appears to be no such pretense in this film from the very beginning with Astaire singing 'Easter Parade' to open the film one gets the impression that EASTER PARADE sets out to be a showcase for songs and a stage for dancesthis is further emphasised when 'Easter Parade' segues immediately into Astaire's famous solo 'Drum Crazy' with no intervening dialogue which while enchanting has next to nothing to do with the story. The plot is skimpy but not worriedly pushed to the side as in some other musicals... in fact it quite happily moves over of its own accord to make way for the Irving Berlin tunes. Most of which are no offense to the immeasurable Berlin pleasant but not particularly memorable. There are exceptions of course particularly the fantastic 'A Couple Of Swells' with enchanting dance accompanimentGarland mugs and Astaire parodies his own 'top hat white tie and tails' image to excellent effect. I'm also partial to the recurring love theme 'It Only Happens When I Dance With You' and 'Better Luck Next Time'. And of course there's nothing really wrong with being all about the singing and the dancing when it's such incredible singing and dancing. It almost goes without saying that Garland with that slightly offkilter but heartbreakingly beautiful voice of hers lights up the screen in all her scenes. It's a credit to Peter Lawford that he manages to hold his own in their one number together 'A Fella With An Umbrella'! There are also very few dancers better than Fred Astaire and Ann Miller Astaire in all the scenes that has him tapping away as he was born to do and Miller particularly in her rousing beatperfect 'Shakin' The Blues Away'. It will always be a mystery to me why Miller wasn't given more choice roles and more opportunities to show off her dancing skills and legs! since she always acquits herself wonderfully in any film I've seen her in particularly ON THE TOWN and YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU with the little screen time she almost inevitably gets.In the late 1940s one couldn't really be blamed for getting the impression that the MGM musicalthough still big and splashy witness the overblown 'calendar girls' segment shoved into EASTER PARADEwas just limping along until Gene Kelly came along and shook things up with AN AMERICAN IN PARIS and SINGIN' IN THE RAIN to follow. Unfortunately even with its impressive cast and great dancing that's just what EASTER PARADE feels like... a filler. It's a slight not too complicated or strenuous musical that's enjoyable but hardly a classic. Watch this for the performances of all concerned but not for the plot. For that the main stars Astaire Garland and Miller have been in far worthier musicals.".

It features all of the halmarks of a Freed production including an amazing cast with Fred Astaire Judy Garland and Ann Miller lush technicolor photography incredible dancing and a great score that features over 16 songs by Irving Berlin.  It actually had a pretty good story too rather just a bunch of songs with a plot that basically exists to get from one song to the next like in some lesser musicals.The story is about a famous dancer played by Fred Astaire who tries to build a new act with an inexperienced chorus girl whom he discovers Garland after his former partner Miller leaves him to pursue a solo career.  Of course the requisite romantic complications and personal and professional jealousies also figure into the mix.Since all three principles play performers there are plenty of opportunities for each of them to show off their singing and dancing in almost iconic numbers like Steppin' Out with My Baby Shakin' the Blues Away and A Couple of Swells which have all come to be heavily identified with Astaire Miller and Garland respectively throughout their careers.I definitely enjoyed this film and think it's a mustsee for anyone who enjoys musicals or are fans of Fred Astaire Judy Garland and Ann Miller. Peter Lawford's in this one too but I'm not a huge fan of his.  Too bad there's no DVD version.".

	schema:reviewBody "This wonderful MGM musical teamed two of the three most recognizable faces of the musical genre together in Fred Astaire and Judy Garland the other is of course Gene Kelly Garland's frequent costarfor the first time and remains a very enjoyable celebration of talent.Garland despite her personal difficulties turns in a very admirable performance as Hannah Brown a club singer who is 'discovered' by Astaire who wishes to replace the great Nadine Hale Ann Millerwith another girl. 'Easter Parade' blossoms into a nice love story as a smitten Garland and initially indifferent Astaire eventually fall for each other in spite of the various obstacles placed in their path.Garland and Astaire make a genuine couple in this film with Judy as always being incredibly likable. Astaire's character is a little more intriguing. Kelly actually was set to play the male lead in this film but was forced to drop out because of a broken ankle. This may explain why Astaire usually the gentleman plays an unusually arrogant caddish man in the first half of the picture Kelly's image tough and free with women on the exterior with a heart of gold on the inside. Very different from those AstaireRogers films where Astaire giddily falls for the girl. Here Judy giddily falls hook line and sinker for Fred.There are some terrific musical numbers here who can forget 'A Couple Of Swells' or Garland's terrific 'Fella With An Umbrella'? Astaire is fantastic with the help of some trick photography in the 'Steppin' Out With My Baby' number. Let's not forget Ann Miller either she gives us one of the great tap solo's in film history with the amazing 'Shakin The Blues Away' number. Jules Munshin is here in an early role as comic relief to Garland in a restaurant.It is hard to imagine the superstar Garland as an unknown singer 'picked up' by Astaire just as was rather hard to believe her as an unknown singer helped by James Mason in A Star Is Born 1954. She always seemed too talented and too much of a natural star to ever be ignored. Still Judy was a terrific actress as well as an excellent singer so she makes the implausible quite plausible in 'Easter Parade'. It's fun to watch her fluff the dancing opposite Astaire Judy was also an accomplished dancer as well as a great singer in that very Gingerstyle dress with pesky falling feathers very reminiscent of Top Hat.Enjoy it. It's great.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though quite enjoyable in an undemanding way Easter Parade is an efficient rather than an artistic musical and as has been noted elsewhere is hampered by an extremely trite plot line and B movie dialogue that makes the self congratulatory tone of the DVD documentary on Sidney Sheldon's script improvements rather ludicrous. One shakes one's head in disbelieffor all the talkyou would think they were discussing Noel Coward. And Noel Coward this ain't.Nonetheless the union of Mr. Astaire and Misses Garland and Miller on the screen together is auspicious in and of itself and for this reason if no other the film merits particular consideration.Curiously especially given that Garland had just completed the artistically accomplished The Pirate Easter Parade is shot much like a Hardy movie with a series of flat uninspired head on stationary camera set ups in a series of hotel room and restaurant settings. All very proforma.Worse apart from Miss Miller's glorious Shakin the Blues Away and her number with the plume The Girl on the Magazine Coverboth of which feature lovely liquid boom camera work not to mention the scrumptious Millerthe musical numbers are shot in much the same unimaginative way.This is especially odd when compared with Garland's prior work in For Me and My Gal which is also set during the same time frame and also with a vaudeville background. Note how in that earlier film Busby Berkeley with William Daniels on camera opens up the proscenium with a floating boom camera as in By the Sea and Ballin the Jack. Would that someone had done the same here in Easter Parade ! What was Harry Stradling thinking! Or was he just fatigued? Film scholar Douglas McVay in his treatise on the musical film has also remarked on the sorely missed absence of Minnelli's decorative flair in this filmparticularly as it relates to his then wife and the film's starMiss Garland. This deficiency is most obvious during Better Look Next Time where Miss Garland's visual presentation of the song is compromised by indifferent lighting a mistake Mr. Minnelli would never make!Nonetheless she manages to wear nearly a score of elaborate and mostly flatteringcoiffures not to mention some lovely gowns most notably the off the shoulder green velvet during the New Amsterdam sequence. As to the dancing Miss Garland had already executed far more ambitious routines than she is given here with no less than the film's director Charles Walters! Given what she had already accomplished with great brio and elegance too in the finale of Presenting Lily Mars why did it occur to no one particularly since she would be dancing with no less than Fred Astaire! to give her a similarly elegant routine here? Apart from When the Midnight Choo Choo Leaves for Alabam very few dancing demands are made on her. Given the charming grace of her footworkwhat a missed opportunity! Snooky Ookums and Ragtime Violin look like something out of a June Haver pictureall shtick and forced grins. Ann Miller by contrast after her long confinement at Columbia really comes into her own here. No wonder many contemporary 1948 critics felt she walked off with the picture.One minor blooper to watch for. When late in the story Miss Garland and Mr. Astaire argue in the corridor outside her hotel room door the wall to the immediate right of the door behind Miss Garland is bare. The next morning when Peter Lawford arrives to awaken her a framed engraving hangs in the same spot that had been previously bare the night before. Note too that the audiencereaction applause shot after Couple of Swells is lifted from Till the Clouds Roll By guess even Metro had their budget conscious moments.Despite these minor quibbles an Arthur Freed picture from MGM in 1947 is a pretty high recommendation in and of itself. And it must be said John Green's orchestrations are superb and the Technicolor some nifty mauves hereis very pretty. All in all enjoyable but seldom brilliant. One can only wonder what Mr. Minnelli could have done for it. Sadly we will never know.".

All very proforma.Worse apart from Miss Miller's glorious Shakin the Blues Away and her number with the plume The Girl on the Magazine Coverboth of which feature lovely liquid boom camera work not to mention the scrumptious Millerthe musical numbers are shot in much the same unimaginative way.This is especially odd when compared with Garland's prior work in For Me and My Gal which is also set during the same time frame and also with a vaudeville background. Note how in that earlier film Busby Berkeley with William Daniels on camera opens up the proscenium with a floating boom camera as in By the Sea and Ballin the Jack. Would that someone had done the same here in Easter Parade ! What was Harry Stradling thinking! Or was he just fatigued? Film scholar Douglas McVay in his treatise on the musical film has also remarked on the sorely missed absence of Minnelli's decorative flair in this filmparticularly as it relates to his then wife and the film's starMiss Garland. This deficiency is most obvious during Better Look Next Time where Miss Garland's visual presentation of the song is compromised by indifferent lighting a mistake Mr. Minnelli would never make!Nonetheless she manages to wear nearly a score of elaborate and mostly flatteringcoiffures not to mention some lovely gowns most notably the off the shoulder green velvet during the New Amsterdam sequence. As to the dancing Miss Garland had already executed far more ambitious routines than she is given here with no less than the film's director Charles Walters! Given what she had already accomplished with great brio and elegance too in the finale of Presenting Lily Mars why did it occur to no one particularly since she would be dancing with no less than Fred Astaire! to give her a similarly elegant routine here? Apart from When the Midnight Choo Choo Leaves for Alabam very few dancing demands are made on her. Given the charming grace of her footworkwhat a missed opportunity! Snooky Ookums and Ragtime Violin look like something out of a June Haver pictureall shtick and forced grins. Ann Miller by contrast after her long confinement at Columbia really comes into her own here. No wonder many contemporary 1948 critics felt she walked off with the picture.One minor blooper to watch for. When late in the story Miss Garland and Mr. Astaire argue in the corridor outside her hotel room door the wall to the immediate right of the door behind Miss Garland is bare. The next morning when Peter Lawford arrives to awaken her a framed engraving hangs in the same spot that had been previously bare the night before. Note too that the audiencereaction applause shot after Couple of Swells is lifted from Till the Clouds Roll By guess even Metro had their budget conscious moments.Despite these minor quibbles an Arthur Freed picture from MGM in 1947 is a pretty high recommendation in and of itself. And it must be said John Green's orchestrations are superb and the Technicolor some nifty mauves hereis very pretty. All in all enjoyable but seldom brilliant. One can only wonder what Mr. Minnelli could have done for it. Sadly we will never know.";

Unfortunately Easter Parade is one of those relics. It was a smashing success in 1948 but all these years later it doesn't play very well at all. The plot is too slight the pacing is too slow the songs are too dull the whole package just doesn't work. Now any movie starring Fred Astaire and Judy Garland isn't going to be all bad. Astaire's dancing and Garland's singing are as great as you imagine they would be. Not for nothing were they film legends. But all in all this is a film which makes a rather poor showcase for the renowned talents of its famous stars.The barebones plot involves Astaire's character of Don having his dance team partner leave him to take up a solo offer. I'll show her he thinks stating that he can take any old girl and make her into a star. Any old girl turns out to be Hannah Brown played by Garland. Don and Hannah form a new partnership which struggles to get off the ground. But eventually the pairing starts to pick up steam and you think the movie might too. But no such luck. It's still a rather dry oddly lifeless musical. And a very antiquated looking and sounding one to the modern eye and ear. The AstaireGarland pairing never sizzles the way you'd hope it would. Astaire is obviously the far superior dancer of the two. Garland gamely tries to keep up but the contrast is rather jarring. It kind of works for the story in that Garland's character is supposed to be an anonymous nobody of a dancer. But when Astaire's best musical number pairs him with a couple of anonymous hoofers while Garland stands idly by offstage it says a lot. The age disparity catches up with the pair as well once the inevitable romantic storyline kicks in. Everything about the pairing and thus the movie seems off somehow. It never comes together properly. The songs the cornerstones of any movie musical are all forgettable. The humor largely falls flat most notably in one scene involving the world's weirdest waiter. The story isn't much of a story at all. Astaire and Garland have their moments but not nearly enough of them to carry this film to success.".

Some have clever lyrics some are pure hokum. The female chorus backing many songs is of the horrid 1940's harmonized variety and it sounds like a soap commercial. It's a pity that so many otherwise great recordings from the era were desecrated by such syrupy overproduced warbling.But the dancing is excellent for the most part. The sets are bright and bold and imaginative though not aweinspiring. It's a bit jarring to see a 49yearold Astaire paired with a 26yearold Garland even if she is already starting to look a bit ravaged and their romance is never plausible. But they both tackled their roles with a lot of gusto and appeared to be enjoying themselves.One really dazzling moment is when Ann Miller who was never more alluring than in this movie puts on her big dance routine and spins around so fast and so many times that it strains credulity that she didn't simply topple over and pass out. Rather odd that the single most striking bit of dancing on one of the movie's most extravagant sets came from her rather than the leads.The Easter parade at the start of the movie is a real gem a great example of 1940's Hollywood going completely over the top. The sequel at the end of the movie is curiously pale in comparison even if it does feature Astaire wearing a silk top hat with a lavender silk bow. One of the unresolved issues with the screenplay is the contrast between exotic Ann Miller and plain Judy Garland. But the movie's high point for me was the number featuring Astaire and Garland dressed as tramps. The lovable tramp schtick can result in dreary tedious clich ala Red Skelton but it's carried off with great verve in this case and is a real treat to watch.".

Don bets womanizing pal Jonathan Peter Lawford that he can make any chorus girl into the next star and picks Hannah at random. They sing some songs do some routines and fall in love and the finale is the singing of the title song as they promenade along 5th Avenue with all the other posers who undertake this ritual every Easter.The cast are good in this film with Judy Garland winning the honours as she provides many humorous moments watch how she scene steals from Fred Astaire in the rather hammy and drab routine that is A Couple Of Swells. Most of the musical numbers are good if forgettable. My favourite routines include Judy Garland singing I Want To Go Back To Michigan her duet with Peter Lawford A Fella With An Umbrella Ann Miller singing and dancing Shakin' The Blues Away the sequence of song and dance duets that Judy Garland and Fred Astaire have together including When The Midnight Choo Choo Leaves For Alabam and Fred Astaire's number Steppin' Out With My Baby despite the unnecessary gimmick of having him dance in slow motion which cheapens the routine.Unfortunately the film crams in too many songs and the viewer may lose interest in the musical offerings especially towards the end as none of them are particularly good or memorable unless there is dancing involved. The film is also a little unbelievable in the way Judy Garland falls in love with Fred Astaire. Peter Lawford is the obvious romance for her but the film seems to be driven by the following love formula  Judy Garland loves Fred Astaire unbelievable who loves Ann Miller but she's a complete bitch so it's unlikely who loves Peter Lawford who loves Judy Garland. It doesn't work.A final criticism must be made of the ending. At the beginning of the film Don tells Hannah that come the next Easter Parade photographers will be lining up to take her picture instead of Nadine's and we have an amusing sequence of Nadine promenading with a dog in a completely ghastly and posey manner as photographers take her picture. At the end of the film the audience does not get the satisfaction of seeing this come true. We are left with Don and Hannah wearing long pink rubber kitchen gloves walking along the parade together but that's it. I assume we are meant to deduce that Hannah has arrived and is now on an equal billing with Nadine. Incidentally we are not shown what happens with Nadine and Jonathan. I assume that they get together as they are both comfortable with having a showy lifestyle. Nothing is clearly resolved.The cast are good the colour is great the costumes are great particularly one green velvet dress that Judy Garland wears and some of the routines are good but there are better musicals than this.".

Astaire loses his dance partner and decides he can turn anyone into a new partner then conveniently stumbles upon Garland. He's demanding and rather sour so of course she falls for him. Meanwhile Peter Lawford floats through the movie to no real purpose and Anne Miller is unsympathetic but really knows how to tap.The movie shouldn't really work as well as it does. Astaire is much too old for Garland the part was originally set for Gene Kelly who was injured and she's not as comfortable a fit for him as previous partners like Ginger Rogers. She's also no more than serviceable as a dancer. And once again Lawford is an entirely extraneous character whose only purpose seems to be to make clear that no one cares about the story.And yet Astaire has his usual debonair charm and his dancing shown off particularly well in a solo dance near the beginning and Garland is all vulnerability and amazing singing.Even the weak chemistry works because the whole idea is Garland is random not someone Astaire would choose making their mismatch a feature rather than a bug until the inevitable romance which seems forced. It's a weird movie in that almost everything about it is problematic and yet it completely works. It's a classic that shouldn't be and you should watch it.".

We get something of a romancecareer mix led by Don Fred Astaire as a professional dancer and Hannah Judy Garland a twobit chorus girl that Don tries to fashion into a replacement for stylish Nadine Ann Miller who dumps Don for a lucrative solo dancing career. But the plot such as it is is not well written and the main characters are not entirely sympathetic.There is at least some humor especially when Hannah as Juanita tries too hard to be sophisticated when she dances onstage with Don in a gown that sheds feathers. Playing it straight longlegged dancer Ann Miller dazzles in a couple of numbers.The thin choppy plot is one problem but so too are the plethora of mediocre songs that intrude into the plot. And though the song Easter Parade is quite melodic the film doesn't do much with it at the end which seemed blatantly curt. In other musicals the entire film builds up to some grand finale musical number but not here. And that was a disappointment.Stylish for its era and supremely colorful Easter Parade revs up the nostalgia for a bygone era but in so doing comes across as quaint and dated to a modern audience.

She wants to be a star on her own right he sets out to prove that he can get any girl to dance as well as she can. He plucks the first girl he sees out of a chorus line in a bar just like he did with her the first time. She turns out to be a disaster humorously rendered as her not even knowing which foot is left.So how to make headlines once more? Of course he grooms her into the image of that first woman and she turns out great but only because unbeknownst to him he was seducing out of her the love that can make a difference. So eventually the two rival shows are made to spin at the same time vying for headlines and our attention. The new pair visits the opponent to strut their newfound triumph under her nose but she's cunning enough to seduce a dance out of her expartner that will break them apart.Naturally this being an MGM production the finale is drenched with the wistful sentiment about wholesome values one is led to expect. The two of them stroll happy together on the Easter Parade as promised in the beginning.So generally speaking this may seem like ordinary stuff for the time. Two things make it stand out however. One is Fred Astaire such heavenly chattery legs. Put simply there is no Michael Jackson without Astaire. The other is a kind of soft Vertigo at the heart of the candycolored spectacle about an obsession with cultivating an image less morbid this go round less dangerous but potent the right amount if we keep in mind how it mirrors across the sparkling surface of a deeply troubled Judy Garland.We know how MGM cultivated the young star in the image of the chaste teenage girl that she's also saddled with in the opening of this film. In the finale she manages to lift herself out of the confines of that image and asserts herself as a sexual dynamic woman likely mapping to some part of her struggle in real life to pursue her heart. Among her many lovers she counted Frank Sinatra Welles Mankiewicz and Tyrone Power. She had enough pull in Hollywood by this time to get then husband Vincente Minnelli fired from this.Our loss here is that Chyd Charisse broke an ankle and could not appear. Ann Miller as replacement acquits herself pretty well as the scheming diva. Her last onscreen glimmer decades later would be Mulholland Dr. where she reflects on the bygone Technicolor glories here.".

	schema:headline " The first half of the movie is much better than the second half";
	schema:reviewBody "The first part of this movie is filled with dark humor and makes a worthwhile statement Most of those who celebrate Christmas do so because of the trappings not because of the substance. The huge snowman that each family who lives on the block is supposed to inflate and put atop their house points to the frivolity of the holiday for the average observer. I haven't read John Grisham's book Skipping Christmas yet but the first half of the film seems to be pure Grisham. Luther Krank Tim Allen is something of an antihero declaring his own private little war on Christmas abuse unlike Dickens' Scrooge who simply doesn't want to be bothered with the holiday because he's a miser and worships money. Nora Krank Jamie Lee Curtis on the other hand really wants the show of Christmas to impress the neighbors and not to rock the boat. Having her only child Blair Krank Julie Gonzalo away from home at Christmas for the first time kills her holiday spirit anyway. She is pictured as a doting mom who has spoiled her child rotten at the expense of her marriage and anything else not involving Blair. The second half of the film becomes a standard traditional type outing with Luther Krank being the scroogelike selfish oaf who wants to spoil it all with his bah humbug attitude. He comes around by giving the best gift of all to his neighbor whose wife is dying of cancer. In other words the film cops out during the second half and with it the humor sours. A potentially funny holiday treat becomes just another lame copy of It's a Wonderful Life.There are some truly funny sequences during the first part of the movie. Note when Luther Krank waters down his sidewalk to make it slippery for the terrible carolers. Keep your eye on the neighbor's cat. The botox part is excruciatingly laughable with Tim Allen at his best. The tanning scene with the glorious Tom Poston as the Krank's priest is also hilarious. Too bad this level of humor was not maintained throughout.The cast is well chosen with one exception. Cheech Marin is wasted in a thankless role. When given a chance he can be a funny man.".

The huge snowman that each family who lives on the block is supposed to inflate and put atop their house points to the frivolity of the holiday for the average observer.

	schema:reviewBody "How can you go wrong with a holiday movie that pairs Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis? Director Joe Roth has found a way. Based on the novel Skipping Christmas by John Grisham the movie centers around a couple Allen Curtis depressed because their daughter will not be home for Christmas who decide to skip the celebration and take a cruise instead. While I admit I would've still decorated the movie goes overboard in the reactions of the neighbors led by Dan Aykroyd. Turning into Christmas Nazis they begin stalking and harassing the pair to try to get them to decorate. I was not aware Christmas spirit meant decorate at all costs. I don't find the humor in the characters here who believe so. Making matters worse about halfway through the movie when the Kranks change their minds it seems more like they did so out of giving in than because they wanted to. And their reason for changing their mind is preposterous the daughter has gotten engaged to a man from Peru and wants to bring him home for Christmas. She goes on to explain to her mother that he has never seen a snowy Christmas because he spends it in Peru every year with his family. Why would she go through all the trouble of making lastminute changes to take him away from this traditionwhen she was already in Peru? I guess it fits the rest of the movie everyone is centered on themselves. Allen and Curtis are the best things about the movie but the scene of her in that tanning salon in the shopping mall is the least funny in a movie full of dead jokes. We even get a Santa Claus finale that does not fit the tone of what came before. Good job Roth! You've made the worst Christmas movie of all time. Bring on Santa Claus Conquers the Martians! Please.".

Luther sees a Caribbean cruise poster in a Chicago travel agency window and he begins to plan the trip. First he must see how he will pay for the trip so he comes up with an idea that if they skipped Christmas they could go. He will save money by not buying a tree having a party or putting up decorations. The neighbors think he is crazy and want him to at least put Frosty the Snowman on his roof for the local decoration contest. The battle begins between the Kranks and their neighbors. Then Blair calls and tells her parents that she is flying home for Christmas with her fiance. They have twentyfour hours to put up all the decorations and prepare for the Christmas party. The movie was based on a John Grisham book 'Skipping Christmas'. It is a cute Christmas story with a lot of funny slapstick sketches. It reminds you of the Chevy Chase movie 'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation'. Tim Allen does a great job in several comedy scenes especially the scenes where he gets bowtox injections in his face and the suntan scene. Columbia Pictures Run time 139 Rated PG 510".

	schema:reviewBody "There is nothing better than a great Christmas movie. Everyone can name their favorite and there is nothing more nostalgic than watching your favorite Christmas special every year. It remains to be seen whether The Kranks will become one of those for us or for me anyways. Christmas With The Kranks which I was stunned to learn the novel from which it was based was penned by the amazing John Grisham and the screenplay by the equally amazing Chris Columbus was a fun heart felt and often laugh out funny Christmas film. It had it's shortcomings as the critics are shoving in our faces but a Christmas film must be given some slack for being a seasonal film anyways.The story is The Kranks Luther and Nora have had to say goodbye to their beloved Daughter Blaire as she moves on to the Peace Corp. Suddenly their empty nest syndrome kicks in and they realize their whole reason for having extravagant Christmas's is gone. Luther realizes that this is the perfect opportunity to leave it all behind and take his wife on a luxurious cruise of the Caribbean but in order to truly appreciate the Christmas cruise they will have to boycott Christmas altogether which sounds easy at first but they realize their Christmas happy neighbors coworkers and town are not going to stand for it. Everything comes to a grinding halt when Blaire calls to say she is coming home for Christmas which changes everything. Now all they've worked towards avoiding they have to bring back set up get ready for and prepare the best Christmas ever!! Tim Allen is wonderful in this movie probably the best of the cast. The character fits him so well and he doesn't come across as Tim Taylor which is always good. Jamie Lee Curtis who I love don't get me wrong but she didn't quite hit the note on this one. She was okay but she wasn't well matched with Luther and she wasn't given the best of scenes in the film although her bikini scene was very funny. Dan Akroyd makes an unfortunately brief appearance as the mayor of the neighborhood who at first appears to be hassling them but in the end rallies everyone to their support. The movie dragged a little it's slightly longer than expected and the beginning of it was a little off putting. It felt like it was going to suck basically. But it got so much better half way through and ended perfectly. From the moment of the hilarious carolers outside their house the movie was funny heart warming and fun to watch. The dialog felt forced at times and some of the gags did as well but it was still fun to watch. Throw in some necessary Christmas magic and a little heart warming moment of Christmas realization and the film is wonderful. I can't wait to see it again next Christmas. I often wondered if Grisham or Columbus wasn't trying to be a little satirical at parts with the neighborhood perfectly aligned and snow perfectly placed. It felt like maybe they were poking a little fun but nonetheless it's a great family Christmas movie. I also think they should have stuck with the title Skipping Christmas but that doesn't effect it much I suppose. Check it out!! 7.510".

It is about a terrible neighborhood where Luther and Nora Krank Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis want to skip Christmas for a change to go on a cruise. Christmas has cost them six thousand dollars last year mainly on decoration so this year they don't do Christmasstuff and go on the cruise still saving three thousand dollars. Unfortunately their neighbors disagree. It is a tradition that the whole neighborhood takes part in this holiday skipping is not an option. The ending of the film basically says that the neighbors are right and that their cruel methods to stop the Kranks from going on the cruise is justified. How stupid can it get?Well even more than it already is. Of course the Kranks fail to skip Christmas because their daughter only away for some weeks to join the Peace Corps in Peru returns for the holidays together with her new fianc. Right. So suddenly the Kranks have to do their usual Christmasthings that includes giving a Christmas Eve party. There is quite some hurry needed since the two lovebirds are already on their way. What do you know? All the cruel neighbors are willing to help! In a series of unfortunate events we see how things almost go wrong the entire time and turn out the way they should after all. How surprising.The movie rolls from one stupid event into another never funny most of the time even annoying. It is hard to believe this story seemed funny on paper and that gives us the obvious question of why this movie was even made. Probably because it is about Christmas and could make some money which it did. If there is one Christmasmovie to avoid in whatever year it definitely is 'Christmas with the Kranks'.".

	schema:headline " Pathetic Christmas comedy is laughable in effort";
	schema:reviewBody "Christmas with the Kranks deserves a place among not only the worst holiday movies ever made but one of the worst of all time in ANY genre.The story closely follows the novel by John Grisham. The book itself is challenged from the getgo because it employs a formula which is all too familiar among holiday fare the man who has lost his enthusiasm for the Christmas season but eventually goes through a personal redemption which restores his spirit. It is a theme that has been visited by everyone from Charles Dickens to Dr. Seuss and so needs a lot of creativity and hard work to appear original. Unfortunately Grishams plot followed a very predictable course and the result is a tale that is so tiresome that you can even sense the actors and the director of the film version were just as completely bored by the premise as most viewers will be.The story also suffers from the assumption that a family not blatantly participating in outdoor lighting greeting card sending partythrowing etc. would be branded and immediately set apart as rejects of their local society. I don't know about the neighborhood where John Grisham lives but in my midwest suburb most of the houses don't even bother to decorate at all. Yet I don't see neighborhood protests occurring every Christmas season. Further in an age when Nativity scenes are routinely banned from public display and use of the word Christmas itself is discouraged as politically incorrect it is hard to believe there would be such widespread condemnation of one family's decision to skip Christmas so they can go on a Caribbean cruise.Having read the book I was curious to see if the movie version improved upon the subpar story. It is much much worse. The development of the main character Luther Krank played by Tim Allen into a man who is tired of the Christmas grind went too fast in the book and in the movie is barely established at all. In fact we are led to believe it all comes about after one scene in which Luther makes a dash into a specialty foods store in the pouring rain to pick up a couple of items for his wife. What passes for creative slapstick at this time is Luther getting splashed by a car and his foot being submerged in a watery pothole.Brace yourself because that is about as original as the pranks in this film get.While the main characters  Luther and his wife Nora played by Jamie Lee Curtis are hardly given any time to get INTO character the character of the neighbors and the Kranks' relationship to them is given none. It is almost as if the screenplay was written assuming the viewer had read Grisham's book and could fill in all the blanks. Hence the much needed dynamic tension between the neighbors and the Kranks in order to establish some of the comedy is nonexistent. Without buildup or justification the animosity the neighbors have for the Kranks is forced untrue and very unfunny.It is unsettling to watch highly paid actors go through the motions looking as tired as the story. It is as if they themselves had no faith in the film and just couldn't wait to get it done and over with. Ditto for the director. I can just visualize the director saying Okay Tim Jaimie Lee. One take and let's move on to the next one.Even the cinematography looks tired and passionless. It appears as if even the outdoor scenes were filmed in a brightly lit studio. The story ached for a wide angle or bird'seye panorama of the neighborhood to emphasize the Kranks' lack of participation with the lighting displays but we never see such a view. In addition the scenery itself is so brightly lit you can hardly tell a difference between the Kranks' dark undecorated house and the welllit homes of his neighbors.When a comedy falls this flat it is not pretty. Especially when the script tries to inject some instant pathos at the last scene! Ironically Luther's conversion into a caring person a scene that is intended to be moving may be the most laughable aspect of a film that is entirely contrived and more pathetic than anything else.".

	schema:reviewBody "If ever one wishes to be visited by the three ghosts of Christmas one must first garnish large sums of regret by spending any amount of time and money at a local theater watching Christmas with the Kranks. Secondly one should tempt the fates with an audacious act of selfloathing by purchasing this movie exceptionally devoid of any depth or merit as a staple for a family's holiday video collection. Lastly one then stunts the development of youthful innocence by exposing his or her children to Christmas with the Kranks and immediately explaining to them how the movie is an adult's shallow interpretation of the holidays as a forewarning to never grow up.Pinnacle TalentsChristmas with the Kranks is the film adaptation of author John Grisham's novel Skipping Christmas adapted by Chris Columbus writer of Nine Months directed by Joe Roth director of American Sweethearts and starring Tim Allen Santa Clause Jamie Lee Curtis True Lies and Dan Aykroyd Driving Miss Daisy.Plot in a NutshellTired of succumbing to the commercialism of Christmas at home Luther Krank Allen convinces his reluctant wife Nora Curtis to take a cruise during the holidays since their daughter Blair played by the forgettable Julie Gonzalo will be away in the Peace Corps. Unfortunately for Luther his coworkers and neighbors consider him the proverbial Scrooge for not participating in festive traditions or buying into annual commodities. This results in the Kranks taking drastic measures to avoid most everyone they know until early December 24th when the doting parents learn that Blair is returning home with her new fiance for a surprise visit and to experience Christmas with all the opulence the Kranks feverishly worked so hard to avoid.Film ImpressionsThe only good thing I can say about this movie is that it had promise. The concept of a suburban Grinch though a centuryold clich at best would have been humorous to watch if the plot demanded the slapstick comedy found in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation the dark humor of Bad Santa the endearing magic of The Santa Clause or the solemn morals of It's A Wonderful Life. Unfortunately this is another case of a movie with an underdeveloped plot forced towards a conclusion without any regard for potential or polish.For instance the Chicago neighbors are made so ridiculously obnoxious that audiences can't help but sympathize with the Kranks. If by the end of the movie Luther and Nora took on the sadistic roles of Mickey and Mallory in Natural Born Killers and terminated everyone around them in a flurry of gunfire it would have been a welcome relief.The only neighbor that is written without any nuances is Bev Scheel played by Elizabeth Franz who suffers from cancer. This fact does absolutely nothing for the plot save to draw in the reins and bring the movie to its obvious ending.Jamie Lee Curtis screams and retreats in nearly every scene Tim Allen takes a Botox joke well beyond the boundaries of funny a criminal aspect is shown that should have been edited from the script a nonsensical last minute bit of wonderment as to whether Santa Claus is real is included and a two second appearance by David L. Lander Squiggy of Laverne and Shirley fame that fails to flourish into anything more than a quick glimpse of entertainment history among many other things makes this movie pale in comparison to other holiday classics save for a dusty lump of coal.".

Their daughter would come back. Time obviously was not enough to prepare the impending Christmas for just both of them.When I watched that Luther Krank gave the travel tickets to his neighbor who he didn't like I was moved by the scene. Leniency is virtue indeed.Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis showed fully their comedian ability. Especially Jamie's exaggerating performance was better. She is my favorite comedian actress.

Until people find out that Luthor and Nora Krank have denied Tradition. What follows is an assortment of disturbing scenes as the neighborhood tries to win back the Krank's hearts. Two exceptionally troublesome scenes The newspaper reports the family's wish to not celebrate Christmas in a smear article front page no less and the constant arguments about the family's decision to not but up a snowman completely identical to the snowmen on every other roof.When I was a child I read the store Tootle the Tank Engine. Tootle was given one rule Stay on the Rails no matter what. When he went off the rails nothing was harmed. But he was not supposed to do it so all the conductors and engineers tricked him into staying on the rails. This book was written admittedly as propaganda to keep children following America as the assumed threat of communists grew. Right now there is an aptmospher in our great nation that says your for us or against us. If we don't follow we are wrong. Whether or not this is intentional the film feels like cold war era propaganda as it does not satirize the neighbor's constant assaults on the Kranks but supports them.At any rate this movie is a frightening monument to conformity and blind faith and teaches us not to respect the wishes and ideas of others.See a much better Christmas film with political undertones Santa Clause Conquers the Martians.0 stars.".

Hoffman plays an East Coast songwriter currently being hailed by Time magazine as a prophet who sees nothing meaningful in his existence hearkening back on his ordinary boyhood in order to make peace with the present. Accentuated by bursts of rock music and defined by little bits of mordant truth the film blessedly isn't a silly phantasmagoria although some may see all this as a conwritten by somebody who is out of step with the times Gardner wrote the coy A Thousand Clowns after all. Yet somehow the movie strikes a melancholic sobering almost disenfranchised chord and smart director Ulu Grosbard is actually interested in revealing something tangible through his characters. Hoffman's Georgie Soloway can't enjoy living without relating it to dying and so has suicidal flightsoffancy paranoiac personal dramas and surreal sessions with a Viennese analyst. It's a good role for Dustin while Barbara Harris is wonderful in the small role of a struggling actress who's still in love with 1957. It takes a while to get into the movie's groove but there are some worthwhile thoughts here helped immeasurably by Victor Kemper's nonfussy cinematography and Grosbard's deep connection with the material.

	schema:reviewBody "Harry Kellerman was a most unfulfilling film for me as unfulfilling as Dustin Hoffman found his life to be in this movie. Hoffman plays a successful rock composer who is going through a mid life crisis and finds all of a sudden in his middle Thirties he's not a really happy guy despite all the money in the world and the toys that money can buy. His best time is flying his private plane talk about toys.For some reason I couldn't get into this film or feel any kind of sympathy for Hoffman's character of George Soloway. Hoffman's best friend seems to be his analyst Jack Warden hamming it up in his best Viennese accent. Dustin has more real and imagined time with Warden than anyone else in the film. In fact Warden functions as an alter ego for him more inside his head than in real life on the couch.The last straw for Hoffman seems to be some mysterious dude named Harry Kellerman who for some reason is calling up all of Hoffman's friends of both sexes and badmouthing him all over the place. As his relationships crumble all around him Hoffman goes on a frantic manhunt for Kellerman.With all the imaginary sequences in this film if you can't figure out who Harry Kellerman is before a quarter of the film is over you haven't seen too many films at all. Think a kinder gentler Fight Club.Hoffman does the best he can to make some coherent sense out of his character but in the end he's not someone I care terribly about. Rose Gregorio as his exwife David Burns as his father and Gabriel Dell as his cheerfully hedonistic songwriting partner are the best in the film.Barbara Harris as a woman who seems to have as much angst as Hoffman got an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress she lost in the Oscar sweepstakes to Cloris Leachman for The Last Picture Show an infinitely better film. Harris's character is interesting she represents a last chance for Hoffman at love. She has her problems but without as much money she seems to be coping a lot better. Another reason for me to not care about Hoffman's George Soloway.The ambiance of the early Seventies rock scene is captured well. Would that George Soloway in Harry Kellerman be someone you could actually get worked up over.".

If you love Acting with a capital A over Action this is your film.What makes this a movie worth seeing are the actors Dustin Hoffman Barbara Harris and Jack Ward all turn in supreme performances. Even the bit parts are wellwritten and equally wellacted. The dialogue is sharp witty and sadly comic. Dustin Hoffman plays a highly successful songwriter who suffers from insomnia and the dementia it brings as he looks back on the relationships he's had throughout his life hoping to break his loneliness. Hoffman does an excellent job of portraying a creative genius one whose creativity is so abundant he seems unable to turn it off. In most of the scenes Hoffman is strumming a guitar singing under his breath presumably writing a new song with each emotion he feels at any given moment. Because the music that flows through him occupies so much of his brain he seems unable to focus on human relationships and by middle age the loneliness catches up with him.Hoffman drifts in and out of reality. Deciding which scenes are real and which are his imagination is up to the viewer. Or as Hoffman tells his psychiatrist Why should I come back to reality? What's it ever done for me?It should also be noted that as much as Simon and Garfunkel did for The Graduate so does this film's soundtrack accentuate the overall feel of the movie with music from Ray Charles and Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show.".

It is not plotdriven but is rather a character study. It also presents a picture of an period in America when modernity began to overtake traditional ways and values.As a whole I do not find the film to be one of Dustin Hoffman's best but I would not have missed the haunting performance of Barbara Harris for the world.

Three things about this movie lend me the ability to give it a 10. Seeing Dr. Hook  The Medicine Show I own their fan club on stage with the genius of Shel Silverstein and Mr. Hoffman. The 3 of them together permit me to vote this movie a 10 no matter how much it needs the help of a decent writer. Hoffman gives a wonderful show as the highly intelligent highly proficient but obviously insane Georgie Soloway. Dr. Hook sing the opening and closing tracks and a song done onstage with Shel and Dustin named One More Round amongst other tracks.

	schema:reviewBody "As someone who'll kill a common house spider on sight and as a resident of one of the the cooler regions of the United States I try to watch the fifties scifi movie Tarantula whenever it's on. Maybe I do it as therapy. I dunno. Or maybe I'm trying to convince myself that it really is better living in a city that has been known to have blizzards in April. Whatever. But enough about me. This Jack Arnolddirected movie was made for UniversalInternational at a time that studio wasn't nearly the behemoth it is today. But UI or rather its management wanted to be big and were aiming to grow. Kind of like the eightlegged creature in this film.The movie is set in an Arizona desert town whose handsome young Dr. John Agar is trying to solve the mysterious death of a man from a condition known as acromegaly or acromegalia as it's called in the film. His quest takes him to the laboratory of research scientist Leo G. Carroll who though outwardly polite clearly doesn't want to be bothered. He doesn't want his beautiful young assistant Mara Corday to be bothered either least of all by the romantic Dr. Agar. As luck would have it Carroll and his former associate and friendlet's call him the acromegaly man and leave it at thatwere working on a nutrient a growth formula that they hoped would cure world hunger. To make a long story short one of the creatures they were experimenting on a tarantula already the size of a Volkswagon escaped from the lab when a former assistant also suffering from acromegaly set it on fire as he had gone mad. He also injected Dr. Carroll with the growth formula that would in time give him acromegaly too.In a brief period of time the spider has grown to the size of a house then an office building. He's either very shrewd or very lucky to avoid being spotted feasting mostly on ranchers and men in remote areas where he won't be seen by others. Guns are useless against the big guy. Dynamite can't kill him either. He just ambles on right through it. The Air Force has to be called in. I won't tell you any more because I don't want to spoil the ending for you. As big bug movies go this one's near the top of my list. It's very well photographed and the life of the small town is presented with just enough credibility so that even when the story gets a tad weird the people seem real. I especially liked Nestor Paiva's extremely to put it mildly aggressive performance as the sheriff. Forceful as he is he's never obnoxious just assertive. Mara Corday doesn't have much to do but look pretty which she does superbly. The late John Agar is quite good as the town doctor. No this isn't George C. Scott we're talking about but Agar is competent. Also there's something about his looks the eyes and cheekbones especially that give him an alien almost unreal aspect. It's a perfect face for a fifties scifi hero. Slightly android. Leo G. Carroll is his usual diffident self and he does make a convincing scientist. There's something about Carroll's manner and delivery of dialog that makes you want to hear more. I wish he'd have more to say and more to do and not just in this movie in all the movies he appeared in. This isn't exactly a star vehicle for him but his role is substantial and in a way it's his lowkey underacting that keeps the movie anchored in something that resembles reality. Put a more flamboyant type in the part a Rathbone or a Lugosi and the film would be over the top.".

	onyx:emotionText "As someone who'll kill a common house spider on sight and as a resident of one of the the cooler regions of the United States I try to watch the fifties scifi movie Tarantula whenever it's on. Maybe I do it as therapy. I dunno. Or maybe I'm trying to convince myself that it really is better living in a city that has been known to have blizzards in April. Whatever. But enough about me. This Jack Arnolddirected movie was made for UniversalInternational at a time that studio wasn't nearly the behemoth it is today. But UI or rather its management wanted to be big and were aiming to grow. Kind of like the eightlegged creature in this film.The movie is set in an Arizona desert town whose handsome young Dr. John Agar is trying to solve the mysterious death of a man from a condition known as acromegaly or acromegalia as it's called in the film. His quest takes him to the laboratory of research scientist Leo G. Carroll who though outwardly polite clearly doesn't want to be bothered. He doesn't want his beautiful young assistant Mara Corday to be bothered either least of all by the romantic Dr. Agar. As luck would have it Carroll and his former associate and friendlet's call him the acromegaly man and leave it at thatwere working on a nutrient a growth formula that they hoped would cure world hunger. To make a long story short one of the creatures they were experimenting on a tarantula already the size of a Volkswagon escaped from the lab when a former assistant also suffering from acromegaly set it on fire as he had gone mad. He also injected Dr. Carroll with the growth formula that would in time give him acromegaly too.In a brief period of time the spider has grown to the size of a house then an office building. He's either very shrewd or very lucky to avoid being spotted feasting mostly on ranchers and men in remote areas where he won't be seen by others. Guns are useless against the big guy. Dynamite can't kill him either. He just ambles on right through it. The Air Force has to be called in. I won't tell you any more because I don't want to spoil the ending for you.

	schema:reviewBody "Only slightly less classic than Them! Tarantula still manages to stand on its own as a strong entry in the Giant Bug movies of the 50s. Technically its not a bug movie as tarantulas are arachnids and not insects but moviegoing audiences of the 50s didn't care. They just wanted to see big ugly bugs crushing everything in their path and this film certainly delivers in that respect.Taciturn scientist Leo G. Carroll is a man bent on finding a cure for world hunger. He invents a serum which enlarges whatever animal or insect or arachnid it is injected into. Unfortunately when injected into a human it causes acromegalia a disorder marked by progressive enlargement of the head face hands feet and thorax due to the excessive secretion of growth hormone. When one of Leo's human guinea pigs comes looking for revenge he not only destroys the lab and injects the doctor with his own serum but he shatters the glass cage of a puppysized tarantula which quickly scurries out into the night.Enter Mara Corday and John Agar. Mara Corday is the new lab assistant for Leo and John Agar is the country doctor who takes an interest in the dark haired beauty. But there's not much time for romance as the tarantula now roughly the size of the Goodyear blimp begins terrorizing the desert. Farm animals are munched upon and so too are human victims who are found in pools of venom their bodies literally filled with enough poison to kill ten more men besides. Leo G. Carroll slowly turns into the Elephant Man the giant spider peeks through the window at Mara in her nightie and Clint Eastwood shows up at films end to fire napalm at the eight legged menace. Forget about Earth vs. The Spider and whatever you do avoid The Giant Spider Invasion at all costs. This is the definitive Giant Spider film. It's smart and fast and well acted and the spider itself is pretty cool looking considering the fact that no furry robotic arachnids were constructed for this film but instead film footage of a real tarantula was blown up and rear projected. It looks pretty good considering the time. If you liked Them! you'll definitely want to check this one out as well.".

Oh by the way the professor's prediction about population growth was a little off the mark. He predicted that by 2000 the planet would be host to something more than three and a half billion people. It's now 2007 and we are just shy of six billion. The best estimate is that in another 50 years we'll have doubled that figure. Someone place a longdistance call to Thomas Malthus and tell him he was right after all.Well see most of the experimental organisms were destroyed in a fire but one managed to escape.

Clint Eastwood leading a pack of jets demolishes the lumbering creature just as it is about to attack the town of Desert Rock. Well we knew Mara Corday would survive anyway because she was later to appear in Sudden Impact with Clint many years later as a waitress.The movie is made on a low budget and it has no ambitions beyond inspiring fear and wonder at the special effects which look a bit shoddy to today's audiences used to CGIs. It has no lesson to teach us unlike say The Day the Earth Stood Still but its very cheesiness lends it a charm that's lacking in multimilliondollar fx extravaganzas like The War of the Worlds. It's comforting to see a smalltown doctor who makes house calls. The vistas of empty desert enchant the eye. And if the characters are stereotypical well stereotypes exist for a reason. They are fixed points in a changing and unpredictable universe. We sort of like our doctors to be humanists and one of the crowd and we like our professors thoughtful and quirky and the sheriff hardheaded realistic and given to derisive laughter when he hears an implausible tale.There's a scene in which John Agar and Mara Corday are driving in the doc's nifty 1950s Ford convertible through the empty desert and he shares with her his sense of awe at living in a landscape like this. Everything that has ever walked or crawled has left its mark in this desert. . . . She asks him to pull over and stop. They sit on a rock and chat in the middle of this vast void. The scene only lasts a few minutes but for those few minutes we could wish we were part of that couple innocent capable of inspiration still able to look at emptiness and recognize beauty in it. My guess is that the location for this scene is now part of a strip mall and the vacant lots sparkle with bent soda cans and styrofoam.

	schema:headline " This is a classic scifi horror monster flick from the 50's about a giant tarantula that terrorizes a rural desert community.";
	schema:reviewBody "One of my favorite classic scifi horror flicks of all time. My dad and I have watched it probably about 200 times. The somewhat cheesy acting of John agar combined with the more serious tone of Leo g Carroll makes for an awesome satisfying blend. The characters and the plot in itself make for a great watch as a scientist Carroll named professor Deemer is using some kind of serum to grow animals in his lab that have grown well above their usual size and grow at a faster pace. Of course the tarantula is injected with this and escapes as one of Deemer's students who injected himself with it for some reason and is totally mutated fights with Deemer and knocks him out and injects him with the serum then dies. Deemerwakes up and slowly becomes mutated throughout the flick. Of course there is also a love interest between a woman who is staying at Deemer's lab as a student Corday and the main hero Agar who ends up saving her from the tarantula who kills Deemer towards the end by knocking down his house. Many random deaths ensue as the spider wreaks havoc until finally the Air Force comes in and destroys the monster after several attempts including sticks of dynamite are used to try and kill the monster. One aspect of the movie that makes all the more better is that the seemingly evil professor actually is a tragic character who didn't mean for his colleagues to suffer from the serum and didn't want all of this to happen and just wanted to increase growth of animals and food. Overall the plot and acting is great for a movie of this typegenre and of this decade of horror movies and goes down as one of my favorites and one that I would recommend for any people who love classic horrorscifi flicks and are looking for an entertaining watch.".

Clint Eastwood has a small part at the end of the film as the fighter squadron leader. The effects by Clifford Stine are classic and Jack Arnold again proves his worth as directorbefore moving on to the Brady Bunch in the 1960s. Leo Carroll is superb as Professor Deemer who develops a formula for a growth serum. It is this serumwith uses an atomic isotopethat produces rapid growth in all the lab animalsincluding the Tarantula.

	schema:reviewBody "The renowned director Jack Arnold was truly on fire during this period also turning out such favourites as It Came from Outer Space Creature from the Black Lagoon and The Incredible Shrinking Man. This is another solid effort from him and UniversalInternational it's intelligent it's spooky and it builds to a very big finish.The likable John Agar stars as Matt Hastings a doctor in the small town of Desert Rock who discovers that the scientific experiments conducted by Gerald Deemer Leo G. Carroll have had devastating consequences. Out of the best of intentions Deemer and his associates have been fooling with a growth formula intended for use in helping a world with too many people and not enough food. The result is a tarantula that grows to MANY times its normal size and terrorizes the California desert and chows down on any unlucky human or animal that it finds.Films such as Tarantula may not be for all tastes. Admittedly it doesn't have that much great tarantula action but the screenplay by Robert M. Fresco and Martin Berkeley based on a story by Arnold and Fresco is sharp enough interesting enough and sometimes amusing enough to just draw the viewer right in. Arnold parcels the thrills out carefully tantalizing us a bit at a time until the climax when the enormous tarantula is about to reach Desert Rock and the frantic humans are trying to figure out how to destroy it. One of the most intriguing aspects to the screenplay is the effect that the formula has on human beings.The visual effects are quite good for this sort of thing but the makeup by Bud Westmore is no less noteworthy. The cinematography by George Robinson is first rate as is the rousing music score by Herman Stein. The acting is extremely engaging from all concerned with Mara Corday both lovely and appealing as the leading lady who's got brains to match her beauty. The underrated Carroll is one of those actors to whom you want to listen when he speaks he carries that kind of authority. Nestor Paiva has an irresistible presence as the jovial sheriff. And be sure to wait for the brief appearance by a certain gravelly voiced squinty eyed movie legend in one of his earliest feature film roles.This is just plain fun and worth watching if you like this viewer are a big fan of the many genre productions of the 1950s.Eight out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am in in the process of rewatching vintage movies. I find some less than I remembered such as The Thing From Another World which now seems talky and slow. I find others to be better than I remembered. Tarantula is one of these. Tarantula is a superbly crafted B shocker from UniversalInternational back in its science fiction heyday during the fifties. Director Jack Arnold did not have a flashy style but was excellent at building suspense and brings off the terror scenes with panache. The script is intelligent and logical with any holes minor. The special effects are convincing with a real spider blown up to gargantuan proportions. The tarantula scuttles about like the real tarantula it is and this certainly aids in the illusion. The scenes with the skeletal remains of cattle and sheep are still extremely creepy.And the cast does very well. John Agar is the stolid stalwart hero both likable and intelligent. Mara Corday matches him as a graduate student and is strikingly beautiful. Their romance is plausible and less of a drawback than is usual in films of this era. The smaller parts are all convincingly portrayed with Nestor Paiva and Hank Patterson standouts as the sheriff and the town character respectively. A very young Clint Eastwood pops up at the climax as a pilot destroying the monster. Best of all is Leo G Carroll as the scientist whose wellmeaning experiments go sour and lead to all the destruction. One of the top character actors from the thirties through the sixties his lowkey delivery always projecting utter conviction Carroll here firmly grounds all the scientific extrapolations. The concept of creating a nutrient to grow more food or to feed humans directly without food makes sense.The movie is slowly paced during the first half but the speculative script with its touches of poetry about the desert and the subplot of the sudden deaths from acromegalia as well as a couple of subtle creepy appearances by the rapidly growing spider holds the interest until the giant tarantula goes on the rampage during the second half. The scenes of terrified horses and cowering humans filmed from above from a spider's eye view are I think the first use of subjective camera during a monster's attack and presage the use of this technique in later slasher movies. I found the scene in which the two old prospectors are attacked and flee in panic with one obviously near seventy falling again and again with his old friend refusing to leave him behind and returning three times to help him to die with him in the end especially well done and affecting.All in all with Them the best of the big bug movies and a giant tarantula is a hell of a lot scarier than giant ants.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of countless 'big bug' features to come out of the U.S. during the 1950s Jack Arnold's Tarantula is one of the most enjoyable of its kind. After Gordon Douglas' Them! really kicked off the fad in the previous year Tarantula has everything audiences came to love about the genre a dusty middleofnowhere Arizona setting the handsome yet charismafree hero the screeching love interest the shady doctor who certainly knows far more than he is letting on and of course the giant 'terrifying' monster. What makes this film slightly more interesting than others of its ilk is the fact that it doesn't blame radiation on the deformed beast but actually attempts to tell a story.After renowned biological research scientist Eric Jacobs Eddie Parker is found dead in the desert apparently suffering from a rapid form of acromegaly Dr. Matt Hastings John Agar is called in from a nearby town to investigate. When Hastings suggests an autopsy to figure out what brought on such a rare disease and how it killed Jacobs so quickly Dr. Gerald Deemer Leo G. Carroll one of Jacobs' colleagues refuses his request and signs the death certificate himself. Back at Deemer's isolated desert research lab it is revealed that the doctor has been experimenting on animals in a bid to save the future planet's food shortage and has increased the size of a number of his subjects including a tarantula. After a fire destroys Deemer's lab the Arizona landscape is soon overshadowed by the giant hungry arachnid. While a radioactive isotope does crop up at one point the 50 foot spider is purely the handiwork of a scientist with good intentions rather than government nuclear tests and therefore Tarantula creates an interesting and conflicted character in Caroll's Deemer. Caroll certainly chews every scene but proves a far more appealing male lead than the bland Agar. Yet the real star of Tarantula is the creature itself. The combination of matte effects and the use of a real spider which would later be used on The Incredible Shrinking Man 1957 have aged spectacularly well only failing to convince during the brief closeup shots of the last thing a few poor and seemingly blind souls see before they're gobbled up. While the climax is over before you know it there's fun to be had in trying to spot a young and uncredited Clint Eastwood as a fighter pilot. It's no longer scary was it ever? but it has charm by the bucket load.".

The spider is genuinely effective and creepy. Arnold is very underrated as a director he gives the film an eerie quality lacking in most of its contemporaries. Obviously inspired by Them it does not disgrace its source. I liked John Agar's performance I understand Universal Pictures to whom he was under contract kept him in scifi monster movies when his poolmates Rock Hudson and co went on to Stardom. A shame because on this evidence he could have made it too.The script's references to Acromegalia are interesting too. Not least as an unfortunate victim of the disease Rondo Hatton was a wellknown contractplayer on the Universal lot in the 1940s. Makes me wonder if he was the inspiration for this plot point.Also  anyone notice the lift from the Dunwich Horror? The investigators surveying the aftermath of the trail of destruction? My own feeling is that Arnold or somebody involved with the creation of his films was into Lovecraft. Creature From The Black Lagoon appears to be inspired by The Deep Ones. At least to me.All in all highly recommended example of a fifties monster flick.".

	schema:headline " Unsafe Labratory Practices Unleash Giant Monster";
	schema:reviewBody "Most of the 50s monster movies played upon the fears of science out of control with nuclear radiation the usual culprit but some films opted for more daring notions of doom. The fear of science unleashing devastation on humanity in the form of food nutrients must have seemed farfetched back in 1955 but it is quite relevant today as labcreated food products and bioengineering become ever more common. The backstory of this movie starts with a group of 3 scientists experimenting with a potential breakthrough in nutrition. From this interesting premise the research gets crazy in a hurry.Science in 50s B movies....where do you begin? Half the fun of watching these movies is for the the sheer insanity of the scientists not only in their behavior but in their theories. Tarantula features some amazingly oddball science all taken quite seriously of course and gives us a close look at unsafe laboratory practices in action. Here's a sample of some of the funDangerous and unknown drugs are quickly tested on humans and if the scientist is that perfect combination of being both enlightened and foolish he will use himself as the test. Scientists physically fighting in the lab. Did this not get covered in Chemistry 101? Never throw beakers full of unknown chemicals at each other or the lab animals! Handling the serum. The scientists treat an open beaker of the serum as if it is is super deadly but once it is in a syringe they are completely nonchalant. Giant easy to read clipboard charts! But shouldn't they at least record weights and measurements at each injection phase in addition to date? They never seem to realize that they created a growth serum instead of a nutritional serum...pay attention to your hypothesis! Tasting unknown goo from a puddle on the ground. He did not just do that! Yes he did. The hideous mutation of the scientists is really creepy. Also not to be missed as in most of the B monster movies of this era is a little educational film about the giant creature in question in this case tarantulas. In addition to the science fun this movie features a sweet and innocent romance between a newlyarrived lab assistant Stephanie 'Steve' Clayton Mara Corday and the local doctor Matt Hastings John Agar. Mara Corday is one of the more capable B scifi movie women of the 50s. She is not easily dominated by alpha males and she commands respect from men. In most scifi movies of this period the alpha male dominates the female breaking down her professional surface until it cracks and her repressed feminine side reemerges. Marda Corday manages to be fully feminine yet composed and competent. John Agar plays the young confident capable and likable country doctor. Somehow John Agar manages to play a character like this and make him believable and real. Oh yeah there is a giant tarantula too. It rampages around the desert for a while before being killed by jets and napalm. The special effects look okay and the monster is certainly aggressive. Tarantula is a fun movie and one of the top monster movies of the 50s. I love it for the weird science.".

Awful it is indeed but in a manner that is nothing but... awful! I am a huge fan of the gruesome Italian Cannibal flicks that were made around the time most memorably Ruggero Deodato's disturbing masterpiece Cannibal Holocaust. Director Alain Deruelle apparently wanted to cash in on this popular wave of gruesome movies about Cannibals that were mostly ingeniously set in the Amazon Jungle. Cannibal Terror is also set in the jungle. A jungle that is very obviously situated in France that is however. I will not even try to explain the absolutely ridiculous and moronic story the performances are among the worst I have ever seen. In the first half of the movie Deruelle seemingly wanted to enhance the atmosphere by having crickets chirp for about ten minutes. The scenes change but the chirping of the crickets keep monotonously drowning out all other sounds such as the dialogue which is even more annoying than it sounds.The 'Cannibals' in the film are entirely white guys in savage costumes some of them sport beards others are bald and have beerbellies. Apart from being the whitest savages ever seen on film they are also astonishingly wellbehaved as they never seem to leave their territory and their hunger for human flesh apparently concerns bad people only. The score wouldn't be that bad but it nearly always seems terribly out of place. Also the goresequences are quite wellmade and nauseating for a film with such a low budget. Nevertheless it is beyond me why this film landed on Britain's infamous Video Nasty list as nobody could possibly see anything but ridiculousness in this sorry attempt of a film. The moderately disgusting gore cannot save this. The only reason to watch Cannibal Terror is the wish to look at absolute awfulness. AVOID!".

	schema:reviewBody "Ah the wondrous mysteries of late 70'searly 80's Euroexploitation cinema With almost a 100 positive certainty the script of this film was improvised along whilst shooting. Judging by the tone and cheerful atmosphere of the opening sequences it doesn't even look like the creators Alain Deruelle and Julio Tabernero ever intended to make a movie about cannibals but maybe the producers forced them in order to quickly cash in on the gigantic success of contemporary horrorhits like Cannibal Holocaust and Cannibal Ferox. As you probably know everything was possible in the exploitation industry even hiring the notorious smut filmmaker Jess Franco to shoot some additional footage. The film opens with a rhythmic and jolly carnival song introduces several comical characters and a potentially interesting but poorly elaborated kidnappingransom plot. The cannibal tribe and obligatory grossness only kicks in after about 40 minutes and comes across as totally ridiculous. Three amateur thugs one voluptuous woman and two guys randomly decide to abduct the daughter of a wealthy businessman and demand a ransom. When one of their accomplices gets involved in a banal car accident they flee towards the jungle I think the South American and seek shelter in the hut of a friend. Nearby there's a tribe of primitive cannibals but they appear to remain politely within their perimeters. Only when one of the thugs rapes the lady of the house her husband almost literally feeds them to the cannibals. Meanwhile the parents of the kidnapped girl have also arrived in the jungle don't ask me how though but they're good people and hence don't get eaten. Needless to say Cannibal Terror is an incredibly bad film and I honestly can't name one good element apart maybe from the jolly theme song. Sure there's a bit of nasty gore but there's absolutely no prior tension building and the actual munching goes on for far too long. You know you're in trouble when even the gory bits in a movie are dull. The acting performances are atrocious. The lines of the little girl are practically inaudible and I'm pretty sure an adult woman imitating the voice of a child spoke them. The jungle setting is quite hilarious as the film is clearly shot in someone's home garden and the natives are plain white dayplayers. Several of them even have sideburns and sophisticated haircuts. Oh dear".

	schema:reviewBody "For a long time this was mistakenly listed online and in various books as either an alternate title for Jesus Franco's MONDO CANNIBALE aka WHITE CANNIBAL QUEEN or an entirely different Franco film altogether. It was also mistaken for Franco's DEVIL HUNTER because it basically shares an almost identical kidnappersstrandedincannibalcountry premise. However despite being made by the same production company Eurocin around the same time and containing some of the same actors this isn't a Franco film. I'm not sure he even had anything to do with it despite still being listed in the credits here. And speaking of credits as if they aren't confusing enough already the ones in the version I saw list Ilona Kunesova the script supervisor for MONDO CANNIBALE as the screenwriter and Allan W. Steeve as the director. It says here that Allan W. Steeve is an alias for Alain Deruelle yet also lists the films costar Olivier Mathot as well as Spanish actor Julio Prez Tabernero as additional uncredited directors. So who the hell actually did make this thing? I can't really answer that but after watching it I can't blame everyone for wanting to hide behind a pseudonym.A trio of gangsters Roberto Lina and Mario the latter played by Franco movie regular Antonio Mayans decide to kidnap little Florence Annabelle and keep her hostage until her wealthy parents Silvia Solar and Olivier Mathot can come up with the ransom money. To ensure an easy escape the trio decide to drag the little girl across the border into Indian territory to hide out with some guy named Antonio and his muchyounger wife Manuela Pamela Stanford. On the way there their jeep overheats and the female guide is kidnapped by a cannibal tribe dragged off to their village and is then sliced open and eaten. The kidnappers manage to get the jeep running again and make it to Antonio's home. After Antonio leaves Mario ties Manuela to a tree and rapes her. When Antonio returns he ties Mario to a tree and whistles so that a couple of nearby cannibals can come eat him ?! Everyone else flees into the jungle when the parents finally show up looking for their little girl and are picked off one by one by in unexciting ways by the tribe. The end.I don't even know where to start describing how awful this thing is. I can only say that it's consistent in that everything the acting the ridiculous dubbed dialogue the inappropriate score badly edited in stock footage etc. is awful. It also commits the cardinal trash movie sin of being extremely boring. Aside from just two moments of gore which are recycled from the aforementioned WHITE CANNIBAL QUEEN and one scene of nudity provided by Stanford during a hilarious bathing scene where she rapidly tries to scrub her body because she's obviously freezing her ass off outside in the jungle this movie is lacking in anything cannibal movie horror or exploitation fans want to see. The entire grueling first hour consists mostly of people sitting around complaining while the last half hour consists mostly of people walking around in the jungle. Notice I keep putting quotes around jungle. That's because the jungle consists of pine trees a couple of strategicallyplaced ferns gravel roads and a snowcovered mountain backdrop to capture that authentic tropical feel. Even more ridiculous is the cannibal tribe which seems to consist of all ethnicities that they try to hide by painting everyone with multicolored clown makeup. There are Asians Caucasians skinny guys fat guys little boys and hippies with porkchop sideburns yet oddly just one female tribe member to populate the entire village. Even if you're a cannibal movie completist I would think twice about picking this one up.".

The plot follows two wouldbe kidnappers who end up hiding out in a house near the jungle. However when one of them rapes the homeowner's daughter the bunch is left to the nearby cannibals. Cannibal Terror was one of the handful of cannibal films banned by the DPP back in the eighties. Indeed there is some rather nasty gore on display but it's nowhere near as gory as the best films that this genre has to offer and the gore is hardly shocking as the whole production is so badly done. Director Alain Deruelle never manages to impose the jungle atmosphere on his audience and the film feels like merely a rip off of better cannibal films. Needless to say the plot doesn't really go anywhere and the overall effect is really rather dull. Overall I can't recommend this film as the only reason for watching is that it was once banned!

	schema:headline " Not the worst of the genre";
	schema:reviewBody "Now this film is by far not a masterpiece out of the Italian cannibal subgenre but it definitely is not the worst either. The film follows two crooks as they kidnap a young girl and take refuge in the jungle. They stay at a friends house but one of the crooks cant control his urges and rapes the house owners wife. As a result the two crooks are thrown out into the jungles to be eaten by the local cannibals living in the area.Now if you are not a fan of the cannibal genre you will have no interest in watching this film because in all honesty it is not that good. But for you cannibal enthusiasts out there I suggest giving this flick a watch. It is the last film to have come out of the Cannibal Boom and though it has been stated to be the worst film to come out of the genre I ensure you that this is not the case. White Cannibal Queen or Primitif deserve such a title this film on the other hand can be categorized as one of those its so bad its good types. The natives look European the cannibalism scenes go on for too long and is obviously just a pig torso and the dialog is humorous.I would say the greatest element in the film is the dubbing of little girl who is kid napped voice. It is clear that it is just a grown women trying to sound like a child and failing miserably definitely something that keeps you chuckling through out the film.".

The film follows two crooks as they kidnap a young girl and take refuge in the jungle. They stay at a friends house but one of the crooks cant control his urges and rapes the house owners wife. As a result the two crooks are thrown out into the jungles to be eaten by the local cannibals living in the area.Now if you are not a fan of the cannibal genre you will have no interest in watching this film because in all honesty it is not that good.

	schema:reviewBody "Many suspect that this film was directed by Jess Franco because it's very similar to and at least as bad astwo Eurocine films he DID directMondo Cannibale and Sexo Cannibale. The movie in fact was made by some of Franco's cronies at the lowrent French production house Eurocine. One of the directors on record was another Spaniard Julio Tabernero who directed the superior film Sexy Cat but since that film has no cannibals in it it will probably never get the kind of upscale DVD release this oneand the two Franco cannibal filmshave gotten in recent years. There's just no justice in the world.There's no point in rehashing the idiotic plot again. Everything about this is laughably unconvincing from the horribly dubbed dialogue to obviously European cannibals to the jungle setting which was obviously a European zoo. The canned sound effects include one bird who seems to be chirping all the time in every single place in the jungle. The public domain music is imported entirely from Mexico with horrid variations on such standards as La Bamba and La Cucaracha a country not exactly famous for its cannibalistic tribes. If this had been an actual Franco film it would have at least had better music.Francoregular Anthony Mayans has a small role here. Pamela Stanford has a nice nude scene which is literally the ONLY worthwhile scene in the entire movie. Sabrina Siani the heroine of Mondo Cannibal has a a don'tblinkoryou'llmissit cameo which aside from her not being naked is probably her best role ever since she makes no attempt whatsoever to act actually she made no attempt whatsoever to act in Mondo Cannibale either but the horny producers still insisted on casting her as the lead. But I'm obviously really grasping at straws to find ANYTHING nice to say about this. This movie has nowhere near the power of an Italian cannibal flick like Cannibal Holocaust and frankly it barely rises to the level of a bad Jess Franco imitation. Avoid with extreme prejudice.".

As revoltingly interesting as the others are I had to know what the black sheep of the Cannibal subgenre was really like and if its bad reputation was nothing more than a bad reputation.This SpanishFrench obscurity has the reputation as a cheap knockoff just because the gore the cannibals as well as the entire vibe of the movie is completely different not to mention no real jungle to speak of but mainly because of the obvious lack of an Italian director.Alright well that about sums it up. Cannibal Terror is a cheap knockoff of an already misunderstood subgenre but that doesn't mean this movie deserves to be hated. Besides having a swell score and unintentionally humorous dialog there's a little girl who's voice is dubbed by an adult which always goes over well in lowbudget European horror.Let the unfitingly inspirational music begin. Some quaint Euroscenery. Now as the story goes a trio of inept kidnappers who steals the little girl of a rich couple and figure that a fake French Jungle with crickets dubbed in the background would be a suitable place to hide out besides the local cannibals are fake yes they do eat human flesh but it's also very very fakelooking so it's all good.The original plan for collecting a ransom is derailed when one of the kidnappers decides to rape the wife of the guy lending out his place for a hideout. New plan rapist gets tied to a tree near fakecannibal country by angry husband while the other 2 run off into the jungle and suffer perhaps an even worse fate.Ouch!! This film constantly screams Not Italian at the top of its lungs which is the only thing drowning out the fake crickets. If Italian Cannibal icons such as Cannibal Holocaust and Cannibal Ferox is what you're used to then Cannibal Terror will seem like a Cannibal movie from another dimension or perhaps a sick joke posing as something it clearly is not... Or is it?There are subtle qualities in this one that I prefer over the real ones although they are few and far between but I think the biggest problem most fans of the genre would have is the gore quality I've just never seen gore like that before but wow it sure was a hell of a lot regardless of what that stuff actually was.The Cannibals who I swear I heard one of the characters refer to as Indians are plain and simple the worst cannibals ever. Some of them are clearly white some of them have sideburns but in their defense they seem a bit more levelheaded and fair than their authentic counterparts.When watching Cannibal Terror don't compare it to the others compare it to something overrated from Jess Franco and you won't go wrong. Awkward dubbing pointless oneliners unintentional humor an obvious eurovibe and ineptness from all directions is what you should expect. because it's exactly what you're getting.

They take the girl into the jungle to come up with their ransom demands but they end up running into some cannibals.CANNIBAL TERROR is from the studio Eurocine which was probably the cheapest production studio out there. They were always around to try and rip something off or jump on the bandwagon of something that was popular at the time. Obviously this one here was meant to cashin on the Italian cannibal genre that was popular in the late 70s and early 80s but this is without question the worst cannibal movie ever made and arguably one of the worst European horror films ever made.Most awful movies have at least a few entertaining things about them but that's not the case here because this movie is just downright awful from the start and continues to get worse throughout each of its 93 minutes. The movie appears to have been made by people without an inch of talent because there's no logical skills that you can find by watching this film as it really does appear to just be someone moving a camera and making things up as they go along. This jungle appears to be someone's back yard and there are a couple shots where cars can be seen in the background.The cannibals in this film are just poor actors who had to stand around and get Halloween makeup on their face. Even the makeup itself is very poor. Even worse are the special effects which are downright horrid and only appear towards the end of the film. The budget appears to be a few dollars higher than a Happy Meal and this probably accounts for none of the cast members giving a damn about what they're doing. Everything in this movie is just downright awful but the biggest problem is how dull every second is. CANNIBAL TERROR was once on the video nasty list and this is one case where perhaps a film should have been burned.".

	schema:reviewBody "Little Big Soldier is actually an oddcouple road flick set during China's Warring States period. The war drama spiced with the usual Jackie Chan comedy has been Jackie's brainchild for 20 years before finally hitting the big screen. Chan had initially planned to play the role of the young general but having aged since he has to settle for the role of the elderly soldier. Well having seen Jackie as the titular character I have no complaints. He provides the role with its requisite charm and experience that it is so easy to root for him. A refreshing change from nonsensical comedies like The Spy Next Door I may add. Jackie plays an unnamed soldier from the Liang State who survives an ambush by Qin forces that decimates the 2000strong Liang army. The lowly soldier who feigns death rather than fight captures a young Wei general Wang Leehom and plans to 'trade' him for a plot of land as reward. Along the way however captor and captive face a host of mishaps misadventures and plot twists  and they have to team up in order to survive. As Jackie's own project you can be sure of the trademark Jackie stunts and image boosts. Playing a farmer forcibly conscripted into war Jackie's message or ego massage is that war is bad for the people birds and the environment. He throws in lots of slapstick and sometimes the comedy borders on the ridiculous. Still these are forgivable because it is easy to like Jackie's and LeeHom's characters. They have a sparkling screen chemistry that helps us overlook the plotholes and lapses in logic. What's more important is that Little Big Soldier has a nostalgic feel reminding us of Jackie's classics like Drunken Master and Snake In The Eagle's Shadow.

His great chance arrives when he stumbles upon a wounded general from an enemy state and he kidnaps him intending to claim credit for the capture which includes five mu of land and most importantly honorable discharge from the army.Jackie's brainchild which had been stuck in development hell for 20 years it was easy to see the amount of effort put into LBS over the years. The plot is simple but is one that is refreshing and original and the story progresses through witty plot devices and hilarious situations. Chan's various gadgets used for feigning death showcases his trademark slapstick humor which we all have come to know and love. His character alone stands out from the protagonist in most of his other movies. Jackie plays the Old Soldier who is cowardly ever optimistic good natured and only dreamsand sings about getting home. He is a flawed yet lovable figure whose own interests and moral values seem to always come into conflict. He aspires but is never boldly ambitious. He'd hurt people but would never kill someone. Such dynamism in a seemingly simpleminded character is especially rare in an action movie much less a Jackie Chan one where he is so often the flawless good guy. And all this is topped by Chan's excellent performance displaying mischief kindliness and a little bit of villainy all at once. And he doesn't forget to convey important messages about life such as filial piety loyalty and the negative effects of war. Leehom Wang on the other hand delivers a competent performance as the young patriotic and upright general whose ambition and stern personality clashes with the Old Soldier's agenda in every possible way. The two share a remarkable chemistry here and their exchanges a joy to behold.But this film is not without it's weaknesses. While the plot's strength was in its simplicity it threatened to throw the audience off by wearing too thin at times and the lack of major turning points made the movie less engaging than it could have been. The humor was there but not hardhitting enough and too many of them die off very quickly without followups. The action scenes are adequate despite being slightly less ambitious than those in Jackie's other films both in complexity and in quantity.Despite these fans of JC will not be disappointed by this outing of his. This is easily one of Jackie's best films in the past ten years and carries an excellent and most importantly original storyline. Not a masterpiece but like what the Old Soldier would say Ting Hao De.That meant Pretty good.".

	schema:reviewBody "In ancient China after a big ambush in a war a soldier having faked his death Jackie Chan takes captive a general of the opposing camp and tries to get him back to his homeland for a reward. Little Big Soldier is kinda like a buddy movie or more accurately an oddcouple road trip except that the characters are really enemies. Jackie Chan is virtually unrecognizable I mean that I didn't think Jackie Chan all the time while watching except for his bumbling yet effective fighting style or avoiding hits nonfighting style and ingenious battle choreography. Despite what the somewhat lame title might imply do not expect epic battles between armies you'll get oneonone fights and skirmishes between small groups focusing on individual battles. Jackie plays a more complex character than usual and even has some choice quiet and dramatic moments. The soldier is also quite likable made more endearing by Chan's charismatic performance. Plus it turns out that he sings so good I thought it was someone else but it wasn't! The general was stoic and honorable  a good straight man. The funny moments were amusing and the audience laughed a lot was a full crowd at the Montreal Fantasia Festival that focuses on genre films. Humor is mostly of the absurd situation or physical slapstick type. The fight scenes were exciting and fast yet easy to follow American action directors take note. There were a few shifts in tones between comedy and drama especially one near the end that worked surprisingly well. I didn't like the kind of washedout pale colors throughout but as a few vivid sequences with brighter colors suggest it was a stylistic choice. I found that underneath the hope for a better future theme there was a sense of melancholy and sadness. I think this contributed along with the historical background to make Little Big Soldier deeper than the usual Jackie Chan comedy. I can understand after watching it why this project was so dear to his heart.Rating  7.5 out of 10".

	onyx:emotionText "In ancient China after a big ambush in a war a soldier having faked his death Jackie Chan takes captive a general of the opposing camp and tries to get him back to his homeland for a reward. Little Big Soldier is kinda like a buddy movie or more accurately an oddcouple road trip except that the characters are really enemies. Jackie Chan is virtually unrecognizable I mean that I didn't think Jackie Chan all the time while watching except for his bumbling yet effective fighting style or avoiding hits nonfighting style and ingenious battle choreography. Despite what the somewhat lame title might imply do not expect epic battles between armies you'll get oneonone fights and skirmishes between small groups focusing on individual battles. Jackie plays a more complex character than usual and even has some choice quiet and dramatic moments. The soldier is also quite likable made more endearing by Chan's charismatic performance. Plus it turns out that he sings so good I thought it was someone else but it wasn't! The general was stoic and honorable  a good straight man. The funny moments were amusing and the audience laughed a lot was a full crowd at the Montreal Fantasia Festival that focuses on genre films. Humor is mostly of the absurd situation or physical slapstick type. The fight scenes were exciting and fast yet easy to follow American action directors take note.

	schema:reviewBody "One of the most enjoyable Jackie Chan's movies in the last decade...While there has always been a question or dilemma about Jackie Chan's dramatic range or even his laughable claim of wanting to become the next Robert DeNiro. Opportunities were there to take with films like New Police Story and Shinjuku Incident. However his performance as a drunken cop was met with critical despite and his wooden display in the againsttype serious persona was met with similar discontent. So it is refreshing to see Chan back to what he is good at physical comedy. This does not necessary mean more action as Chan rarely fights or even if he does he is simply avoiding fights. What is means is that Chan is trying to be funny and the audience also finds it funny as well. Not unlike Jet Li who have now successfully transformed from action icon into an actor with his own acclaimed role in Warlords. Little Big Soldier is hopefully what you call a breakthrough performance and perhaps a step in the right direction for the aging Chan to take.The movie goes like this Chan is an old soldier who pretends to be dead on the battlefield. He avoids fights and by playing dead he managed to survive a battle where everyone dies. Going by luck he somehow managed to capture the enemy army general. From there the two roam across the oceans and the seas encountering everything along the way.It is a delight to witness Mr. Chan in full flight. Rarely do we see this side of Jackie and somehow we never doubted at the back of our mind. Whereas Chan usually plays one dimensional characters as a cop spy agent cop and cop. Chan is given a character and by the end of the movie I felt that Chan have succeeded in bringing the character of the old soldier back to life. This is not an understatement but rather a real sense of achievement. That's not to say Chan have created something special. Perhaps it serves as either a breakthrough or even a successful change in the right direction. There are moments in the film where the audience laugh with Chan escape with Chan and ultimately feel for Chan. Now that's something is that unheard of and missing for the last 40 years of this great man career? LeeHom Wang last seen in Ang Lee's Lust Caution delivers a wooden yet cool performance. While he was somewhat miscast and lost in Lust Caution. Here he is very much in control of what he is doing. Perhaps knowing his limited range and his ability to be cool Lee flairs far better in this role as the future heir. His chemistry with Chan is both fun and delightful to watch. There is a fight scene by the river banks which is fun enough for someone to enjoy.All in all Little Big Soldier is what you call a little successful story. It is a light hearted movie that is surprisingly engaging. With Jackie Chan in one of his best character roles Little Big Soldier is best served after dinner. Surely action fans may be somewhat disappointed in the lack of action but true Chan fans will know and understand that Chan have finally fulfilled a lifelong dream. To be recognised as an actor and more importantly coming out of the movie as a character rather than his larger than life public persona  Jackie Chan. I wouldn't go to say that Little Big Soldier will be everyone cup of tea but for anyone who have followed Chan throughout all these years I am certain that like Chan you too will be proud...Neo 2010I rate it 810www.thehkneo.com".

Sometimes the movies are great other times they are quite terrible and sometimes he just makes it land somewhere in between. I can say honestly that this movie is one of the movies you will want to place on the top shelf of your movie collection. Its old fashioned wonderfully comical at times and tells a story of a small part of a large history of China.People say that Jackie Chan's acting is hollow. While I agree that this can sometimes be the case its only because of the terrible Hollywood machine movies he is inclined to make versus the traditional Hong Kong actiondramacomedy flicks he is used to. Hollywood Jackie Chan can be quite terrible The Tuxedo The Medallion Around the World in 80 Days The Spy Next Door etc. Traditional Jackie Chan is great New Police Story RobBHood Who Am I? along with all the Hong Kong classics Jackie Chan has under his belt like Drunken Master Police Story City Hunter I'm rather frustrated at the implication that Jackie Chan cannot act and that this or The Karate Kid are trumpeting his newfound skills as an actor when in my opinion he has been a superb actor far before that. Just watch New Police Story.In any case this was an excellent watch and has earned itself a spot on the top shelf of my collection. Hopefully there will be an English dub sometime in the future so that more people will be able to watch this fine film.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Little Big Soldier";
	schema:reviewBody "Little Big Soldier continues to reinforce a point that while one can afford to forgo Jackie Chan's rather dismal outing in any Hollywood flicks of late his Asian films are a totally different story altogether. JC was said to have this story brewing for some two decades now and initially his plan was to play the Big General himself but good advice and probably with more confidence in his dramatic acting ability meant he takes on the Little Soldier role and went with Wang Leehom for the other.Maybe I'm crediting him too much since he came up with the story but here's a film that would probably not work without JC taking on one of the characters with the Little Soldier seem tailor made for him at this stage of his career no longer needing to be the hero but ever willing to be part of the underdogs which Hollywood still frowns upon hey he's JC he has to be a top notch copspysecret agentetc as compared to everyday working man roles like that in Shinjuku Incident RobBHood and as a cowardly soldier whose self preservation instinct kicks into overdrive all the time.Set prior to the unification of China by the Qin dynasty the film opens with what seemed like a total annihilation in the battlefield between Wei and Liang troops only to find Liang's Little Soldier being able to capture Wei's super Big General Leehom only because the latter is severely injured. With the promise of plenty of land for the live capture of an enemy general Little Soldier makes it a point to cart Big General back to his country at all costs so that he can settle down with new found wealth coupled with an exemption from having to serve in the army. But of course Big General comes with a lot of baggage in knowing that his kindred had betrayed him and his elite troops in a battle and are after him to ensure that he stays dead.So lies the gist of the story which to say anymore would be to spoil the fun and the depth of the story's development. Suffice to say JC's story contains enough to make you feel for the two lead characters where their natural adversary would pave the way to inevitable friendship being forged by way of encountering and overcoming painful obstacles and challenges posed along the way as the adage goes two is better than one. JC too plays his character so well that you can't help but to endear to his multiple gimmicky toys he employs to survive in battles plus the sheer luck and street smarts he has to rely on to get out of sticky situations. I'm not much of a Leehom fan but he managed to pull of his role as the stoic general with aplomb and shares some fine chemistry with JC believable that these guys would be friends should they not be from different lands.But the strength of the film comes from how the two characters contrast with and how they rub off their respective ideals on each other. The Little Soldier aspires to lead a simple life of farming to go back to his roots of a simple life reminiscing upon his father's wise words where rich means a plot of land to farm two cows and a wife. Fighting in battles is not his cup of tea and he'll do anything just to ensure that he comes out unscathed even if it means being branded as a cowardly deserter. On the other hand Big General aspires to conquer lands and if inevitable to die gloriously in battle. Soon enough he learns how having small but fulfilling meaningful aspirations would be miles better than material wealth of the joys that a simple peaceful life can bring compared to one of constant fights. For the Small Soldier lessons in the virtues of honour and courage get imparted which leads to an especially touching and poignant finale.Serving as action director. JC keeps all the fight sequences here fresh. You know how it is with action flicks when one battle scene doesn't offer anything new from the one that preceded it JC had done something right in the fight choreography department. There are enough moments here to showcase straight forward fighting sequences and those of his signature acrobatic buffoonery to suit the role of his Little Soldier to a T. Watch out too for his hilarious gimmicks employed which will surely bring out a chuckle or two which only JC can deliver in a true blue JC film.It's been some time since JC had a major project rolled out every Lunar New Year and this one comes just in time to perhaps continue in that tradition. If it's anything to go by this film has surpassed expectations set low thanks to a lacklustre trailer and thankfully the end product is confirmed to be miles better. He may be slower these days but Little Big Soldier demonstrates that JC still has what it takes to deliver a Chinese blockbuster. As with almost all JC movies sit back during the end credits roll to enjoy the many outtakes included.".

	schema:reviewBody "Flawed masterpiece from Jackie Chan has him giving an Oscar worthy performance that coupled with Karate Kid and the Shinjuku Incident should put Chan on the fast track to serious actor status in Hollywood.The film has Chan as a foot soldier finding a wounded but still living general in the bodies left after a large battle. Knowing that the general could gain him land and a way out of military service if he brings him home a captive Chan hauls him down the road. However as circumstance warlords and some of the generals own men pursue them a friendship of sort forms.Stunning fight scenes and fantastic performances come together to form one of Jackie Chan's best films ever. You can pretty much flush his Hollywood films when you compare them to this little gem. And while I know I've loved some of Chan's recent films from China there is something so solid in this to make you feel as though it was from a different filmmaker. This is a film that makes you sit up and reevaluate Chan as an actor and filmmaker. He hasn't raised the bar he kicked it into orbit Long in gestation this film was originally intended to have Jackie play the young general but time and tide have conspired to give him one of his best roles ever. Funny touching and wise Jackie hits every emotion letter perfect and when the end comes I think you'll be hard pressed not to be moved deeply by what transpires.There is so much to love I can't not recommend the film highly enough.In fairness I do have to warn you that the film isn't perfect. At times there is a battle between being light and serious that doesn't quite work. The film also meanders a bit in the wilderness at the start as if they are trying to fill in a couple of minutes in running time.Ultimately though my quibbles are minor and this is a grand return to form nay reinvention of Jackie Chan.One of the great finds of 2010.".

The film also meanders a bit in the wilderness at the start as if they are trying to fill in a couple of minutes in running time.Ultimately though my quibbles are minor and this is a grand return to form nay reinvention of Jackie Chan.One of the great finds of 2010.";

	schema:reviewBody "Another goal by Jackie Chan. Not only does this movie deliver the usual martial arts extravaganza that is trademark of his movies but it also delivers a really interesting story that is not just slackstick humor. And that is a really great trait to the movie and a great step towards the right approach for a movie of this type.The story is about a peasant soldier in the Liang army played by Jackie Chan who saves himself from slaughter in a massive battle by feigning his death. As luck would have it he manages to find a surviving general of the Wei army played by Leehom Wang the soldier seems to have it made as he can hand in his captive for land and profit. But the road back to Liang is long and treacherous  the king's men are out searching for the missing general and the land is not at all a friendly place in itself.A great story that Jackie Chan came up with here and it has been masterfully put to the screen. The story offers great action and just the right amount of comedy without it becoming too much in the usual genre that Jackie Chan operates.What really makes Little Big Soldier work out is the chemistry and dialogue between the soldier and the general on their hard and long trek back towards Liang. And the spectacular landscape and scenery really adds a lot of flavor to the movie and it is like you are right there back in time in ancient China.This is one of the better Jackie Chan movies in the recent years and it is great to see him take on other roles this late in his career. Little Big Soldier is well worthy of a place in the DVD collection of any fans of Jackie Chan or of Asian ancient war history movies in general.".

Jackie Chan plays a farmer who was drafted into his kingdom's army. He is the last surviving member of his family and wants nothing more than to return to the land and raise a family. He survives a horrible battle and captures the enemy general. If he can get the general back to the capital he can get five acres of land as a reward and become a farmer again. It is one of Jackie Chan's best performances but don't go expecting Shanghai Knights. Beautifully photographed with a compelling story line it is in the end a melancholy film.".

And despite a nondescript trailer lacking in any visualaction eyecandy and lukewarm previews from critics who didn't know what to expect audience wordofmouth has slowly but surely carried the movie to boxoffice success.Based on Jackie's concept for a wartime frenemy roadmovie this is the closest he has ever come to making an Indie comedy where the communication of the storyconcept always takes precedence over the presentation of visualaction setpieces. There is no doubt that Jackie's effortless acting and antics carried the film but it is also sensibly supported by a storyscript from the newcomer directorcumwriter Ding Sheng who knew how to flesh out the concept  so earn his place as director by adopting the setting of China's Warring States era.As a TV commercialturnedmovie director Ding Sheng instinctively trusted himself  the audience to get a pointbeat within a preciselyframed 3second shot instead of those wide sweeping or lingering shots donetodeath by cinematographers or MTVproducers turned directors making much of the foreshadowing and reveals strangely subtle for an actioncomedy. So much so that some critics will inevitably lose the plot... because true to the roadmovie convention there are many popup cameoroles whose appearanceplotlines are NOT explained except maybe with a 3second shot or a oneliner all of whom are inconsequential on their own but serve to add spice as well as depth to the storycharacters.Not to mention that readers of subtitles might also miss the bits of cultural referencessymbolism littered throughout the film... like the irony of a royalty who quotes classical poetry from memory but doesn't know the plant from which rice is grown or the fact that calling someone a little person is one of the oldestgravest insults in Chinese culture.The hodgepodge of characters and plotpoints sounds like a recipe for disaster but the lowtech animation of some openingtitles and a flurry of short openingscenes quickly and firmly sets the tone for a lighthearted fablesatire of a dark age so much so that the apparently rambling dialog and wildly varying accents including one unintelligible language seemed quite natural to it. In fact a result of this movie following the actioninserviceofstorycharacter principle was that I frequently wanted to get past the action sequences and get on the storydialog a prequelsequel would be nice... so here is an advanced warning with spoilers don't watch this movie if you don't want to see Jackie Chan as...SPOILERS START SPOILERS...a brazen coward who can't fight to save his own life.

So much so that the whole theater burst out laughing even as his character breaks down for the only time in the movie because it was just such a commonbanal result of war. In fact there wasn't a single gag or joke that didn't add a little more to the storycharacters so another thumbsup for applying the gagsinserviceofstorycharacter principle.And the turnabout ending of the movie is just icing on the cake being gently foreshadowed it is pretty obvious that this is a message movie it provides even more food for thought... and brings to fore the existential question faced by the Little Big Soldier to live in peace or die with dignity? But whether you agree with the endingchoice of the Little Big Soldier the outtakes presented during the endcredits a feature of most Jackie Chan movies are there to help you deconstruct the movie with further hilarity and no one in my theater even tried to leave until we were sure that the endcredits were absolutely over.SPOILERS END SPOILERSThere isn't anything revolutionary in Little Big Soldier except maybe personally for Jackie Chan as well as the novicesnewcomers involved but thanks heavens that the current generation of ChineseHK directors is not asking audiences to condone shaky storytelling for the sake of some shiny setpieces like Hollywoodwannabes Zhang Yimou John Woo etc..

	schema:headline " The sparrow that will be a phoenix !";
	schema:reviewBody "Let's see what we have here  a buddy comedy an action adventure a road movie a historical war movie a story about a little soldier who turns big and a meaning about the necessity of peace. Just WAW. Pure WAW !The greatest thing about this movie is being solid and entertaining while delivering a substance as well. The genre movie always and maybe forever is described as a way to make you enjoy however I believe that with the right hands it can make you think as well. This is perfection in my book. And this movie beautifully did it.The storyline of that old clumsy and kindhearted foot soldier fascinates me. He's originally a poor farmer who dreams of having money land kids and respect though his dreams turn usually into nightmares. Someday he found himself in conscription during a long war hoping to get out of it unharmed so he avoided fighting to the extent of feigning death while the battles. But he got through the journey which proved that he could be a hero as a soldier and human being even if he eventually had none of his dreams fulfilled. I loved the way of transforming into the very general he saw dying at the start to end up exactly like him dying with his flag up. I loved how he trades 10 years of peace for his captive's life. I loved his wisecracking lines and dad's sayings. And I loved how Jackie Chan surprisingly didn't play him as Jackie Chan the martial arts expert and the competent fighting machine.The endless problems that the 2 leads get into during the difficult road made worthy action comedy. Yet the drama of them as fromhaterstolovers then the conflict of the title character to be brave and successful added to the conflict of the second character the general of Wei with his own brotherall enriched the movie to be such a delight satisfaction on many levels.Did you notice smart touches along the way like how the 2 leads have no names or the consecutive dreams of the foot soldier which are colored with darkness and predict his final fate or Lin Peng as the singer who sings for peace and life or a sorrowful line such as Sorry dad I will never have children. when the soldier is dying or even how that character loses his fortune  the gold of the Wei general as if to assure that he has nothing at the end but himself and his proved success. Ahh this is more than enjoyable and makes this movie suitable to be watched for more than once. I bet within a few years Hollywood will remake it in let's say a western movie just remember that you heard it firstly here ! I was astonished when knew that Jackie Chan wrote it at first I guessed it needed at least a professional playwright to master !. Undoubtedly this is the best of Chan ever as a writer. Directer Ding Sheng made an impressive world of a movie where all the aforementioned genres were very well served. Leehom Wang was keen as the little general. And the cinematography did something to be proud of. Aside from picturing the exotic backgrounds mostly ravishingly it sometimes mounted the character to raising skies to be like abstract symbols in a folk story.Now to the problems. I thought that the pace of the second half was more fast less sane than the first half. The final battle was sure less powerful than the one before it where Chan rode a bull to break a wall. The matter of the general's brother killing himself to save his brother was melodramatic and forced. At times I got the feeling of more than enough action and not enough drama. And it was wrong to have the bloopers right after the tragic ending for one reason it somehow weakened the serious effect of the movie's end and for another it was like compulsory Jackie Chan move which while belonging to and fitting more his pure action comediesrepresented sort of dissonance this round. This is unique Jackie Chan movie. Enough to recall that he isn't the usual Jackie Chan in it however succeeds. And as a genre movie it reaches really high top that not a lot of genre movies can reach. It is more like its own metaphor about the little soldier who could be big a sparrow that could be a phoenix.".

	onyx:emotionText "Let's see what we have here  a buddy comedy an action adventure a road movie a historical war movie a story about a little soldier who turns big and a meaning about the necessity of peace. Just WAW. Pure WAW !The greatest thing about this movie is being solid and entertaining while delivering a substance as well. The genre movie always and maybe forever is described as a way to make you enjoy however I believe that with the right hands it can make you think as well. This is perfection in my book. And this movie beautifully did it.The storyline of that old clumsy and kindhearted foot soldier fascinates me. He's originally a poor farmer who dreams of having money land kids and respect though his dreams turn usually into nightmares. Someday he found himself in conscription during a long war hoping to get out of it unharmed so he avoided fighting to the extent of feigning death while the battles. But he got through the journey which proved that he could be a hero as a soldier and human being even if he eventually had none of his dreams fulfilled. I loved the way of transforming into the very general he saw dying at the start to end up exactly like him dying with his flag up. I loved how he trades 10 years of peace for his captive's life. I loved his wisecracking lines and dad's sayings. And I loved how Jackie Chan surprisingly didn't play him as Jackie Chan the martial arts expert and the competent fighting machine.The endless problems that the 2 leads get into during the difficult road made worthy action comedy. Yet the drama of them as fromhaterstolovers then the conflict of the title character to be brave and successful added to the conflict of the second character the general of Wei with his own brotherall enriched the movie to be such a delight satisfaction on many levels.Did you notice smart touches along the way like how the 2 leads have no names or the consecutive dreams of the foot soldier which are colored with darkness and predict his final fate or Lin Peng as the singer who sings for peace and life or a sorrowful line such as Sorry dad I will never have children. when the soldier is dying or even how that character loses his fortune  the gold of the Wei general as if to assure that he has nothing at the end but himself and his proved success. Ahh this is more than enjoyable and makes this movie suitable to be watched for more than once. I bet within a few years Hollywood will remake it in let's say a western movie just remember that you heard it firstly here ! I was astonished when knew that Jackie Chan wrote it at first I guessed it needed at least a professional playwright to master !. Undoubtedly this is the best of Chan ever as a writer. Directer Ding Sheng made an impressive world of a movie where all the aforementioned genres were very well served. Leehom Wang was keen as the little general. And the cinematography did something to be proud of. Aside from picturing the exotic backgrounds mostly ravishingly it sometimes mounted the character to raising skies to be like abstract symbols in a folk story.Now to the problems. I thought that the pace of the second half was more fast less sane than the first half. The final battle was sure less powerful than the one before it where Chan rode a bull to break a wall. The matter of the general's brother killing himself to save his brother was melodramatic and forced. At times I got the feeling of more than enough action and not enough drama. And it was wrong to have the bloopers right after the tragic ending for one reason it somehow weakened the serious effect of the movie's end and for another it was like compulsory Jackie Chan move which while belonging to and fitting more his pure action comediesrepresented sort of dissonance this round. This is unique Jackie Chan movie. Enough to recall that he isn't the usual Jackie Chan in it however succeeds. And as a genre movie it reaches really high top that not a lot of genre movies can reach. It is more like its own metaphor about the little soldier who could be big a sparrow that could be a phoenix.";

This is a straight up film with real characters that thankfully stays in one era and sticks there.Jackie is the lone survivor in a particularly bloody battle that sees many of his fellow soldiers from Liang dead. Once he realizes that there is another survivor and that he is an enemy General he concocts a plan. Captured Generals are very sought after by Liang soldiers in fact by providing a live one JC expects to be showered with rewards namely his own farm and land and exemption from military service.The problem becomes getting the General to safety where he might collect his prize as the General is very resourceful and dogged in his efforts to escape. This is only exacerbated when JC uses his abilities to heal the General's wounds meaning he is even better equipped to provide resistance. Furthermore the General is simultaneously being tracked by his own men who would free him and bandits who would just as soon kill him so JC has set himself lofty goals.Seemingly immune to all around him JC is eternally cheery and optimistic everything around him is described as How Marvelous and he never misses an opportunity to either sing about or talk about his previous hometown of Liang. So determined is he to carry out his plan that after a woman dupes JC and takes his transport he simply drags and then carries the General along for many miles nearer and nearer to his prize. It appears that all JC wants is out of the army and peace for himself and Liang. The General however wants honour and war is all he knows. JC never seems to think too hard about why it seems EVERYONE is out to get this particular General  This is a real change of pace for Jackie aside from the dubious facial hair his character seems more adept at fleeing than fighting his best defense is deemed to run he's a good shot with a rock though.As the duo move towards the conclusion they bond together and find some common ground even though they are from different worlds and have entirely different ambitions the General escapes more than once and both are captured at times but circumstances have a way so that they find each other once more.97 of Little Big Soldier is quite light and breezy the battles aren't too vicious and the dialogue quite refreshing and reasonable entertaining the other 3 you'll have to see for yourself.This is not a Jackie Chan flick though the martial arts action is kept to a minimum and usually Jackie isn't part of it anyway and the stunts and narrow escapes aren't the normal Jackie Chan stunts and escapes. This is simply a well made movie that tells a good story and the ending packs more of a punch than the first 80 minutes suggest.Final Rating  7.5  10. Not a Big Jackie Chan actioner filled with chopsocky and stunts but also not a Little movie either. Jackie's best film since Shangahi Knights  Rush Hour 2 and his best drama since Crime Story.".

Little Big Soldier is a refreshing comedy action adventure in which Jackie's performance is better than any of his latest movies. Even though he's a bad ass kungfu fighting farmer he appears to be a coward which later on proves to be otherwise. His humor is not as immature as before I even felt like it came from his roots. The Chinese have proved themselves to be witty before and Jackie really portrays that in this title. It really shows you how the Chinese history was how the people thought and acted and adds a big pile of good comedy on top of it. I enjoyed it more than expected and especially liked the twist at the end. I did not for one minute mind that this movie was in Chinese. Actually I enjoyed not watching Jackie suffer with his English even though it tends to be funny. This movie really deserves a larger audience than I believe it gets but I guess not everyone is ready to watch a Chinese movie. Loved it and I would love to see more of this kinds of movies from Jackie.".

There are only two survivors a lowly Liang soldier who survived by playing dead and a princely general on the Wei side. The former takes the latter captive with the intention of taking him home for the reward. The journey back to Liang won't be an easy one the general's younger brother is searching for him and there are plenty of other unfriendly characters they will have to pass not to mention a bear! At first the two don't get on but as they travel and fight various foes a friendship develops.Given that this film not only stars Jackie Chan but was also written by him it isn't surprising that there is lots of slightly slapstick action and plenty of laughs. He does a fine job as the lowly soldier and is ably supported by Leehom Wang as the general they work well together especially during the impressively choreographed fights. There are plenty of these fights and they are nicely varied in style. It isn't all fighting though there is a decent amount of conversation between the two protagonists that allows the characters to develop nicely as well as being amusing. The story moves at a good pace and even though it is only an hour and a half long it doesn't feel rushed. Without going into too much detail the finale comes as quite a surprise and is far sadder than one would expect from this sort of film it is effective though. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of Chinese cinema in general or of Jackie Chan in particular.".

As it so happens Jackie Chan is a soldier who was drafted to serve in the army of Liang. Having had two brothers who had already been killed in war he felt compelled to avoid risk as much as possible in order to carry on the family name. So during a great battle between the armies of Liang and Wei he feigns death in order to survive. When he finally decides to look around he discovers that everybody on both sides have perished except for one particular enemy general played by Leehom Wang who he immediately takes prisoner with the expectation of receiving a handsome reward for delivering him to his superiors in Liang. Unfortunately there are hazards in store for both of them as they make their way from the battlefield to their destination. Now rather than reveal any more and risk spoiling this picture for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this film had an ebb and flow that was most unusual and not at all typical of most Jackie Chan movies. Naturally there were quite a few scenes involving martial arts action along with the usual stunts and comedy that usually accompany them. In short although I don't consider this to be an outstanding movie by any means it was still a fairly decent film and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.".

For Hiroko Watanabe the passing of two years has not lessened the pain brought on by the death of her young fianc Itsuki Fujii Takashi Kashiwabara in a mountain climbing accident. She longs for healing but is unable to let go of his sudden death. Fate intervenes however and a single letter she writes to her deceased lover as a whim sets in motion a chain of events that allows her to discover the untold secrets of their connection. Written and directed by Shunji Iwai and based on his novel of the same name Love Letter is a simple but very moving love story about two people who must redeem the past in order to be fully alive in the present.While looking through her fianc's old school yearbook after the memorial ceremony Hiroko wants to find something of Itsuki that she can hold onto some token that will allow her to let go. Finding his name in the yearbook she jots down the address associated with the name Itsuki Fujii and mails a short letter addressed to him in Otaro in northern Japan. She asks How are you? and tells him I am fine. Thinking that she is sending a letter to heaven she is supported by Akiba Etsushi Toyokawa a close friend of Itsuki who has fallen in love with her and strongly wants her to complete the past. To her surprise she receives a reply and after the exchange of several letters discovers that her correspondent is not a disembodied spirit but a very alive woman with the same exact name as her fianc. Even more astonishing is that both male and female Itsuki Fujiis were classmates together in Junior High School.While there is some initial confusion stemming from the fat that both Hiroko and the female Itsuki are performed by the superb Miho Nakayama in a dual role each character's personality is so individual that any confusion is soon dispelled. As the letters continue Itsuki uncovers some hidden truths about herself her father's death and her relationship with the shy student with the same name. Bringing to light memories from the past that she had long buried she remembers how they were teased by fellow classmates for having the same name how they developed a bond while working together in the library and how the male Itsuki checking out books from the library wrote his name on five checkout cards saying to her in English straight flush.Sensing that Hiroko's quest for completion has reached a dead end Akiba takes her on a trip to Otaru to meet the female Itsuki and to search for some memento of her fianc. In a memorable scene in which in the words of author Marion Woodman the eternal crosses the transitory Hiroko cries out to the mountain that holds the body of her lost love Ogenki desu ka? Watashi wa genki desu How are you? I am fine and the words echo through the winter night to be repeated by the female Itsuki sitting in her home miles away.Love Letter is a film of exquisite cinematic poetry that explores the subjectivity of memory and the idea of redemption. Author Robertson Davies says One always learns one's mystery at the price of one's innocence Like gemstones of coral and quartz that fill our life with joy Itsuki Fujii came into the lives of two young women then as suddenly as he appeared he was gone yet now both Hiroko and the female Itsuki have established a strange connection and are in the words of Elizabeth Lesser no longer dead but alive with something luminous and solid burning in their core.".

The music and the very atmosphere of the movie is somewhat Japanese it has something really distant and beautiful. In movie which deals with love always good sign is that if it does have very few or none scenes where love is physical such as kissing or making love. This movie shows love as somewhat ideal very mindfull and platonic. Works for me for you I don't know. Really beautiful movie what I can recommen to everyone.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm still trying to decide whether SWALLOWTAIL BUTTERFLY is the greatest movie ever made or not. If it were the greatest movie of all time you'd think it would be a bit better known surely? But I really can't think of any movie I've ever seen that was better. This is obviously something of a difficult position for Shunji Iwai to find himself in in relation to me. If the first movie of his that I saw was the greatest movie ever then surely no matter what efforts he goes to he's never really going to impress me again. Knowing that SWALLOWTAIL BUTTERFLY is very different to the rest of his filmography in terms of themes and sheer scale of the production I was quite apprehensive about paddling deeper into Shunji Iwai waters. The rest of his movies don'tdidn't really sound like my sort of thing.LOVE LETTER is based on a strange premise of unlikely coincidence. Two years after his death Itsuki Fujii's fiance Hiroko Miho Nakayama is still having a hard time moving on with her life. When she comes across his old address in his high school yearbook Fujii's mother tells her that the house was demolished for a highway years ago. Hiroko hence figures that it is safe to send a letter there seeking closure. Itsuki Fujii O' Genki desu ka? she writes. Genki Desu Hiroko Watanabe. How are you I am well Not the most heartfelt expression of mourning it must be said. Still it makes her feel better... but when she receives a reply to the letter she is a little confused. Mostly well... but I have a cold now. Itsuki Fujii Is it a letter from heaven? She would like to believe it is. The viewer however knows that the reply is actually from a different Itsuki Fujii  a woman Miho Nakayama who lives in the same town where Hiroko's fiance grew up. Once the confusion is eventually cleared up Hiroko and Itsuki begin to write to each other as penpals. It turns out that Itsuki Fujii female was in the same class as Itsuki Fujii male so she tells Hiroko stories and memories from her youth. The attentive amongst you may have noticed that Miho Nakayama is credited twice above. No it's not an even more unlikely samename coincidence. The same actress plays both Hiroko and Itsuki... I suppose it worked out cheaper that way. The movie is hence hinged heavily upon her performances as most of the 115 minutes is filled with her either writing or reading letters tofrom herself. Thankfully she is absolutely fantastic in both roles. I think I would have cast her as all the other characters too if I were directing. Thankfully Shunji Iwai is more sensible than me and kept it to a more manageable 2 parts. A movie about 2 people writing letters to each other sounds kind of boring right? The movie is filled with such gorgeous music and imagery that it never gets at all boring though and Miho Nakayama has such a beautiful voice and face for that matter that I could happily listen to her talk for a very long time. It's not all letter writing though  we also get invited in to see all the little details of both women's lives and through flashbacks we see quite a bit of the two Itsukis' youth as well the young actor  actress playing these roles are also very good. You probably gathered by now that I enjoyed the movie... a lot in fact. It is an absolutely beautifully crafted piece of cinema in every aspect and utterly fascinating and beautiful to watch. It's a slow movie... at nearly 2 hours it could maybe have benefited from the tiniest bit of editing perhaps... but an incredibly powerful one. I have to admit that it left me in tears when it finished and I doubt if there are a dozen other movies that have ever had that effect on me. There is no doubt in my mind that Shunji Iwai is a god of modern cinema. His movies are so well crafted it's almost like he's ripping his talent out of his body and shoving it right up in your face... but not quite so disturbing as that would be. Kurosawa Kubrick Iwai... not sounding incongrous to me at the moment.  All demonstrate a transcendent understanding of film as a medium and make almost every other film maker out there look like an amateur!".

She calls the letter to heaven. Unexpectedly she get reply. Of course she feels so weird and decides to visit the town. Finally she finds the girl who sent the letter.

In the end female Itsuki Fujii understand his love she receives a bookborrow card and see her drawing painted by male Itsuki Fujii. But everything's gone. I heard of a number of girls ask their boyfriends do you really love me or just love somebody else looks like me when they leave cinema. It's surely a joke. The movie tells a very tragic story but still beautiful. I saw the aesthetic sensibility just belongs to oriental. The story moves not very fast but I can taste an implicit feeling no sexuality no action scene no drugs even no kiss. Do you believe a Hollywoodized love story could be without all these elements my answer is absolutely impossible. Love could be simple but not means kinda boring if only it's genuine. It brought tears first time when I watching a film. Thanks for the director Shunji Iwai he brought an unique oriental style to the world. I also wanna look his APRIL STORY65292 I assure that's another excellent movie. 10 out of 10.".

She knows that the house was knocked down and built over by a highway years ago but does it anyway perhaps out of desperation. Unexpectedly she gets a reply. From there the story begins and it takes a much different direction than how the plot sounds on paper. I can't really say too much without spoiling it but this is a tragic movie yet beautiful at the same time. There are flashback sequences that make you really care about several characters in the movie including the deceased man who is shown as a school boy in the flashbacks.

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the best romantic movies in my life. It doesn't have a kiss scene or even a hug scene like typical Hollywood movies except for scenes recalling the past. The setting of the movie is winter in Japan. The director Suhnji Iwai made this film with many poetic scenes. I can recall the time when I was in high school. This movie reminded me of the pure feeling of love.Hiroko Miho Nakayama goes to her exboyfriend's memorial service. Itsuki Fujii died on a mountain climbing accident two years ago. When she visits the house of her exboyfriend's mother she finds his high school year book and takes notes of his address. She struggles to overcome the grief coming from losing him at that moment. She sends a letter to Itski Fujii because of romantic reason. Surprisingly she receives an answer from him. Hiroko knows the address does not exist any longer after it was demolished for a highway construction.Another female Itsuki Fujii is a Hiroko's exschoolmate who shared the school days with him. Coincidentally she has the same name Itsuki Fujii and she tells many stories about male Itsuki's school life when they were young. Corresponding with letters for that time between them Hiroko looks back on Itsukii's past and feels slightly jealous about female Itsukii. Moreover female Itsukii finds another truth that she didn't know about the past. It seems like they are in a love triangle beyond time.Miho Nakayama plays roles of two womenHiroko and female Itski at the same time. Her acting is impressive especially her crying monologue is very famous. The story is sad but she does not play her role with grief all the time. She acts with the sad feeling in moderation. With her beautiful voice her acting sparkles pure and elegant.The director made this film with special camera effects. Some parts of this movie don't have the clear scene and instead he used the foggy dreamlike scene intentionally. I think he wants to express his feeling with great delicacy not directly.Considering only this story it may look boring but it isn't boring at all while I watch this movie. It is filled with enormous mountain views and poetic music. The background piano music is very popular among people.In this film the actors don't say many words but we can feel more than their lines because the dialogue is full of suggestions.The images from this movie still linger in my mind.".

Oh and she can't shake a nasty cold.Hiroko and Itsuki live at opposite ends of Japan do not know each other but could pass for twins.From such small incidental trivial fragments of life Iwai weaves together a magical deeply cathartic film. Hiroko and Itsuki exist in the same temporal moment but travel through metaphysical time in opposite directions with regard to their feelings towards Fujii. Hiroko retreats from her love in order to grieve properly and finally let go. Itsuki inches towards her memory of Fujii finally waking up to the realisation that he was her first love. Neither Hiroko or Itsuki can make the journey without the other their dialectical relationship propelling them both towards a confrontation of sorts with Fujii. Hiroko will bellow through her confrontation at a mountainside at dawn. A prosaic message mundane even one that repeats the first letter written in the film but one that manages as Hiroko cries it out again and again to touch your soul. Itsuki is to be blindsided by Fujii when the secret of his obscure librarycard project is revealed in a simple scribble and Itsuki's fragile hopes come to fruition.There are truly funny moments in this film  Itsuki pedalling the bike to provide light for Fujii to read Ranran's manic take as the class nutter and most of all the nervous laugh of Itsuki's unthinking uncle. It is also very touching at times such as when the grandfather says he will not walk to the hospital he will run and then wonderfully undercut when he falls flat on his face. The whole thing together shimmers with a purity and vitality that words cannot do justice to the photography has to be seen. Love Letter is a masterpiece from a living genius.".

A delicate actress called Miho Nakayama is cast in the double role of fianc and exschoolmate of the deceased. Comparisons to Kieslowkski or Lynch may spring immediately to mind. However Love Letter is nothing like an intensive meditation on fate and serendipity. Instead it is a bittersweet tale of discovery both of oneself and also of the ones you love and ultimately closure. There are some great moments in this film that resonate with feeling like when an old man must carry a very sick granddaughter to the hospital in a driving snowstorm. An assured script and direction beautiful wide screen cinematography and a pretty score all add to the atmosphere. The film eventually bursts into unabashed expression in an unforgettable final scene. Just lovely!major major spoiler below! Don't read if you haven't seen the film.In certain comments people have either criticized as being unrealistic or concluded that the casting of M. Nakayama as both female protagonists as being a logistic or financial decision. I think that misses an important point. What this presumably odd piece of casting was meant to show was that the deceased actually ended up marrying or got engaged to a woman who looks quite similar to his childhood love. This happens in life that is we do tend to choose people who look similar. So the casting choice was a bit of a stroke of genius especially in light of the revelatory final scene and what a scene that is!. Very nice touch.".

By the end of teh first act you'll be hooked till the subtle twistintheend more on that later.The film reminds me alot of The Double Life Of Veronique as it uses the same concept of having the two protagonists being played by the same actress. I've watched both and though Veronique is a masterpiece this film is a few notches above.Now the ending of the film is at once touching intriguing disturbing and very hard to accept. Some people might  have seen it coming early into the film but it caught me off guard. It is not like Teh Sixth Sense or The Usual Suspects kind of twist ending but it runs along the lines of....man i can't think of any other film which has this kind of ending. I won't spoil it for you but it involves the two leads and the one thing they have in common. Ohh....its tempting to reveal the secret but i won't.Check this film out. Everything is top notch  direction script cinematography acting editing and the musical score. Definitely the number one Japanese movie in my favourite film list. I love it...you'll love it too.".

I have to say she impressed me here with her performance as Pursalane Hominy Will ain't that a mouthful of a name!. Travolta does a nice turn as the titular Bobby Long a former English professor who has fallen into the depths of an alcohol induced fantasy life. Gabriel Macht also does a good job as Lawson Pines Bobby Long's former teaching assistant who has accompanied Long into his descent out of a sense of loyalty and guilt.Perhaps the most interesting character to me is the one you never see Lorraine Will a New Orleans diva and the mother of young Pursey. Lorraine's death from alcoholism is what brings our characters together and much like Alex in The Big Chill we never once see or hear from Lorraine not even in voiceover when Pursey reads a letter never sent to her by Lorraine but we experience her through the people in this movie. It is a brave choice for the director to make as I believe others would opt for more direct exposition via flashback voiceovers etc.In the end while there is a certain formulaic approach to the story the characters are done well enough that you enjoy the story anyway.".

	schema:reviewBody "For those who have read Ronald Everett Capps' novel 'Off Magazine Street' and savor the slow lugubrious decadent pattern of life in the poor section of New Orleans then ScreenwriterDirector Shainee Gabel's transformation of those ideas into A LOVE SONG FOR BOBBY LONG will certainly satisfy. Though Gabel has manipulated characters names and identification to fit her sensitive interpretation of Capps' story into a visual manifestation the changes are sound and serve to make this remarkably fine low budget film a humid alcoholically lethargic slice of New Orleans as viable as say Tennessee Williams. There is a captured ambiance of the South complete with decay shanties intermittent rain and aimless broken lives that sets a fine stage for a rather minimal story.Purslane Hominy Will Scarlett Johansson is a young high school dropout living in trailer park trash in Florida with a low class boyfriend Lee Clayne Crawford when she learns of her mother Lorraine's death in New Orleans. Though she hasn't seen or heard from her obese druggie songwriter mother in years she wants to attend her funeral and strikes out for New Orleans.Arriving on the doorstep of her mother's rundown rotting house she discovers Bobby Long John Travolta an unkempt drunk who once was an English professor in a college in Alabama but fell into oblivion and alcohol when he lost his wife and family. He is living in filth with Lawson Pines Gabriel Macht who as Bobby's teaching assistant whom Bobby has deemed gifted has followed Bobby to write Bobby's biography  a work in progress that has stalemated in favor of alcoholism and disillusionment. Pursey hears that Booby and Lawson were Lorraine's closest friends she had invited them to flop in her shabby house entertained by their low key scholasticism and literature quoting and that Lorraine had willed her home to the three of them.Pursey moves in reluctantly  she has nowhere else to go  and immediately is at odds with her 'roommates'. Likewise Bobby and Lawson resist Pursey's presence and insist she 'get a life' by returning to high school making use of her obvious intellect. The verbal sparing that eventually leads the three to find a sense of family lays the foundation for the predictable conclusion.That is the simplicity of the tale  if it is storyline that is important to you. Gabel's distillation of Capps' novel is in the atmosphere she creates with these gifted actors. Bobby may be a drunk but he is the spokesman for a neighborhood of sad broken lives. The world is confined to the street that contains the local bar churches and graveyards  each of varying importance but all drenched in humidity and frequent rains and alcohol and aimless living. The local bar is tended by Georgiana Deborah Kara Unger with whom Lawson is having a strained affair. The folk who gather at Bobby's literaturespouting soirees include gardener Cecil Dane Rhodes Junior David Jensen to mention only a few welldefined characters. That anyone could alter the ennui in the way Pursey changes things is a minor miracle.The minimal music score by Grayson Capps is atmospheric as are the offscreen comments and quotations of great literature of TS Eliot Robert Frost WH Auden et al. The cinematography by Eliot Davis is properly claustrophobic and decadent in atmosphere. And while some feel the movie is too long for the minimal story the length and pacing are in keeping with the traditions and the literature of the South and for this viewer it works exceedingly well.Travolta Johansson Macht and Unger give multifaceted highly sensitive performances. As for Shainee Gabel whose only other film was the controversial 'Anthem' here is a writer and director to watch. The DVD contains some excellent deleted scenes and one of the more informative 'making of' segments with Gabel Travolta Johansson Macht and Rhodes speaking with quiet eloquence. Highly recommended.".

The character development for the three main characters Travolta Johansson and Macht is wellwoven into the story. Each character is flawed and through a series of events overcomes their problem.

One the other hand i'we never seen Scarlet make a bad flick...As soon as i started watching it i could not take my eyes of the TV... I have to say this movies is one of 2005 best movies by far. This is NOT a bad copy of LIT this is if not better at least as good as it! The script is awesome and the acting MINDBLOWING!If you still haven't watch it get of your ass and GET IT!

Considering the awesome acting between Bill and Scarlet i at first hand thought that A love song for bobby long would be a bad copy of it. One the other hand i'we never seen Scarlet make a bad flick...As soon as i started watching it i could not take my eyes of the TV... I have to say this movies is one of 2005 best movies by far. This is NOT a bad copy of LIT this is if not better at least as good as it! The script is awesome and the acting MINDBLOWING!If you still haven't watch it get of your ass and GET IT! This movie will take your mind peace for 1h and 59m!";

John Travolta lights up the screen in every scene he is in.The soundtrack adds so much texture and feeling to the picture. And it is a surprise to see a preKatrina New Orleans.The atmosphere in this movie reminded me of Midnight in the Garden of Evil. In both cases they captured the special uniqueness and character of the cities.The pace is slower and more relaxed which goes a long way in capturing the atmosphere of New Orleans.I highly recommend this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Up front I want to say I cannot write objectively about Love Song For Bobby Long. When my wife was housesitting for good friends in New Orleans next to Audubon Park filming for this movie was going on. She grew up in New Orleans and I consider it a second home. I have spent much time in Audubon Park on the Saint Charles Avenue street cars on the levee at the Mississippi River and in the French Quarter all locations used in making this movie. So while I enjoyed the story I also enjoyed seeing these characters inhabit the territory I know so well. Even if it had been a bad story I would have enjoyed the movie.But ... it is a good story. A story about three misfits thrown together as a result of someone else's misfortune. And the story is about how they each discover something about themselves and grow as a result. A growth each would not experienced had they not been in the situation. John Travolta is always good and here he is Bobby Long former Literature Professor who has dropped out of the mainstream. Scarlett Johansson is perfect as Pursy Will a high school dropout who looks at waiting tables as an acceptable career. Gabriel Macht is Lawson Pines a genuine follower a former protg of Bobby Long's and erstwhile author who can't seem to write anything good. The movie develops deliberately somewhat like reading a book and always interesting. SPOILERS. Pursy is living with her boyfriend in Panama City Florida and one day he incidentally tells her Bobby Long called to say her mother had died. She is too late for the funeral but the gravestone tells us she was 40. She goes to check out the house in Gretna near the levee but finds Bobby and Lawson living there in squalor two apparent drunkards who have no obvious income. They tell her that the will left the house to each of them onethird owners. What they didn't tell her was they could stay there up to one year then it belonged to Pursy alone. In a rather long process Pursy gets her GED looking through her mom's things finds letters to Pursy that she never had the courage to mail and also finds out Bobby Long is her father. There are many other complications but Bobby doesn't take care of an infected foot and dies a year later. Lawson writes the book Love Song For Bobby Long. Pursy gains confidence and looks towards a career.".

Inconsistent direction by Shainee Gabel and a weak Cajun accent by John Travolta did not ruin what I found to be very interesting subject matter. Although we never see the local legend Lorraine her impact on this strange troupe of characters is beyond question. Watching Scarlett Johansson's quest to unlock her mother's mystique and her own history proved very enjoyable for this viewer. Johansson's Purcy Will named after a weed is both head strong and independent while vulnerable and eager. Travolta's iconic Bobby Long and the evenkeeled Gabriel Macht are nothing more than alcoholic shells of men who trade literature quotes when Purcy pops into their lives. Much of this is predictable and the flavor that is New Orleans plays a huge part of the feel of the film. Although the novel was difficult to bring to the screen and improvements could have been made this film should find an audience. Johansson may a bit old for this role at the ripe age of 20 but her acting skills continue to grow and I love that she is always up for a challenge. She should be fun to watch for years to come.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Love Song for Bobby Long is the essential film one can truly appreciate. The story is compelling the script is an editorial delight the ensemble containing a talent pool of outstanding performers and characters that are three dimensional interesting to enjoy. Purslane Will Scarlett Johansson travels to New Orleans to attend her mother's funeral oblivious to the fact that she inherited a house from her will. But she must also share the abode with two other people a greying literature professor Dr. Bobby Long John Travolta and his young assistant Lawson Pines Gabriel Macht. Both are attempting to usurp each other with quotes and booze. As Pursy cleans up their acts and the house a bit of a bond ensues between them even through their quarrelling. As the three live in peace and harmony yeah right! more secrets are discovered in Pursy's late mother's will that only Bobby and Lawson know of and another secret that all three don't know about. It was an allaround emotional rollercoaster ride. It contains humor intelligent dialogue sentimental moments and scenes that will lift up your hearts if only a tad bit obscene in some areas. Sure it was a frugal budget but I've seen high budget movies turn into godawful clunkers before. I admired the transformation of the house going from a condemned house whose makeover could've been solved by a wrecking ball to an artistically crafted piece of architecture. Where they got the dough is a mystery since the triad are jobless. The bayou setting in New Orleans never looked so sophisticating and the neighborhood they lived in was a landscape's paradise. John Travolta was terrific from the the likable tough guys he's played like Tony Moreno and Vincent Vega to a more subtle Southerner like Bobby Long though he was still a bit tense at times. The other leading characters were amazing here too. Scarlett Johansson was really into the character she played and it was hard not to sympathize with her and still looked good even in shabby apparel. Gabriel Macht shows what he can do with a clever script and at times can outperform the other two leading performers. And the chemistry between Macht and Johansson didn't feel forced or scripted but real and natural. This is a movie for the intellects and one to watch if you are a true movie fan.".

Travolta shows his chops here as does Scarlett some of her best work yet her style fits the character well and that is not something one can count on from her. Not to give away the details for this movie is best when it catches you by surprise I really had a nice evening with these folks. Though sometimes repulsive sometimes too long it will win you over in the end because it makes you care about them. That being said it was a bit far fetched to think a beauty like Scarlett would ever be stuck in such a fix or Travolta and his buddy either but they pull it off with terrific performances. Love to see more from this director she impresses in a big way and has the potential to be one of the best ever. Treat yourself to this one when the crickets are singing in the summer fields and if you visit New Orleans first you'll enjoy it twice as much.".

Travolta shows his chops here as does Scarlett some of her best work yet her style fits the character well and that is not something one can count on from her. Not to give away the details for this movie is best when it catches you by surprise I really had a nice evening with these folks. Though sometimes repulsive sometimes too long it will win you over in the end because it makes you care about them. That being said it was a bit far fetched to think a beauty like Scarlett would ever be stuck in such a fix or Travolta and his buddy either but they pull it off with terrific performances. Love to see more from this director she impresses in a big way and has the potential to be one of the best ever. Treat yourself to this one when the crickets are singing in the summer fields and if you visit New Orleans first you'll enjoy it twice as much.";

	schema:reviewBody "Lorraine Will whose funeral marks the beginning of the story had died from a drug overdose. We watch Bobby Long limping across New Orleans as he gets to the cemetery not before finishing a bottle to perhaps fortify his spirit. The one that never makes it to the funeral is Lorraine's daughter Pursy who lives in Florida with an abusive boyfriend. Upon hearing about her mother's death Pursy goes back to New Orleans but she is a day late.Going to her mother's house she meets two strangers Bobby Long and Lawson Pines. Bobby had been a college professor and Lawson his assistant. Since they lost their jobs they relocated to New Orleans where they lead lives wasted by the amounts of liquor both drink. Pursy comes into this household without a clue as to why these two are living in Lorraine's house. Both men are supposedly the inheritors of the property but the young woman's arrival changes their position considerably.Pursy who has dropped out of school is coaxed by Bobby and Lawson into getting her GED and to pursue a college education something she is reluctant to undertake at first. The fact that the house is in her name and both men had lied about it comes as a shock to Pursy who feels betrayed and decides to put it for sale but it seems she is too deeply involved with these two men. Bobby it turns out is closer to her than she ever thought and she has feelings for Lawson in spite of the age difference.Shainee Gabel who adapted Ronale Everett Capps' novel Off Magazine Street into this film captures the essence of the relationship among these three lost souls living in New Orleans. The film starts slowly but keeps getting better half way into the film. It pays for the viewers to stay with it because of the nuanced character study Ms. Gabel achieves in the film.John Travolta would have been not our first choice to play Bobby Long but for better or worse he is the man that was tapped to portray this lost soul. At times he succeeds brilliantly and at other times we just don't believe he is that alcoholic man whose talent has gone to waste. Scarlett Johansson gives a good performance as Pursy the confused young woman who must face reality and deal with it. Gabriel Macht is also effective as Lawson. The best thing though is the understated reading Deborah Dara Unger gives to Georgianna the bar maid with a heart of gold who loves Lawson silently.Watching the film postKatrina we could only wonder what state the neighborhood where the film was shot a couple of years earlier would be like right now. One could only hope everything had managed to survive the furor of the storm although who knows?".

	schema:reviewBody "Scarlett Johannsen doesn't normally do much for me. Yeah she's cute but that doesn't make her the greatest actress. She's been in a few movies that I thought were okay but this one was stellar and she was stellar in it.The cast of characters  aside from Johannsen Macht and Travolta  were ghostly and indistinct while still being integral to the plot...but you don't find out why and how it all comes together until the end. It was interesting how they pulled that off. The movie starts out like pardon the expression a trailer trash documentary and I must admit that I only started watching it when I was bored. However when they started in on the literary quotations I was reaching for my pen and a piece of paper to make a note of the quote the book title and author for later digestion. I was hooked.The dynamic between Travolta and Johannsen was electric and even that guy Macht that I'd never heard of before but found to be delicious was really alive. He's a good actor...I shall watch out for more of his stuff.Travolta was brilliant. He was so dead set against Johannsen being in his life initially and he was such a BLEEPITY BLEEP BLEEPING BLEEP it was really difficult to feel anything for his character in the beginning. Travolta definitely does NOT get the recognition for his skill that he richly deserves.It was heartwrenching to watch Johannsen fall for one character for so many wrong reasons and a few right ones he was on her side he gave her all the support and encouragement that she had so desperately needed and  more importantly  his support and encouragement were genuine and warm ultimately with no ulterior motives..for perhaps the first time in her life.. But her growing affection for someone she didn't want to care for was really beautiful. It was the end that had me bawling my eyes out. It was perfect. It was sublime. Watch this movie. Yes there are some slow parts but if you want to get as much as you can from this flick pay attention to all of it. I think you'll be glad you did.Enjoy and thanks for stopping by.".

He never plays the same character twice unless of course he is making a sequel. He gives his characters life and a style of their own. He can be bad or good sweet or sad  and each time you feel it.This story is a study in character and Travolta takes it to the limit. This is a man that is hurting both mentally and physically. He is lost but he is soon found. And a whole new reason for living is offered to him. He believes in God  now how can a character go wrong if he believes in God.This is a movie that you want to sit back and relax and just go with it. It is not an action film and so it moves slow. But it has to in order for you to feel the emotions of the characters. They all have their own little demons and yet they try to support each other without really realizing it. In the end they are brought together by pure love.Watch it and enjoy. If you can't pause it then get your drink and food before watching it. You do not want to miss even one word. All dialog is too important. Miss any and you miss the message.Great movie done by even greater actors. Leave it up to JT to come up with another gem  he has the knack for it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The GDR film studio DEFA was famous for its wellacted classical adaptations of classic novels and plays that stuck very closely to the original as far as plot dialogues set decoration and costumes are concerned. Viel Lrm um Nichts Much Ado About Nothing based on the play by William Shakespeare is a typical example of that. Although entirely filmed in a studio the production is a very funny and entertaining adaptation that creates a Shakespearean atmosphere by using contemporary costumes and set decoration. This colourful scenery is the perfect background for the actors who are giving very good performances above all Rolf Ludwig who is able to portray Benedict's development from the mocking bachelor to the loving husband convincingly. Although I generally prefer Kenneth Branagh's adaptation of the play this film tops it in some parts for example the scenes with the stupid men of the guard are far better and funnier here than in the 1992 version. All in all I strongly recommend this film because it makes you feel as if you were watching a very good stage production. I'm sure that Shakespeare would have liked it.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review I Love You Man";
	schema:reviewBody "I Love You Man is a delightful film not just for its brand of humour which worked almost all the time nor because it stars the bunch of contemporary jokers who have taken Hollywood by storm but because it had a meaningful story to tell and has translated that key insight of friendships and relationships for the big screen effortlessly wrapping up some deep intrinsic behavioural observation deceptively behind a curtain of laughter.Like the 40 Year Old Virgin in its quest for a woman to get laid with to pop his cherry this film works on the reverse in its protagonist's quest for a male friend since Peter Klaven Paul Rudd has no problems with female friendship as he's the quintessential ladies man only that he's about to marry his fianc Zooey Rashida Jones. Since the bride has a maid of honour it's up to Peter to find a balance in a best man only that he hasn't really had a man friend for the longest time and so begins a crazy montage of hooking up with casual friends in the hope of striking gold.It might seem like a hypothetical situation but as the film progressed it brings to mind how many of us have friends male or female that we sometimes take for granted in knowing that they'll always be there for us. Only a reality check brings up the fact that everyone has their own personal lives to lead and it wouldn't be nice to impose midlife crisis singles hands up here especially not with an ulterior motive. Some of us too when having a girlfriend tend to allow male friends to fall on the wayside as we skirt chase and depending on whether you get someone who provides that much leeway as Zooey you can kiss goodbye to those malebonding sessions.Then there's the difference between the premise of a girl's night out and a guy's and the dynamics of what happens within the groups. It can be somewhat stereotypical here in the film but you get the drift as the film lays it all out on the table with the girls talking about the boystuff behind their backs and the worst bit being that cause for comparison and the guys well talk about what else sex! There are some lines clearly drawn here in what can or cannot be discussed and how much of that you can bring to the table and how much you can take away from. A secret's a secret and should stay that way with clear segregation in order to prevent upsetting anyone. Talk about compromises and truth.If what you're saying is that it reeks of hypocrisy then yes sometimes it does and the married couple played by Jaime Pressly and Jon Favreau yes he who directed Iron Man epitomizes the crankiness of a marriage with its idiosyncrasies and the hypocrisies that come with presenting a united front and worse of all trading favours in both directions. They have some of the best lines and insane moments in the film and poor Jon has got to suffer two verbal abuses for you to watch and find out.Many of us who have remembered Jason Segel's comical turn in Forgetting Sarah Marshall and here he cuts his Sydney Fife both ways one an alpha male type who seems way cool with his frat boy sensibilities which is actually a facade for a lonely life he leads in his garage where he can be the man he actually is. As the friendship between Peter and Sydney grow from their numerous hanging out sessions from short drinking sessions to weekend rendezvous just to jam to their favourite tunes so too does the strain in Peter and Zooey's relationship because as the saying goes two's a company and three's a crowd. This aspect serves as an adversary in the film though it doesn't come unexpected when it suddenly dawns upon Peter that he can't have two birds in one hand. Being the novice in this aspect of a manfriend relationship here there are many times Peter trips up and the experienced us would know that it's perfect danger territory to find yourself in.And who would have thought friendship and relationships could be such a chore especially when expectations start flying around being that spanner ready to be thrown in the works. As a comedy this film hit plenty of right spots in eliciting laughter from the audience with funny lines that do work and carefully crafted characters in Peter with his nonsensical one liner conversation endings and nicknames and Sydney being quite multidimensional. And what's a film like this about manfriends without that dose of fanboydom in it with the Incredible Hulk Lou Ferrigno playing himself in a very short supporting role and many other film references thrown in for good measure too?I Love You Man is an excellent story on friendship and what makes friendship tick. For that and its healthy dose of comedy and a great spin on the tired romanticcomedy genre it goes without a surprise into my list of contenders for top films of the year.".

That honestly would have been the smartest thing to do but then we would have no movie.

The only problem is Peter's guy friends don't care much for Zooey because well he doesn't have any. In fact he's never really had any. Which begs the question Who the hell will be Peter Klaven's Best Man at his wedding?? A couple of uncomfortable and unpredictable man dates later enter Sidney Jason Segel who shows up at an open house hosted by Peter Klaven. Only he's not there to check out the multimillion dollar estate owned by The Incredible Hulk Lou Ferrigno. Sidney's there to scope out the recent divorces who commonly show up at open houses and to grab some free sandwiches while he's at it.With Sidney's uncanny understanding of male behavior his barbaric display of testosterone his similar taste in Rock  Roll and his honest and vulgar approach to male bonding hence the RRating is this really the Best Man Pete's been looking for? Or the Worst Man that could ever happen to not only Pete's pending marriage with Zooey but also his career and ultimately his life?? As implied by the sentimental title this film was building up to be the definitive Bromantic Comedy and in my opinion they pulled it off. I Love You Man is Paul Rudd at his finest. He charmed his way into a clueless Alicia Silverstone he started a timeless string of homophobic questioning with Seth Rogen and he helped a selfloathing Jason Segel forget Sarah Marshall with a spaced out surf lesson.Now Paul's back to find a best man and the chemistry he has with the best man tobe is pure comedy. Thankfully we get a front row seat to all his awkwardness his flamboyance his unabashed silliness and his hopelessness and all of it is completely hysterical and completely endearing. You know how I know you're gay? You think Paul Rudd is endearing. Alongside Paul is a unique ensemble of characters including Andy Samberg playing Pete's gay brother JK Simmons playing the everyman father not unlike his role as Juno's dear old dad and a handful of other awesome cameos that create some great moments. Director John Hamburg does a great job of creating an open environment to let them play off of each other uninhibited and sometimes ridiculous.I Love You Man is funny honest overthetop yet truetolife and yes I'll say it again completely endearing.".

	schema:headline " Gut bustingly funny and actually endearing";
	schema:reviewBody "When I first heard about this movie I became a little irritated. The premise seemed to me like a romantic comedy for gays except with a few lines to make it a bromance. It makes sense as most guys in the target age group high schoolers and college aged are quite uncomfortable discussing sexual orientation in any context Don't believe me? Try raising the topic with your best buddies. It seemed like it was wimping out instead of taking a chance and really making a movie that could make said guys comfortable about this sort of thing.This may be the film's intention but it hides it well. The romance between Peter Paul Rudd and Zooey Rashida Jones is wellintegrated and quite important to the story. If anything it represents a major stepping stone.I approached this film with much trepidation I don't especially like Judd Apatow movies. Some of the stuff is funny but a lot of it is too understated like Clark Duke in Sex Drive or Kick Ass watch the trailers of either one of those movies and when the dorky kid with glasses talks you'll see what I mean. Worse Jason Segel wrote and starred in Forgetting Sarah Marshall a movie of that ilk that I didn't like at all. Fortunately none of those characteristics made into this movie. The jokes flow naturally and the film has energy and chemistry between the actors. This result is 90 minutes of absolute hilarity.Peter Paul Rudd has always been a ladies man. Women love him and he finds them very easy to talk to. That's one of the reasons why Zooey Rashida Jones falls head over heels for him and when he proposes she accepts. But once wedding plans get underway he realizes that he has no best guy friends to make up his share of the wedding party. So with his friends encouragement he sets out to find a new best guy friend. After a few disastrous man dates he runs into Sydney Jason Segel a fun loving guy with a lot of advice on how to break loose and have fun.The best thing about this movie is that everything unfolds naturally. True it follows the familiar beats of the genre but nothing that happens is contrived. The characters actions are genuine and make sense from what we know about them and that makes it more honest not to mention effective.The leads are great. Paul Rudd tones down the funny smartass personality that made him famous and instead acts like a likable guy albeit without malemale social skills and a penchant for creating bad nicknames and catchphrases. Peter is an easy guy to like and he has good chemistry with both of his costars Rashida Jones and Jason Segel. Segel is a revelation. He's one of the most likable characters I've seen on screen in a long time. He's easy going and earnest the type of guy anyone would want as a best friend. However some of his philosophies on life and social skills come off as scripted and try as he might Segel isn't able to make them sound otherwise. Rashida Jones is also very good looking and sounding like Jessica Alba only more relaxed. When Peter tells her about Sydney she's excited for him. If us guys could all have such wives we'd be in heaven. As the gay brother who is on hand to give advice about man dating Andy Samberg is far less irritating and obnoxious than he was in the utterly awful Hot Rod which is near the top of my list of one of the worst movies ever made.John Hamburg is making a comedy and like the best ones he lets everything flow naturally. The humor isn't kept on mute or drained of energy or kept lowkey. It's totally natural and that's what makes this such a funny and dare I say it touching comedy. I was actually discussing this film with my best guy friend and the movie reminded us quite strongly of the sort of things we would do when we were in college together. Movies that have establish that kind of a connection with a viewer don't come along very often.".

	schema:headline " Very likable and sweet a great dategroup movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "Though you won't find the name Judd Apatow on this film at all he certainly has a hand in it as his influence is all over the film. However unlike most of the movies that can certainly be grouped with this one 'I Love You Man' is a movie almost anyone can enjoy even women and kids. It's the lightest warmest and the best for buddies of either sex to see. It's a delightful comedy that will make you laugh throughout and brighten your day.Whether it be the great buddy chemistry between the leads or the simply hysterical supporting cast I found myself loving this movie. Like director John Hamburg's previous effort 'Along Came Polly' the movie is incredibly likable because it relies on the awkward humor that Paul Rudd does pretty much perfectly playing off the happygolucky humor of Jason Segel.Rudd is likable and reliable as usual in a role showcasing the best of his abilities I really can't say how happy I am that he's finally getting leading roles and unlike in 'Role Models' he's the undisputed lead here. Segel is a character in Rudd's story his life and his journey to find a friend and essentially become a complete person before his life changes for the better. Segel is at his best in a role as what appears to be the perfect friend I would hang out with this guy for days. Rashida Jones is adorable and likable as Rudd's fianc and it's a role that most actresses would've over done Jaime Pressly's performance should remind people of how it could've been over done and Jones plays it with an ease that makes her likable.The supporting cast is what makes the movie great. It's the foundation of characters played by Thomas Lennon Joe Lo Truglio Jon Favreau Jaime Pressly and Andy Samberg that completes the movie and makes it worth watching because let's face it the movie wouldn't be that great if Rudd and Segel just sat around broing out for 2 hours. Lennon and Truglio are hilarious as candidates for Peter's best man position and Lennon will bring down the house as Doug with his classic monologue about how he feels when his advances towards Peter are rejected. Truglio is great in yet another small cameo that stacks up with his previous appearances in 'Pineapple Express' and 'Superbad' as well as the icing on the cake that was 'Role Models' he's an example of the whole everyone will like this movie thing. Jon Favreau is hysterical in his part as a cynical ass that makes you go this guy directed 'Iron Man'?.I think the reason most people will like this one is because it'll put a smile on most people's faces. It's a generally happy movie that is a good movie to see in a group to start off a night and is even a decent date movie. It's got jokes that even kids can like though most of the film is obviously not appropriate for them...what I'm saying is if they HAVE to see one of these movies this is the one for them. I really enjoyed this movie it left a good taste in my mouth and my friends loved it too.".

And should be smooth sailing from there right well not so much. Peter quickly discovers that he has no best man for his wedding the painful fact is that Peter has never really had a male friend most of his best friends are females. So Peter goes out on a search by going on a couple of man dates in hopes to find the perfect B.F.F.. But comes close to giving up until he meets SydneyJason Segel a wild fun loving guy. Peter and Sydney soon become the best of friends has Sydney shows Peter on how to be wild and crazy. But will it put a strain on his relationship with Zooey? One funny comedy that hits it's mark perfectly. And a great bunch of characters that don't over do it either. Paul Rudd is great always he had better chemistry with Rashida Jones and Jason Segel then he had with Elizabeth Banks and Seann William Scott. Rashida Jones is also great in her role although she doesn't quite get the big laughs she endearing and believable in her role. Jason Segel was perfectly cast also he managed to get some good laughs.

	schema:headline " Smart  Enjoyable Film Jason Segel's and Paul Rudd's Best";
	schema:reviewBody "Even though Judd Apatow had nothing to do with this film as far as I know it will inevitably be compared to both Forgetting Sarah Marshall and The 40 Year Old Virgin. It's not very hard to see why since both male leads are frequently in lead or supporting roles in Apatowdirected or produced films. Since those two films most especially exceeded many people's expectations Jason Segel and Paul Rudd both probably had a lot of pressure for this film to be funny. Fortunately this film succeeded in being as funny and as refreshingly honest as the aforementioned comedies.I Love You Man is a comedy that doesn't quite fit into the romantic comedy or feel good comedy categories. It has elements of both and fortunately all the right elements.The premise of the movie is a bit unconventional. Paul Rudd plays Peter Klaven a moderately successful and ambitious real estate broker who just proposed to his beautiful and articulate girlfriend played brilliantly by Rashida Jones. He seems to have everything going for him until he realizes he doesn't have a best guy friend. All his life he has had woman friends which isn't a bad thing. However he feels a void especially since he doesn't have a best man to choose. He enlists the help of his mother SNL alum Jane Curtin and brother current SNL player Andy Samberg to find a guy friend creating a hilarious montage of unsuccessful man dates. After those attempts don't go well he spontaneously meets a broker named Sydney Fife Jason Segel. Through Peter's awkwardness with having a best male friend they hit it off. However Peter's cluelessness with what information to share with a male friend as opposed to a female friend creates tension between new friend Sydney his fianc and her friends.The premise is one of the best things about this film. It's safe to say that everyone has had moments where everything is going right except for one minor thing except it doesn't seem too minor to you the more you think about it. One of the most poignant scenes is when Rudd is driving around L.A. and he sees various types of male bonding. The leftout look on Rudd's face was both heartfelt and understandable. Of course when he asks his family for help it's not made clear why he didn't ask his brother to be his best man. The brothers appear to get along well although once Rudd's character goes on a quest to find a guy friend Samberg's character appears to get pushed into the background until the very end. Samberg was very funny in this movie but his character created this tiny plot hole in the film.That being said Jason Segel's character was absolutely brilliant and the opposite of whom he played in both Freaks and Geeks and Forgetting Sarah Marshall. He's confident in this movie and his humor comes from street smarts more than awkwardness and selfdoubt. That's not to say his previous performances weren't good. Rather Segel shows in this movie that he's good at playing a different kind of ambitious person. His lines are often times laughoutloud funny and he plays very well off of Paul Rudd's slightly unsureofhimself character.Of course in similar buddy movies there's always the subplot when a person is either married or in a committed relationship that the main guy meets an outgoing other guy they become friends and they spend so much time together that the wifesteadygirlfriend immediately becomes jealous. This subplot is especially prevalent in movies where Jennifer Aniston is that girl. Here Rashida Jones plays a far more realistic counterpart to Paul Rudd. She's not immediately jealous of Segel but there is some friction later in the movie. The most refreshing part is that Jones' character is far more reasonable than other similar characters. Her reactions are familiar yet she still maintains a calm dignity throughout the movie that's rare especially in romantic comedies. Jones a regular on The Office shows brilliance in this role. As long as she stays the hell away from chick flicks along the lines of She's Just Not That Into You she'll be a welcome face in film and not just in Judd Apatowinfluenced movies.I highly recommend this picture. It's funny in some of the same ways the aforementioned Judd Apatow films are but there's another level of refreshing honesty brilliant writing laugh out loud humor and a slightlyunusual plot line that sets it apart from those films. It hasn't been released to theaters yet but when it does I hope it's a hit. If the writing team here was worried movie goers would think the film to be Forgetting Sarah Marshall 2 hopefully they won't have anything to worry about.".

In case the plot is of any interest to you it's about this guy Paul Rudd who is getting married to this woman Rashida Jones but he realizes that he doesn't really have any male friends to fill out his side of the wedding party. So he starts on a quest with the aid of his brother Andy Samberg to find a best man. When he finally thinks he finds one Jason Segel hilarity ensues.On the spectrum of comedies this is a bro movie. One made basically for guys a little raunchy. But honestly it's not too Rrated. It cusses a bit discusses sex a lot things like that. But not nearly as Rrated as say... Role Models which I feel is sort of along the same lines. Comparable at least. They are both very funny movies and both have Paul Rudd.But this is about I Love You Man. The highlight of the movie for me is Thomas Lennon as Doug. I have been a fan of his for a long time at least since Reno 911 came out. Which is a brilliant show. Paul Rudd is very very cute but not always convincing the same with Rashida Jones as his fiance. It's a movie that Ben Stiller would have made if he were younger. Jason Segel does what Jason Segel does. He plays his role very capably as Sydney the crazed friend.And that is I Love You Man. It's a rather simple but funny movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Curiously the buzz surrounding the latest R rated adult comedy I Love You Man is fairly superficial as many of the media eyes are on the clever creation of buzz word de jour 'bromance' meaning a platonic bond between two men in the spirit of a traditional romantic comedy. Now I don't know too much about all that nor do I truly care. What I am concerned with however and what I feel should be first and foremost on all accounts is how incredibly funny this movie really is.What happens when you put two comedic actors who can do no wrong in a vehicle with an original premise and an experienced comedic director? Well you get I Love You Man which is one of the funniest comedies in years. Not quite as good as Superbed better than Forrgetting Sara Marshall and about on par with Tropic thunder leads Paul Rudd and Jason Segel anchor director John Hamburg's film so securely it adds a complete additional layer of heart and gravitas to material that could have been executed disastrously.With both Rudd and Segel in recent years we have seen they can carry a movie having starred as leads in Role Models and Forgetting Sara Marshall which Rudd also starred in respectively and uniting them as coleads works fantastically. Neither sinks to a stereotype or falls to a role they have previously played nor do they play the hilarious but not silly for the record premise anything but straight. The duo score massive laughs together and apart and a fantastic supporting cast highlights all the talent involved marvelously.Rudd stars as Peter Klaven a freshly engaged realestate agent who has always been more of a girlsman then a best buddy guy. With the wedding approaching Peter soon realizes he has no close enough friends that could serve as a best man or even a proper wedding party for that matter. So Peter does what any mature professional would do. he recruits his gay brother to set him up on man dates to find a suitable suitor for his big day. After a string of failed sometimes homoerrotic ventures Peter meets Sidney Fife Segel a slovenly but oddly charming bloke at an open house. The two hit it off and a bromance is born but the bond puts a strain on his engagement to Zooey a lovely and delightful Rashida Jones and more hilarity ensues.As I mentioned Rudd and Segel are given oodles to work with by way of a supporting cast including Andy Samburg who has evolved by leaps and bounds since Hot Rod as Peter's gay brother John Favreau as a disgusting family acquaintance J.K. Simmons as Peter's father and The Hulk Lou Ferrigno as himself. Along with the endlessly clever writing and bountiful talent director Hamburg also manages to blend in rib cracking potty humour satirize romcoms and meld it all together with a whole lot of heart and warmth.

	schema:reviewBody "The fact that Rush are in the movie and that the main characters are Rush fans was the sole reason I decided to give this movie a try. Turns out that's the only thing to look forward to. Besides the couple scenes centered around Rush this movie is mostly bland and forgettable. The acting isn't particularly great the camerawork and direction are rather dull and unstylistic and I couldn't bring myself to care about the characters very much. Things just sort of happen without much emotional weight. Since this is a comedy I could forgive the lacking aspects of the film if it was at least funny. Unfortunately the movie isn't really that funny. I had two or three involuntary grins and chuckles but nothing made me involuntarily burst out laughing. Even their Rush fandom is only shown as surface level only popular songs like Tom Sawyer and Limelight are showcased with a brief mention of Spirit of Radio somewhere in there and I think it would have been more rewarding for viewers who happen to be Rush fans if they picked some lesser known songs. Not anything super obscure like Tai Shan or The Necromancer but how about something like Closer To The Heart Fly By Night or YYZ? Sydney has a 2112 poster in his man cave but we never hear 2112! It also would have made sense for them to listen to some lesser known songs since Sydney is apparently a big enough fan that he bought a Geddy Lee Jazz Bass. A lot of people seem to love this movie and that's fine but I personally found it rather dull. Its not really worth checking out even for Rush.".

	onyx:emotionText "The fact that Rush are in the movie and that the main characters are Rush fans was the sole reason I decided to give this movie a try. Turns out that's the only thing to look forward to. Besides the couple scenes centered around Rush this movie is mostly bland and forgettable. The acting isn't particularly great the camerawork and direction are rather dull and unstylistic and I couldn't bring myself to care about the characters very much. Things just sort of happen without much emotional weight. Since this is a comedy I could forgive the lacking aspects of the film if it was at least funny. Unfortunately the movie isn't really that funny. I had two or three involuntary grins and chuckles but nothing made me involuntarily burst out laughing. Even their Rush fandom is only shown as surface level only popular songs like Tom Sawyer and Limelight are showcased with a brief mention of Spirit of Radio somewhere in there and I think it would have been more rewarding for viewers who happen to be Rush fans if they picked some lesser known songs. Not anything super obscure like Tai Shan or The Necromancer but how about something like Closer To The Heart Fly By Night or YYZ? Sydney has a 2112 poster in his man cave but we never hear 2112! It also would have made sense for them to listen to some lesser known songs since Sydney is apparently a big enough fan that he bought a Geddy Lee Jazz Bass. A lot of people seem to love this movie and that's fine but I personally found it rather dull. Its not really worth checking out even for Rush.";

Its a great premise for a comedy but its potential isn't ever realised. The problem is with Paul Rudd as the central character Peter Klaven. The guy just isn't a leading man he does 'nice' very well but isn't capable of delivering anything impressionable or captivating.

We get up close with his uncompromising and boyish lifestyle with most of his scenes shot in his 'man den' a room filled with guitars TV's and a masturbation station for his considerable alone time.We get to see the pair bond over a love of Rush jamming sessions and talking frankly of the opposite sex. Peter is the middle of the road realestate professional stuffy and inhibited Sydney  the fun loving spontaneous 'man's man'. For the first hour its a fun if light weight juxtaposition that entertains you. But the film requires drama you're constantly waiting for it and when complications do arrive its all somewhat anticlimatic.There's some great support with an under used Jon Favreau I wish I'd watch Swingers again instead! a handful of funny scenes the poker table and an admirable job from Jason Segel but ultimately 'I Love You Man' will make you feel as though a better film could so easily come from the same subject matter.

They openly court Penelope and ask her to give her husband up for dead and remarry one of the rowdy suitors who have taken up residence in her home since her husband's departure. However Penelope clings to her belief that Ulysses will soon return. To appease the aggressive suitors Penelope promises that she would remarry as soon as she finishes weaving a large tapestry depicting Ulysses' deeds of bravery. In secret she's unraveling the day's weaving thus delaying the tapestry's completion. Penelope knows that her trick won't work forever. In Troy Ulysses and his warriors use the Trojan Horse ruse to conquer the city. In his fervor Ulysses destroys the Trojans' temple to Neptune god of the sea...";

But Neptune  protector God of the conquered people  pursued him with his anger and kept him murdering for ten years . It is the story of Ulysses who dared defy the god and continued his journey to Ithaca  his home where his wife Penelope was waiting.. and waiting.. The dust of centuries has not dimmed the glories of Ulysses' heroic deeds. the cave of Pholiphemus still reverberates with the with the bellowing roars of the son of Neptuno . The sorrowful face of Penelope still gazes longingly across the open sea. And on a distant shore Circe still casts her spill . For the immortality that Ulysses refused of a goddess was later given to him by a poet ..And the epic poem that Homer sang of the hero's wanderings and of his yearning for home will live for all time .Good rendition deals with Ulysses on his Odyssey home to Penelope and Telemaco after the Trojan War . The classic version ever of Homer's epic produced by two greatest Italian producers as Carlo Ponti and Dino De Laurentis . Based on Homer's Odyssey adapted by seven writers including the American prestigious Irwin Shaw and Ben Hecht  Billy Wilder's usual. As a tale  the Odyssey is an unparalleled metaphor of the struggles of a man's life. The cast is brilliant and international with American as Kirk Douglas  Anthony Quinn and Italian actors as Silvana Mangano  Rossana Podesta and Franco Interlenghi. Silvana Mangano gives us a typical Greek tragedy style performance in a double role as Penelope and Circe  but most amazing is Kirk Douglas acting as the brave and valiant Ulysses  really good looking  impulsive and totally convincing it seems the role was really written for him . Partially shot in natural locations in the Mediterranean and PontiLaurentis studios. The exteriors of this Lux motion picture were filmed on the Mediterranean coast and islands described in Homer's Odyssey . The sea and the sky are strikingly blue the islands green and wild . Colorful and spectacular cinematography by Harold Rosson . Evocative and impressive original score by Alessandro Cicognini  well conducted by Franco Ferrara . The motion picture is professionally directed by Mario Camerini and some scenes by Mario Bava though uncredited . Rating  Better than average take on that will appeal to classic film lovers and Kirk Doglas fans . Another excellent adaptation results to be L'Odissea 1968 TVseries directed by Franco Rossi and also by Mario Bava with Bekim Fehmiu as Ulysses and Irene Papas as Penelope.".

	schema:reviewBody "Homer's tale goes that after his brilliant idea of a huge wooden horse that decided the Greek's victory in the Troyan war Ithaca's King Ulysses challenged the sea god Poseidon and he was punished to sail around for 10 years before he could get back to his island and his faithful wife Queen Penelope. During the hero's long absence many ambitious men have settled in his palace with the intention of marrying the supposedly widow Queen and rule Ithaca with her. The picture is about Ulysses's trip and all the tasks he has to go through before reaching home and once there how he deals with the men that are trying to take his place.Though the film is sort of slow by the middle part of the story and perhaps a little exceeded in its running time it doesn't lack adventure action and entertainment. Ulysses faces the cyclops who wants to have him and his crew for lunch survives the seducing singing of the mermaids visits the kingdom of the dead and escapes the spell of sorceress Circe who plans to retain him for herself. Arrived at last in Ithaca after loosing all his mates he faces the pretenders to his throne in a memorable action and fighting sequence.Ulysses is pure entertainment and adventure in ancient Greece. The film is well done and easy to watch its excess in duration apartwith a correct direction by Mario Camerini. It shows well chosen locations and carefully designed settings. Special effects are more than acceptable for 1955. But perhaps the main feature is a well selected main cast.Kirk Douglas is the perfect choice for Ulysses and his performance is strong and convincing. Silvana Mangano renders a believable Penelope and Anthony Quinn is at his best playing the main pretender Antinoos the first in pride.It could be true that this picture inspired the sword and sandals sub genre that started a bit later with Steve Reeves's Hercules but you can be sure that fortunately this one doesn't belong to that category.A fine product in its genre.".

Through his legendary encounters with the Titan Polythemeus The Sirens of the rocks and of course Circe the witch he is pitted against all the ancient Gods. But it is his final challenge by the suitors who wish to claim his wife and throne which is his greatest threat for they are led by the champion Antinoos Anthony Quinn from the island of Encephelonea. Only through a special contest and with the help of Athena can he regain his kingdom his wife and his son. This is a classic in its own right and like our hero has never been equaled. ".

If you'll remember your classical history and the recent movie Troy Ulysses was the guy who finally broke the siege at Troy with that wooden horse gambit. But as the Greeks ran amuck in Troy behaving very much like barbarians Cassandra the high priestess of Poseidon called on the big guy to do his very worst to Ulysses. Of course in the film Poseidon is called by his Roman name of Neptune.As Ulysses Kirk Douglas invests the part with his own combination of aggressiveness and charm. It ain't exactly the classics but realize that the film was aimed at a juvenile market and it works out rather well. Even the grownups will get a good hearty laugh at how the clever Ulysses outwits the Cyclops.Silvana Mangano does very well as the long suffering Penelope the wife of Ulysses who's needs just aren't being met and as Circe the witch whose profession kind of scares the guys away. Anthony Quinn has a small role as one of Penelope's suitors for the hand of the presumed widow. Why he took such a small part in a film I'm not quite sure but this would be the first of three films he did with Kirk Douglas. The next one Lust for Life would gain Quinn a second Oscar.Ulysses is not one of Kirk Douglas's greatest roles but the film still holds up well today and kids and grownups will appreciate it.".

	schema:headline " Kirk Douglas largerthanlife and the beauteous Silvana Mangano";
	schema:reviewBody "In this fantasyadventure based on Homer's epic poem The Odyssey Kirk Douglas is larger than life in the title role and Silvana Mangano is spellbindingly beautiful in the dual role of PenelopeCirce. Most importantly the story  script are compelling. The Cyclops sequence is a highlight and the FX are surprisingly good for 1954. Moreover the climax when Ulysses is revealed after posing as a beggar is dynamic. Sometimes it's necessary to temporarily kowtow to the arrogant in order to assess the situation and bide your time for an effective strike. In my humble opinion this version is better than the 1997 rendition with Armand Assante The Odyssey because it's more streamlined lacks the eyerolling manifestations of the gods and it's hard to beat Douglas' imposing portrayal. However The Odyssey is still worth checking out since the effects are more modern and there are some quality cast members and effective sequences particularly the crew's horrific confrontation with the threeheaded monster Scylla and the entire final act.The movie runs 117 minutes and was shot in Italy the Mediterranean Sea and North Africa.GRADE A".

Back home his wife Queen Penelope Silvana Mangano is urge by the people to remarry and the strong but arrogant Anthony Quinn is most determined to be the one. It's a battle of the strongest when Ulysses comes home to reclaim his wife son and kingdom.Surprisingly well filmed in spite of an obvious low budget it is a step above the Steve Reeves Hercules and Goliath films. Douglas didn't have to be dubbed like many of the other actors whose voices don't match their looks so he comes off unscathed. Special effects are good characterizations and plot are well fleshed out although some of the male costumes are quite skimpy and revealing of the male anatomy. This will never be in the category of Ray Harryhausen's mythic adventures but overall it is much better than average.".

As the scenes progressed I started to get a sense of dj vu. Halfway through I started predicting what was going to happen! If they meet a giant with one eye and get him drunk I've seen this movie I said to myself. Turns out I saw the movie in a high school English class!My teacher had assigned Homer's works for required reading but when the entire class flunked the test afterwards she knew something was wrong. No one understood what had happened in the story! She tried explaining it and cited passages to help our little brains connect the archaic language to what she was saying but again it went over our heads. Finally she knew there was only one way for us to learn Odyssey she showed us the movie.The second time aroundonce I remembered I'd seen the film beforeI was taken on a very enjoyable trip down Memory Lane. There's the giant! There are the sirens! The pigs! My review as you can probably tell is a little colored by my past. I have no idea how much I would have liked or disliked Ulysses if I'd seen it for the first time last month. You might turn it off and think it's ridiculous or you might think it's a clear understandable adaptation of a very dense classic poem. I consider this movie a sentimental favorite like the first version of The Nutcracker my teacher showed the class in fourth grade. Plus for half the movie Kirk Douglas practically prances around in his underwear so that's always fun.".

His final challenge is the suitors who want his wife and throne. Chief among them is Antinoos Anthony Quinn. With help from Athena Ulysseus regains his kingdom and Penelope. Gorgeous Silvano Mangano plays both Penelope and the enchantress Circe. Scenes focus on Silvano's hypnotic eyes and sensuous lips. In fact the film has a way of getting right up in the faces of its characters. The film seems old by modern standards but the strength and acting prowess of Kirk Douglas makes it relevant and worthwhile. Douglas recently turned 100 years old.".

	onyx:emotionText "It took 10 years for the Greek hero Ulysses to make his way back to Ithica after the Trojan War. Kirk Douglas is Ulysses. He overcomes the Cyclops the Sirens and Circe. His final challenge is the suitors who want his wife and throne. Chief among them is Antinoos Anthony Quinn. With help from Athena Ulysseus regains his kingdom and Penelope. Gorgeous Silvano Mangano plays both Penelope and the enchantress Circe. Scenes focus on Silvano's hypnotic eyes and sensuous lips. In fact the film has a way of getting right up in the faces of its characters. The film seems old by modern standards but the strength and acting prowess of Kirk Douglas makes it relevant and worthwhile. Douglas recently turned 100 years old.";

	schema:reviewBody "Like many here I remember seeing Ulysses when I was a kid probably at the Colonial Theatre in Harrisburg Pa. My memories are not as vivid as those of 7th Voyage of Sinbad which I saw at the same downtown theater but what kid could forget Ulysses' cannibalistic cyclops which was much more human andnightmarish than the one in 7th Voyage.The current Lionsgate DVD is welcome but something of a disappointment visually. I was somewhat put off by the dark opening scenes but when Ulysses' adventures kicked in I became quite involved.The story based on a condensation of the Odyssey moves along cutting between episodes from the hero's adventures returning from the Trojan war and his wife Penelope fending off greedy suitors on the home front.Clocking in at nearly 2 hours the film manages to evoke an epic feel on a modest budget. The special efx credited to the GermanAmerican Eugen Schfftan a pioneer in the field of optical effects are modest but effective especially the cyclops and ship wreck scenes.The screenplay credits eight writers includingAmericans Ben Hecht and novelist Irwin The Young Lions Shaw. There are some effective dramatic scenes particularly between Ulysses and the beautiful witch Circe whenduring their final confrontation they discuss the nature of life and death. The DVD is dubbed into English with apparently only Douglas and Anthony Quinn speaking for themselves.Before the flashbacks of Ulysses' long journey home a prologue in Ithaca includes a brief scene from the Trojan war as background though the famous wooden horse is not as spectacular as in another international production Helen of Troy 1956. Interestingly Rossana Podesta who here plays Nausicaa has the lead as Helen in that Robert Wise film. Silvana Mangano who plays both Penelope and Circe went on to become a major star in Italian cinema.Ulysses was among the early films to utilize American stars usually males on the way up or down from Clint Eastwood to Rory Calhoun mostly in Italian films of the spaghetti western andswordandsandal variety.Ulysses produced by Dino De Laurentiis and Carlo Ponti is several steps above the typical ss production. Kirk Douglas is an Americanized but quite the dashing Ulysses. I was never a big fan but he was certainly versatile and here his cool beard and longer hair make him a much more attractive even sexy hero than does the austere buzz cut lookhe sports in the later epic Spartacus 1960.Cinematography is by Hollywood veteran Harold Rosson which raises hopes that a higher quality DVD with a few extras might appear sometime in the future.".

I opted as always for the original version on the dvd and was amazed to hear Italian not English !!  I had no idea that Kirk Douglas could speak italian so fluently.......absolutely amazing !! That is unless the notes on the dvd were incorrect and it wasn't the original version at all but one dubbed into Italian. I suppose we'll never know!  I was expecting a better film than what I saw something of the quality of The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad but was rather disappointed with the script a lot of useless talk and not enough action ! I suppose this is what we can expect of Italian cinema  the director of the film was italian as were a number of the actors ! . The picture quality although announced as Technicolor had too much contrast plus clicks and spots and certainly left to be desired. There was a good passage with the Cyclops Polyphemus however we saw nothing of the sirens and I was desperately looking out for Charybde and Scylla but saw no sign of them. I really thought too much of the story had been omitted and too much time given over to boring soporific chat. Certainly not a film to be recommended !".

	schema:reviewBody "There isn't too much of Homer left in this comic book adventure detailing the voyage of Ulysses Kirk Douglas from the shores of Troy to his home in Ithaca. It's all pretty much boiled down. Gone are such distractions as Scylla and Charybdis and the naughty Calypso. But we still have an extended stay with Circe the witch Sylvana Mangano in which Douglas excels at comic self justification. He spends a comfortable night in Circe's bed and the next day presents himself and tells her he and his men are leaving on their ship. Circe slyly informs him that the wind doesn't pick up on this island until sundown. Well Douglas muses no point in leaving early. The men would break their backs on the oars. And they're all good men. They deserve a rest. So he spends the next five years eating lotus blossoms drinking wine and sleeping with Circe until his men go half nuts with waiting and leave him behind.If it resembles a typical sword and sandal epic from the 1950s starring one or another muscle man it's probably because it was made at Cinecitta and used many of the same cast and crew. And of course at featurefilm length it had to be compressed  Procrusteanized so to speak  in order to fit in as many episodes as it now contains.The scenes back on Ithaca with Penelope also Sylvana Mangano weaving her tapestry and unweaving it at night to keep the bloodsucking suitors at bay are retained and they're not as bad as they might be. Anthony Quinn is Antinuous chief of the suitors and he comes across not as a greasy freeloader but as a masculine commonsense kind of guy who just about convinces Penelope that his feelings for her are genuine and that Ulysses gone lo these ten years is dead. It's only just before the bloody climax that he reveals his truer nature. Some scenes are still fairly powerful given the cheap special effects. Ulysses' visit to Hades and his encounter with the dead who try to convince him that ANY kind of life is better than being dead. And Polyphemus is pretty horrible too. And there is a bit of wit built into the script. When they first notice Polyphemus' huge footprint the men quail and start muttering about giants. Probably just a man with big feet comments the phlegmatic Douglas the man who does not believe in isomorphism.Alas the gods are left out of the story which detracts from our understanding of what's going on and is a betrayal of the movie's Homeric source. I guess if you want gods and goddesses you have to go to Homer or Thorne Smith.Douglas is an adequate Ulysses. He's pretty sneaky. The film leaves out the noman ruse he used with the cyclops but includes the Trojan horse. And he looks right. Except for Quinn the rest of the cast doesn't really contribute much though Rossana Podesta as Nausicaa looks cute in a Cynthia Gibb way.Entertaining version of an epic tale.".

I'm the type of guy who enjoys some slapstick some raunchy humor and a lot of zanyness.I went into Zohan not expecting anything but pure frivolous humor. You don't go into films like this with any expectations and I think that's where a lot of the reviewers prior to myself went wrong. They went in expecting to see an evolution of Sandler's humor and while I would say that Zohan raised the bar a tad it's still Adam Sandler. Yes it's going to have a corny ending a lot of physical humor and a healthy dose of humor aimed at the more intelligent in the crowd as well.Overall I couldn't stop giggling laughing and chuckling throughout most of the film. After a long streak of not seeing any humor films I thought it was the perfect thing to bring me back to comedies. The last few years especially have been incredibly lackluster in regards to comedies if that's what evolution of the genre is count me out by the way and I found Zohan refreshing.I think another thing a lot of the other reviewers missed is that the film in no way expected to take itself seriously. The only serious moments were cheesy predictable and ultimately corny which is irony in itself and only contributed to my bemused chuckling. Yes a lot of the humor bordered on racial stereotyping there were a lot of overthetop accents and allusions to the Middle East so if you're the type to get touchy about that feel free to skip. I found it to be a rather hilarious joke on the seriousness that everybody applies to the stereotyping. The stereotyping is actually rather fair and towards the end even shows plenty of good stereotyping as accurate as stereotyping ever is which is to say rarely.Really the film laughs at itself. Are there some bum moments? Certainly but it seems that's been the case for almost every film I've seen in the last few years but it was grand seeing the cast and crew not try to make this the 'next great comedy' and just have a buttload of fun.And if the cast and crew are laughing at themselves which you can clearly feel through the screen you can't help but laugh with them.If you want to spend an hour or two snickering and have an open mind give Zohan a shot. Don't expect an evolution of comedy. Don't expect the bar to be raised because that's not what this film was trying to do. It was trying to be ridiculous and make people utter that ever so fantastic groaninggiggle followed by the heart chuckle.Don't let the other critics fool you they've probably forgotten the meaning of the word 'satire'.".

Yes this is the same company that brought us Happy Gilmore and Click. And yes while I have aged a bit since I could appreciate the his silliness there is still a part of me that enjoys the goofy fun that Adam Sandler likes to put on screen. I knew very well coming in to the 745 showing of You Don't Mess with the Zohan that this was going to be crazy. And sure enough it was. But you know what I liked it my friend liked it quite a few people in the audience liked it it was a good time had.Adam Sandler loves to put himself in ridiculous situations. In Gilmore he was a hockey nut with a hidden talent for golf. In Mr. Deeds he became a billionaire overnight. This guy has played football twice gone on fifty first dates paused and sped up his life and married Kevin James. Now he's an Isreali counterterrorist with a fetish for cutting hair. Oh and he loves making sexual remarks as much as Borat does. Sound familiar? Thought it did.So how does the humor compare to previous Sandler features? Well it's unfocused. Part of the problem is that three writers with different mentalities are writing the script. The silliness comes from Sandler the raunchy stuff comes from Apatow and everything else comes from Smigel. Although I found myself laughing at quite a few parts particularly when the Zohan was on the job as a soldier there were also a lot of parts where I was thinking to myself Come on. Another shot of the crotch? Or butt or some other sexual reference All of these various ingredients have been thrown in together and the end result is let's face it uneven.But though the movie may have lacked focus I couldn't help but have fun with it. You see unlike Mr. Deeds which I found boring and lame this film goes whole hog. Sandler and the cast surrounding him do almost everything in their power to make a joke out of something. These guys aren't sleepwalking through their roles to the contrary they're having a great time putting on a show. It's contagious. About halfway through the movie I began to realize the reason I was having fun with the Zohan was because this movie essentially gives out an open invitation to enjoy the silliness that was being presented. By the end of the movie Sandler had done the most outrageous acts I had seen him do since Happy Gilmore. And frankly I think I prefer Sandler when he just tries everything.Fans of Sandler will most likely enjoy this one nonfans should pass. For what it's worth You Don't Mess with the Zohan is a good continuation of the act Sandler has put on for us for over a decade now. Worth a Saturday matine.".

He's not afraid to push the envelope to garner a laugh. He knows he's capable of doing a more serious role and have success.

	schema:reviewBody "Zohan Dvir is a legendary Mossad agent known for his unique skills and indestructible nature but unlike his current violent job Zohan's dream is to become a hairdresser and bless the world with the gift of silkysoft and styled hair. He seems destined to never know this dream though until he decides to fake his own death during a battle with Palestinian freedom fighterterrorist The Phantom. One smuggled flight later Zohan arrives in New York to take up a position at the salon of Paul Mitchell but finds that he cannot just walk into this world of styling and washing. Refusing to work in an electric store Zohan finds work as a cleaner in a small salon run by a Palestinian woman where he waits his chance to prove his skills.The unusual title and setting for the characters were enough to make me forget that ultimately what I was about to watch was nothing more than an Adam Sandler comedy. You see mostly when you come to a Sandler comedy you know what you are going to get and have a feel for whether or not it is your type of thing. Now the quality of his films may vary but generally what he does and how he does it in most films is pretty constant. However Mossad agents who wish to pursue a dream of hairdressing in the US is not one of his usual themes and somehow I thought this might be more than just an Adam Sandler comedy as I have experienced them in the past.The film itself didn't allow me to sit in this misconception for very long as from the very start we find ourselves with physical comedy and jokes reliant totally on body parts and sex organs. This continues with ongoing humour drawn from a young man having intercourse with elderly women on a frighteningly regular basis. Of course if I still hadn't worked it out then what really reminds me where I am is that the entire film is silly beyond belief but yet also still finds time for a stunning young woman to fall for the main character no matter how arrogantstupidunlikable he is  a persistent thread in Sandler films. So knowing what you are getting into is important but once there what does Zohan do for the casual viewer  ie not the audience member who puts Sandler as 1 on the list of all time comedians but rather someone who sees him as at best a man who can turn his juvenile comedy into a guilty pleasure. Well Zohan is not really that funny a film but it just about has enough wild humour and creativity to it to make it quite fun. I was not laughing out loud that often but it did have plenty of amusing moments that made me not hate it  which was a possibility. What helps it is that it throws itself totally into how nonsensical it all is and never really attempts to step away from it thus maintaining the tone that is knowingly silly and makes it possible for the audience to accept this and not unfairly expect anything more.Of course this does not make it brilliant by any means and the film is still only silly fun and not a hilarious comedy that is accessible to all. Sandler himself throws himself into his role and his accent even if he still has the same crude material as ever. The fact that he makes fun of the IsraelPalestine situation is a move that gives his material a different feel but it is essentially a different doorway to the same material. He plays up the silly aspect but of more help is a wonderfully daft Turturro Schneider and others who get easy laughs without the need to progress plot. As she did in In The Mix Chriqui concentrates on being light and sexy  not that easy with her accent but she does her basic requirement.Zohan looks like it will be a daring and imaginative comedy but beyond the basic design of the film the material is pretty much what you would expect from an Adam Sandler film in so much as it is crude silly and aimed at a teenage market. It is silly and if you are in the mode it is quite fun but if you are looking for anything more than that then you'll be disappointed. An usual Adam Sandler film but still very much an Adam Sandler film.".

This movie is a comedy and it stars Adam Sandler if you walk into that theater expecting anything except a stupidfunny movie then you need to instead leave the theater to go home and hit yourself in the face with a rock after all it can't do more damage to your brain. In the most simple of terms this movie stars Adam Sandler if you do not find him and his over the top antics funny then I would delicately suggest that you do not see his movies as I understand they are not for everyone. To preempt any whining from people saying that Other Adam Sandler films made me laugh but this one was not the same let me remind you that the movie you just saw was called You Don't Mess with the Zohan NOT Happy Gilmore. If you walked into this theater expecting to see Happy Gilmore then again let me remind you that you can actually buy Happy Gilmore on DVD and also there is a rock at home for your face. NEWSFLASH! Movies do have differences from one another and thank heavens they do or the only Adam Sandler movie we would ever have is Happy Gilmore recycled over and over. Finally and perhaps most important of all this movie was never intended to somehow explain or even explore the difficult and tense situation in the Middle East it was not even necessarily supposed to poke fun at it. This movie was supposed to make you laugh. If you laughed and had a good time then who cares? Everyone in the theater with me was laughing through the movie and having a good time. That is what I look for in a comedy so thumbs up Sandler for a fun night out.".

The laughs in the theater were very loud and seemed to be coming from throughout the auditorium. Perhaps this humor isn't for everyone but it never occurred to me until now that there would be so many lower ratings. I say this because I most always feel the reviews here at IMDb are right on and rely upon them for my movie going choices. My wife feels the same way about this...very confused at the lower score.

Being from Israel I found his jokes funny and very witty. I don't know if noneIsraeli's would find half the jokes funny though. The movie tried to delve into the whole IsraeliArab conflict but it doesn't go deep enough to make much of a point.See the movie if you wanna laugh A lot but don't see it if your looking for a an Oscar movie night.".

	schema:reviewBody "You know sometimes I just don't understand what the heck is going through Adam Sandler's head. He's a funny guy with natural charisma and I would guess a reasonable level of intelligence. So why does he feel compelled to write and produce films of such appallingly low quality? It worked with his initial efforts Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. Those two films defied any sense of logical criticism. They were sloppy yet contained a maniacal sense of anarchic glee. He seemed thrilled at what he was getting away with. Yet since the release of those films over a decade ago he has continued to crank out bythenumbers mediocrity that lacks any feeling of comic discovery.It is my unfortunate duty now to inform you that his latest You Don't Mess With The Zohan is by far his most wretchedly awful film to date. Sandler's character this time a Mossad agent who dreams of being a hairdresser would probably fill a lame Saturday Night Live skit but stretched to over 100 minutes is akin to Chinese water torture.Zohan isn't any normal secret agent he's a walking caricature of crass Middle Eastern stereotypes and snickering vulgarity. With a Wham!inspired haircut and a penchant for shtupping elderly women he finds employment at a small salon run by the sweet yet blank Dalia Emmanuelle Chriqui a Palestinian woman with no patience for Zohan's sexism. As can be predicted despite their antagonistic relationship they soon are yearning to make the bamboom. Their insipid love story intermingles with a laughfree subplot featuring Zohan's nemesis the Phantom John Turturro and a hapless Arab cabdriver Rob Schneider ladies and gentlemen... ineptly planning murder attempts.Now racial stereotyping and crude humor can be used to great comic effect in the proper hands. The makers of Borat toed the line brilliantly delivering great vulgar hilarity mixed with social commentary. You Don't Mess With The Zohan is not even in the same time zone much less ballpark. The film is amazingly hostile and meanspirited mocking its targets with unfiltered scorn for the majority of the running time yet tacking on a we're all the same message at the end. It's like the schoolyard bully who beats the snot out of you all semester but wishes you a good summer at when vacation time rolls around. Why did no one involved in this debacle pull Sandler aside and gently suggest that this material was unfilmable? Also concerning is the amount of animal abuse presented for cheap laughs. There is a particularly soulkilling scene featuring Zohan and two friends playing hackysack with a cat. Now a good writer would use this undeniably objectionable act as a springboard to a larger payoff. That would redeem the bad taste and warrant the scene's inclusion. Not here however where the only apparent joke is that a trio of grown men are kicking the stuffing out of a helpless animal.What is almost fascinating about Zohan is how little interest the screenwriters have in their own story. New story lines are launched at random to replace the ones running out of gas. I couldn't believe that the introduction of an evil landdeveloper to the film occurred near the end of the second act. It would seem that writers' Sandler Judd Apatow and Robert Smigel knew that their material was limited and hoped that by padding it liberally no one would notice. Hence the heavy helping of crotch closeups homophobia hummus jokes and dry humping present. As well the endless cameos come off as desperate and pointless although it is amusing that Mariah Carey has finally found a fitting companion piece for Glitter.To call You Don't Mess With The Zohan a misfire is a grand understatement. It's a dreary trudge through migraineinducing territory that is all the more unforgivable considering the level of talent involved. There's an old adage that it takes true skill and artistry to create a truly horrific film as hacks will only produce bland mediocrity. Well Zohan is a colossal achievement a film that will receive endless mentions on Worst of 2008 lists and the rants of legions of angry ticketbuyers. With that said though Sandler may have inadvertently found a point of agreement for Israelis and Palestinians. I think that both sides would agree that You Don't Mess With The Zohan flatout SUCKS!".

	schema:reviewBody "You Don't Mess With the Zohan is the newest regurgitated hitfest unleashed upon us by the brilliant minds of comedian Adam Sandler and director Dennis Dugan. The movie chronicles the absurd zany story of Zohan Dvir a ridiculously offensive special agent of an Isralei counterterrorism organization known as the Mossad. His extraordinarily stupid fake accent and personality that would insult the intelligence of an eleven year old give the writers Adam Sandler Judd Apatow and SNL writer Robert Smigel the framework to create a movie that is incomprehensibly bad. The movie begins with Zohan in his home country doing stupid hit which is what he does pretty much for the entire movie. As the movie scrapes along you're pondering what the hell Zohan is even supposed to be. How does he have super powers? Is he a superhero? Why the hell am I watching this? Why does Adam Sandler always have to play the role of a super savvy coolguy when the only reason anyone really liked Happy Gilmore Billy Madison Bulletproof The Wedding Singer Big Daddy Little Nicky or Mr. Deeds is because of his supporting cast? Why can't Adam Sandler play a pedophile addicted to methamphetamines who is married to a retarded homosexual and spends his free time wiping his ass with an American Flag? Veiled behind the facade of a retarded accent a stupid haircut and a constant beating of dick jokes narrow minded cultural references and pretty much anything else that would annoy anyone with a shred of dignity Zohan expresses aspirations of becoming a hair stylist in which he will make people s' hair silky smoothwhich he repeats at least SEVEN times before the movie ends and you stop wishing to stick your head in an oven for watching this hideous abomination which is another stupid idiosyncrasy of every single Adam Sandler movie in the past nine years which is including a subtle reference to one of his older movies which the writers apparently think is cute. After a literal five minute long homosexual joke he moves to America.Not long after his arrivalin...you guessed it... NEW YORK CITY!!! where every single movie ever made takes place he finally achieves his goal of becoming a hairstylist. Nearly an hour into the movie a bit of plot is finally revealed the time between had to be used as filler for Adam Sandler tea bagging at least twenty different characters and further humiliating himself into oblivion. Zohans' arch enemy Palestinian terrorist leader Phantom John Turturro reveals himself. Apparently he is also a superhero like Zohan. There are several scenes illogically strewn together depicting Zohan doing some more stupid hit and further cementing this movie as being the most racist mainstream movie ever made that the American public completely ignores because they're too dense to be able to comprehend anything that isn't expressed explicitly. When there's about a half hour left in the movie I'm probably not correct on the time frame because I was trying my hardest not to pay attention to the movie for fear that the movie would have pulled me into the depths of insanity so try to bare with it Zohan enlists the help of socialite millionaires to aid him in his battle against Phantom. Among these people is Michael Buffer the famous boxing announcer. I'm still in awe of the throngs of people who were dragged screaming into this fiasco. But I'm still frustrated because of the relentless cameos. Seriously it is not necessary in any movie. I know that I'm skipping around the plot a bit but I am trying not to think too much about this movie. At the end of the movie the Palestinians led by Phantom and the Israelis led by Zohan have an ultra explosionfilled showdown in the streets of New York as the result of some idiotic subplot regarding Rob Schneiders'affinity for his goat because every single person who lives in the middle east who isn't a terrorist is a goat farmer some other retarded subplot and some other retarded subplot. The movie predictably ends with each group realizing their differences and learning to love each other. There. I spoiled the entire movie for you because it really doesn't matter.In the midst of all of the racism sexism xenophobia and pretty much every other idiotic antisocial American sentiment that entrenched this travesty of a film there is one notion for me that resides over all others. It is the fact that the creators of this movie actually thought that they were making a good movie. To me that is mind boggling. Overall I give this movie a 2 out of 10 because there were a total of three times when I chuckled at the movie. It's a pretty bad ratio because the movie has to have the record of most attempts at trying to make its audience laugh. However it was agonizing to watch so I'll give it a 1 out of spite.".

Stupid. It might have you grabbing your sides in 98' but when you watch it its somewhat like OK let me guess Rob Schneider is going to pop up and say something dumb with a 'pause for laughter' moment? Yup.Is Sandler going to do a stupid voice the whole movie and end on a 'touching theme'?. Yup.Acting is good I will give it that. However if you have seen any Adam Sandler movie then you won't be surprised with his acting choices. Same choices different accent.Nothing against Sandler his movies were great.......in 98'I'd wait for DVD...if that.".

Absolutely on the level on movies such as Happy Gilmore maybe better in its own way. Now don't get me wrong all of the humor is juvenile and the movie is certainly not going to win any Oscars but expect people to be quoting it left and right cause nearly every line is hilarious. Look out for this movie guys cause its going to be a hit without a doubt.".

Also the crude language and the ohtoomuch crotch view makes it quite impossible to let your kids watch the movie which is a pity because I find the hilarious fight scenes and the Zohan's supernatural cool stunts would have been fun for kids to watch.Second point of view would be from an Arab point of view I started watching this movie preparing myself to get offended and mind you I am a very broad minded person ... However I was pleasantly surprised for the first time in my life I see a movie that does not picture Arabs as animallike heartless brainless killing machines. They are just people trying to make a living even the avenging one has a reason the Zohan stole his goat.Watching this movie I tried to forget that I am an Arab and I see that it is portraying  in a very silly and somehow inaccurate way  two opposing sides and suggesting that they stop fighting get over their differences to see that they are in fact similar.The movie makers get my personal thank you for that it is no different than watching a movie about the conflict between black and white people after the civil war or about Americans and Japanese directly after WWII there is no prejudices against Arabs here.For the very first time someone has discovered that Arabs are human beings too.

	schema:reviewBody "What has happened to Adam Sandler? Billy Madison is one of my alltime favorite comedies the romanceinclined Wedding Singer is fantastic and his forays into serious farePunchDrunk Love and Reign Over Mehave shown the talent hidden beneath the 5year old trapped in a 40year old body routine. As far as his production company's new work goes in my opinion a lot is left to be desired. Sadly You Don't Mess with the Zohan does nothing to alleviate those feelings. Yes the trailer looked absolutely horrible but I still held hope that something would click and give me an enjoyable experience once again. Don't get me wrong I definitely laughed throughout it's just that those laughs were more out of embarrassment for those on screen and because if I didn't chuckle at the asinine events I would have needed to walk out from boredom. It appears that the Judd Apatow name means zilch when attached to a film he does not deem important enough to direct himself. This one is marginally better than Walk Hard his last script helper but not by much.The concept at hand has some potential. With an utterly preposterous subplot involving Sandler's Israeli Mossad agent faking his death in a fight with the leading Palestinean terrorist in the Middle East so that he can come to America and live his dream of being a hairstylist you won't be thinking anything will be learned by watching. However there are some moments that shed some criticism to the fight in the Middle East over land and religion as well as bringing up issues of compromise and acceptance for success in the US. As one Israeli says he has just as hard a time fitting in as the Arabsbecause Americans confuse him as one. These two sides look similar speak similar and hold a large amount of national pride containing a lot more in common than the war would like to admit. Leave it to Sandler and company to lambaste these moments with absurdity and broad humor sending up the issue while also shining light on it although in a very dumbed down manner. Would I have liked more of this and less sexual innuendo? I don't really think it would have helped any.Right from the start we are shown what to expectphysical humor sight gags and obnoxiously drawn out sequences that start out funny yet finally fall flat. If the craziness leaves any mark it's the fact that Sandler got in pretty good shape for this role. Did he do so because of the script or did he write it all to show off? Unnecessarily gratuitous shots of his backside complete with fish and hacky sacks finding their way there only made me hope that some real comedy was coming soon. Instead what we get is an abundance of Hummus horrible fake accents I need to believe these were purposely bad especially Chris Rock's and as many allusions to Sandler's Scrappy Coco satisfying the elderly clientele he cuts hair for as possible. There are some surprises such as the truth to what is in his shorts as well as the plethora of cameos straight from left field Dave Matthews?! but for the most part it is a completely obvious string of random events tied together with a thin plot line that really is secondary to the setpieces and toilet humor.While the sex jokes got old really fasthow many times can he hump the women and spray water suggestively before our smiles turn to yawnsthe ethnic ones had a bit more life. Hummus as a universal food aside I did find the random disco moments and Mariah Carey tshirts humorous for the most part and the faulty Hezbollah phone line is priceless. Rob Schneider and John Turturro are overthetop hams as always actually a positive thing never taking the roles seriously. Even Sandler for what it's worth plays the part well. The racial stereotypes definitely trump anything on display throughout the writers involved holding nothing back and having no shame at all. And Emmanuelle Chriqui is absolutely gorgeous and likable playing a similar role to her part on Entourage with the addition of a bad accent.After all the headshaking and prayers for the film to either get better or just end it is the supporting cast that leaves the only real indelible mark. The surprise cameos are just too many to mention and for the most part successful across the board. While the Zohan is a onenote joke beaten to death those surrounding him attempt to infuse a little variety. Unfortunately the final result reminds me more of a recent Saturday Night Live skit containing a funny premise and then killing it by not knowing when to stop while ahead. Even after seeing the foot fight in the trailers the actual scene was still pretty hilarious. But what do the filmmakers do? Oh yes they use the gimmick a few more times including a sad extended sequence in a fight scene at the end concerning new shoes squeezing any laughter that might have still remained out way too early.".

	schema:reviewBody "You will be marinated in Russianness after watching this gritty crime drama shot in St. Petersburg. Set in the early 1990s after the fall of Soviet communism it's a movie whose costar is the place. The crime and gunplay in the foreground which cropped up after the collapse of stern authority seems to perfectly match what we see in the background  trashstrewn streets grimy flats drugfueled nightclubs. Everyone is poor or barely getting by. Even the gangsters who you'd think would have some Scarfacetype perks seem to live in squalor.One thing that will instantly strike you is how everyone in the movie looks like someone you know not a Hollywood star. I want to call particular attention to Svetlana Pismichenko the film's love interest who plays the driver of a streetcar that hauls lumber ?. She's not pretty at all but you see the love she is capable of and all I can say is I wish she were my girlfriend. Her last scene is one of the most memorable portraits of heartbreak I have ever seen. She has incredible eyes.Sergei Bodrov plays the lead a soldier just back from Chechnya who is drawn into his brother's gangland activities. We never see a flashback of what happened over there and when asked by others in the film what he did grins and said he was a clerk in HQ. As we come to see the fearlessness and ruthlessness he is capable of it is obvious he is lying. This man is steel tempered in a furnace. His gangster enemies are no match for a man with his willingness to prepare for and face death.I've never been to Russia but I lived in the Czech Republic for three years and I can testify to the authenticity of this movie's backdrop. When the Iron Curtain fell it revealed decaying rust belt cities but also a toughminded population of attractive and spirited people who somehow found ways to be happy in tough times. I am American and half Polish and this movie made me proud to be a Slav.A scene in the movie is a homage to Russian good cheer. It is a party in a Russian flat where a few dozen people are chatting eating smoking pot drinking vodka singing along to a guitar shooting pool and having fun. They're all young people in their 20's. You'll wish you were at that party.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really liked this movie. It was a gangster crime movie but in a totally different style than most American films. There was a good story and great visuals of Russia. I liked the fact that not everything had to be explained to the audience. The director assumed that we were able to think for ourselves i.e. the lead character's 'true' past in the army. I don't believe that he was just a clerk at HQ. I saw the DVD version and watched the interview with the director. The film is even more amazing considering the shoestring budget. He got his friends to perform some of the acting roles as well as write and play the music which was quite good. This is a great gritty film. Its one of the more watchable movies from Russia that I have seen. I gave it a 7 out of 10. I plan to see 'Prisoner of the Mountain' next can't wait.".

This movie will be misunderstood by many Westerners I am Russian myself because it does not fit the traditional Hollywood screenplay style  and its characters do not behave themselves like most Hollywood characters would in a crime drama.

Throughout the movie there are long stretches of Danila making explosives sawing off a shot gun and fashioning weapons with Nau music playing.  The rest of the movie consists mainly of him using these weapons at his job as a hitman.  Make no mistake there is depth to this film.  It is more than an excuse to show violence.Danila is an interesting character.  At the ame time he blows away people regularly with no remorse and little thought.  Its his job may as well do it well. I watched this as part of a film series at college in the original Russian and the group of Russians sitting behind me laughed at many points.  The laughter confused me a bit but the second time I saw it was pretty funny and not in the usual one liner sense of action movies.  I especially liked the part where Danila asks if he can copy the directors Nau CD.I highly recommend this film for people who either like random violence or can tolerate it for the sake of an interesting plot.  The film has a distinctive feel to it.".

	schema:headline " Personal and cultural connections in Brat Note this contains possible spoilers!";
	schema:reviewBody "In the film Brat themes surrounding relationships and family take on broader meanings in Russian culture. The main character Danila returns to visit his brother Viktor at his mother's insistence. The relationship between the brothers is unlike what one would expect Viktor even betrays Danila at one point. Danila does not make a real connection with anyone by the end he has severed ties with everyone he had met. Interestingly his actions form a parallel to Russia's attempts to leave behind the past and hint at possible attitudes toward other cultures.The title Brother itself indicates that the relationship between the brothers is the most important in the film. Viktor was much like a father to Danila in the past indicating that their relationship while always close had changed over the years. Viktor's character represents the past he is successful only because of his criminal dealings as many were during the Soviet days. Danila is pulled into these dealings of the past because he has no other direction just as the present Russia was still unsure of where it was going. The past is well known and understood even if it is not the best course of action. Danila kills other gangsters who are clearly part of this past world he operates within the system in order to destroy it. In many instances he must kill these individuals out of defense just as certain aspects of the old Soviet culture had to be destroyed or they would ruin the new way of life Even Sveta's situation represents the past. Danila tries to free her from her abusive relationship yet she is disgusted with the way he tries to help her. Similarly many people might not be willing to kill off or sever ties with the past it is the only life they have known.Other people who Danila meets are similarly different forces acting on the culture some of them could stand for foreign influences in Russia. The girl Ket exemplifies Western culture particularly America she likes to party and eat McDonalds. Ket's obsession with money also depicts the stereotypical American perspective. Danila eventually breaks off connection with her giving her some money before leaving her. This attitude illustrates the fact that while the new Russia is open to the far western influence of America the people do not necessarily want to accept this culture nor is it a good idea for them to do so if they wish to maintain their own identity. Danila's relation to the German represents the general Russian relation to this western European country. Russia's relations with Germany have occasionally been somewhat tense and the character points out what is good for the Russian is death for the German. The German refuses the money that Danila offers him in the end perhaps a statement that Germany or maybe Europe in general has no tolerance for the morally corrupt way of the old Soviet Union. Indeed Danila brings the bodies to the graveyard where the German and others stay urging him to give them a decent burial. It seems that the new Russia wants other Europeans to figuratively bury the past and can not necessarily accomplish this task alone. However the fact that Danila breaks off ties with the German shows a desire for Russia to deal with the past in its own way. Whether or not this will lead to trouble in the future is uncertain. Yet it seems that Danila is entirely capable of dealing with these problems on his own even though the means by which he does so is not ideal in most eyes.".

The music of Nautilus makes the atmosphere of being there just at the moment of the story development. This band was on the top of it's popularity at the moment of the middle 1990's. There are a lot of people here allover the Post Soviet places who are fans of the band.Any way  this movie is about some real aspects of real Post Soviet history.".

He never once in the movie betrays a promise and he helps anyone in trouble that crosses his path. Although he seems to find it easy shooting and killing other mafia killers he puts himself in the 'hero' role on the streets protecting innocent people from harm such as the German and the ticket collector on the bus.His taste in music reflects aspects of his personality his disdain for American and European dance music mirrors his views on these countries and how the army has built in an unnecessary unreasonable bitterness for certain types of people i.e. Jewsinto his mind without him really understanding why he feels this way. He says 'whats the difference?' when referring to Jews and Germans and Americans and French people showing his lack of real experience with people of these nations and thus his ignorance.His relationship with the battered wife I think represents his need to do good perhaps out of guilt for all the wrong he has done. The casting of her as a blatantly unattractive woman who is much older than Danila and who's character has absolutely nothing in common with him is important in front of him is not a woman he is in love with but someone who is in dire need of a hero and of something positive in her life. Thus he does his best to make her happy only failing in my view because the relationship is not real the passion isn't really there.Unlike most people i enjoyed Brother more than the sequel to it it is understated but says a lot about society and about relationships. There is so much to say about it yet so little time!".

	schema:reviewBody "In the movie Brother the hero Danila has two different sides to his personality his creative peaceful inner life that comes with his music versus his desire to get more powerful making more money by killing and climbing the ladder of success with rapid steps. Danila loves music very much. Music is like a gateway to his inner peaceful life. He buys new CDs and keeps listening them on his compact disc player when is strolling around the streets of St. Petersburg. We listen to the songs that he listens to and we can sometimes understand the mood of the moment. Also Danila does not act selfish when he gets money in his hands even though he worked hard to earn it by risking his life and killing people. However he is not selfish and shares the money he gets with his friends and especially the two women in the movie Sveta and Kat is concerned he does not hesitate to share his money with them. He wants Sveta to enjoy his music hoping that she would be able to share his inner life. He buys a VCR and together with Sveta they watch some music clips.Throughout the movie Danila gets richer and more comfortable with the city. He keeps buying more CDs to listen to and we see him walking around the city more and more. One time while he was listening to music and strolling a man comes out from the corner and shoots Danila at the same time Danila shoots him. Both of them get hit the assassin dies but Danila was hit on compact disc player which breaks down but Danila is unharmed. This is actually an important event in the movie. The breaking of the compact disc player would mean that Danila would no longer be able to listen to music. Yet for one last time the music literally protects him. Further more he would not be able to get in touch with his inner life and he does not get another compact disc player. Also from another point of view this event could be considered as the end of Danila's peaceful inner life. It could be interpreted that the city has weakened him and took away some part of him although he might be still powerful with a shotgun and with his skills. He thinks there is more action more money and more power in Moscow so he is going there.".

The unclean fly markets at every metro station immorality adoration for worst of western culture or dismissing it with unearned hubris all ring very real. President Putin got Russia out of this mud and it is no surprise that he is ever so popular. Despite it being essentially a populist commercial Russian potboiler pandering and complimenting the worst instincts of this sometimes great but often self absorbed nation it is worth a watch if only to understand how decline and decadence look like up close. Russians might tap themselves over their thick shoulders telling that it is movie speaking only to themselves but this movie is in fact very successful not only in over the top pandering managing to earn director enough money to move to more serious projects luckily for everyone but also for revealing beneath the nationalistic facade the true face of well deserved decline after decades of Russian imperial lism in the cloak of being the main bearer of socialist idea that they almost ruined  a fate that awaits the Amuricans too as the Soviets were as conceited as they are before hitting the rock bottom during the well deserved but awakening Yeltsin years".

The movie is multilayered you can watch in as an action movie a social analysis of the period even a Dostoevskylike study on the value of brotherhood and after all a unique picture of what Russia is was and will be.The story is told brilliantly the main character Danila doesn't tell or brag about his past he actually makes himself out to be a humble guy instead of saying he served in the hot spot in the war and was given recognition and bravery award for saving his platoon members he often reminds people that he was far from combat he is passionate and caring and not aggressive at all.If you were in S. Petersburgh in the early nineties you feel this movie has been able to grab a cubic meter of air of the city at that time pack it and give it to its viewers to breathe.filled with excellent performances especially by Sergei Bodrov III and Yuri Kutznetsov. I was swept away by the story and characters thrown into their world. I'd have to say it's a MUST SEE!!!".

Oh yea the main character Danila is quite a character.  A very likable guy though he dislikes jews and film directors not to mention America and anyone from the Caucases but he is cool with Germans  go figure likes Nautilus Pompilius very kind too when he has the money he is always ready to share somewhat dimwitted but at the same time very prompt and knows what's cooking.  He obviously was in Chechen war but always dodges the questions about his army experience because er it's repugnant to him.  So he is all that and he is also a cold blooded killer with no remorse.  Man Dostoyevskiy must be turning in his grave!  But can you really judge Danila? He embodies a significant part of Russian society. A good thing about the movie is that director Aleksei Balabanov doesn't try to do it either but lets the viewer decide on hisher own. Among other things the movie also boasts a unique St. Petersburgh atmosphere an image of a selfsacrificing Russian woman Danila's lover a villain who constantly uses saying and proverbs in his speech and of course a brief appearance by Mr. Butusov of Nautilus Pompilius fame. And let us not forget Danila's spiritual advisor of sort  the intellectual bum Nemetz who definitely knew what he was talking about when he called the city an evil force. I could go further with this review but why don't you just see this movie for yourself...".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes it is certainly nothing new that these German Edgar Wallace movies from the 1960s and 1970s always include a fair dose of humor and this one here takes it to the next level. Some of the supporting characters are written in such a way that it almost has a Theo Lingen touch of comedy and I am not only talking about the very final scene here of course. The sound effects are very much over the top as are the ways in which people theatrically die and occasionally they even make fun of the dramatic music. And honestly I have to say that I think all this is pretty positive. But this is not because it adds a whole lot to the film but because the dramatic and crime action in here is fairly uninteresting. The hunchback mentioned in the title is really just a minor character looking at how he does not have a lot of screen time. The real antagonist for almost the entire film is a Kevin Spacey lookalike. And back to the hunchback his costume looks also pretty bad although this may have been even intended in the sense of comedy once again as well. Director is Alfred Vohrer and he made several other Edgar Wallace films not just this one from 50 years ago. The cast has not too many big names this time compared to other films from the series that have sometimes 3 or more actors that are still known today here in Germany. All in all I give Der Bucklige von Soho a thumbsdown. I was not impressed by it apart from some weirdly funny moments occasionally. Also the James Bond references feel very much off the mark if not copied uninterestingly.".
