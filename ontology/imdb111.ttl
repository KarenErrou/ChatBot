Imaginative story great cast who despite other reviews do not phone it in Wargames is a true gem as it was recently listed by AFI as one of the top 100 sci fi movies of all time. Broderick was perfect as a slacker teen and Ally Sheedy turns in one of her best performance making the most of an under developed character. Dabney Coleman showed why he was one of the busiest actors in the 1980's though he always better cast as a villain and Barry Corbin could play almost anything convincingly. while the special effects may be dated by todays standard Wargames helped shape the way people think and speak.

	schema:reviewBody "Cyberthrillers may not have started with WarGames but it was here the form achieved an early peak. As more filmmakers follow its example of portraying a hightech faceoff between man and machine WarGames remains a standard to be measured against. While it's not a film classic it's a very very good popcorn thriller of uncommon craft charm and humanity.Seattle high schooler David Lightman Matthew Broderick has only a few hours to undo what he thought was a sneak preview of an upcoming computer game but what instead got him tinkering with the U.S. Air Force's WOPR War Operation Planned Response computer system in such a way as to trigger a countdown to World War III. The FBI thinks he's a Soviet spy while classmate Jennifer Mack Ally Sheedy is wondering if this isn't all really about a rejiggered biology grade.Broderick is solid and Sheedy even better but what really sells this film is everything else. Start with the excellent supporting performances. John Wood as a reclusive professor and Barry Corbin as a tobaccochewing general get much of the kudos and rightly but there's a whole deep bench of quality work beyond that like Kent Williams as a curt White House advisor William Bogert and Susan Davis as David's outofit parents Alan Blumenfeld as the swaggering bully of a biology teacher and Juanin Clay as a beautiful but underappreciated assistant even by herself as she uses her own mouth as an ashcan for her boss's discarded gum. You know the casting people behind this movie were on the ball when the opening sequence features two very recognizable faces those of Michael Madsen and John Spencer in what were film debuts for both.That sequence with Madsen and Spencer as missile men point up another quality of WarGames the way the movie works in terms of setting up expectations and developing pace. The harrowing business between the two of them is mercilessly presented Turn your key sir! and then effectively abandoned so as to work in the central storyline the replacement of these men with computers. We get a macroview where Dabney Coleman as a tunnelvisioned warroom executive effectively makes the case for taking the men out of the loop and then zoom back into what seems a totally unrelated story that of slacker teen David Lightman and his high school travails.The film could have just started with Lightman and worked its way out to the business with the WOPR. But the early peek behind the curtain is a clever way of raising the stakes with the audience before the protagonist realizes what's up.The set design cinematography lighting and editing all work wonders as well. The NORAD warroom is really a character onto itself the ultimate source of reality in this film and better for my money than the warroom in Dr. Strangelove' an obvious inspiration. The way the cameras dart around from terminal to terminal as uniformed USAF technicians follow the progress of an apparent Soviet attack lighting onto one of them just before he or she relays an important piece of information is highly addictive and entertaining.There's some sloppiness in the movie. Madsen and Spencer's talk about this great pot Spencer's character has scored strains credulity in the highsecurity setting they are in and its blindingly obvious that the two men we see exiting a helicopter and entering a jeep during the credits are not the same two men getting out of the jeep moments later. The musical score is terrible except for the elegiac tune at the end by which time it's too late. And there's no real examination of the morality of Lightman's serial lawbreaking.But this is a funny exciting consciousnessraising movie that is as entertaining now with the Cold War more than a decade behind us as it was all those years ago. For all the technical innovation on display it's ironically appropriate we remember it for showing us how to butter an ear of corn because it's the human side of the equation WarGames' keeps in its sights at all times.The DVD features a terrific candid commentary from director John Badham and writers Lawrence Lasker and Walter Parkes that gives one a real appreciation for the value of creative license as well as factual diligence in making a film of this kind work.".

	schema:headline " Let's play Global Thermonuclear War";
	schema:reviewBody "WarGames is a film which in some ways seems hopelessly dated and in other ways seems to have been way ahead of its time. There's the Cold War angle the United States and the Soviet Union gearing up for the seemingly inevitable World War III and the nuclear holocaust that would go along with it. It's a 1980s storyline which doesn't play as well all these years later with the Soviet Union long having been consigned to the dustbin of history. Nowadays the threat comes not from one communist superpower but from...well pretty much anywhere it seems. But then again this movie made in 1983 is at its heart really about a computer hacker. Who in 1983 even knew there was such a thing as a computer hacker? Ahead of its time this movie is.While certain aspects of the story may seem less relevant today there is no denying that WarGames is an effective entertaining thriller. There may be some flaws in the movie's logic now and again not everything we see seems entirely plausible. But the movie works. The story centers around Seattle high school student David Lightman who is not doing particularly well in school. But it's not because he isn't bright he certainly is. He just seems unmotivated and perhaps distracted by his obsession with computers. That obsession plays itself out as he attempts to hack into a video game manufacturer's computer...and instead unknowingly hacks into a Defense Department computer. In playing the games on that computer he almost starts World War III. Whoops.Matthew Broderick plays David and his performance is excellent as he portrays a young teen who finds himself caught up in a situation behind his imagination. Ally Sheedy plays his friend Jennifer a character who seems a tad bit underdeveloped. It often seems that Jennifer's just along for the ride rather than having any real purpose in the plot. But Sheedy does well with what she has to work with. Our young hero and heroine are very much the focus of the story at times to detrimental effect. All the adults in the story seem rather onedimensional. Some of them have very important roles to play in the story yet we never know much of anything about them. Besides David and Jennifer there's really only one other character for whom there is any kind of character development going on and that character doesn't even show up until rather late in the proceedings. But this is a movie which will definitely hold your attention. It's a tense taut thriller which also has some heart to it. And it often looks spectacular most notably in the scenes which take place inside the NORAD war room a movie set which was stunningly impressive for its time and actually would still be stunningly impressive today. All in all WarGames is a wellmade suspenseful enjoyable film. It has its flaws but it is still a film well worth seeing.".

The performances are good but I disliked and didn't believe the performance of the man who should have played the woodenhead general. It seemed to be too overacted.

Just as resonant as Gloria Swanson asking Mr De Mille for her closeup. Or John Candy's heartfelt I like me speech in Planes Trains  Automobiles. The difference between Joshua and those people is Joshua is not a real person. Just a computer. But a computer that has a very difficult time distinguishing fantasy from reality. A computer with the same foibles as any flesh and blood person.WarGames was so ahead of its time in so many ways. The way it embraced modems the use of computer jargon like firewalls. Commonplace things today but practically unheard of back in 1983. Granted some of the technology may have dated you get to see an actual floppy disk but the film's message hasn't faded. And nor has its power. They're just as strong as ever.David Lightman Matthew Broderick is the classic hitech nerd. He's a bright boy. He knows the ins and outs of all the computers. And he hacks into systems with all the skill of a safecracker. But he's an underachiever at school. Hasn't got many friends. And he gets on the wrong side of all the teachers. And his parents.David is far more interested in playing computer games. And when he learns a toy company is planning to release up to date ones in a few months he wants the inside story. So he hacks into systems until he finds the right one. And he finds one alright. But not the system he thinks.When he taps into Joshua David gets the chance to play Global ThermoNuclear War. And accidentally sets in motion the countdown to World War III.There is something almost blackly humorous to the way WarGames' screenplay turns. How through one innocent little action David begins a chain reaction of increasingly dire circumstances. Although WarGames never gets as black as Dr Strangelove its very effective in its first half as the different steps David takes get more and more unnerving. Its all summed up perfectly at the halfway point with another classic line from Joshua WarGames' answer to Hal 9000. When asked if Global ThermoNuclear War is a game or not Joshua innocently replies What's the difference?It does tend to get a bit bogged down in the second half with a lot of ethical debates over the futility of nuclear war. But that doesn't change the fact that WarGames has got an exceptional cast. Even at the start of his career and only 21 at the time Matthew Broderick gives an assured performance. And modulates his character accordingly when David gets in over his head.Ally Sheedy is sometimes a difficult actress to tune in to but she gives Jennifer David's only real friend a lot of life and spunk. John Wood is suitably flaky as Joshua's creator Dabney Coleman perfectly obnoxious as the head of the computers David's messed with and Barry Corbin's general more than just a onedimensional caricature. Which would have been a lot easier to play.I didn't always buy into the technical somersaults that WarGames comes out with. David's method of escaping from NORAD is something that just doesn't ring true. And you have to suspend disbelief a little too much. All they're seeing on those big screens is false. And no one puts it together. But there is something frightening about the film's conceit all the same.The line that separates reality from fantasy becomes blurred. And when the subject in question is nuclear war who wouldn't be carried along with that? It all works on the level of a paranoid nightmare that just keeps on going and refuses to stop.The final scenes though are quite philosophical. And again its Joshua who provides that unrelenting implacable logic. Only this time tempered with common sense. WarGames is filled with many great characters but its Joshua who is the film's heart. That final line at the end is a statement of such striking intelligence its almost scaryA strange game. The only winning move is not to play.".

I really think that in this day and age where computers literally do run our lives this film stands up really well not only as a warning piece about messing with technology but also as a gentle poke in the ribs about defence systems and the people we trust to run them. Tho the film is a kind of watered down and accessible 2001 A Space Odyssey for the 80s set it impacts well and only really suffers from a pointless romantic plot strand involving the sprightly Ally Sheedy could they not just have been pals? and the aforementioned dated gadgets. The ending to the film is excellent as the tension builds up nicely and we are left chewing our nails watching a game of TicTacToe sounds simple doesn't it? Not so.Good honest and intelligent entertainment. 7.510.".

And today as well as old fashioned wardialing we have wardriving warstrolling warchalking... war everything else because of this movie.

When David plugs the speech synthesizer into his computer he explains that the computer isn't really speaking just interpreting the text that's coming in. We can't have an entire movie just looking at a video screen so we accept that. But then at the end Joshua speaks the climactic lines of the movie in the same voice which makes no sense at all.

I hope you understand what freeze means because it's not the same as disarmament. It means lets just stop throwing money down this black hole by stopping the nuclear arms race where it is. Who cares if they can reduce us fine powder and we can only reduce them to sand. Ronald Reagan outmaneuvered the freeze movement with all that SDI nonsense which was just another excuse to waste money and extend the arms race into space. With Reagan it's hard to tell of course maybe he really thought it was a purely defensive system that could make nuclear weapons obsolete. When the Soviet Union finally collapsed there was talk of a peace dividend in which the obscene amount of money previously spent on the arms race could actually help people at home. There ain't too much talk about that now with the War on Terror which is a war about as much as the War on Drugs or the War on Poverty and just about as successful.".

	schema:headline " Thoroughly exciting and enjoyable thriller.";
	schema:reviewBody "An exhilarating and rather disturbing story dealing with the potential of computer technology to overrule humans in a nuclear crisis Wargames is a memorable thriller which made stars of Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy. Directed with real chutzpah by John Badham working from an eventful and Oscarnominated script by Lawrence Lasker and Walter F. Parkes the film is an exercise in suspense which cleverly caters for a target audience of both kids and adults. Part of the film's appeal is that the script manoeuvres a smartass teenager into becoming the one character capable of saving the world from a holocaust another part of its appeal is that the plot doesn't retreat into the realms of ludicrous fantasy like so many films of this kind. Consequently the suspense in this 1980s film is very real and urgent as opposed to the more artificial kind of suspense that has weakened the soulless thrillers of recent years.The U.S. Defence Department design a huge computer called the WOPR which plays out various war game scenarios. Following recent human errors it is felt that in the event of a real nuclear strike it would be better if the computer could take control eliminating the costly factor of human hesitation or crises of conscience. Meanwhile in Seattle a brilliant young computer genius David Lightman Matthew Broderick hacks into the Defence Department's computer. He mistakenly believes he is checking out some asyetunreleased computer games but in reality he is about to set into motion a chain of events that could lead to worldwide destruction. David chooses to play a game entitled Global Thermonuclear War. He elects to play for the Russian side and sets Seattle and Las Vegas as nuclear missile targets. Little does he David realise that the WOPR has logged his instructions and believes a real nuclear strike to be imminent. The computer overrules everyone  including the top brass of the American military  and prepares to launch a counterstrike against Russia. In a race against time David and his girlfriend Jennifer Ally Sheedy try to track down the brilliant but reclusive programmer Professor Falken John Wood who designed Global Thermonuclear War in the hope that he may know how to stop the computer as it prepares to wipe out mankind.It's a simple but thoroughly exciting premise played out with maximum intensity. Broderick and Sheedy make likable young heroes and are well supported by their adult costars. One flaw with the film is that the grownup characters are generally rather dim you'd think all these computer specialists and decorated soldiers would be a bit more competent for example at holding David in custody after arresting him for breaching their technology. In spite of the implausibilities in their characters though the adult actors still turn in good performances. The score by Arthur B. Rubinstein is suitably exciting and adds to the urgency of the action onscreen especially in the film's taut lastgasp climax.

	onyx:emotionText "An exhilarating and rather disturbing story dealing with the potential of computer technology to overrule humans in a nuclear crisis Wargames is a memorable thriller which made stars of Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy. Directed with real chutzpah by John Badham working from an eventful and Oscarnominated script by Lawrence Lasker and Walter F. Parkes the film is an exercise in suspense which cleverly caters for a target audience of both kids and adults. Part of the film's appeal is that the script manoeuvres a smartass teenager into becoming the one character capable of saving the world from a holocaust another part of its appeal is that the plot doesn't retreat into the realms of ludicrous fantasy like so many films of this kind. Consequently the suspense in this 1980s film is very real and urgent as opposed to the more artificial kind of suspense that has weakened the soulless thrillers of recent years.The U.S. Defence Department design a huge computer called the WOPR which plays out various war game scenarios. Following recent human errors it is felt that in the event of a real nuclear strike it would be better if the computer could take control eliminating the costly factor of human hesitation or crises of conscience. Meanwhile in Seattle a brilliant young computer genius David Lightman Matthew Broderick hacks into the Defence Department's computer. He mistakenly believes he is checking out some asyetunreleased computer games but in reality he is about to set into motion a chain of events that could lead to worldwide destruction. David chooses to play a game entitled Global Thermonuclear War. He elects to play for the Russian side and sets Seattle and Las Vegas as nuclear missile targets. Little does he David realise that the WOPR has logged his instructions and believes a real nuclear strike to be imminent. The computer overrules everyone  including the top brass of the American military  and prepares to launch a counterstrike against Russia. In a race against time David and his girlfriend Jennifer Ally Sheedy try to track down the brilliant but reclusive programmer Professor Falken John Wood who designed Global Thermonuclear War in the hope that he may know how to stop the computer as it prepares to wipe out mankind.It's a simple but thoroughly exciting premise played out with maximum intensity. Broderick and Sheedy make likable young heroes and are well supported by their adult costars. One flaw with the film is that the grownup characters are generally rather dim you'd think all these computer specialists and decorated soldiers would be a bit more competent for example at holding David in custody after arresting him for breaching their technology. In spite of the implausibilities in their characters though the adult actors still turn in good performances. The score by Arthur B. Rubinstein is suitably exciting and adds to the urgency of the action onscreen especially in the film's taut lastgasp climax. Wargames is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller which resists the urge to preach about the man .vs. machine climate in which we all exist and instead concentrates on pure suspense.... and is all the better for it.";

	schema:headline " Exciting and wellresearched thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "In the 1980's the realisation that computers will soon play an extremely important role in everyday life was becoming more and more evident. This idea was treated with excitement curiosity and fear  people genuinely did not know how powerful they would become but they were certainly fearful of it. Cinema explored this fear in successful films such as The Terminator 1984 which depicted a future where humans were locked into a battle with robots and Tron 1982 in which a character is sucked into a game where he is forced to battle with the computer to survive. Never had the capabilities of computers been so realistically portrayed than in WarGames a film that introduced the world to home computers hacking and how humanity can be replaced by machines as well as the idea that nuclear destruction is still a threat.When two missile controllers fail to launch a missile during a test launch due to uncertainty government bigwig McKittrick Dabney Coleman introduces his superiors to WOPR War Operation Plan Response a giant supercomputer that repeatedly plays games with itself to generate stats and results of possible nuclear war outcomes. The operation is given the goahead and workers find themselves replaced by this metallic super brain that will deal with any potential nuclear threat to the US. High school punk David Matthew Broderick is a highly intelligent computer obsessive who uses his hacking skills to change his grades on his high school system. When he learns that a company is releasing new breakthrough games in California he scans the area for computers in order to hack into their mainframe. He stumbles upon a computer that lists many strange war games including 'Global Thermonuclear War'. He begins a game choosing to be Russia but unbeknownst to him he is actually playing WOPR who is playing the game for real. Soon David is brought in by the FBI who suspect him of working with the Russians while the threat of global nuclear destruction lingers as WOPR carries on playing the 'game'.I viewed this film quite often when I was a child as I owned the VHS but admittedly the film went over my head somewhat and I found it quite boring. Watching it now I was shocked to find out this is a very good film and it makes for a gripping adult thriller while maintaining that 1980's kidsfilmfeel. The technical aspects shown on screen are extremely wellresearched and David's hacking activities make for exciting and interesting viewing. It's also fascinating to see the early giant clunky computers of the 1980's and an early portrayal of the Internet. Overall this is a highly entertaining thriller that is well acted scripted and filmed and even received three Academy Award nominations and has plenty of those nostalgic qualities for us children of the 80's.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I feel safe to say that WarGames truly defines how computer technology has come long way since the 1980's and the effects it had on people at that particular part of time. When it was first released in the theater back in 1983 I was only a small boy at 6 years old. And even though I wasn't the owner of a computer until 1994 for sure WarGames truly was inspiration of things to come in the always evolving world of modern technology. Sure the 1970's and 1980's had some creative juices going for them at the time like Superman Star Wars Raiders of the Lost Ark to name a few but this creative story also leans more to a realistic as our technology keeps getting stronger as we speak. Even after 28 years WarGames may have outdated dinosaur technology in its arsenal the ideology of a potential technological revolution is still to this day not an exaggeration. I'm not hoping that it will ever happen but not saying there will ever be one. There might not be one right around the corner but it would be ignorant to assume there will never be one. Sure it takes a while for Matthew Broderick to make his inaugural appearance but one he does he just nails his role to perfection. Things get so interesting when Professor Falken John Wood shows up near the end. From the outskirts of a suburban town in the Seattle area to the paranoid threat of a possible World War III they successfully executed each scene without a single hint of dramatic tensions that could've dragged the movie down. And though I didn't find any real necessity to the genre of this movie the love story was quite charming. Ally Sheedy was wonderful in her rather meagre role and even to this day I wished her potential would've caught on knowing what potential she had when she graced the screen in the 1980's. The DVD special additions had some points of interest but what really stands out with the DVD feature is the poignant commentary of director John Badham as it clarifies the exactly what makes this movie an original classic in filmmaking. Sure it's clear that Badham reveals the comical factors of the movie and the dramatic features are of notable interests too as well. The feeling I get is that Badham and company must've had a ball when they made WarGamwes. WarGames was one of the earliest films that focuses on the many dangers computers can be when you abuse the systems. Sure it can be a helpful guiding hand to get messages across at a more rapid rate than snail mail and sure it is an endless array of information that covers just about every topic that you want to know something about. But keep in mindto always watch what you're doing because if you hack into something that's unsafe you and others might end up facing dire consequences in the end. Just play safe and play carefully.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have a history with this film. When it came out in 1983 during the summer I was in my last year of sleep away camp. It was visiting day and my dad came up on July 24 yeah for you Yankee fansthe Pine Tar game occurred that day and wanted to take me to see it. I decided against that because my mother was also coming up separately my parents were long divorced and thought she might not want to go. We saw the film on video several months later and I remember being moved by two sequences 1. David screaming as he is dragged down the stairs No it's Joshua! He's still playing the game! He's gonna start a war!!!! 2. Joshua's comment at the end of the film which I won't mention here for anyone who hasn't yet seen this film. I later taped the film off of TV and when it came out on cable I was surprised how much was edited out. I didn't remember the whole movie since it had been several years. I now have it in letterbox version which makes it even more like seeing it in the theater. One more thing My dad's funeral was July 24 1994 which was exactly 11 years after my dad wanted to take me to see this fine film. As to this film it may not be accurate about computers since they can't start wars but it is convincing. Now the Cold War is a distant memory but I can remember the fear as to maybe having a nuclear war and the world ending. It is amazing how many actors in this film in small parts have gone on to other things Jason Bernard John Spencer Maury Chakin to name a few. And Matthew Broderick has certainly had a great career in fact at the time this film was playing he was on Broadway in Brighton Beach Memoirs!!! Bet you all didn't know that. Also doesn't Barry Corbin Gen. Jack Berringer look like Jackie Gleason? And yes he and Gleason worked together on Nothing in Common Gleason's last film. Can't say enough about this film and how far we have come with computers and video games. See It Immediately!".

	onyx:emotionText "I have a history with this film. When it came out in 1983 during the summer I was in my last year of sleep away camp. It was visiting day and my dad came up on July 24 yeah for you Yankee fansthe Pine Tar game occurred that day and wanted to take me to see it. I decided against that because my mother was also coming up separately my parents were long divorced and thought she might not want to go. We saw the film on video several months later and I remember being moved by two sequences 1. David screaming as he is dragged down the stairs No it's Joshua! He's still playing the game! He's gonna start a war!!!! 2. Joshua's comment at the end of the film which I won't mention here for anyone who hasn't yet seen this film. I later taped the film off of TV and when it came out on cable I was surprised how much was edited out. I didn't remember the whole movie since it had been several years. I now have it in letterbox version which makes it even more like seeing it in the theater. One more thing My dad's funeral was July 24 1994 which was exactly 11 years after my dad wanted to take me to see this fine film. As to this film it may not be accurate about computers since they can't start wars but it is convincing. Now the Cold War is a distant memory but I can remember the fear as to maybe having a nuclear war and the world ending. It is amazing how many actors in this film in small parts have gone on to other things Jason Bernard John Spencer Maury Chakin to name a few.

	schema:reviewBody "As the film opens we see two men turning for duty at a US missile silo shortly afterwards the order comes through telling them to launch their missiles at the Soviet Union... one of them refuses to turn his key. It was just a drill to test how many of the operatives would actually go through with such an order. As a significant number refused it is decided that the men should be replaced by a computerised system... nothing can go wrong with that!We then cut to a school in Seattle where students David Lightman and Jennifer Mack have just failed a history exam David doesn't see the problem though he just connects to the school computer and changes their grades. Having established his computer prowess we see him trying to hack into a games software company's system he thinks he has found the site but he has unwittingly found the computer that runs war simulations for the US Air Force. Once in he decides to play a game of 'Global Thermonuclear War' not realising that the computer will act as if a real attack was underway. Not surprisingly he is arrested and is taken to NORAD headquarters where he learns that the program is still running if all out nuclear war is to be averted he will have to escape and along with Jennifer find the computer's creator before time runs out.When I first watched this as a teen in the 1980s it was fairly exciting and seemed very modern with the way he had a computer at home and could connect to others over the telephone... now that aspect of the film seems very dated. The story itself is enjoyable though largely because Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy are likable leads as David and Jennifer. It is clear that this was aimed at a teen audience as we see the adults behave as idiots while the problem is solved by the youngsters. The idea of an 'unauthorised' nuclear war has been done before most notably in 'Dr Strangelove' although this isn't played for laughs like that film nor strangely enough is it anywhere near as bleak. I'm not sure that this would appeal to modern teens as it is dated and the Soviet threat has long gone however if you were a teen in the eighties it is nostalgic fun.".

Joshua the computer created by Dr. Falken was programmed to learnteach itself but as yet had not grasped the concept of futility nobody wins in a war game. The tictactoe analogy was spot on. Of course at the end Joshua finally learns that thermonuclear war is a strange game. The only way to win is not to play.

	schema:headline " A classic computer film that has stood the test of time remarkably well considering the fact that it's a computer thriller.";
	schema:reviewBody "Wargames is one of those young adult films that manages to span just about all ages of movie fans with its sense of adventure mixed with a chilling sense of reality. Kind of like The Goonies it is a movie that finds a young kid in an extraordinary situation except that rather than the Indiana Jones type adventure that the Goonies go on David a young Matthew Broderick has inadvertently come frighteningly close to starting a massive nuclear war between the United States and Russia.We meet David early in the film after a tense missile launch training sequence in which the men on hand do not realize that they are only participating in a training drill. David is a typical high school boy bored to death by school but fascinated to no end by computers even the nowprehistoric dinosaur that he had operating at home. One of the things that I liked about this movie in fact was that it made my computer look so high tech! Obviously any movie that deals with computers is going to be outdated in a few years and Wargames is certainly no exception. Consider for example the fact that David's girlfriend was so fascinated by the concept of a speaker that she picked it up and looked at it from all angles completely amazed. You can see this in any number of movies such as the similarly ancient computers in Weird Science and probably the most amusing the massive bricksized cellular telephone that Wesley Snipes used in true gangster style in New Jack City. Technology is an amusing thing especially when it's taken so seriously in the movies and then is so completely obsolete a decade or so later.Wargames however despite being jampacked with outdated machinery and computer technology is no less potent as a military thriller because the technology is not the point of the film. Instead the movie tells the story of how David goes searching for video games on the 1983 version of the Internet only to accidentally stumble upon a topsecret military database WOPR endearingly referred to as Whopper' that runs hypothetical sequences of what World War III would look like including how the Russians would react to American reactions to their actions and so forth. The process by which this machine can do this is one of the few things that's left relatively unclear in the movie which is probably a good thing because it sounds suspiciously like something that a computer even today would have a hard time doing. Imagine the staggering amount of information that would have to be entered into a computer for it to achieve that level of intelligence. At any rate wanting nothing but some new video games and to impress a girl David searches for video games on what appears to be the web's only search engine and indeed it's only feature at all and stumbles onto such titles as Backgammon Chess Guerrilla Warfare and of course Global Thermonuclear War. Naturally being a high school kid he's fascinated and wants to play the biggest baddest one. Probably the most hairraising scene in the film is when David's mother calls him downstairs and congratulates him on passing his classes which he had changed by hacking into the school's computer system by which he is thrilled until he turns to look at the TV where the news is reporting the war that has been set in motion because of his tinkering on the computer.  Wargames requires a substantial suspension of disbelief because of such things like the United States military's inability to tell whether or not those blips coming from Russia on their screens are real weapons of mass destruction of if they're just a computer game but the fact that the world is tottering so lightly on the edge of Global Thermonuclear War even if only because of the very presence of these types of weapons is the frightening concept that the movie tries to get across. It focuses on the possibility that something like that could have happened and it rings chillingly true to this day no matter how much more advanced our technology is. Sure it's not likely that the governments of the United States and of Russia or any other countries are likely to launch weapons that will kill millions of people simply based on a few lights that have lighted up on their switchboard but the weapons are there and someone paid a lot of money for them. Wargames is an enormously entertaining thriller that poses a question about humanity with the answer from WOPR that like Tic Tac Toe there is no winning move in war. We see it playing through World War III on the military intelligence screens near the end of the film during which it evidently has a field day messing with the lighting in the room showing missiles coming from every direction and destroying everything on the map.This is a strange game' it says. The only winning move is not to play. How about a nice game of chess?'".

	schema:reviewBody "The Lodger was the feature which Hitchcock himself described as his first true film it was actually his third complete one and film historians particularly auteurists tend to focus upon it because it is it introduces themes of murder and suspense that Hitch's name would later be synonymous with.To be honest the first thing that strikes me upon watching The Lodger is its sense of rhythm. Hitchcock's earliest films were always very rhythmic and the opening moments of The Lodger are a great example with a dynamic and attention grabbing sequence of shots and title cards. Much of this however may be down to the style of the seldom referenced screenwriter Eliot Stannard who has a credit on all but one of Hitchcock's silents. Stannard was a master at telling stories in purely visual terms and his screenplays often go as far as to map out series of interlocking images.The next very obvious thing about The Lodger is that right from the start Hitchcock was more interested in cinematic technique than he was in performances or artistry. The Lodger is crammed with Expressionist effects in particular double exposures. Hitch clearly hadn't learnt the art of subtlety yet and these are massively overused. We can also tell early on that Hitchcock was interested in using his camera to involve the audience in the film throwing in pointofview shots or drawing our attention to specific items. In this regard his technique was not yet refined. He was develop it in his later silents.Of course what generally interests followers of Hitchcock's career is the fact that The Lodger is the first time he deals with the grisly subject of murder. It's true that there are many Hitchcockian elements here  murder blondes a love triangle and even a MacGuffin in the form of the Avenger whom all the characters are concerned about but isn't the focus of the story. There is a kind of morbid sensationalism concerning the killings something we'd see right through to the other end of Hitch's career with the comment about ripped whores in 1972's Frenzy. There's also of course a wrong man although here he appears more as the subject of a whodunit. The later Hitchcock would have focused upon the plight of the wrongly accused and made a more suspenseful film in the process.All in all The Lodger isn't really as significant an early Hitchcock as some would believe. For one thing there is the influence of screenwriter Stannard and the fact that Hitchcock although he may have relished the material was still very young and inexperienced. The fact is The Lodger may contain more of Stannard's influence than it does Hitchcock's. It's not as if Hitchcock immediately began making more murder thrillers. The majority of his British thrillers are of the espionageadventure variety and it would take up until the early 40s for Hitchcock to really begin making masterpieces in the domestic murder genre. It's also nowhere near being Hitch's best silent film even though it tends to be remembered over more polished works like The Ring and The Manxman. Taken out of context though it is a fairly decent late silent thriller with only a few minor flaws in plot and direction.".

Based on the novel by Mrs. Belloc Lowndes and the tales of Jack the Ripper Hitchcock was able to embroider upon the theme of mistaken identities and incorporate an intense chase sequence both of which would become important elements in his later suspense films. He also made the first of his famous cameo appearances twice actually which would also become part of his trademark.The film is well plotted and moody told in an almost expressionistic style relying mainly on visuals and a somewhat frugal use of title cards. The staging in the narrow multilevel home is especially well managed with characters on different stories interacting in the plot simultaneously.Fans of the 1944 American remake with Laird Cregar may be surprised at its very different ending from this film. This is probably largely due to the fact that the earlier movie including some very incongruous and never explained plot elements was planned as a showcase for its star matine idol Ivor Novello who plays the title role.

Although he appeared occasionally in films Novello's greatest renown came from his acting in the lavishly romantic stage plays he authored his handsome good looks being especially appreciated by the ladies in the audience. A hint of his melodramatic stage persona especially the use of his mesmeric eyes can be seen in Hitchcock's film projecting the actor into a virtual Epiphany during the most exciting sequence.

	schema:reviewBody "I wonder if this would be identifiable as a Hitchcock movie if it weren't identified as such. Maybe. It as a few innovative touches anyway although it's often a little primitive.For one thing it's a theme  a serial murderer in a comfortably bourgeois setting  that Hitchcock would return to from time to time. Frenzy for instance and Shadow of a Doubt. But this isn't really typical in that the later Hitchcock would have complicated the story or juiced it up by having the innocent eponymous lodger guilty of something or other  maybe just having a closet full of ladies' garments. As it is he's made Ivor Novello a bit odd looking given him effete gestures more makeup than the other men suggesting that he's gay. Other characters refer to him as queer in the oldfashioned sense of quirky and say of him that he's not keen on the ladies. Ivor Novello was himself gay. There's also a scene in which a sexy young girl is happily taking a bath while the lodger tries to sneak into the bathroom. Shades of Psycho.And when the lodger is pacing back and forth in his upstairs room the family look up at the ceiling at the jiggling chandelier and the ceiling becomes transparent so we can see the shoes of the suspect. Oh it's not elegant but it IS original. Hitchcock was trying something new even then.Then too there is a scene in a kind of  boutique? Is that the right word? A fancy dress shop where the heroine models. The prissy looking lodger is seated between two dolls in cloche hats  I'm afraid I'm guessing again  and one of them puts an unlit cigarette in her mouth waiting for the smooth gentleman to light it for her and maybe buy her that smashing dress too. But the lodger has noticed that  well to be frank  the woman's bare KNEE is on display the flapper! So get this staring straight ahead he takes out his lighter flicks it lit and moves it to the side so she can reach it. Then he disengages himself stands up and walks off to her irritation. It was not necessary to do the scene in that particular fashion but it's the kind of thing Hitchcock would dream up a small but telling detail. Hitchcock makes his cameo in the crowd of people trying to clobber the lodger who is hung up on a fence by his handcuffs. Christian symbolism? I doubt it. Hitchcock's presence is clear enough in still shots but the print I saw was so old and scratchy half the scene was obscured. Why didn't Hitchcock make an outright movie about Jack the Ripper instead of this one with an innocent Avenger. We never find out who or what the real murderer is avenging. Come to think of it we never even see him. Maybe Hitch wasn't too fond of period pictures. The few that he made were anything but hits. Hitch making a movie set in 1885? What's next? Hitch remaking the shootout at the OK Corral? Hitch doing a biography of Moses? Nah. He had a pretty good sense of his talents and their limitations. When he misjudged them it was usually in the matter of technique not subject. Worth seeing. In fact an interesting story.".

There's also a scene in which a sexy young girl is happily taking a bath while the lodger tries to sneak into the bathroom. Shades of Psycho.And when the lodger is pacing back and forth in his upstairs room the family look up at the ceiling at the jiggling chandelier and the ceiling becomes transparent so we can see the shoes of the suspect. Oh it's not elegant but it IS original. Hitchcock was trying something new even then.Then too there is a scene in a kind of  boutique? Is that the right word? A fancy dress shop where the heroine models. The prissy looking lodger is seated between two dolls in cloche hats  I'm afraid I'm guessing again  and one of them puts an unlit cigarette in her mouth waiting for the smooth gentleman to light it for her and maybe buy her that smashing dress too. But the lodger has noticed that  well to be frank  the woman's bare KNEE is on display the flapper! So get this staring straight ahead he takes out his lighter flicks it lit and moves it to the side so she can reach it. Then he disengages himself stands up and walks off to her irritation. It was not necessary to do the scene in that particular fashion but it's the kind of thing Hitchcock would dream up a small but telling detail. Hitchcock makes his cameo in the crowd of people trying to clobber the lodger who is hung up on a fence by his handcuffs. Christian symbolism? I doubt it. Hitchcock's presence is clear enough in still shots but the print I saw was so old and scratchy half the scene was obscured. Why didn't Hitchcock make an outright movie about Jack the Ripper instead of this one with an innocent Avenger. We never find out who or what the real murderer is avenging. Come to think of it we never even see him. Maybe Hitch wasn't too fond of period pictures. The few that he made were anything but hits. Hitch making a movie set in 1885? What's next? Hitch remaking the shootout at the OK Corral? Hitch doing a biography of Moses? Nah. He had a pretty good sense of his talents and their limitations. When he misjudged them it was usually in the matter of technique not subject. Worth seeing. In fact an interesting story.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Lodger 1927This is the first of three movies in a 30 year period based on the same plot and in terms of plot this is the best of them. There is also a recent one that is the worst of the bunch. It is for sure an early Alfred Hitchcock film. It's early in the sense that it's still creaky at times. It's Hitchcock because it's tightly made visually dramatic and it combines sympathy and suspense really well.If you are into what makes Hitchcock tick you really have to see this movie. Not that you should mindit's great stuff. First of all you get the presumably innocent man accused of a string of murders this is ambiguous. Then you have the mixing of sex and murder or lust and murderthere is no sex here. And then you have the way Hitchcock mixes every day regular people and very safe and homey situations with genuine terrible murderous events. And finally there is his filming and editing. Take a look even at the very first shota close up a screaming woman shot at an angle a Dutch angle. Look next at how dark and impressionistic the next shots are of a horrified crowd a cop and a reporter. Later there are other interesting cuts to lead you to thinking a certain way about the characters. And the overlapping of images. And the shot of a man walking overhead on glass as if you can see through the ceiling.The humor and clever conversation of later versions of this story are naturally lost on us here. Also in good Hitch fashion there are few intertitle cards. Good thing. The visuals tell the story. And wait until the final scenes the Pieta all over again really gorgeous. Some of these last shots were redone at the request of the studio to change the impressions of the main character a handsome man with an acting reputation to protect. Hitchcock went along and it seems to be acceptable all around by the time it was released.It's hard to find a decent print of this a version from a good copy of the film on DVD or streaming but it has recently been restored and rescored orchestrated and that's for sure the one to get. It is so far only a U.K. release apparently even a bluray version is out look for the red and black Constructivist cover. Criterion has not released a version. The original release has different scenes tinted blue or amber for greater effect and the usual version on Hitchcock DVDs and DVD sets in the U.S. is all black and white.So if you don't like silent films and can't stand choppy or grainy or badly cropped releases of early films don't see this. But if you can find the clean new restoration or you just love Hitchcock or if you really like silent films they get more and more amazing the more you see then see this! It's the director's first really characteristic feature.".

That's what hooks the viewer into wondering who the Avenger might actually be and with only a handful of credited characters the only other reasonable suspect would be police detective Joe.Alfred Hitchcock masterfully directs his first British thriller with hallmarks of the style that in later years would make his name a household word. The steep stairways of the boarding house a recurring black cat and Hitchcock's own understated presence were all to be repeated in later films not to mention central characters in a tense game of identity crisis. What makes the lodger character Ivor Novello particularly creepy is his unusual behavior in turning women's pictures away from view and the borderline malevolent interest he takes in young Daisy Bunting a fair haired girl who has all the prerequisites for the Avenger's next victim.There are a couple of anomalies that bear mentioning. I found it more than a bit unusual that the lodger's murder map would have been drawn in exactly the same way as the one the police have a set of smaller triangles within a larger one to mark locations of the stranglings. Speaking of triangles perhaps it was unintentional but the one between Drew Daisy and Joe presents a lot of unresolved tension as events unfold.The other scenario I had some problem with involves the mob chase after the lodger and Daisy leave the pub  just where did ALL those people come from? Presumably it was late evening with most people staying safe at home but it looked like a hundred plus people were after the innocent victim.At times excessively grainy and marked with imperfections I was fortunate to have this rare movie turn up on a Hitchcock DVD compilation of nine British films on three discs put out by St. Clair Vision. These early Hitchcock efforts have been easy to find for a long time now except for The Lodger and Blackmail which is also part of the set. Even if you're not a Hitchcock fan per se it's a great set to get into to see the early development of the suspense genre with an opportunity to see how the director progressed over the course of his early career.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unfortunately this famous film was for me a bit of a disappointment. The novice Hitchcock is clearly in love with special effects and the manufacture of suspense but he resorts to devices that are all too obviously manufactured in his endeavour to throw suspicion on the eponymous lodger. It's pretty difficult to poke a fire in such a way as to poise the poker threateningly above the head of the girl on the other side of the table even if she is bending down to retrieve a lost chesspiece and it's pretty crude to have your suspect pretend to stab the heroine with a tableknife. And when the murderer is known to have a fixation of blonde girls it's not exactly subtle to have your suspect talk not about the beauty but the colour of the heroine's hair  lack of subtlety is the main theme here culminating in the lodger's 'crucifixion' when a trickle of blood oozes from his mouth in what is doubtless intended to be a deeply significant shot. The story is a potentially good one but the execution is too often hamhanded... not aided I'm afraid by some poor acting.It does annoy me when people dismiss bad acting in silents with airy phrases such as 'you had to overact to get the story across without dialogue' and 'that style of acting was normal in those days' any decent silentera actor can get his message across just by the way he moves and reacts without making eyes at the camera or gesturing around and wooden acting is wooden acting in any era. Top silent actors were often better than talkie actors because they didn't have the crutch of dialogue to distract from awkward body language if it looked unnatural everyone would notice.Ivor Novello had no pretensions to be a great screen actor  he was originally selected for film roles simply on the grounds of his striking good looks and cheerfully admitted it  but this is far from being his best performance. He gives every indication of reacting to offscreen directions as to what expression to pull next rather than communicating clearly with the audience some scenes are far more successful than others. Malcolm Keen in the role of his rival Joe the detective is little better and the mysterious June perhaps a contemporary society celebrity with whom the audience was expected to be on firstname terms? acts them both off the screen as do the character actors who play her parents.The film has good moments generally when a touch of humour is allowed to break up the wouldbe intensity or when the actors relax enough to give more natural performances but it left me feeling nakedly manipulated. There are flashes of talent but all concerned are trying too obviously and too hard I'm not sure I could honestly recommend it save for curiosity's sake.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Lodger is Arthur Hitchcock's third featurelength directorial effort and a landmark film for him. It is Hitchcock's first thriller and establishes his tradition of placing himself in one scene for a brief cameo.The story centers on the Buntings a middle class London family who have a room for rent while the city is being terrorized every Tuesday by a mysterious JacktheRipperlike serial killer who calls himself The Avenger. A mysterious rather Gothic young man the great Ivor Lovello rents the room and his odd behavior almost immediately sends up red flags for the suspicious Mrs Bunting Marie Ault. Things begin to come to a head when Young Daisy Bunting's developing friendship with the new lodger begins to attract the jealous attention of her young police detective lover Malcolm Keen and when Mrs Ault notices his mysterious nighttime sojourn on a bloody murderous Tuesday.I generally enjoy wellmade silent films and consider them a species quite apart from films with sound. Yet even if I were to lump The Lodger in with its louder cousins and proceed to rate it purely on its relative entertainment value this little gem of a film would still be rated as high as 8.In a talented director's hands the lack of sound is no handicap and as silent film directors go Hithcock was very good. I am convinced that his early formative history in the silent version of the medium is one of the reasons why his later films were so visually dramatic and exhaustingly and meticulously photographed.Silent film acting is also very different from acting in a 'talkie'. not having a voice forces performers to actout the feeling of each scene with a standard body language. Certain tilts of the head and eyemovements become words for 'please forgive me' 'I like you''leave me alone' and even 'Go away and never come back'. Silent movie actors often learned this vocabulary so well  making several films per year just to keep themselves fed and lodged  that the transition to sound and its much more visually subtle body language became very difficult.The silent performances in the Lodger are very excellent. Lovello is phenomenally ambiguous and creepy though somehow sympathetic as well  absolutely perfect for this role. His female counterpart is his equal though she presents herself much more subtly. Daisy Bunting was played by a mystery woman named June whose infrequent appearance in films is hard to explain given her good looks and obvious talent. A young Malcolm Keen who would make other films with Hitchcock later in his career does yeoman's supporting work as the notsosympathetic police inspector.Recommended for film history buffs and thriller fans with open minds and good attention spans.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm hardly ever in the right mood to watch silent movies but as a selfdeclared cinephile you should make some necessary exceptions. The earliest work of Alfred Hitchcock for example since he undoubtedly is one of the if not THE most important director of all times. Admittedly I don't worship the Master of Suspense's entire repertoire but I am extremely fond of his horrorthriller movies dealing with psychopathic murderers and thus The Lodger ought to be considered as mandatory viewing. I can only concur with what I've read in numerous reviews namely that Hitchcock's preferences for macabre tales mentally burdened lead characters pitch black humor and unorthodox plot twists are already clearly noticeable here in this primitive story inspired by the Jack the Ripper case. Visually and stylistically young Alfred's creative mind also was already far more advanced than the technological possibilities of that era. It's abundantly clear that he wanted to do so much more with his cameras lighting effects and sound but the film industry simply wasn't ready or equipped yet. How frustrating that must have been. Anyway as said the story is a slightly more polished reenactment of the Ripper murders that kept London under siege at the end of the 19th century. Instead of prostitutes the killer is exclusively targeting fairhaired girls and for some reason he's only prowling the streets on Tuesday evenings. When a mysterious and deeply introvert young man applies for the room she has for rent the landlady slowly begins to suspect that he might be wanted killer. After all he often covers half of his face with a scarf just as how witnesses described the killer and he shows a lot of interest for the beautiful fairhaired daughter Daisy. Hitchcock demonstrates his vision and talents through maintaining a continuously unsettling atmosphere a couple of genuinely tense sequences and a few stunning especially for 1927 camera angles. The finale illustrating a relentless manhunt by a furious mob is truly astounding and certain themes from the denouement would later grow out to be director's trademarks. Acting performances are always difficult to judge in silent films but I must say I was perplexed by the appearance of Malcolm Keen. He's supposed to be the honest police detective but his eyes and charisma are far more evil and menacing than those of any serial killer I've ever seen!".

The acting is good Ivor Novello especially in a performance that is ambiguous and creepy but also extravagant and sympathetic.

	schema:headline " One of Hitchcock's best and an early indication of his talent";
	schema:reviewBody "The Lodger was Alfred Hitchcock's third completed feature film the first being The Pleasure Garden and the second is the now seemingly forever lost The Mountain Eagle which Hitchcock did not seem proud of in his interviews with Truffuat. Although The Pleasure Garden showed some indication of what to expect in the future from Hitchcock both stylistically and thematically the Hitchcockian elements were minor and not particularly notable. On the other hand The Lodger is certainly distinctively an Alfred Hitchock film and is all the more interesting for the time it comes in and the subject matter which sees Hitchcock at his most experimental during certain scenes and also successfully attempting to give the film an expressionist flavor. Most people probably don't even know Hitchcock made any silent films let alone one as good as The Lodger.If there's one thing I do not understand about discussions of Hitchcock's ouevre it is how rarely this film comes up in conversations. People would rather discuss inconsequential fluff like To Catch a Thief or formulaic mediocrity like Torn Curtain than a film which sees Hitchcock infusing his own style with silent expressionism? Apparently that is how things are but they certainly shouldn't be that way given how much of Hitchcock's style is developed here and how interesting what he does with editing is and the several interesting shots shot through plateglass floors. The cinematography by Gaetano di Ventimiglia is actually very good as well if a little predictable and I do wonder why he didn't have a better or bigger career based on what he does here.The film's story is simple but intriguing and contains the twists and turns many might expect from a Hitchcock mystery thriller. A Jack the Ripper sort of serial killer is killing curlyhaired blonds in London and soon a landlady begins to suspect that her new lodger Ivor Novello who takes a liking to her daughter is 'The Avenger' the killer behind the murders. Of course not everything is how it seems and the narrative is hugely involving particularly during the first and last twentyodd minutes but there's a stretch in the middle where the film is still entertaining and involving but doesn't seem completely certain of itself and all of the minor flaws are contained within that third of the film. It's still very good throughout however. These comments are all based on the 75 minute long version. I see that the TCM print is 101 minutes long and am not sure if there are restored scenes or if it is just played at a different speed. I doubt added scenes would have helped the film much as the narrative moves at a blistering pace and I can't imagine any other scenes doing anything but causing uneven pacing. The Lodger which features so much subject matter that would later recur in Hitchcock's filmography lust murder obsession fetishism was remade twice in 1932 a widely disliked and little seen film again starring Ivor Novello and in 1944 a minor cult classic starring Laird Cregar and another remake set for a 2009 release is in production. Perhaps it will draw more attention to this somewhat forgotten Hitchcock classic as it really is one of his best films but for some bizarre reason not among his more popular even among his preHollywood films. A remarkable and visually exciting film with a fastpaced and hugely enjoyable narrative. 910".

	onyx:emotionText "The Lodger was Alfred Hitchcock's third completed feature film the first being The Pleasure Garden and the second is the now seemingly forever lost The Mountain Eagle which Hitchcock did not seem proud of in his interviews with Truffuat. Although The Pleasure Garden showed some indication of what to expect in the future from Hitchcock both stylistically and thematically the Hitchcockian elements were minor and not particularly notable. On the other hand The Lodger is certainly distinctively an Alfred Hitchock film and is all the more interesting for the time it comes in and the subject matter which sees Hitchcock at his most experimental during certain scenes and also successfully attempting to give the film an expressionist flavor. Most people probably don't even know Hitchcock made any silent films let alone one as good as The Lodger.If there's one thing I do not understand about discussions of Hitchcock's ouevre it is how rarely this film comes up in conversations. People would rather discuss inconsequential fluff like To Catch a Thief or formulaic mediocrity like Torn Curtain than a film which sees Hitchcock infusing his own style with silent expressionism? Apparently that is how things are but they certainly shouldn't be that way given how much of Hitchcock's style is developed here and how interesting what he does with editing is and the several interesting shots shot through plateglass floors. The cinematography by Gaetano di Ventimiglia is actually very good as well if a little predictable and I do wonder why he didn't have a better or bigger career based on what he does here.The film's story is simple but intriguing and contains the twists and turns many might expect from a Hitchcock mystery thriller. A Jack the Ripper sort of serial killer is killing curlyhaired blonds in London and soon a landlady begins to suspect that her new lodger Ivor Novello who takes a liking to her daughter is 'The Avenger' the killer behind the murders. Of course not everything is how it seems and the narrative is hugely involving particularly during the first and last twentyodd minutes but there's a stretch in the middle where the film is still entertaining and involving but doesn't seem completely certain of itself and all of the minor flaws are contained within that third of the film. It's still very good throughout however. These comments are all based on the 75 minute long version. I see that the TCM print is 101 minutes long and am not sure if there are restored scenes or if it is just played at a different speed. I doubt added scenes would have helped the film much as the narrative moves at a blistering pace and I can't imagine any other scenes doing anything but causing uneven pacing.

This sort of story has admittedly been done before but the script was full of enough plot twists to keep one interested who expected Jason Gann and Shaun Angus Hall to appear as a pair of obsessive utterly misguided ACDC fans? and Darren Ashton proved himself a very competent director. I look forward to seeing his future workMost of the flashback scenes can bring tears of your laughter to your eyes particularly those of Sonnie and Sam's past occupations.

I don't usually care for 'flashbacks' but these were so funny I didn't mind them. The group of guys they have work so well together. The messes they get into are so outrageous and how they get out of them is even funnier. The storyline is excellent the actors are great the laughs are hysterical and it has the most awesome music  ACDC  how can you go wrong with that combination!";

	schema:reviewBody "OK I'll say up front that this movie features only 1 ACDC song the title track in the very beginning. At the end there's a good cover of It's a Long Way to the Top and somewhere in the middle is a bizarre country version of TNT. Hardcore fans might recognize a song by Fraternity Bon Scott's band before he sang for ACDC.But this movie isn't really for hardcore ACDC fans it's for everyone. Rather than the music of ACDC it focuses on the mischief and mayhem caused by 4 loser friends in their late 20s twelve years after their rock'n'roll dreams burned out.It's a road movie meaning there's not much of a plot other than a bunch of guys being on the road most of the time. Strange almost random scenes happen along the way and that's what the fun is about.My favourite parts were the creepy gas station guy and his surprise the crazed wheelchair rugby team the Korean mafia stick around after the credits the argument over what letter should mark the spot X? and of course the two terminally stupid Beavis  Butthead fans who take the lyrics of Jailbreak too literally.Some might say that this film has deeper themes about loyalty to friends and youth and about staying true to dreams despite getting older. But nah I just see it as a wacky road movie.Thunderstruck is pretty tame not too much swearing and only one sexual situation. There are some references to drug use and 1 grossout scene involving drugs and a toilet and other things that go in toilets. But other than that it's mostly familyfriendly.Three years after making Thunderstruck director Darren Ashton would make Razzle Dazzle A Journey into Dance which is my alltime fave Aussie comedy and one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen. For Ashton fans these 2 movies are very different. While Razzle Dazzle has a cheeky ChristopherGuesttype of humour Thunderstruck is more physical and inyourface like maybe Wedding Crashers.Other similar Aussie comedies I recommend are Alex Proyas's Garage Days about a struggling band trying to get their first big break and The Wannabees about a team of foulmouthed crooks who somehow become the nation's most popular children's show. See them all and maybe you'l agree Aussie comedy rocks.".

	schema:headline " A very good adaptation";
	schema:reviewBody "Cronica de una Muerte Anunciada Chronicle of a Death Foretold is based on the novel of the same name by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Garcia Marquez together with Jorge Luis Borges is the most recognized name in Latin American literature and one of the exponents of what is usually called magic realism. If you are an American reader and are familiar with the works of Isabel Allende you should definitively read Garcia Marquez who is her original inspiration. Most of his stories occur in a fictional world that resembles provincial Colombia at a time right where the traditional values of Spanish colonialism are slowly beginning to clash with the new laws and customs of modern society.Garcia Marquez writing is dense and as a good story teller of old he slowly gives us pieces of the plot while vividly describing the surroundings and most importantly his characters' state of mind. Nowhere is this more true than in this novella which as the title implies will retell the story of one single death.This film adaptation is one of those rare cases where the spirit of the book has been kept intact and in my opinion by changing the order of two incidents in the conclusion the film has even improved upon the book. This is a compliment not only to Garcia Marquez but to the talent of Tonino Guerra one of Fellini's long standing collaborators. Right away we are told that Santiago Nasar has been murdered and we already know who the killers are. What we are not completely sure is how and why. And what is not understood is how it was possible for this to happen in the center of the plaza in front of the whole town.These are the mysteries that propels the narration. And just as with 'Citizen Kane' or 'Rashomon' we listen to the different testimonies of the witnesses to the incident  each one holding just a small piece of the truth.The nonlinear story and slow peeling of layers of truth will confuse and maybe bore some viewers but those paying attention will enjoy one of the most satisfying films in a long time.While many of the actors will seem unknown to American audiences this film has a stellar cast of international European stars and is a display of the talent of the veterans Irene Papas and Gian Maria Volonte. But where the casting shines is also in that of the main protagonists of the drama Ornella Muti as the beautiful and mysterious Angela Vicario who motivates the drama Anthony Delon son of the great Alain Delon as the man she falls for and the yet unknown Rupert Everett.This period piece is recreated authentically in both the costumes and the surroundings.".

This is one of those movies you once see and love so much but are afraid of not getting another chance to see it again. I have forgotten some parts of the film and i would do anything to see it again just to remember it to see if it still would be one of my favourites. So i hope someone reads this and  maybe can help me? I liked it so much I sudently got interested of reading Gabriel Garcia Marquez' tales and books so I told my father to read some of them for me. I now am a big fan of Garcia Marquez. I'm a movie lover and my favourite movies are such as The Usual Supects The Shawshank Redemption Memento Schindler's List Life is Beautiful  many many more. Good movie. Please forgive me for my bad english... Peace y'all".

A lot of attention was paid to the appearance of the characters as well  MutiEverettDelon became a sort of programme music to commemorate human beauty and I really liked the reluctantly avenging twins. Another technical trick was the scantiness of the soundtrack there were times when I would have liked a bit more dialogue but some of the long silences like Bayardo and Angela in the rowboat spoke for themselves as it were.Speaking of soundtrack why were Rupert Everett's lines dubbed into Spanish? I know it avoids the need for subtitles but it was so out of sync with the movement of his mouth as to be ridiculous and his use of English apparently sullenness rather than bad Spanish  so said the flyer at the 1987 Montreal Film Festival added to the fishoutofwater if not actually exotic characterization of Bayardo.What really troubled me and it would be unfair not to say so was the narrative frame that Garcia Marquez adopted for the screenplay. It was clumsy to have Cristo Bedoya as both character and objective narrator and the external narrator of the novel might have been kept as a voiceover device. And SPOILER HERE the final scene wasn't plausible being untrue to the novel is no big deal but it was so far beyond belief as to have harmed the film. Why not just finish with the body of Santiago Nasar lying in the sand? But it's a WONDERFUL piece of filmmaking. It deserves far more attention than it's had to date.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not having read the book I can't say how close this movie sticks to the story by the great author Gabriel Garcia Marques. The scenes in this movie are works of art joined together and put in a sequence that gradually reveals a multitude of plots all woven into one. Long after seeing the movie the scenes of their own accord come back into my mind like a tune that once heard is never forgotten demanding to be considered the main plot. A man on the prow of a river boat looks at the approaching land. The scene without words only the thudding motor of the boat feint sounds of voices coming from the land the brilliant white of an elegant mansion contrasting with the dark gold of the water and a glimpse of narrow alley ways opening on to a wide plaza hints to us that dramatic events now memories are going to be revealed here. Even now more than a week since seeing the movie I ask myself what I can learn from this tragic story. The town's folk have just celebrated a fairy tale marriage of a young woman. Immediately her prince like husband reveals her lost virginity on her marriage bed and returns her to her mother as spoiled property. The lesson I learned from this movie is that a woman whose honor has been taken away has the right to name the price for its recovery. Her price is the life of the most popular young man in town full of the joy of life and hope in the future. It doesn't matter whether it really was he who had robbed her of her virginity. The fact is that a fallen woman is dangerous she can name the price of her lost honor. She chooses him to be the sacrifice because he is worthy. He is killed just like a sacrifice stabbed to death in the town's main square while all the people of the town his friends look on. I wouldn't have come to this conclusion had I continued like most viewers I suppose to dwell on the mystery of whether it was really he who had taken away her virginity. If it wasn't him then who was the true defiler? Why didn't she give him up to be murdered? Was she protecting someone? Who was she protecting? Was it the doctor? Or was it someone in her immediate family? Maybe even her father or one of her brothers?".

Bront is already married to Georges the French composer. Other directors or screenwriters would have shown their wedding in detail peppered with gags. But Weir sees that this is not necessary it would only follow the convention.Later we have unexpected plot twists and changes in the characters that are not always convincing but give the film an interesting not too light base tone. And actually Peter Weir is a too enthusiastic director to make a visually rather undemanding romance film. So he introduces some wonderful visual ideas like the scene where Georges is standing in front of Bront's door covered with a blanket calling her name while the camera shoots him from inside through the watcher. I'm not particularly fond of Andie MacDowell because she always seems even more nervous than my English teacher always presenting herself with a pained smile. In Green Card of course the fact that she is not at all likeable to me at least fits perfectly and one little wonder of the movie is that Grard Depardieu can convincingly play that he is falling in love with her.A comedy surprise.".

Unfortunately the INS suspects it is a bogus marriage and the two have to temporarily move in together in order to prove their marriage is real.  From the start Bronte and her immigrant husband dislike each other. Yet strange things can happen.  This is a sweet story with plenty of laughs sprinkled throughout.

This review is thus very subjective but it comes from the heart....First it is a rare movie in which I feel my favorite town New York as my neighborhood. The town really appears as an endless collection of big cubic buildings but under the soft menace of the green invasion trees garden.... All the roof scenes are memorable...Then McDowell plays an almost introvert woman in contrast to the French extraversion of Depardieu. Sure being French I support our national icon who is particularly in his turf here but I was more over captivated by the development of the Bronte character and her feelings. From her initial motivation then indifference to exasperation and finally complicity  deep devotion it was a remarkable evolution to behold and understand.Finally there's also a lot of subtext  subtlety here and it's great for the brain I mean some things talks to our unconscious and the connection isn't immediate. For example think how Africa is the main background the emigration subject the Afrika bar the drums the safari life ... There's also the sweet translation from Green Card to Green House and the role of ecology... Like I already said the green tries to grow in every free space left from the rock buildings which is a poetic metaphor for the emigration...So a great romantic story in a wonderful setting  which leaves many doors to open...".

	schema:reviewBody "Green Card is a good movie. Worth watching. The first time I saw it I wasn't impressed but then watching it again I found it realistic and refreshingly charming in that simpleagainst the tide sort of way that is so Peter Weir. He's also done The Witness Dead Poets Society and The Truman Show and Green Card most certainly is another of his films about people who don't quite fit in their environment or in the world of their aspirations but are drawn into finding life where probably they were not looking for. The scene about finding the bathroom is both hilarious and very suspenseful. It's funny how in a house or even in a small apartment we're never quite sure where the bathroom is. Our first instinct is to ask even though it probably wouldn't be a difficult move to find that on our own. Now imagine having to deal with that bathroom situation something you only care about when you need it pretending that the place where you're in is your house. It's almost like in those nightmares where there are so many doors but which one is the one that will take you to that next level you so much need but have not the slightest idea of what it might really be? I guess the metaphor here is that you keep on opening a chain of wrong doors until you find the right one for you. It's frustrating but the door was always there always with the exception that you never noticed it. Just like in everyday life love and spirituality might flash into your face as banal sight at first but they're made of hopes and fears that are always bigger than us unexplainable maybe fate. We don't have control of it the Greeks knew it we're still the same but again we're not. And here we are groping surviving.

He doesn't do the pretentiousness that is so common today.  He is unsophisticated yet not uncomplicated.  Andie MacDowell plays her part wonderfully.  You just want to smack her silly at times which proves that McDowell is a great actress.  She is also one of Hollywood's Classic beauties.  She is a pleasure to watch not only for her first rate acting but also because she is such a handsome woman.My wife hooked me on this movie.  I am a typical American man who is usuually into action and SciFi movies.  I usually run screaming from romantic movies.  The fact that this is a Romantic COMEDY made it fun to watch.  Depardieu plays the large oafish commoner to a T.  He is a very funny man indeed as well as a first rate actor in his own right.  He is not in enough movies IMNSHO.I wish the studio that owns this would release it on DVD in the US.".

	schema:reviewBody "Green Card was made at the time Peter Weir had been making an attempt to break into the Hollywood mainstream. In his native Australia Weir made some offbeat but effective horrorfantasy films in particular the beautiful atmospheric and very eerie Picnic at Hanging Rock. After the move to America Weir's output has become somewhat sporadic but his films are never less than interesting and have a refreshing intelligence among the predictability's of US fodder.Green Card was Weir's first film after having huge success the year before with the excellent Dead Poets Society. And while perhaps a little more straightforward than what he usually goes in for Green Card is a superior romcom that mostly avoids the clichs that come with the genre.Green Card has a plot that could easily be built out into a US sitcom. An American woman marries a Frenchman so he can get his green card. And she can get the apartment of her dreams which is available only to married couples. When Immigration start snooping around they have to put on the pretence of being married and that includes friends and family. Naturally they're different in every way. She's a prissy prim and pretentious snob. He's a crude rude and lewd slob. But they're falling in love anyway.Its a credit to Peter Weir's skills as a storyteller that he can make such a contrived scenario fly. But he does. Obviously a personal project for Weir he wrote produced and directed it. Which means his unique vision is stamped upon every aspect of the film. In the hands of a more pedestrian writerdirector Green Card would have you running for the nearest exit but Weir's confident assured direction hits a lot of the right notes.There's a common theme that runs through much of Peter Weir's films. An outsider in a foreign land. In The Truman Show Jim Carrey was a real man surrounded by a fictitious world. In Dead Poets Society Robin Williams was a freethinking teacher at a conservative prep school. And in Green Card Gerard Depardieu is a foreigner in America.I think Peter Weir shares a special kinship with Depardieu's character Georges. They're both foreign men trying to work in an alien land. Weir's script refreshingly avoids all the usual clichs. It never has Georges as a bumbling blithering idiot bound by the language barrier as other filmmakers would have been tempted to do just to get easy laughs. Green Card attains much of its mileage from Georges quiet awe of his adopted country and his slow discovery of the woman he married out of convenience.In his first English speaking role Gerard Depardieu does very well. In fact he does much better than he has in any of his subsequent film roles. He never overplays his hand or makes Georges too broad as a character. His acting almost verges on minimalism but he gets across to the audience without ever sacrificing his realism.Andie MacDowell spends all her time now promoting Loreal but Green Card shows there was a time when she actually did concentrate on an acting career. I've never been much of a fan of Andie MacDowell. Although radiant she often seems rather remote as an actress. Like she prefers to keep the people she works with at a distance. Despite the occasional gem like Groundhog Day MacDowell hardly ever impresses as an actress.In the case of Green Card Peter Weir has made the wise choice of creating a character for her she's suited too. Bronte is supposed to be an aloof distant society gal and its something that fits Andie MacDowell's temperament perfectly. Her quiet exasperation with Georges' lifestyle is very amusing and even if her timing is slightly off most of the lines Weir gives her are usually on the nose.Green Card is one of the few films where we have the rare pleasure of seeing the extremely underrated Bebe Neuwirth in a major role. And she doesn't disappoint as Bronte's spontaneous larger than life friend Lauren. Bebe Neuwirth always has tremendous charisma and never fails to dominate the screen. Best known for playing humourless ice maiden Lilith Sternin in Cheers and Frasier Neuwirth is one of Hollywood's unsung actresses.Lauren's observations over Georges and Bronte's 'relationship' are hilarious. Neuwirth has an uncanny ability to be eyewateringly funny and then turn serious at a moment's notice. In fact one suspects she would have made a much better Bronte than MacDowell does. Bebe Neuwirth is by far the better actress and its sad she's not in the film more often. She lights up the screen whenever she's around. Love the look on her face after she hears Georges' piano concerto at a plush dinner party! Worth the price of admission alone!Peter Weir's films are often lush and attractive to look at and Green Card is no exception. We get to see some beautiful photography in Bronte's greenhouse. Lush greens and relaxing streams. Beautiful sunsets highlighted by the Manhattan skyline. Accompanied to a wonderful whimsical film score by Hans Zimmer with haunting vocals from an uncredited Enya.As things draw to a close Green Card becomes quite intense. We know that Georges and Bronte are getting closer but the Immigration interview hangs over them both. They desperately need to get their stories straight if they ever hope to get through this. And much as he did in Dead Poets Society Peter Weir shocks one and all by ending things on a real downer. They don't succeed. And Georges is deported back to France just as they've admitted their love for each other.Green Card may not be one of Peter Weir's classic films but its a refreshing antidote to Hollywood's sugary sweet romantic comedy genre. It has an intelligent stride that is very fulfilling and an ending that will leave you depressed for days afterwards.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm normally not too much a fan of Grard Depardieu at least not when he plays a role in a movie that isn't French. But this time I was willing to make an exception and the main reason for that is because I was interested in the subject of fake marriages in order to be able to stay in the country permanently. It's a problem that is all too known known over here as well and I couldn't think of any other romantic movie that dared to use this subject. That's why I was curious about it.George Faur is a French citizen who has been offered a job in the U.S.A. but before he can start working he'll need a work permit. Since it's very difficult for him to get one the easiest way is to marry an American woman. Bront Parrish loves plants and has dedicated her entire life to them. Now she has found a wonderful flat with its own greenhouse but there is one problem the flat is for married couples only. The best solution for both is a marriage but to convince the immigration officers that they are married for love and not out of convenience they must move in with each other and try to cope with all the difficulties that this will bring...It wouldn't have been a romantic comedy  drama if there weren't the necessary complications between the two people so in that perspective this certainly isn't an original movie. But there is one difference normally this kind of movies never shows a marriage of convenience as it is something that doesn't belong in the perfect image of love and happiness that this kind of movies wants to portray. Fact is that it is a 'daring' move  although only to a certain extend  that really works. I really didn't have any problem to believe that in reality Bront and Georges would never marry because their worlds are too far apart. And I admit that I was still a bit surprised when seeing the end of the movie. Of course their ideas about each other change this is still a romantic movie but it was all done in a very decent way.Overall the acting in this movie is quite good. Despite the fact that I had my doubts about him before watching the movie I must admit that I even liked Depardieu probably because he didn't have to conceal his awful French accent when speaking English. He more or less could be himself this time and that's good. Also nice was Andie MacDowell's performance and I loved Jessie Keosian as the noisy landlady. All in all this is an interesting romantic drama  I wouldn't really call it a comedy  that offers a good story and some nice acting. It's perhaps not the best in the genre but it's certainly better than average. That's why I give this movie a 710.".

Depardieu comes across very well though really doesn't need to try very hard to pull off the fairly stereotypical 'big french feller' he plays here and MacDowell is her usual droneyvoiced moodyfaced self there to look pretty but prim rather than inspire any great feeling. The story ambles along nicely taking in most of the standard licks of the genre ? impressing the friends the family high jinks with the neighbours bad behaviour and heroism shouting and laughing together to illustrate how love can emerge from conflict. Not hugely funny or romantic but very nice to see that a romantic leading man could still smoke drink and eat lots of butter in healthobsessed Hollywood back in 1990.".

The story ambles along nicely taking in most of the standard licks of the genre ? impressing the friends the family high jinks with the neighbours bad behaviour and heroism shouting and laughing together to illustrate how love can emerge from conflict. Not hugely funny or romantic but very nice to see that a romantic leading man could still smoke drink and eat lots of butter in healthobsessed Hollywood back in 1990.";

	schema:reviewBody "What's so great about this movie? Most people dismiss Green Card as just another romantic chickflick comedy but it's FAR more than that. While not a message movie it's actually a light commentary on the institution of marriage and what makes it work.It starts with a premise that everyone can recognize two people who can barely stand each other must put aside their differences for a greater good. The actual wedding and its attendant emotions is carefully avoided only to drop us into the lives of our protagonists as they are suddenly forced to make their marriage of convenience appear real. Only when they do the hard work to make it real does it actually become real the emotions experienced are the result of the commitment not the motivation for the commitment. In other words if luck is the residue of design then love is the residue of commitment.This is not to imply that the movie is perfect but it does hold up very well after all these years. Yes the clothes are very much of their time and there are a few groanable moments but for the most part I see no reason why people not born when the movie was written and filmed shouldn't be able to relate to the story and understand what the producers were getting at.With beautiful scenery and an outstanding cast this movie was also very nearly prophetic in anticipating all the singles in the city movies and TV shows of the 1990s of which Friends is the most famous example. Which is not to say that Green Card was the only movie of its time with those qualities but merely IMHO the most exemplary. Would there be a Hallmark Channel today without movies like Green Card?".

He is sure to be one of the best French actors.The most unforgettable scene is Gerard spoke lively poem in French while playing piano in order to win green plant for Andie. No doubt it is the most touching moment in the film.The good ending is welcome and heartwarming. Andie and Gerard duet is more impressive than the other two duets Andie and Hugh grant Andie and Bill Murray. Really hope they can cooperate again. Maybe GC2. 910".

This is a perfectly terrible unfunny movie with a script that would be lame on a 30 minute sitcom. It was made solely as a vehicle to introduce Gerard Depardieu to American audiences and as such was a failure. It also showcased the lovely Andy McDowell but rather unfairly  she's either pregnant or postpregnant here and although radiantly beautiful she is hulking around in huge baggy jumpers and tops. Considering Depardieu is a heavy set man the combination isn't romantic at all. It's like a before ad for Weight Watchers.I'm not saying a comedy about two heavy set people can't be done  of course it could be and delightful with lots of avenues for humor. But that's not how this framed AT ALL. Their weights are not alluded to except briefly when George Depardieu wrongly guesses Bront's weight as 140 lbs she says 125 lbs...well maybe when not preggers.I think this pretty much restricted the script to no nude scenes.And oy the plot unrealistic and leaden. Not only does immigration law in the US work NOTHING like this is it possible the allAussie crew had no idea? we are talking about a pretty serious crime. It's not cute to defraud the INS. George has no reason to do all this. He could have applied for a work visa and waited it out. Also come on  he's what? 45 or older? What has he been doing all this time? Frankly though the script was apparently WRITTEN for him Depardieu is entirely WRONG for it  and unfunny  every scene is just painful. George needs to be an eager YOUNG guy maybe 25 or 30 with some real goal  something he would NEED to be in America to accomplish.OK so why 7 stars? Honestly I remember this movie well for one reason  it is shot in the loveliest most charming apartment I have ever seen. It is truly the apartment of my dreams. I've never forgotten it and 25 years after I could have described it down to the last detail. I suspect it is only a movie set but OMG what a set. The building itself is real. Never mind it would have cost a fortune even in 1989 and never mind it is probably a CO OP meaning you buy in and not rent it and we are talking MILLIONS of dollars. I don't care. It's a dream and a wonderful one  oh that greenhouse...the koi pond...the fountain.This was the beginning of the shabby chic style and it was never showcased better than here. Kudos to the set designer. I want to live here. I just don't want to live with fat annoying George or dull matronly Bront.Consider watching this with the sound turned off.".

Green Card has one of the funniest scenes of all time in my opinion in which Georges must find a way to convince a room full of New York society people that he's an accomplished musical composer.

	schema:reviewBody "I can be a sucker for romantic comedies just like anyone else  good ones that is. Green Card most definitely does not fall within that realm which is probably a good reason why so few people remember it. Andie MacDowell is an upper crust horticulturist who finds her dream apartment in NYC with its own greenhouse. For plot purposes only a married couple can occupy the apartment. So she enters into a marriage of convenience with Frenchman Gerard Depardieu. He to get his green card and she to nab her apartment. As the clichs fly fast and furious naturally the two are complete opposites who cannot initially stand each other. Naturally as they are forced to get to know each other intimately in order to fool immigration officials the two will move towards a grudging admiration and then love. There are no particular surprises in Green Card but then romantic comedies do have a certain formula they follow. The secret is in enjoying the banter and chemistry of the leads while they hit the familiar notes. It is impossible to see how anyone could enjoy time spent with either Bronte or George  the characters played by MacDowell and Depardieu. Bronte is the typical caricature of a hoitytoity snot a woman who feels she is better than everyone in the room and is not provided any evidence by the film to the contrary. She seems to have little regard for other people's feelings and is herself a dreadfully dull and uninteresting person. By contrast Depardieu is downright scary. His days as an international sex symbol long past Depardieu arrives in the film looking a good 50 lbs. overweight beady eyes peering from behind hanks of greasy hair and one can somewhat understand Bronte's alarm at having to open a room up to this creepy ugly thug. Unlike MacDowell at least Depardieu does try to lighten things up a bit but he is cursed with a screenplay that gives him precious little to work with as well as the embarrassing habit of having every woman in the piece outside of McDowell lust after him and describe him on initial meeting as delicious. A factor that would be laughable if it did not have the habit of making the women in question seem so pathetic in their lascivious thoughts over someone who resembles an Idaho potato. To say that the leads share nonexistent chemistry is an understatement of vast proportions. No these are actors that should not even appear in the same film much less as a romantic coupling. As the film monotonously grinds to its conclusion it stupidly concludes with Depardieu largely acing the immigration interview and then confessing everything to the authorities merely because he cannot remember the face cream that MacDowell uses how many husbands can truly remember such a detail?. As the love birds are being parted an insipid romantic dirge plays over their closing embrace with the singer wailing about how everything is going to be OK. Actually it is not OK  I have lost 90 minutes of my life to this excruciating ordeal and want someone to give it back!".

It's a sociopolitical essay on the dangers of Western meddling in Third World countries.  It's a fascinating view into the challenges of journalism in a volatile foreign country.  It's a steamy romance involving two beautiful intelligent characters.  It's a distinctly Far Eastern morality play that seems to delight in yinyang paradoxes.  Plus it's one of the best films at evoking the mood texture and sensuality of life in Southeast Asia.  Don't be too harsh on Weir for the lapses in historic accuracy and plotting because it's a complicated busy landscape he is painting here.  The best things about the film areLinda Hunt's amazing performance.  Unlike other genderbending performances Julie Andrews in VictorVictoria Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie you never once give any thought to the fact that this is a woman playing a man.  It's a seamless transition and a performance of immense heart and honesty.  The image of a distraught Billy pounding at his typewriter pleading What then must we do? while an aria swells around him and the eyes of Jakarta's poor stare at him from his own photographs is an incredibly moving scene.The atmosphere created by the combination of Russell Boyd's  cinematography and Maurice Jarre's score.  Take a look at the scene with Weaver walking through the streets of Jakarta in a tropical downpour.  The effect is breathtaking.The chemistry between Gibson and Weaver.  You can feel the heat between them.  Unlike other posters here I believe their romance is one of the film's strong points.I agree that the ending is a bit of a letdown but it doesn't diminish Weir's accomplishments.

Living in a totally foreign country in a totally strange culture imperfectly understanding the local language bewildered by alien logic you experience a permanent sense of unease.

In the evening you have a pleasant drink with your neighbour in the morning you are arrested accused of being a foreign mercenary. When you travel inland you come at a road block not knowing if they'll let you pass or harass you for a couple of hours or confiscate your car. As a foreigner in developing countries you are constantly confronted with uncertainty an intangible menace lurking around the corner.I find that TYOLD transmits this sense of menace very poignantly. Many people have commented on its brilliant sense of place the accurate depiction of Indonesia and the events that took place at the time. Others mention that you get a very real feeling of the tension and uncertainty journalists in times of upheaval are subjected to. But I would like to extend it beyond journalists. The sense of menace in TYOLD is eminently recognizable by all who have lived in countries where the police is not there to protect you the laws are not there to make society more civilized the hospitals are not there to cure you. In TYOLD the menace is made visible because of the troubles that erupt but usually you do not have to live through civil war when overseas. Still the menace is not less real and the sense of foreboding haunting every expatriate was very convincingly conveyed in the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Banned in Indonesia for nearly 20 years after its release Peter Weir's 1983 political melodrama THE YEAR OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY TYLD remains the only film in existence set during the failed Communist revolution of 1965 which swept corrupt dictator Sukarno out of office only to replace him with the equally corrupt Suharto. The plot revolves around the comingofage of neophyte journalist Guy Hamilton played by Mel Gibson before Hollywood stardom ruined his looks and bloated his ego to titanic proportions recently arrived in Djakarta from Australia and looking to break big stories and make a name for himself  fast. Guy is befriended by ace photographer Billy Kwan more on him later a halfChinese halfIndonesian dwarf who has connections in very high places and believes in President Sukarno's benevolence. The political situation in the country is tense  mass protests block traffic in the streets while a Communist revolution brews behind the scenes and Sukarno's position grows more anxious by the day. Naive and selfcentered Guy sees his new world entirely through selfish eyes  as though all Indonesia existed only for his personal entertainment and enrichment. Guy is far from alone in this regard as the racist and sexuallyexploitative behavior of his fellowjournalists demonstrates a scene in which one of Guy's colleagues takes his pick from literally a score of desperate girls all too eager to sell themselves for a few dollars is horrific. Despite the postWW II setting European colonialism in Asia seems alive and well with Western diplomats and expatriates living lives of material abundance far removed from the miserable reality of Asia's slums. Thanks to Billy Kwan's connections and friendship Guy not only gains access to leading political players  making his name via an exclusive interview with the head of the Indonesian Communist Party  but meets the beautiful Jill Bryant played nicely by Sigourney Weaver whose acting is better than her accent.

The Vangelis soundtrack is also brilliant  lush waves of synthesized chords wash over the viewer making the perfect aural counterpart to the film's rich photography. The ending  in which Guy has to make a choice between his ego and his lover  is gripping and suspenseful. The film's slow even languid pace only adds to the hothouse and strangely selfcontained atmosphere. This movie isn't just something you watch  it is a remarkable sensual experience all by itself and a reminder of the power and beauty that the screen can bring to the human face. This reviewer has loved this great film ever since watching it repeatedly on cable TV as a child in the 80s  there is nothing quite like this movie's atmosphere anywhere else. Don't miss this sexy and thoughprovoking work of art!".

	onyx:emotionText "Banned in Indonesia for nearly 20 years after its release Peter Weir's 1983 political melodrama THE YEAR OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY TYLD remains the only film in existence set during the failed Communist revolution of 1965 which swept corrupt dictator Sukarno out of office only to replace him with the equally corrupt Suharto. The plot revolves around the comingofage of neophyte journalist Guy Hamilton played by Mel Gibson before Hollywood stardom ruined his looks and bloated his ego to titanic proportions recently arrived in Djakarta from Australia and looking to break big stories and make a name for himself  fast. Guy is befriended by ace photographer Billy Kwan more on him later a halfChinese halfIndonesian dwarf who has connections in very high places and believes in President Sukarno's benevolence. The political situation in the country is tense  mass protests block traffic in the streets while a Communist revolution brews behind the scenes and Sukarno's position grows more anxious by the day. Naive and selfcentered Guy sees his new world entirely through selfish eyes  as though all Indonesia existed only for his personal entertainment and enrichment. Guy is far from alone in this regard as the racist and sexuallyexploitative behavior of his fellowjournalists demonstrates a scene in which one of Guy's colleagues takes his pick from literally a score of desperate girls all too eager to sell themselves for a few dollars is horrific. Despite the postWW II setting European colonialism in Asia seems alive and well with Western diplomats and expatriates living lives of material abundance far removed from the miserable reality of Asia's slums. Thanks to Billy Kwan's connections and friendship Guy not only gains access to leading political players  making his name via an exclusive interview with the head of the Indonesian Communist Party  but meets the beautiful Jill Bryant played nicely by Sigourney Weaver whose acting is better than her accent. Jill is an assistant at the British Embassy and as such is privy to a great deal of classified information. The pair seem to be wildly in love but is Jill more important to Guy than his career? Before the story ends Guy Hamilton will see blood spilled lose his best friend learn that Asian politics isn't a spectator sport and that his white skin is no guarantee of safety and security.

Wonder of wonders compared to many other films of the early '80s this one is just as riveting as it was when I first saw it and doesn't look like it has aged a minute.  In addition I am picking up many nuances of the film that I had never seen before.What I know and knew about the tribulations of Indonesia in the 1960's is contained in the reels of this film.  The subject matter is so far outside of the typical WesternAmerican perspective that it is amazing that the film got made.  Gibson is very good as Guy Hamilton and his performance is much more lean and energetic than what he has done since  he hadn't had years of Hollywood gloss and Lethal Weapon familiarity to file down his performances into the predictable boxes they have become.  Sigourney Weaver is elegant although her English accent is never really convincing and sometimes disappears altogether.  Linda Hunt's portrayal of Billy Kwan is astonishing and won her a welldeserved Oscar in an incredible genderswitching performance that was inspired casting.One thing I never noticed before was how Billy placed each of the three main characters in their perspective as the Indonesian puppets he explains to Guy.  Arjuna the hero who can be fickle and selfish Guy.  The princess he will fall in love with Weaver's character.  And the dwarf who carries the wisdom for Arjuna Billy Kwan.  I haven't much more to say about this film aside from how much I admire it and recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it.

	schema:reviewBody "I had forgotten what it is to inhabit the frame that is to be immersed not only in the world these characters experience but in the sensations made available in it. To feel a draught of air or the scorching heat.Peter Weir here in his best period reminds me again. His fascination in this period with the otherworldly is firstly Australian that of a man awed by the mysteries of an alien ancient landscape that trumps comprehension outlasts our follies and dreams then foremostly mystical implying a communion with worlds beyond. In this world answers are denied us and we can only hear vague echoes of the questions we have asked. This is Picnic at Hanging Rock as well as The Last Wave and The Year of Living Dangerously the tingle of excitement and fear before this enormous complexity to which we are only small and transient. The Hanging Rock here becomes Jakarta.These visions of Jakarta a veritable jungle of humanity teeming with passions and cruelties he presents from a point of view that communicates alienation and fear.

	onyx:emotionText "I had forgotten what it is to inhabit the frame that is to be immersed not only in the world these characters experience but in the sensations made available in it. To feel a draught of air or the scorching heat.Peter Weir here in his best period reminds me again. His fascination in this period with the otherworldly is firstly Australian that of a man awed by the mysteries of an alien ancient landscape that trumps comprehension outlasts our follies and dreams then foremostly mystical implying a communion with worlds beyond. In this world answers are denied us and we can only hear vague echoes of the questions we have asked. This is Picnic at Hanging Rock as well as The Last Wave and The Year of Living Dangerously the tingle of excitement and fear before this enormous complexity to which we are only small and transient. The Hanging Rock here becomes Jakarta.These visions of Jakarta a veritable jungle of humanity teeming with passions and cruelties he presents from a point of view that communicates alienation and fear. When our white characters venture out into the crowded slums human misery reaches out at them with filthy gaunt arms. All this he doesn't merely document for the sake of political discourse he stylizes as an experience meant to stir things in the soul.

And who better than a devilishly handsome rogue like Mel Gibson to portray Guy a selfcentered journalist whose nearly loses an eye because he can't really see the way Billy tries to get him to.

There weren't more than a dozen people in the audience just more evidence as if we needed it that quality doesn't guarantee popularity. It stars Mel Gibson as Guy Hamilton a journalist in Sukarno's Indonesia who is so naive that he is tempted to break the cardinal rule of reporting and get involved. Linda Hunt is Billy Kwan Guy's photographer and cultural interpreter who finds inspiration in the Gospel of Luke for an ultimately tragic attempt to change the poverty and hopelessness around him. Sigourney Weaver is Jill who may or may not be a British spy. On another level the main characters in the film hero heroine servant parallel one of the seminal tales of Indonesian folklore. Having grown up in the tropics myself I found the atmosphere of the film consistently authentic. It oozes heat and sweat along with the uncertainty and quiet menace that's always just beneath the surface when one is a privileged foreigner in a poor country. Don't take it personally Billy says to Guy as they walk through a slum the focus of everyone's abuse. You're just a symbol of the West to them. I feel more like a bloody spittoon Guy replies. Jill doesn't share Guy's budding sense of compassion Watch out for the melodrama she tells him but she cares about Guy. The flip side of Guy's character is Pete Curtis Michael Murphy a grinning amoral journalist who gets his comeuppance though he doesn't yet know it when he announces triumphantly near the end of the film I got Saigon!. This is not an action thriller or escapist romance but something better a journey to a place where flawed characters face hard choices stand by and observe or get involved  that are no different from what the rest of us have to make.".

	schema:headline " Political Intrigue and Fiery Romance a great mix";
	schema:reviewBody "Peter Weir's Year of Living Dangerously is one of the best 80s foreign dramas available. It stars an up and coming Mel Gibson in the middle of a politically volatile setting in 1960s Indonesia. Mel Gibson acts young alive and foolish as an Australian journalist Guy Hamilton in a country impoverished with a power struggle about to erupt between a communist type faction and the local inpower dictatorship. As a well done secondary plot I found Gibsons's romance with Sigourney Weaver particularly enthralling about the middle 30 min of the movie especially 2 scenes where career and relationship runs headon at odds  and leading up to that with Weaver walking in the tropical rain amid squalor while contemplating that communicates atmosphere and feeling to perfection together. As a third supporting character Linda Hunt's Billy does well as sort of a dismayed but hopeful dwarf journalist and an onlooking supporter of the impoverished.

	onyx:emotionText "Peter Weir's Year of Living Dangerously is one of the best 80s foreign dramas available. It stars an up and coming Mel Gibson in the middle of a politically volatile setting in 1960s Indonesia. Mel Gibson acts young alive and foolish as an Australian journalist Guy Hamilton in a country impoverished with a power struggle about to erupt between a communist type faction and the local inpower dictatorship. As a well done secondary plot I found Gibsons's romance with Sigourney Weaver particularly enthralling about the middle 30 min of the movie especially 2 scenes where career and relationship runs headon at odds  and leading up to that with Weaver walking in the tropical rain amid squalor while contemplating that communicates atmosphere and feeling to perfection together. As a third supporting character Linda Hunt's Billy does well as sort of a dismayed but hopeful dwarf journalist and an onlooking supporter of the impoverished. The movie captures political tension very well as it does the setting  a hot humid southeastern Asiafilmed in Phillipines and Australia marred by inhumane living conditions and famine. Towards the end one of the local characters remarks Westerners don't have answers anymore....almost 25 yrs after this movie this still rings true.

Billy Kwan Linda Hunt mentions to Guy Hamilton Mel Gibson at the film's beginning Luke 310. His simple rephrasing of it is What must we do? It's a question that haunts the character throughout life. I went back and reread it after the movie. John the Baptist has just called the Pharisees a brood of vipers for not practicing their religion with any measure of compassion. In answer to their question what must we do? he instructs them to share their excess of clothing and food with those less fortunate.

It examines the sweeping forces of change and clashes of cultures that have struck so many parts of the world since the second world war.Most moviegoers will be drawn to this film by the presence of Mel Gibson and Sigourney Weaver who do an outstanding job as Guy and Jill.  Guy is a cocky pragmatic news reporter who is mentored by a fellow Australian the halfChinese Billy Kwan in an aweinspiring performance by Linda Hunt. Billy has seen Indonesia through his camera lens he knows firsthand the daily trauma and heartbreak under which Indonesia's poorest citizens live. He adopts those he cares about and follows their progress obsessively assembling dossiers and secretly photographing them.  Billy is an idealist who believes that Sukarno holds out the greatest hope for the Indonesian people.Another of Billy's obsessions is Jill Bryant a gentle Englishwoman who works for the embassy.  Billy orchestrates a meeting between Guy and Jill who in the movie's most moving scene break curfew and flee to Guy's cabin in a hail of bullets.  Billy lurks outside clearly satisfied that the puppets are filling the roles he has written for them in his private shadow play.Betrayal is a huge ongoing theme in this movie.  Billy the idealist always expects more from those around him than they deliver.  He befriends the assortment of foreign journalists who pass through his world only to be shocked at their exploitative behavior with the natives.  Sukarno says one thing on TV but demonstrates very different motives as his reign continues. Billy despairs that he will not be able to change the way things are. Finally Guy's relationship to Jill represents yet another betrayal  he takes advantage of classified information that Jill passes to him out of concern for his safety.  I found the ending no spoilers to be the most disappointing thing in this movie  it seemed somehow anticlimactic and I would have liked to see something more but cannot think of what.  The ingredient that makes this film what it is is Maurice Jarre's wonderful haunting score.  The pacing of this picture is slow by today's standards but did not seem so in 1982. r".

	schema:reviewBody "Weir's fascination with the mystical and magical has taken him to places where most filmmakers would never dare to venture for fear of obscuring or losing the audience. He is Australian and maintains that connection through many of his films but has also stepped out of this comfort zone and into the international away from the cultural cringe and tall poppy syndrome that raided our media and arts for so long and I think still to an extent does so. Weir is a good choice perhaps not just for the geographical proximity of Australia to Indonesia and how he understands how to use the landscape as a way of building character see The Last Wave but also for the way in which the expatriate stumbles in his navigation of the new environment buffeted by the cultural shift and on permanent unease and wariness. We sense this is something that Weir is quite familiar with. A young Gibson is therefore perfect for the role of Guy Hamilton an immature freshfaced reporter thrust into a role a great deal more important than himself he has that vitality and zest that you cannot get with an older portrayal. Most people have gone through the same period  the one in which your future aspirations aim higher than the clouds and you feel ready to change the world. Guy is rough on the edges and easily distracted when he sees the white jewel in a murky foreign forest but initially perhaps he has those qualities. To the extent that he maintains them is where we lose track a little but he shows enough promise to be taken under the wing by the local veteran Billy Kwan diminutive in stature but not in courage. Linda Hunt's portrayal has been praised widely and deservedly  she in herself has created so many layers of sexual ambiguity and mystery that aren't explored and ultimately the character is reduced to a rather pointless sacrificial lamb she dies for a tiny insignificant cause which leads nowhere except to highlight the moral danger that is all around this politically charged country but she has done more than enough to keep us guessing long after her demise. Kwan is an extension of Weir's mystical less person or dwarf and more a creature of great passion and emotional capability that feels a sense of moral debt to those around him and goes to great lengths to pay it off. She is almost positioned on another layer from the narrative itself at times the cryptic voiceover revisiting its own plans and devices and muttering on the happenings and progress of these...like a guide that introduces you to a strange new world at the beginning of a video game only to chastise and take back its godlike power when you stray down the wrong path or kill the wrong targets. But the message itself seems contradictory. Kwan bestows great responsibility and opportunity onto Guy  including positioning him with a make or break story that could potentially save many lives. But he also criticises him for his nobler intentions he would give up the whole world for Jill he claims and has mistakenly thought that Guy too would do the same. Eventually he does go along those lines. After a rather tame rise to the challenge that rewards him with a busted eye he rationalises that his love for Jill is more important and scurries away. Is it wrong to expect more of a character in this situation? The film poses so many questions of its political environment but shys away from answering all but the trivial ones. Weir's vision is limited by its caricatures and in the end the noble white man has not even risen to the challenge but run away from it hand in hand with the fair maiden. And Weir incredulously frames this as an epiphany as a coming to the senses.".

When I decided to see TYOLD one weekday afternoon in 1983 I didn't expect a comedy and knew nothing more about the film than that Australians had written and directed it so as I drove alone to the theater I only hoped that I had chosen a thoughtprovoking story that might offset the uneventful life I was living at the time.The Year of Living Dangerously did much more than provide me with a pleasant 2hour escape from my dull routine. When the credits began to scroll by I not only knew that I had just seen a very special movie I also felt that I had had a peak experience. I returned home moved and inspired. I imagined myself attending school or teaching in Per helping rebuild the homes of victims of an earthquake in El Salvador or donating money each month to clothe and feed indigent children in Uganda. I raved about the movie and recommended it the next time I spoke with friends.The film affected me as much emotionally as it did intellectually. While holding my interest with a compelling story about a passionate little photographer and an inexperienced journalist on a dangerous assignment TYOLD clarified for me significant differences between Southeast Asian and Western cultures and enlightened me about Indonesian history During the 1960's people talked about the possibility of a communist revolution in Viet Nam not in Indonesia.. In a review I once read of TYOLD a professional critic mocked Mel Gibson and Sigourney Weaver by asserting Bogart and Hepburn they're not. Though I didn't leave the movie theater wishing that other actors had played their parts I did see the relationship between Guy Hamilton the journalist and Jill Bryant an assistant to an attach of the British embassy as the film's one weakness.That he pursued her and she ultimately accepted after much reluctance came across as believable enough but since their relationship developed so little  few meaningful conversations not much exclusive time her sudden transformation into lustful from discreet and aloof  the apparent message that by story's end the two had bonded didn't feel convincing. Hamilton and photographer Billy Kwan on the other hand exchange opinions about the state of Indonesian politics support each other's work and learn from each other's point of view. They had the more complex relationship and therefore the more valid one and it stood out as the strength of the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "After seeing this movie again in New York recently and noticing that it was going to be available on DVD I ordered it immediately through Amazon.com and decided to send the following comments which were posted in the customer reviews section1. The plot. The Nobel Prize winner Hermann Hesse wrote Siddhartha in 1922. It is a novel about Eastern spirituality many Indian scholars consider it as one of the few successful examples of Indian philosophy presented by a Western author. Siddhartha is one of the names given to the Buddha himself. The novel narrates the pilgrimage of the son of a Brahmin his struggle to find his own destiny his friendship with Govinda his shadow his encounters with many different people the Samanas the ascetics that practice selfdenial Kamala a courtesan who claims that she can teach and provide love as an art Kamasawami a rich merchant who becomes his boss and Vasudeva...  note Vasudeva is another name given to Krishna the teacherdriver of Arjuna in the BhagavadGita.2. The Movie. In 1972 Conrad Rooks an almost unknown movie director who made Chappaqua in 1966 came out with a 94minute movie transcription of Hesse's novel. He engaged Sven Nykvist the famous Swedish cinematographer of Igmar Bergman and a mainly Indian cast including Shashi Kapoor Siddhartha Simi Garewal Kamala Romesh Sharma Govinda and Zul Vellani Vasudeva. The beautiful music was composed by Hemanta Mukherjee I hope the soundtrack will be available soon. It will be particularly enjoyable for those who have read the book. In many of the scenes the synergism produced by the photography the music and the acting is superb. And with few exceptions the movie is a good transcription of the book. The book and the movie became part of the cult culture of the West coast of the early seventies but it never got the attention of the general public. With a condescending tone Leonard Maltin refers to the movie as too arty but onlocation photography ... is often dazzling.After seeing the DVD transfer I was very happy with its high quality. There are 27 interesting minutes of comments made by Conrad Rooks about why and how he made the movie 30 years ago. With the DVD technology I am able to enjoy my favorite scenes and particularly the music of Hemanta Mukherjee on texts from another Nobel Prize Rabindranath Tagore.  Because of these unforgettable moments I give a rating of 10 absolving Rooks from his youth sins.".

A good deal of the films success is due to Sven Nykvist's marvellous camera work done mostly with natural light. The few scenes with set light are awful. The beauty of the landscapes is not only the superficial one of a postcard but the philosophical one that tells you that a beautiful world is essentially a good complete happy world a world in which you can afford to completely focus on your personal search for meaning and spirituality. Well personally I don't believe this but this movie had me suspending my belief for 90 minutes. What a comforting experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "This excellent work1972 of an American director Conrad Rooks made me fall in love with India and its spirituality all over again.I am so glad I could borrow and watch this movie from a public library Dow library in Midland Michigan. The cassette claims that it has been recovered in 2002. This movie is based on a Nobel prize winner novel by Hermann Hesse. The music composed and sung by Hemant Kumar who is well known for singing TagoreNobel winner. The song tracks are Tagore's compositions. Very melodious.The story is about a young Brahman of a priest family. The father is a sacred priest of a temple. Next to the temple flows river Ganges. Siddharth grows up with his close friendfollower. Their early childhood is shown to be bathing in the river and performing rituals in the temple. Being fedup with his father's routine life Siddharth decides to get out of the town and wishes to become a 'sadhu' and attain nirvana eternalpeace. His father consents halfheartedly. The best friend Govinda follows him like a shadow. During their journey they both come under the influence of many accomplished sadhus and a Guru. Inspite of serving the Guru Siddharth is not satisfied and does not feel even being close to attaining nirvana. In the meantime Govind influenced by Buddha himself joins Buddhism leaving Siddharth alone with his path. The main aspiration of Siddharth is to achieve nirvana without a teacher. He claims why do we need teachers to attain nirvana a seemingly conflicting belief to Hinduism which preaches without a Guru its impossible to attain eternal peace. Hinduism is esoteric and abstract. The conflicting facts are not conflicting at all..As Hinduism goes far and teaches that one is the God himselfor herself..Aham Brahmasmi. At one stage a soul outstands or out performs the teacher.So he continues his wandering. In the meantime gets attracted to the pleasure gardens of a beautiful soulfulcourtesan by name Kamala. Siddharth wants to learn the art of love from her. She induces him into materialistic world. He learns all worldly business in order to gain the love of Kamala. Kamala true to herself teaches him all he wants. Eventually he gets tired of all of it and leaves that place to become a ferry man. During that time he learns a lot of philosophy from the river. Kamala who now has a son from Siddharth gets bitten by a snake and dies in the arms of Siddharth. Siddharth tries to bring up his son but the son turns out to be defiant and so on and so forth...From the comment I learned that the ferryman who taught him about truth was none other than Budha himself.The passionate scene between Shashi Kapoor and Simmy Grewal heats up the screen..I never had imagined that in the best hands of director and photographer Shashi Kapoor could be so sizzling sensuous. I always find him boring and cold in almost all his movies..The conversation between Kamala and Siddharth is very touching. After sharing a very passionate artistic love making both of them settle to think that they do not love each other. What a disappointment. Two people in true love sometimes are unable to make passionate love due to situations and two people who after all share passionate physical love are not in love..what an irony of life..The consummation of love passion  spiritual  commitment happens only in imaginations ??? I hope not.For Siddharth the journey of spirituality is reverse seem to happen to many people..Its from vairagya renunciation to bhoga materialistic luxury and back again..Some simple men and women who follow simple philosophy and travel from bhoga to yoga and to nirvanaeternal peace seem to be doing it right...However there is nothing right and nothing wrong in this journey...Like a meandering river we all tracecarve different paths suitable to our mind and our body. Also the chakras control our actions at different points of time and determine at one point of time what is predominant for us.The significance of ferryman is not an old concept. In Kannada literature16th century ? Purundara Dasa calls God as ambiga ferryman..God is the ferryman who helps cross this river called life and the ferry is our own body with nine holes. What an artist he must have been to help cross the river in such a perforated boat... Coincidentally I remember this funny incident from Ramayana..Rama requesting a ferrymankevat in Hindi to help him cross river Ganga. Before Kevat lets him in his boat runs and gets a pitcher of water to wash Rama's feet off..When asked why he narrates the reason which seems so hilarious...He says if I let you get in my boat with the dust of your feet there is a fear that the boat may turn into a maid just like stone turning into Ahilya...thats why had to wash your feet..cause I have no other means of living 'main gareeb naiya meri naari naa hoya pade'...".

He claims why do we need teachers to attain nirvana a seemingly conflicting belief to Hinduism which preaches without a Guru its impossible to attain eternal peace. Hinduism is esoteric and abstract. The conflicting facts are not conflicting at all..As Hinduism goes far and teaches that one is the God himselfor herself..Aham Brahmasmi. At one stage a soul outstands or out performs the teacher.So he continues his wandering. In the meantime gets attracted to the pleasure gardens of a beautiful soulfulcourtesan by name Kamala. Siddharth wants to learn the art of love from her. She induces him into materialistic world. He learns all worldly business in order to gain the love of Kamala. Kamala true to herself teaches him all he wants. Eventually he gets tired of all of it and leaves that place to become a ferry man. During that time he learns a lot of philosophy from the river. Kamala who now has a son from Siddharth gets bitten by a snake and dies in the arms of Siddharth. Siddharth tries to bring up his son but the son turns out to be defiant and so on and so forth...From the comment I learned that the ferryman who taught him about truth was none other than Budha himself.The passionate scene between Shashi Kapoor and Simmy Grewal heats up the screen..I never had imagined that in the best hands of director and photographer Shashi Kapoor could be so sizzling sensuous. I always find him boring and cold in almost all his movies..The conversation between Kamala and Siddharth is very touching. After sharing a very passionate artistic love making both of them settle to think that they do not love each other. What a disappointment. Two people in true love sometimes are unable to make passionate love due to situations and two people who after all share passionate physical love are not in love..what an irony of life..The consummation of love passion  spiritual  commitment happens only in imaginations ??? I hope not.For Siddharth the journey of spirituality is reverse seem to happen to many people..Its from vairagya renunciation to bhoga materialistic luxury and back again..Some simple men and women who follow simple philosophy and travel from bhoga to yoga and to nirvanaeternal peace seem to be doing it right...However there is nothing right and nothing wrong in this journey...Like a meandering river we all tracecarve different paths suitable to our mind and our body. Also the chakras control our actions at different points of time and determine at one point of time what is predominant for us.The significance of ferryman is not an old concept. In Kannada literature16th century ? Purundara Dasa calls God as ambiga ferryman..God is the ferryman who helps cross this river called life and the ferry is our own body with nine holes. What an artist he must have been to help cross the river in such a perforated boat... Coincidentally I remember this funny incident from Ramayana..Rama requesting a ferrymankevat in Hindi to help him cross river Ganga. Before Kevat lets him in his boat runs and gets a pitcher of water to wash Rama's feet off..When asked why he narrates the reason which seems so hilarious...He says if I let you get in my boat with the dust of your feet there is a fear that the boat may turn into a maid just like stone turning into Ahilya...thats why had to wash your feet..cause I have no other means of living 'main gareeb naiya meri naari naa hoya pade'...";

It seems that the point is you must pursue your quest on your own.

My picture of this activity was different but Chappaqua' shows how obsessed with and involved in drugs Conrad Rooks was.This is a lovely but empty and ultimately not very cinematic film.  Sven Nykvist's photography is at the service of a vision so generalized Siddhartha is a universal type not an individual that too often the images look like something out of National Geographic' with miseenscne by Bollywood. The scenes are not as exotic as those Pasolini created for his Arabian Nights' 1974 nor are Rooks' depictions of Indian rural life ever remotely as real as Satyajit Ray's in the Apu Trilogy.'  For a trippier film version of Hermann Hesse see Fred Haines' Steppenwolf' which came two years after Siddhartha' in 1974.  For a more original film depiction of a spiritual quest see the story of G.I. Gurdjieff as done by Peter Brooks in Meetings with Remarkable men' 1979.".

	schema:headline " Not bad but fails to capture the resplendence of the novel";
	schema:reviewBody "No movie that is even marginally true to the story that Nobel Prizewinning German author Hermann Hesse told in his novel Siddhartha 1951 is without merit and this modest film is no exception. The problem is that while Conrad Brooks who wrote directed and produced the film is true to the storyline of the novel and even in some respects true to the spirit of the novel he fails to bring the power and the resplendence of Hesse's philosophic and spiritual masterpiece to the screen.What made the novel one of the best ever written is the character of Siddhartha himself. Patterned after the Buddha both in temperament and in experience Hesse's Siddhartha the Accomplished One grew up amid extravagant wealth and privilege only to dump it all in an effort to find himself. Brooks fails almost immediately when he leaves out the scene from the book in which the young Siddhartha not wanting to directly disobey his father and to demonstrate his resolve stands up all night waiting patiently for his father's permission to leave their splendid estates. This is one of the great coming of age scenes ever written and an early insight into Siddhartha's strength of character but Brooks gives it barely a notice! Also skirted over too quickly are Siddhartha's years with the samanas in the forest where he practiced meditation and austerities. This part of Siddhartha's life was essential in making him the man he was and in showing us his character. He spent six years with the shamans and gurus of the forest along with his companion Govinda and in the end learned everything they knew and more and yet had not found the answer he sought. This parallels the experience of the emaciated Buddha. Brooks does do the meeting with the Buddha well having us hear his voice but not see him and then follows that up with Siddhartha's reasons for not following the Buddha even though he finds no fault with the Enlightened One's teachings. Note that without his actually meeting the Buddha the life of Siddhartha which is one of the traditional names of the Buddha would so closely parallel that of the Buddha that some people might think that Hesse had written a profane life of the Buddha which might not set well with some Buddhists! Of course we all have the Buddha nature. Siddhartha's life with the courtesan Kamala and the merchant Kamaswami and his spiral into debauchery and sloth is well depicted although again the ultimate disillusionment that Siddhartha experienced is not as well presented as in the novel. Which brings me to Shashi Kapoor who plays Siddhartha. Although he would go on to be the veteran of well over a hundred films and although he is appropriately enough Indian as well as tall dark and handsome and a good actor he fails to evoke the passion that Siddhartha must have. Siddhartha felt everything in a profound manner even boredom was profoundly experienced by the Brahmin's prodigal son. Kapoor especially near the end of the film when he plays an old man occasionally made me feel that he could be the Accomplished One but more often he made me feel that he was holding something back.Finally the poetic scene near the end of the novel when after living with and being guided by Vasudeva the ferryman Siddhartha becomes one with the river and falls spiritually into its wisdom is only a bland shadow of what appears in the novel! Part of the reason for the failure probably has to do with a limited budget. The film is 83 minutes long but could easily be twice that long. Part has to do with the selection of scenes and the emphasis on those scenes and finally part of the reason has to do with the relative inexperience of Brooks who was only directing his second major film and apparently his last. Certainly the onlocation in India cinematography by Sven Nykvist who worked on so many films with Ingmar Berman is not to be faulted. Although not spectacular Nykvist's camera conveys both the exotic beauty and the poverty of a landscape that could have been India 26 centuries ago.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

	onyx:emotionText "No movie that is even marginally true to the story that Nobel Prizewinning German author Hermann Hesse told in his novel Siddhartha 1951 is without merit and this modest film is no exception. The problem is that while Conrad Brooks who wrote directed and produced the film is true to the storyline of the novel and even in some respects true to the spirit of the novel he fails to bring the power and the resplendence of Hesse's philosophic and spiritual masterpiece to the screen.What made the novel one of the best ever written is the character of Siddhartha himself. Patterned after the Buddha both in temperament and in experience Hesse's Siddhartha the Accomplished One grew up amid extravagant wealth and privilege only to dump it all in an effort to find himself. Brooks fails almost immediately when he leaves out the scene from the book in which the young Siddhartha not wanting to directly disobey his father and to demonstrate his resolve stands up all night waiting patiently for his father's permission to leave their splendid estates. This is one of the great coming of age scenes ever written and an early insight into Siddhartha's strength of character but Brooks gives it barely a notice! Also skirted over too quickly are Siddhartha's years with the samanas in the forest where he practiced meditation and austerities. This part of Siddhartha's life was essential in making him the man he was and in showing us his character. He spent six years with the shamans and gurus of the forest along with his companion Govinda and in the end learned everything they knew and more and yet had not found the answer he sought. This parallels the experience of the emaciated Buddha. Brooks does do the meeting with the Buddha well having us hear his voice but not see him and then follows that up with Siddhartha's reasons for not following the Buddha even though he finds no fault with the Enlightened One's teachings. Note that without his actually meeting the Buddha the life of Siddhartha which is one of the traditional names of the Buddha would so closely parallel that of the Buddha that some people might think that Hesse had written a profane life of the Buddha which might not set well with some Buddhists! Of course we all have the Buddha nature.

	schema:reviewBody "Not having read Hesse's novel I went to see this film during its first and controversyplagued release in Calcutta in 1976 purely for the music composed by my idol Hemanta Mukherjee. The film was certified by the censors as fit 'For Adults Only'. By Indian standards I can see why.Regarding the music 2 correspondents had flayed Hemanta Mukherjee in the Calcutta daily THE STATESMAN for having vulgarized Siddhartha's quest with two Bengali songs each from a different and earlier Bengali film. True one can wonder why Bengali in a film which has already used the convention of characters in ancient India speaking English. Imagine Achilles in TROY suddenly breaking into modern Greek while otherwise speaking English. However the theme song on the river is unexceptionable contentwise. I am a little uneasy about the other song. Let us concede that for anyone who has seen the 2 Bengali films the songs would come with their own distinct situational associations. This is my problem with the other song as I had seen the Bengali original by the time I saw SIDDHARTHA.Watching the film again in the late 1980s at the Penultimate Picture Palace Oxford I had to confess to a sneaking sympathy with my cousin who in 1976 had dismissed the film as 'pavement philosophy'. The narrative struck me as potentially pretentious and quite unconvincing in its pontifications at times.The photography however is breathtakingand the cast seem sincere in their performances. Incidentally with reference to user gabravo123 at the PPP Oxford I think a bunch of Bengali students were the only viewers in a single row.Similar to hisher experience? However the reason why not one of us moved as the closing credits rolled is because we were all mesmerized by the divine voice of Hemanta. For gabravo123's information the two songs have been available on a 45 rpm disc since the late 70s only there is no reference to the film on the disc. It is just titled HEMANTA KUMAR. They I'm sure are available now on CDs of the singercomposer's film songs. Incidentally why does gabravo123 mention Rabindranath Tagore? I hope she is not implying that Tagore has anything to do with the lyrics both of which are by the late Gouriprasanna Majumdar.".

	schema:reviewBody "Siddhartha is a young man who leaves home and sets out on a long search for the meaning of life.  He's like a many protagonists from folklore who've sought immortality perfect honesty or whatever  he's engaged on a quest for something that doesn't exist and isn't worth finding which WE could have told him at the very beginning but of course he must find out for himself.  His character matches that of his counterparts in folklore.  He's a nice chap a bit obsessive very clever  but on the one point that motivates him he's exceptionally dense.  He does so much navelgazing that when tragedy touches him we're surprised he even notices.  Don't let this put you off.  You'll like him all the same.By the way although Siddhartha's character is much the same at the end as it is at the beginning there is a brief unconvincing montage that shows him corrupted by worldly values.  We never see the transformation and it's hard to believe that it could possibly have taken place.The India in which the story takes place is timeless albeit convincingly solid although we soon find out that Siddhartha is a contemporary of Buddha who he meets but who doesn't appear in the film.  It's a kind of Buddhist BenHur'.  I thought this was a nice touch but the intrusion of real world creeds is indeed an intrusion.  One problem with this kind of story is that the audience is really just waiting for the hero to realise that he's chasing a rainbow's end and speaking for myself I'd prefer to watch the hero's life rather than listen to empty platitudes and claptrap while I wait.  But I must say the platitudes have been very prettily dressed up.  Hesse or Rooks or whoever is responsible had a great gift for making nothing sound like something.Photography is gorgeous and the gentle editing lulls us into accepting the fairytale.  There's a lovely smorgasbord of Indian music.  SOME of this music you're bound to like  it's much too varied for any one person to dislike it all.  It's not an arresting film but it's a sweet and guileless one.  Try to see it under circumstances that best allow you to absorb the sights and sounds.".

We also would concentrate on Luciano's years in America which could be a familiar plot of the rise and fall of a gang boss.  But Rosi's film begins with him leaving this country it relates the long career that he had in Italy in the drug trade a time that Americans know little of  it doesn't form part of the legend.  Most of all Rosi deliberately downplays the glamor.  The drug trade is big business and this middleaged Luciano is a very solid businessman the director and the actor have undercut the expected charisma.  The efforts of police and government against him are portrayed as factually as possible which makes aspects of their discussions rather unintelligible to Americans.  Of course all these things will make the movie seem rather boring to many viewers here!  If you're looking for gangster thrills go elsewhere this is a movie of ideas a critique directed at Italy in particular.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is boring. Plain boring nothing else. And I've a great tolerance of movies that most people find boring.I still wonder what I just watched. Is it a documentary? Most gangster films are pretty slow but this one is more than that. All action happens in 15 minutes then...nothing. It's like there was no editor or that the material was shot for some kind of documentary.Gian Maria Volont plays his role very good. Rod Steiger is nice but doesn't get enough time to be as great as he usually is. The rest of the cast is OK not a problem here. Gangsters look like gangsters cops look like cops and the dames are plenty.For some seven years now I have been collecting gangster films read books about the subject and even collected news articles about the mafia and such. Most of what I saw in this film is not new for me. Luciano was famous and is nothing short of legend these days. When he moved out of the US he kind of got into the darkness. When this film dragged on I saw some potential stories come by but all just passed and went on. So nothing happened until the end where that thing happened that everyone that ever read a book about the mafia knows that happened.The soundtrack doesn't help. Piero Piccioni can't even live up to his usual 'clone morricone' music and seems only to have written about 7 minutes of music.The DVD I got was a UK version without any subtitle. I can watch English spoken films without much trouble but half of this is in Italian so beware! At first I feared this would have been a action movie disguised as a gangster film but even that wasn't true. It is slow and all that. Of course I never thought I was going to watch a true classic but I almost felt asleep. Still I cannot give it less than a 4. Gian Maria Volont and Rod Steiger together in a film and the sets were good enough. The production itself felt okay. So maybe they should have fired the writer and maybe the editor.It could have been so much more!".

When this film dragged on I saw some potential stories come by but all just passed and went on. So nothing happened until the end where that thing happened that everyone that ever read a book about the mafia knows that happened.The soundtrack doesn't help. Piero Piccioni can't even live up to his usual 'clone morricone' music and seems only to have written about 7 minutes of music.The DVD I got was a UK version without any subtitle. I can watch English spoken films without much trouble but half of this is in Italian so beware! At first I feared this would have been a action movie disguised as a gangster film but even that wasn't true. It is slow and all that. Of course I never thought I was going to watch a true classic but I almost felt asleep. Still I cannot give it less than a 4. Gian Maria Volont and Rod Steiger together in a film and the sets were good enough. The production itself felt okay. So maybe they should have fired the writer and maybe the editor.It could have been so much more!";

As a 2hour movie covering the events of his life in Italy after his extradition it just doesn't work.  There's not enough action eg. shootouts and fistfights to make it worth watching.

I love Webber's Phantom but I also love the original Phantom. I have seen Lon Claude Rains and now Robert Englund in the role of the Phantom and I believe that this film with Englund is a fantastic adaptation of the story. Webber created his screenplay for his musical to bring out the romance of the Phantom while Gerry O'Hara and Duke Sandefur The writers did a great job concentrating on the less romantic phantom but the obsessed genius who would do anything and kill anybody for the woman he was infatuated with.Anyone who has read Leroux knows that the Phantom was a composer and not a singer so the fact that this version did not have the Phantom singing opera was alright by me. As I said before Webber has made too many high expectations for any other version of this story. What I really enjoyed about Dwight Little's Phantom is that it took place in a Opera and actually had Christine singing. Though I do not agree with the Phantom's 'Faustus' like background instead of being a circus freak I can appreciate this movie.The end was a bit 'blaah' and I don't know if I agree with the mixing of modern and flashbacks. I didn't like how they changed the place of Paris to London. I did however like how the ending did enforce the theme of this particular movie Only Love and Music are forever.I think anyone who enjoyed the book the musical and has an open mind to other people's interpretations plus a good love for horror since Phantom of the opera is a horrorGothic novel should see this movie and forget the musical numbers and scores of Webbers before they view it or their expectations will be unfulfilled.810".

Well this story is basically the same except for a few differences. For one a late 80's version of Christine is trying out for the lead role in an opera. During her addition she is hit over the head and knocked out. When she awakens she is back in time in late 1800's London. She seems to have no recollection of even going into the past. The rest of the story is traditional Phantom except for name changes and how disturbed this Phantom is and his origin. I really have to hand it to Robert England as the Phantom or Eric. This is by far one of the best roles I have ever seen him in. And the makeup job for him is astonishing. The fact that this Phantom makes a mask out of human flesh is actually quite creepy. And physically he makes his character of Freddy look like a silly mess.Now for fans of the musical and the original versions of the movie I don't know if you would really like this version. But for fans of 80's slasher mixed with some atmosphere a good soundtrack and good acting I would have to recommend this. I give it an 810.".

But believe it or not I think that Robert Englund did a fairly good job. My favorite Phantom will always be Michael Crawford but when one compares Englund to Gerard Butler's Phantom even using Crawford as the standard he practically blows that little pansyass out of the water. It's refreshing to see an old decrepit Phantom again with more subdued majestic style than Butler's gaudy emo character. Also this time the Phantom isn't scared to spill some blood restoring some respectable fear for Erik that the 2004 version kills. Englund's voiceat least when he isn't screamingseems surprisingly perfect for the part and all film critics alike will see that he can indeed act but has merely been restrained by his previous Freddy typecasting. All in all I'd say this film makes an excellent counterbalance to the 2004 film and both those who like like Chaney's Phantom and Crawford Phanatics alike will definitely enjoy it.".

	schema:headline " More darker horror version of the Phantom provides to be really good.";
	schema:reviewBody "Dwight H. Little THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA 1989First things first this is a supernatural horror version of Gaston Leroux's novel. It is the darkest version of the story then any other I've seen and it has more blood and gore than really needed. But it is also a surprisingly faithful to Leroux.In this version Christine Day finds a 100 years old script named Don Juan Triumphant to use in her Broadway audition. While singing she is thrown back to her former life in London 1881. There she is an opera singer who tutored by Don Juan's composer Erik Destler the Phantom of the Opera. Destler has sold his soul to the Devil so that world would love his music but was hideously scarred from the face. From there on it is the basic Phantom story with more murders. This is probably the only film where Christine kisses only one time and that is with the Phantom. Great!!! The heart and soul of this film is Robert Englund in the title role. I disagree with the peoples who say he is only repeating his role as Freddy Kruger here. Englund's performance is much closer to Gaston Leroux's Erik than Freddy. With his haunting voice menacing eyes and dark appearance Englund gives a performance of a madman who won't allow anything to come to his way. I especially like the scenes where he walks the streets of London at night. Though I don't agree that Erik would take a prostitute I enjoyed his Jack the Ripper appearance in that scene and where he kills the three robbers. He even uses a Punjab lasso once. Rest of the cast are mainly b movie actors with exception of always good Bill Nighy in the minor role.Also Misha Segal deserves a mentioning for the hauntingly beautiful music in this film.Last word Darker version of classic story with supernatural twists highly entertaining if you don't mind little blood and gore.".

	onyx:emotionText "Dwight H. Little THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA 1989First things first this is a supernatural horror version of Gaston Leroux's novel. It is the darkest version of the story then any other I've seen and it has more blood and gore than really needed. But it is also a surprisingly faithful to Leroux.In this version Christine Day finds a 100 years old script named Don Juan Triumphant to use in her Broadway audition. While singing she is thrown back to her former life in London 1881. There she is an opera singer who tutored by Don Juan's composer Erik Destler the Phantom of the Opera. Destler has sold his soul to the Devil so that world would love his music but was hideously scarred from the face. From there on it is the basic Phantom story with more murders. This is probably the only film where Christine kisses only one time and that is with the Phantom. Great!!! The heart and soul of this film is Robert Englund in the title role. I disagree with the peoples who say he is only repeating his role as Freddy Kruger here. Englund's performance is much closer to Gaston Leroux's Erik than Freddy. With his haunting voice menacing eyes and dark appearance Englund gives a performance of a madman who won't allow anything to come to his way. I especially like the scenes where he walks the streets of London at night. Though I don't agree that Erik would take a prostitute I enjoyed his Jack the Ripper appearance in that scene and where he kills the three robbers. He even uses a Punjab lasso once.

	schema:reviewBody "There is no doubt in my mind that the writers of this film were trying to make an enjoyable slasher film to entertain teenagers and attract fans of The Phantom of the Opera at the same time.  What gives this away is the casting of Robert Englund.  It shows that they wanted to attract teenagers by casting Freddy Krueger.  However at the same time the writers include lots of technical stuff from the novel to try and get fans of The Phantom of the Opera.  The result can be one of two things.  You can either have teens screaming saying they were fooled because they thought they were going to see Freddy Krueger kill a lot of people and you can have Phantom fans screaming saying they thought they were going to see a real Phantom film rather then some stupid teenage slasher film.  Personally I am a slasher film fan and not a Phantom fan.  Not because I don't like the Phantom films but just because I've never seen any of them.  My initial reaction to this film was a positive one.  It's stylish has great acting and directing and it's something different.  It's not your typical slice and dice film but rather an interesting look at the Phantom and his life.  Diehard Phantom fans probably won't truly enjoy this as I think at the end the makers of the film quit trying to please everyone and the film degraded into the typical slasher genre.  I really enjoyed this one and personally I think that it's wrong that die hard Phantom fans give this film negative comments.  If you were expecting to see the 1925 version all over again with Robert Englund as the Phantom then you're way off.  Diehard slasher and horror fans as well as Phantom fans should find this at least marginally enjoyable.  out ofThis film is fun and really cool especially when you watch it for the first time and late at night".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a great fan of the story I have seen most film versions of Phantom of the Opera I'm aware of and this is truly one of my absolute favorites.If you're interested in this movie because you're in love with ALW's musical and you just want more Phantom approach this movie with caution. If you're madly in love with every detail of the novel and want to cry every time you think of anything not in the novel approach this movie with caution. While it remains the same tale of a disfigured man desperately doing what he can to spend his life with the woman he loves in a world that won't except him it seems people are often put off by the fact that this film takes greater artistic liberties in telling the story than others but I think that's what should be appreciated about this movie. I am unaware of any takes on The Phantom like this one and feel it is worthwhile for that reason alone if you are interested seeing a variation on the story.This is the story of a much more brutal Phantom reaching out to a great singer who otherwise wouldn't be given a chance in a much more brutal setting. While it is indeed a horror movie it's a unique one featuring creative death scenes and an interesting story. It can be enjoyed as a good horror movie and an enjoyable different Phantom story.Robert Englund's committed portrayal of a man devoted to the beauty of music and love of a woman is greatly admirable. While I'm sure many will jump to disagree I feel his performance in this film while different is far more believable and powerful than Gerard Butler's 2004 performance. As the Phantom he is intimidating and passionate.The real star of this movie is its ohsounderrated score. So often is the music of a Phantom film not brought to the forefront enough. One of the great things about this movie that set it aside from other films based on the same story is that it is as much about Christine's love for The Phantom's music as it is about his love for her. In a film where the score plays such an important role Misha Segal does a brilliant job keeping the audience in suspense making them cringe in horror giving a haunting addictive voice to The Phantom's desperate longing and giving Christine good reason to show interest in a man so ugly.See it for the story see it for the music. Enjoy.".

	schema:headline " Not bad remake";
	schema:reviewBody "Often forgotten after it's release because it was critized as being a takeoff of Andrew Lloyd Webber's then current Broadway musical version of the same title. Actually Dwight H. Little's film version isn't bad and Duke Sandefur's script actually has more originality than some of the earlier versions. Robert Englund is probably the most terrifying phantom yet he probably can't pull it off like Lon Chaney did in the 1925 film version but he certainly did a terrific job at playing a more darker and scarier phantom. Jill Schoelen also did a pretty amazing job playing Christine as she is taken from present day New York to 1881 London were she is the star of the opera and stalked by the phantom and he kills anyone who gets in his way. My favorite death scene is probably were the phantom takes on three thieves and also kills an opera critic in a sauna. In addition to the originality the phantom is cursed by the devil and his face mutilated in a Faust tradition. He is then forced to sew on pieces of skin to save his face. The production is luxurious and the costumes are authentic. But the most greatest thing about this 1989 remake is the music. This is probably the best music I have ever heard for any Phantom film. It's more malvolent and suspensful and also at the same time magicial. Misha Segal certainly did an amazing job at creating a difficult score and it's a shame that I don't hear his music in today's films. I guess the film could have been a little better if it had a little less gore and a good falling chandlier scene but even though this is the only Phantom film without a chandlier it was still an amazing picture. Also look for Saturday Night Live star Molly Shannon in a small role in the New York City sequences.".

This had 2 awesome leads a very cool and interesting story the set pieces were great and i really dug the location it was an eerie setting. The finale was great and exciting and the ending was very cool. The makeup effects were outstanding especially Robert's face very well done!. The direction was great. Dwight H. Little did an excellent job here moving it along at a very nice pace and some very cool creative shots. There is plenty of gore here. We get a ripped out heart a few bloody gunshot wounds impaling a severed head in a bowl crushed face decapitation 2 people get completely skinned nasty 4 bloody stabbings someone sews there face back together very gory and we see Robert Englund's gory face throughout the film.and more! yep plenty here for gore hounds.The acting is GREAT!. Robert Englund is AMAZING here utterly amazing here as the Phantom he is EXTREMELY creepy and did great in the acting department and he is kind of like Freddy Krueger as the Phantom only not as extreme. Jill Schoelen is gorgeous and does very well here although her chemistry with AlexHydeWhite was terrible!. AlexHydeWhite was awful here his delivery was awful and was painful to watch totally over acting and he had no chemistry with Jill. Terence Harvey does okay as the inspector and nothing more. Overall i highly recommend this movie and if ya get it cheap like i did it is well worth purchasing 12 out of 5".

	schema:headline " Great movie in its own right!";
	schema:reviewBody "No the story doesn't follow the plot of the original book. However this was a great film if people can get over preconceived notions of 'how it should be'. Leroux's novel is fiction. It isn't real. There was a real singer named Christine Nilsson who was the prototype for Christine Daae however she was never abducted by a masked fiend. And for those fans who claim the true mask was a white half mask are mistaken and only using Sir Andrew's musical as their background which is only loosely based on Leroux's novel in and of itself. The true mask was a full mask and it was black. Authors and stage managers have been changing the masks' appearance for years ie 1925 with Lon Chaney to fit their storyline or vocal needs. In Sir Andrew's musical the mask is only a half mask because it made for better staging and viewing from the audiences' perspective. If you're truly interested in the staging decisions you can read The Complete Phantom of the Opera which is all about Sir Andrews' musical. I am a slasher fan and a 'Phantom' phanatic. I felt this was a truly cool movie with my favorite villain Mr. Robert Englund. I found this movie highly entertaining. After all isn't that why we go to the movies in the first place? To be entertained? If I wanted a movie that followed the original story line I would be hard pressed to find one. However the characters personalities were very true to the story. Christine Day Daae has always been a modern turn of the century woman with her own ideas and agenda. She was not portrayed as a weak and somewhat low intelligence woman as Sir Andrew portrayed her but that's what makes his musical so engaging. You find yourself rooting for the Phantom simply because it is so easy to manipulate her. In this movie you find yourself rooting for neither the Phantom nor Richard Raoul. You're cheering on Christine to the very end which makes it so wonderfully different from every other 'Phantom' movie out there. That is as much because of Miss Scholoen as it is because of the writers. Miss Scholoen makes Christine seem like me or one of my friends rather than a wispy caricature of femininity. Mr. Englund was as usual creepy beyond words and sexy as hell. If you'll pardon the pun. His genius lies in his ability to make a villain sympathetic without taking away any of the scary and creepy aspects that are so highly prized in a slasher flick. You find yourself feeling sorry for him almost as much as you fear him which builds the tension in your own mind long before the writers want you to be tense. You end up doing all the work of freaking yourself out and then the writers come along and bash you over the head with gore. It's awesome! Bravo to Mr. Englund once again! His portrayal was as true to the story as the plot would allow. The original Erik had quite a bit of blood on his hands. He was not a warm and fuzzy guy. Being kidnapped by the original would not have been the romantic getaway that many 'Phantom' fans think it would be. You would find yourself in the clutches of someone who would willingly blow up an entire opera house himself included just so you couldn't get away. Personally I prefer roses and moonlit walks as a means of wooing. Granted the original had a sad life that made him that way as did Erik Destler of this movie version. To be honest the Devil tricked him. He never said I'm the Devil and when you say you would sell your soul I mean literally. No he was a midget dressed like an organ grinders monkey who simply asked him if musical fame was worth his soul. And Erik never really got that fame did he? No one heard his operas. So was it a fair bargain? No. Poor guy was cheated! If you're a die hard 'Phantom' fan who simply can't separate themselves from either Leroux or Sir Andrew then by all means don't waste your time on this movie. If you have the creative ability to take this movie for what it is a slasher flick based on Phantom of the Opera then you will love this movie as much as I do. If you're a Freddy fan you'll find a million more reasons to thank God for giving us Robert Englund and for pairing him with one of the few actresses who can hold her own next to a legend such as Mr. Englund. I'm speaking of the girlnextdoor beauty Jill Scholoen.".

His portrayal was as true to the story as the plot would allow. The original Erik had quite a bit of blood on his hands. He was not a warm and fuzzy guy. Being kidnapped by the original would not have been the romantic getaway that many 'Phantom' fans think it would be. You would find yourself in the clutches of someone who would willingly blow up an entire opera house himself included just so you couldn't get away. Personally I prefer roses and moonlit walks as a means of wooing. Granted the original had a sad life that made him that way as did Erik Destler of this movie version. To be honest the Devil tricked him. He never said I'm the Devil and when you say you would sell your soul I mean literally. No he was a midget dressed like an organ grinders monkey who simply asked him if musical fame was worth his soul. And Erik never really got that fame did he? No one heard his operas. So was it a fair bargain? No. Poor guy was cheated! If you're a die hard 'Phantom' fan who simply can't separate themselves from either Leroux or Sir Andrew then by all means don't waste your time on this movie. If you have the creative ability to take this movie for what it is a slasher flick based on Phantom of the Opera then you will love this movie as much as I do. If you're a Freddy fan you'll find a million more reasons to thank God for giving us Robert Englund and for pairing him with one of the few actresses who can hold her own next to a legend such as Mr. Englund. I'm speaking of the girlnextdoor beauty Jill Scholoen.";

The idea of using skin for a mask was pretty original idea in place of the death mask and his red death at the masquerade was good as well. There are many details it includes that are from the book that aren't in the 2004 movie.SPOILERS The rat catcher The Opera and part in which Christine understudies for La Carlotta Faust The attempted suicide by Christine by banging her head against the wall though on the movie it does not look like she hit her head hard The wedding march or funeral march SpoilerI prefer the 2004 because of the music and the romance of it all but it all comes down to the bottom line If you are looking for gore and horror this is a good one and not for the weak of stomach.

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start out by saying that I'm a horror fan. I love all forms of horror from the silent classics to the newage shocker films. It's a genre that is near and dear to my heart so when I stumbled across this version of the great Lon Chaney classic screw that french dude his story didn't even tap the potential of the story I HAD to see it.The basic premise is that love and music live forever. The movie starts in the 80's where Christine is looking for a fresh new audition piece and stumbles upon Don Juan Triumphant a great unfinished musical. While in the audition a freak accident flashes her back to what appears to be a past life in which she is an underappreciated actress in the shadow of a great diva. True fans of the world of the Phantom can guess where the story goes from here.The acting in this movie is above average. While it isn't the best you'll see you have to respect the classical training of many of the actors. Jill Schoelen plays the best Christine I've seen in a film and Bill Nighy is as always great... even though his role is pretty small. Robert Englund better known to slasher fans as Freddy Krueger does moderately well. He plays the sadistic side of the phantom very well. While he is no Lon Chaney who is really?! His performance is equally haunting and captivating.The sets are very well done especially considering the time it was made. Many other 'classic' films made circa this time had horrendous sets and visuals Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein was great but had TERRIBLE sets can I get an amen? So I had to throw some Kudos for them.The sense that the film was made to cater to two separate audiences is clear with the added psychotic nature of the phantom and the decent death sequences but any true horror fan can appreciate the film for it's very decent adaptation of an overdone story.".

His deep rooted hatred for the human race went to the extent that he took a job as a carpenter for the new Paris Opera House and built the famous mazes and tunnels below it's basement where he lived his entire life seeking revenge on the world by capturing actors singers and spectators and than locking them for weeks on end in a torture chamber below the Opera House.

I disagree that Jill Schoelen was not a good christine. She can sing awesome she's smoking hot and captures the innocence sensuality and talent of christine perfectly. Sometimes i did feel like her character was crafted to somehow fit in with the stage christines though. The supernatural twist was a bit much in my opinion it took away my sympathy for Erick's character. However i enjoyed the twist that the phantom is actually a. phantom. Without this element it is actually very close t the book. I love the gore and the atmosphere.

There is gore but this is a horror moviethere's gotta be some gore. However the violence in it does not take away from the full impact of the story and it just isn't unnecessary violence...it fits into the storyline and it helps bring out different shades of the Phantom's personality.As far as the cast goes Englund is perfectly cast portraying both a menacing Phantom and one to be pitied. He might be the best actor to portray him yet. The rest of the cast is good as well and the direction is stylish. Actually only Christine is dissapointing. Jill Schoelen does a nice job playing the innocent opera star but she does doesn't have the impact earlier attempts did. She is however very believable at the end.Great film. Go rent it. Don't listen to what many critics have said about it calling it a gorefest and a ruthless display of violence. It simply isn't true....This movie is superb. Gaston Leroux would have been so proud.".

There is gore but this is a horror moviethere's gotta be some gore. However the violence in it does not take away from the full impact of the story and it just isn't unnecessary violence...it fits into the storyline and it helps bring out different shades of the Phantom's personality.As far as the cast goes Englund is perfectly cast portraying both a menacing Phantom and one to be pitied. He might be the best actor to portray him yet. The rest of the cast is good as well and the direction is stylish. Actually only Christine is dissapointing. Jill Schoelen does a nice job playing the innocent opera star but she does doesn't have the impact earlier attempts did. She is however very believable at the end.Great film. Go rent it. Don't listen to what many critics have said about it calling it a gorefest and a ruthless display of violence. It simply isn't true....This movie is superb. Gaston Leroux would have been so proud.";

Who better to tackle this than Robert Englund king of 80s horror and Menahem Golan king of 80s horrible? The end result is an interesting concoction that mixes 80s slasher attitude with 19th century sentiment.Director Dwight Little hot off the success of HALLOWEEN 4 brings an unusual sense of prestige to a film. The film benefits from excellent cinematography ornate costumes and beautiful Hungary locations. While it isn't going to convert any Webber fanatics it may have conned a few the film is one of the more extravagant horror films from the late 80s. The script by Gerry O'Hara offers a few deviations from the original Gaston Leroux source novel. There is no chandelier scene apparently cut due to budget and the film inserts completely wrongheaded wraparound segments set in modern day New York. I guess the producers figured a Victorian Era tale wouldn't hold attention spans no matter how bloody.And this is easily the goriest version of PHANTOM to date. Highlights include beheadings skull crushing skin removal and throat slashing. Unfortunately it seems a bit of this feel victim to the MPAA. John Buechler's MMI handled the graphic gore while Kevin Yagher's team contributes the scarred Phantom makeup. This may not have been the best move because the end result is something so similar to the Freddy Krueger image Yagher did the Freddy makeup for the last few NIGHTMARE films that it comes off as almost a reproduction.That is not to say that Englund is merely going through the horror icon motions. His portrayal of Phantom Erik Destler is very serious and unlike any previous incarnations. This Phantom keeps the wisecracks to a minimum and is completely unsympathetic. It is kind of hard to feel for him as he screams Christine! when you've just watched him literally rip someone's heart out. Then again Jill Schoelen isn't much of a muse either. While she does perfectly fine in contemporary set horror films she seems a bit out of place in 1885 England with her raspy voice. The rest of the cast is comprised mostly of British actors. They are quite good especially Bill Nighy recently seen in THE CONSTANT GARDENER and Terence Harvey as the Scotland Yard Inspector trying to figure out the murders.1989 certainly was a productive year for Englund. He saw his directorial debut 976EVIL released in theaters in March. The fifth installment of the ELM STREET series hit theaters in August. And this version of PHANTOM debuted in November. As much as Englund tried to separate this turn from his Freddy image the studio played it up check out the poster above. The film opened on close to 1500 screens but fared rather poorly. Despite the poor box office just under 4 million total domestically the film ended up being 21st Century's highest theatrical grosser. Actually it is their only theatrical grosser because this film tanked the company.".

	schema:reviewBody "For those who are familiar to the previous films of the story this movie is based on a novel by Gaston Leroux. Leroux is best known as a Poet Journalist and Novelist. Everyone knows the Story from Leroux's novel which is about a man who lurks underneath the opera theater. He waits for a greater talent to come one who could act and sing in the opera house. Once he sees that talent from afar this man would does anything in his power to turn that talented singer into a big star. But this man is also a mysterious figure and he keeps everything into himself hiding from the world.Unfortunately this 1989 feature turned to a nearslasher movie But the original story still remains. Like the previous films about the phantom. It is still a horror movie. The Phantom of the Opera is played by Robert Englund Who is better known his role as Freddy Krueger in the Nightmare in Elm Street Series. Englund does some of his best work as the phantom. He plays a man who was talented as a musician but once sold his soul to the devil so that his music would be immortalized but instead he becomes an immortal and his music remains unheard or simply unfinished masterpieces. The film starts in 1989 as an ambitious young female singer Jill Schoelen finds music notes in the basement at a New York Public Library. She is hoping to find great music to impress her next audition in any famous theater in the city. When she surprised people at the audition when she nearly got killed in the stage by accident. She mysteriously finds herself transported back to VictorianEra London 1881.Then she becomes fascinated by a mysterious man who never shown his face to her. This stranger helps her sing and in order become a major star in the opera. Unfortunately this talented young star is overshadowed by a meanspirited diva Stephanie Lawrence who doesn't want her to costar in the play with her. Then trouble being when the Phantom starts committing murder in her honor so that nothing gets in her way. He will never stop committing these crimes until she become a star his possible chance at redemption and to complete his music with her. Maybe even a second chance in love.This film is directed by Dwight H. Little who directed a successful film the previous yearHalloween 4The Return of Micheal Myers. Which it was a pretty good sequel. Little has a decent film career who went on to directMarked to Death Rapid Fire Starring the lateBrandon Lee Free Willy 2 Murder at 1600 and just recently the sequel to Anaconda. This film is nicely well directed and it does deliver the goods Especially in the horror sequences. For a low budget production is well produced but the film has a few obvious mistakes. At times the production values could have been much better if the film had larger budget. But what makes up for some fatal flaws are the Cast Terrific MakeUp effects work by Kevin Yagher and a good music score by Misha Segal.This film was briefly released in the fall of 1989. Once it was released in theaters the film was too slow for the true horror audience yet too much for the larger audiences. Several film critics really hated this film because of the graphic violence. Which caused a problem with the rating boards before the film's release. The film originally received an XRating. It was a year before the new rating NC17 existed. Furthermore the film had a limited release because of an independent distribution.The Phantom of the Opera found an audience when it came out on video and it sort of lived on ever since to become a cultclassic. Well i liked this film maybe because the horror elements in it. It is certainly One of the Fascinating Horror Movies of the late 1980's. It was also a little different than most horror movie back then. It is also a very unusual movie because it was shocking beautiful and elegant at times.Since it came out on DVD recently it has been revamped with better picture quality and sound. It may find more life like in this format. The film isn't perfect but to me It is a worth a look. Centainly Horror Fans may like it also. You know there is something odd happens in the film's credits. When the producers credit this 1989 version as This motion picture is not associated with any current or prior stage play or motion picture of the same title. Isn't that weird ? I guess The Producers didn't want to get sued from the previous films or especially Andrew Lloyd Webber's Musical Play of the Phantom ! .".

Ever since the Lon Chaney which is still the closest to the book version Erik has lost his edge and become a sort of disfigured James Bond. While I don't have much of a problem this is a nice beak from that. Robert Englund is one of my favorite actors and this was the first or second movie I saw him in the first if it wasn't this one would have been Urban Legend decent movie on TV. He plays Erik with a sinister sensuality. His lanky frame and Kruegeresque swagger are fine qualities he comes of confident. Erik was like that in the book many times though he did become a lovesick puppy with Christine. Yes it's a slasher yes they make Erik quite cruel in it but it does have many little tidbits from the book. Plus it has the masked ball scene which helps it score high with me!! Go in with an open mind and acceptance of a crueler Erik or a sickness of a loveydovey Erik and you should enjoy it. At least it's better than the Julian Sands version.".

	schema:reviewBody "EXTREMITIES is the disturbing yet riveting screen version of a play by William Mastriosimone who adapted his own play for the screen about a woman who is attacked in her car one night by a wouldbe rapist on her way home and is terrified when she realizes the man got her purse and knows where she lives. After her roommates leave for work the next day the guy shows up at her home and attempts to rape her. The story takes a surprising twist when at one point the woman turns the tables on the man and is able to overpower him but when she realizes there is no way that attempted rape can be proved and if the man is arrested he will just get off she decides to keep him prisoner in the house until she can get a confession out of him. Farfetched? Maybe. Disturbing? Definitely but there's a wonderfully claustrophobic feel about this film especially the middle with just the woman and her attacker that you can't help but feel completely a part of what's going on. I did not see the play on Broadway but I would imagine a piece like this works better onstage but that doesn't make this film any less riveting an experience. Farrah Fawcett one of the last actresses to do the role on Broadway was awarded the role of Marjorie in the film version and delivers a taut and deeply moving performance as the victim who refuses to be a victim. Many critics found Fawcett's performance to be onenote but for me Marjorie is a woman completely numbed by what she has been through and the performance works for me. James Russo in the performance of his career is slimy and menacing as the wouldbe rapist who finds Marjorie to be much more of a challenge than he assumed. Alfre Woodard and Diana Scarwid costar as Marjorie's roommates who come home after Marjorie has overpowered the guy and has him tied up and stuffed in their fireplace upon their arrival. And it's the arrival of the roommates that take the story to an unexpected level because they didn't see what we saw Marjorie go through and therefore think she should call the police and let them handle the guy. Not for the faint of heart but if you can stand it a gripping film experience anchored by a lead performance that will surprise you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kudos to Fawcett to taking on roles that at the time were considered controversial. To my recollection rape was still a taboo subject in the 1980's and women's rights and emotions were rarely so deeply examined during that time.Fawcett is simply a woman who is followed then stalked by actor James Russo. He is adequate as the obsessed psychopath but at times a bit transparent.Diana Scarwid has a bit role as does Alfre Woodard as the house mate. Woodard worries about the legal consequences when Fawcett the rape victim takes revenge on the culprit. The scene where she throws a frying pan of hot oil at Russo is classic and as the rapist he deserves it. She then keeps him in bondage and the consequences must be faced.A very real story reflecting the emotions and rage of rape victims who have been violated physically and mentally. Highly recommended. 810.".

	schema:headline " Extremities Hits You Where It Hurts!";
	schema:reviewBody "As a stage play one can imagine how shocked audiences were when they stepped into William Mastrosimone's Extremities. Having to watch a woman on stage being brutalized in her own home by a stranger is not an experience I imagine to be fun. But it is a fascinating and utterly compelling story that leads into some very unexpected directions. In 1986 Extremities became a movie adapted by Mastrosimone himself. With the incredible performances of Farrah Fawcett and James Russo some very believable fight choreography and a tightly woven script Extremities goes to new extremes as a film.Alone in her car one night innocent Marjorie is threatened by a man with a knife. Just before he attempts to rape her she escapes. The bad news is the cops aren't helpful and the criminal has her credentials. He knows where she lives. A week later Marjorie is home alone while her friends the attractive Terry and social worker Pat are away at work. Out of the blue a man waltzes right into the house and asks Marjorie if a guy named Joe lives there. No matter how many times she tells him No Joe lives here it becomes evident that this is the man that attacked Marjorie the other night. He beats her tries to smother her with a pillow and then tries to rape her again. But he doesn't get away with it when Marjorie sprays him in the face with insect repellent ties him up and jails him in the fireplace. But when Terry and Pat come home and there's no proof that the attacker laid a hand on her Marjorie's only safety net is to keep him locked up until he confesses his sins. If he doesn't she'll kill him.Ariel Dorfman's Death and the Maiden bears remarkable similarities to Extremities but Mastrosimone's story works exceptionally well as a film knowing the decade that the film was released in. The same decade produced such crime movies as The Accused and TV's stunner The Burning Bed another Farrah Fawcett feature. This was when women took hold of their sexuality and wouldn't allow themselves to be exploited by men. Keeping that in mind will allow the viewer of Extremities to connect to the plot whether they're male or female.The movie also raises several questions about where the line is drawn in terms of justice. If a man rapes or beats a woman does the victim have a right to physically hurt the other person? Worse if there's no proof of rape what can the victim do to save herself? Marjorie pulls no punches. She is dead serious about keeping the police out of it and killing this home invader. But with his word against hers she could go to jail for life. Though she is fully aware of the consequences she can't allow him to walk away. Extremities is controversial and gives the viewer plenty to talk about when the movie's over.However I find it impossible to avoid the movie's rather typical opening which begins differently from the play. The opening is almost like a Bgrade 80's slasher movie and I'm sure that's not what Mastrosimone was aiming for. But things get much better once we're isolated with Marjorie and the rapist in the house. When he walks through the front door the guy easily gives us the creeps. We know he's up to something. The tension grows and grows as he commits more embarrassing and painful acts towards Marjorie. When she takes control the suspense goes together perfectly with the drama a classy combination for a movie so gritty and violent.In terms of casting Mastrosimone and director Robert M. Young picked up two of the stage production's regulars the beautiful Farrah Fawcett and the alarmingly intimidating James Russo. Fawcett was just breaking free from her Charlie's Angels reputation and this movie put her on the map. Marjorie is not at all an easy role to play but Fawcett gladly accepts the challenge. Her performance is booming and simmering with a quiet anger. She makes Marjorie a very sympathetic and frail woman at first. Notice how her voice breaks every time she's about to cry. And when she throws the rapist in the fireplace and threatens him with a shovel you understand her pain. Fawcett turns Marjorie into a force not to be messed with. How she walked away without an Oscar nomination proves that this woman was one of the most underrated actresses of her time. James Russo is absolutely spinetingling as the rapist. His beady eyes and twisted smile make your skin crawl every time he's on screen which is for the majority of the film. He too deserves more praise. Alfre Woodard is decent as Pat but Diana Scarwid's performance as Terry is flawed. It is basically too overthetop. She cries too much and her dialog is delivered too unbelievably her worst case being a monologue about a past encounter with a rapist. What translated so effectively on stage to the public has changed here and the way Scarwid portrays it it comes off more as forced subtext than being related to Marjorie's troubles.Does Extremities have its minor quibbles? Of course. Most movies do. But this is a film that plays most of its cards correctly and aims its darts close to the bullseye. If it weren't performed so believably by its leads the movie wouldn't have nearly as much impact as the play. Movies like this are always more frightening when you realize that it can happen. Mastrosimone's story feels very real which helps Extremities to be a powerful adaptation.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whatever magic and power this had on the stage is lost on the screen. Scripted by Mastrosimone from his own play this movie attempts to make a statement about the subject of rape but ultimately fails because of weak pacing limp dialogue and horrendous supporting performances.The film begins with Fawcett's character getting off work. She is terrorized by a man in a parking lot. She is able to get away and runs to the cops who are impotent to do anything. Fast forward several days later Fawcett is at the home she shares with her two friends. The two friends head off to their respective jobs and moments later Fawcett's attacker arrives at home and proceeds to slap her around and attack her in the most sadistic brutal and exploitative ways. Then she turns the tables on him. As he has a grip on her she reaches for a can of bug spray gets him in the eyes throws a pot of hot water on him then proceeds to tie him up and stuff him in the fireplace figuring out what to do next.At this point much of what has gone on is remotely suspenseful. However once the two roommates reenter the picture the movie becomes banal with some horrendous dialogue mostly shouting matches where idiot and moron are tossed around. Since there was no actual rape Fawcett realizes she has no case and the cops will only let the man free to attack her again. Moreover she can't make her own roommates believe her. The climax of the film is soapopera material and nothing more.I don't feel the need to comment much more on this except that the ending doesn't ring true Alfre Woodard has gone on to more worthy projects Grand Canyon Down In The Delta and this one probably should've been left on the stage. A frustrating movie that I can't recommend.".

	onyx:emotionText "Whatever magic and power this had on the stage is lost on the screen. Scripted by Mastrosimone from his own play this movie attempts to make a statement about the subject of rape but ultimately fails because of weak pacing limp dialogue and horrendous supporting performances.The film begins with Fawcett's character getting off work. She is terrorized by a man in a parking lot. She is able to get away and runs to the cops who are impotent to do anything. Fast forward several days later Fawcett is at the home she shares with her two friends. The two friends head off to their respective jobs and moments later Fawcett's attacker arrives at home and proceeds to slap her around and attack her in the most sadistic brutal and exploitative ways. Then she turns the tables on him. As he has a grip on her she reaches for a can of bug spray gets him in the eyes throws a pot of hot water on him then proceeds to tie him up and stuff him in the fireplace figuring out what to do next.At this point much of what has gone on is remotely suspenseful.

After subjecting Marjorie to plenty of degradation and psychological abuse Marjorie manages to turn the tables on Joe and locks him in the fireplace. What is Marjorie going to do with Joe? Director Robert M.

Joe perceives women strictly as objects while Marjorie only sees Joe as an animal. However this movie to its admirable credit refuses to make Joe out to be simply a vile onedimensional creep instead he's a terrifyingly real and ultimately pitiable human monster with a wife and kid Joe's climactic confession in particular is genuinely poignant. Fawcett and Russo are both outstanding in the leads they receive fine support from Diana Scarwid as the passive Terry Alfre Woodard as the sensible Patricia and Sandy Martin as sympathetic policewoman Officer Sudow. Both Curtis Clark's agile cinematography and J.A.C. Redford's shivery skincrawling score greatly enhance the considerable claustrophobic tension. A real powerhouse.".

She scarcely escapes the first attack a car jacking where they end up in a discreet parking spot. She manages to get away leaving her car and wallet behind. With not much help from authorities der we've seen it so many times before in rape films it now becomes a game of waiting with Farrah quite on edge and rightfully so. She does share house with two other women. Diana Scarwid very good as a wild impulsive sort and Alfre Woodard as a more wiser black woman the only one partially sympathetic to the rapist after the tables are turned and turned they are. Farrah becomes caught in conflict with her mates who return to find Joe the battered faced rapist chained up in the fireplace. She wants to kill Joe on the too probable count that if tried and he gets off he will come at her again. This is a real life situation scenario here Woodard of course dead set against the idea. For rape victims this movie is not for you. It's an intense grueling flick about the rape process where the consequences for a criminal's acts here are extreme hence the title for low class sort Joe a wonderful Russo But it's Farrah who engrosses us where Extremities is an engrossing and with a wonderfully claustrophobic atmosphere where indeed it's well shot where most of the movie is set in Farrah's pad. For some viewers it'll be tough to watch. Too what's shocking is Russo's admittance and his intentions when untied and falling to the floor where then Scarwid surprisingly becomes sympathetic. Although I really didn't like it's ending Extremities is powerful movie making and far from escapist fare for viewers wanting to leave reality behind. I would also like to see the play one day but for now I'll stick to the movie.".

After dismantling him and blockading him inside her fireplace she and her two female roommates struggle with what to do next.This is an all around minimalist thriller that is taut and effective in spite of locale limitations. The film is structured much like the stage play with the majority of the action taking place in the confines of a living room. Thus the film is very much dialoguedriven dependent on strong performances which the cast deliver. Farrah Fawcett is one of the most underrated actresses ever as far as I'm concerned and her performance in this film is proof of it she was much more than a pretty face on Charlie's Angels and plastered on the walls of teenage baby boomer boys' bedrooms. James Russo who also starred in the stage production with Fawcett plays the villain with tenacity and menace that is overtaken in the second act as the film swirls with moral debate between the two other women Alfre Woodard and Diana Scarwid provide solid and necessary support here. The real electric chemistry at the crux of the film is between Fawcett and Russo and this is very likely due to their past experience playing out the narrative onstage together regardless both of these performances are honest and believable.Though not exactly a suspense film there is a high level of tensity maintained throughout nearly every scene is rife with it. The opening sequence featuring a pointof view shot from Russo as he stalks potential victims in the night before locking in on Fawcett is especially sinister and almost reminiscent of a slasher film. The denouement follows a jawdropping onetoone between the two leads with a hunting knife and family jewels.Overall Extremities is a minimalist but solid thriller that works as a thriller and as an acting decathlon for Fawcett and Russo especially Fawcett. I'd say to see it just for the acting but there is also a great handling of material here that shapes the source material into a formidable and disturbing adaptation. 810.".

	schema:headline " High level rape film a winner for our late Farrah";
	schema:reviewBody "Extremities is a story of a man overwhelmed with guilt one that has proved to be fatal turning him killer. When first learning of this film back at the start of '87 I thought it was just about some psycho getting his kicks raping women. Little did I know. Our rapist Joe has already raped a score of women and disposed of em'. Only his latest Marjorie Fawcett in a great dramatic performance has managed to escape when first car jacked and driven to a deserted underpass. Marjorie explains her situation to the police none too helpful where the police woman tells her straight there's a chance he could get off. Farrah's even mistaken for a hooker by a young cop who interrupts the not so progressing well conversation. She leaves irate and by not signing this certain form the cops can't take action. The rapist has got her wallet with her id so we know what's gonna ensue. We too see Joe has a family where he has been kept pretty faceless up to this point. When he's in his little shed examining Farrah's id his cute little daughter knocks on the glass informing him dinner's almost ready. So now with Farrah it's a waiting game. Her two housemates Patti and Terri have been informed of the situation. Even when the pizza guy comes delivering a meal Farrah is rather surly when he asks if the three of them live together which is understandable. Then days later low and behold a man freely enters her house asking after a Joe. And from here the real drama and suspense begins claustrophobic one would say as Russo great here gets quite physical and cruel at one point almost threatening to toss a pan of burnt bacon onto her. He also examines her particulars even making opportunity to indulge in some forced sex cause in reality there's no way in hell she'd go out with this creep of low class status. Keeping with the stage play she finally turns the tables on the attacker after luring him on when on top of her falsely. She then sprays his eyes with insecticide cracks a hot glass kettle of coffee over his head before strangling him and barricading him in a fireplace from which there is no escape. Not much sooner does her two friends return from work and cross this scene of madness. The two do not agree with her illogical plan of murder which too could be seen as logical if this madman gets off. We do weigh these real life options. Scarwid a great character actress brings an effervescent quirky and sexy character as Terri while the more mature Woodard gives a very humane and real performance I liked. She's the only one showing compassion to the not so healthy looking Russo. Farrah at one point who's taken enough of her says Why don't you just f..k him. That'll make him feel better. Extremities is a real film of real situations and choices. Even near the end Scarwid chooses to stay with Russo when Farrah and co get the cops warming up to him some as hearing his reasons. One particular moment with Farrah running her knife down Russo's lower region may make you flinch. This is a great dramatic film that I wouldn't suggest a rape victim should watch. It's all too real as are the performances and I'm not just talking the mains. You will feel pretty washed out at the end of this too as in these claustrophobic movies. The up tempo music score at it's opening is all so unfitting though even though I liked it a lot so.".

And from here the real drama and suspense begins claustrophobic one would say as Russo great here gets quite physical and cruel at one point almost threatening to toss a pan of burnt bacon onto her. He also examines her particulars even making opportunity to indulge in some forced sex cause in reality there's no way in hell she'd go out with this creep of low class status. Keeping with the stage play she finally turns the tables on the attacker after luring him on when on top of her falsely. She then sprays his eyes with insecticide cracks a hot glass kettle of coffee over his head before strangling him and barricading him in a fireplace from which there is no escape. Not much sooner does her two friends return from work and cross this scene of madness. The two do not agree with her illogical plan of murder which too could be seen as logical if this madman gets off. We do weigh these real life options. Scarwid a great character actress brings an effervescent quirky and sexy character as Terri while the more mature Woodard gives a very humane and real performance I liked. She's the only one showing compassion to the not so healthy looking Russo. Farrah at one point who's taken enough of her says Why don't you just f..k him. That'll make him feel better. Extremities is a real film of real situations and choices. Even near the end Scarwid chooses to stay with Russo when Farrah and co get the cops warming up to him some as hearing his reasons. One particular moment with Farrah running her knife down Russo's lower region may make you flinch. This is a great dramatic film that I wouldn't suggest a rape victim should watch. It's all too real as are the performances and I'm not just talking the mains. You will feel pretty washed out at the end of this too as in these claustrophobic movies. The up tempo music score at it's opening is all so unfitting though even though I liked it a lot so.";

Therefore her attacker now knows where she lives. 3. A total stranger is in their living room fireplace with bug spray in his eyes and a nice scalp cut near his temple. 4. There's obviously been a fight because there's broken crockery on the floor and the phones have been yanked out of the wall.So why in the name of God is Pat so willing to hear Joe out??????? Is it really so much of a leap for her to figure out that this is the guy who attacked Marjorie before??????? But we need there to be some doubt in how this will play out so Pat has to play incredibly dumb and almost fall for Joe's story.All in all the plot's inherent weakness overshadows very strong performances from the four principals.

When James Russo first appears it's very unsettling. He is so good at being despicable it becomes very satisfying what happens to him. The fact that he plays a father makes him even more disgusting. This movie has good suspense in general. Farrah Fawcett is extremely sympathetic as our heroine. I thought she did a fantastic job. My only real complaint is that it falters a bit in the second half.

	schema:reviewBody "I rate both films exactly the same but for very different reasons the first film was an enjoyable romp fusing horror and comedy to great effect. When I saw that there was to be this sequel 6 years later I was very pleased indeed. What I hadn't bargained for was the sharpness of the writing and the satirical structure that director Dante laid out for audiences to watch.Focusing very much on the then modern obsessions like tearing things down to build state of the art monstrous complexes or the need for a better world be it the laboratory testings for better life forms or machines to run our lives Gremlins 2 plays out as a sort of morality tale that sees the creatures themselves as byproducts of the human condition.

When I saw that there was to be this sequel 6 years later I was very pleased indeed. What I hadn't bargained for was the sharpness of the writing and the satirical structure that director Dante laid out for audiences to watch.Focusing very much on the then modern obsessions like tearing things down to build state of the art monstrous complexes or the need for a better world be it the laboratory testings for better life forms or machines to run our lives Gremlins 2 plays out as a sort of morality tale that sees the creatures themselves as byproducts of the human condition.

It successfully continues the underlying theme of the original unlike a lot of sequels which seem to forget their points entirely gremlins are mythical creatures blamed for mechanical errors if an appliance is broken it must have been the work of gremlins.  In this movie the gremlins are loose in a totally automated highrise office building already suffering from its own malfunctions which serves as the perfect playground for them.  Charles Haas' script is absolutely hilarious filled with more movie injokes than I can recall seeing in a single movie and it even pokes fun at the more serious original.  In fact I think many people disliked this film because of its total irreverence compared to the first it didn't try to be scary for a second and Rick Baker's creature effects turned out goofier than Chris Walas's original creature designs.  Just realize...this is a comedy! Definitely worth seeing more than once to catch the barrage of jokes and references...and sit all the way through the credits!".

I'm now 20 years old and this is still one of my most favourite movies of all time. It's even better than the original I believe. The reason I love it so much is because it is so damn strange. It really really is! It's like a live action Looney Tunes episode. The gremlins are wacky Gizmo is cute and mysterious the human actors are all brilliant in their roles and the New York building setting is well neat.The basic premise for this movie picks up a few years after the first Gremlins movie. This time however it takes place in the busiest city on the planet New York.The movie opens with the death of Gizmo's frail Chinese owner. In accordance with the owners death the place where Gizmo is kept is demolished by a bulldozer and recking ball. Terrified Gizmo flees from the building and into an alley where he is plucked up by a scientist and brought to the Clamp Cable Network building. The building belongs to media mogul Daniel Clamp and contains a vast variety of shops including coffee houses restaurants dental clinics and science laboratories.Coincidentally Billy and Kate are both working in the same building. Billy is in the art department and Kate gives guided tours of the building. It is here that they stumble upon Gizmo and the inevitable happens.I won't give anymore of the story line away. If you haven't seen this movie yet I urge you to. It may not be brilliant in the eyes of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences but it is in my eyes. 10 stars!".

My 9yearold self was a HUGE fan of the first movies and staring at a standee taller than me featuring wonderful artwork for those sequels was big deal for me. I pity kids nowadays who don't have the attention span to soak up little moments like that.Dante takes everything that was great about Gremlins and cranks it all the way up to a zillion. The original movie was a dark xmas comedy horror with Bmovie undertones. The sequel goes so overthetop it launches itself into the stratosphere and doesn't come back down until the very very end of the credits. It's just walltowall mayhem with so many injokes it'll make your head explode. The movie even attempts to begin as a Looney Tunes cartoon.Gizmo now back with Mr. Wing escapes the curiosity shop after the old man dies and is found by a scientist working at Splice of Life a laboratory located in the Clamp Premiere Regency Trade Centre and Retail Concourse a big skyscraper in Manhattan. Working in the art department of that skyscraper is Billy Peltzer hero of the first film. Billy eventually locates and rescues Gizmo but he gets wet before Billy can take him home spawning a new generation of cute fluffy malevolent Mogwai Mohawk Lenny Edward G. Robinsonlookalike George and the absolutely mad Daffy. They eat after midnight at a Yoghurt stand in the lobby. The following day the Clamp building and all of the tenants from the Archery Channel to the movie print itself leading to an amusing cameo from Hulk Hogan are besieged by a horde of gremlins intent on mass destruction and good times at any cost.One can accuse the film of having no story beyond giving the Gremlins a lively backdrop for their wild antics but when you're having so much fun isn't that what matters most? Goldsmith's score sadly underrepresented on the 22yearold Varese Sarabande CD has a lot more weight second time around backedup by a large orchestra and stringbased action cues. You'll absolutely love it! Chris Columbus didn't return for this movie leaving scripting duties to Charlie Haas. He uses the Gremlins and the location to skewer big city culture and satirize business tycoons. John Glover is brilliant as the easily excitable Daniel Clamp a Donald Trumplike property magnate who has more money and power than he knows what do with.It's amazing that a third Gremlins movie was never made. Despite it now being 22 years since Gremlins 2 and 28 years since the first movie virtually every kid knows what the Gremlins are and are familiar with Gizmo who may well be the cutest thing that ever existed. It's still a huge cash cow and a recognizable brand and why Warner never greenlit Gremlins 3 is puzzling to say the absolute least.One last thing. Stay with this film until the end of the credits.".

I am actually convinced that Spike has taken on a life of his own kinda the way Freddy did in Wes Craven's New Nightmare and lives to make my life difficult.  Joe Dante's Gremlin's has had that much of an impact on my life.  Gremlins was a wonderful film and it was a little more creepy than it was funny.  But make no mistake about this one it is one of the funnier movies that I've seen.  It abandons all that was scary and atmospheric in the first and just adds comedy aplenty.  And I would seriously put this humour up against some of the funnier comdies of the 90's.This time the adventures of Magwai and Spike reach a skyskraper like building owned by a guy that has to be a distant cousin of Donald Trump. And if you think back to Gremlins remember how much trouble the little guys could get into using simple household products microwave chimney etc  well that is nothing compared to what they can do at an office filled with the latest technology.  There are also many many inside jokes about Hollywood and such that you have to watch it several times to pick up on all of them.  What is also great about the film is the two versions  one for the theater and one for the VCR   I remember when I saw this in the theater I really thought something was wrong with the projector when it first went all strange.  And I like the fact that the makers of this had the guts and the gaul to try something new like that.  It kind of reminds me of Something About Mary when at the end the entire cast is singing that song.  The movie never stops trying to entertain and that is what I got from this film too.  It will do anything to make you laugh even throw in a little Hulkamania when he was cool.Gremlins 2 is one of the funniest films that you will see.  And I'm just a little surprised that Joe Dante isn't still active so much in the business anymore.  He made some great films and I would gladly see anything that he puts his name on.  If you haven't seen this film for quite some time then I highly suggest that you do see it soon.  I was browsing through Rick Baker's filmography on the IMDb and I came across Gremlins 2.  I rented it the same night and I was very glad I did.  Not only did it make me laugh it brought me back to a time when films like this and The Goonies and even E.T. were made.  Movies aren't the same anymore and that is not neccessarily a criticism it is just a comment pointing out that in the early 90's and the 80's movies were just different sometimes.  This is one of the funnier ones and one of the more entertaining.  Do you remember a film by Amblin that wasn't?".

What I like best about this film is that it took the hard edge off the first one and made it more of a comedy. To me this sequel was more entertaining than the first film and one I would watch a lot more times. There are so many jokes and wild scenes in here it would many viewings to catch them all. For movie buffs it's especially fun with all the references to other films in here.However it should be pointed out that there are still plenty of scenes where the gremlins are nasty and attack people so the film is still horrorlike in that respect. It may be played for comedic purposes but these creatures are anything but friendly. In other words there is still a bit of a hard edge in here for people who want that.After three viewings of this film over the years the only person who wore thin on me was John Glover's character Daniel Clamp an obvious Donald Trumpimitation but grossly overacted by Glover. He winds up just being too silly.Phoebe Cates and Zach Galligan reprise their roles as the cute smalltown wholesome despite not being married however couple who live together who of course know all about these gremlins.It was nice to see Jackie Joseph of the original Little Shop Of Horrors again as well as some other wellknown characters such as Christopher Lee Robert Prosky Dick Miller and Keye Luke. The film just flies by which tells you it's entertaining.".

	schema:reviewBody "First my little back of obligatory backstory. I was 9 years old when the original GREMLINS was released. Probably smack dab in the middle of the perfect target audience for a fun little horror film full of gleeful gore and maniacal monsters. Due to many factors a sequel to the megahit was not produced for some time afterwards. By the time this was released I was then 15 and looking for something a little more from my entertainment. The sequel was then quickly relegated to a little corner of my memory.Years have elapsed. I have submersed myself in horror films and still to this day have an undying love of the original. I can see now all of the fun little horror tidbits that Dante hid in his movie for the more adult viewers while spicing just enough family fun to keep the whole family interested.This movie though is lacking any of the charm and craft that made the original so good. What Dante and all involved seem to have forgotten is that the gremlins and mogwai became stars but what made the original so successful was good writing a good script and a good plot.This sequel seems hellbent on packing as many different gremlin creations and bad jokes as possible in its' runtime. There is almost no story developed here at all and the story that is doesn't make sense half of the time. The plot moves along just enough to propel the viewer from one gag to another most of which are not funny by child or adult standards that become a tireless repetitive bore by the end. Naturally most of these gags also serve to introduce us to a bevy of new characters with their own personalities. Yes it smells a little too much of marketing and the need to create new mogwaigremlins as if they figured they missed out on something with only having Gizmo and Stripe as recognizable creations in the original. Most of these new creations are even more annoying than the gags.Even the human characters have become cardboard cutouts this time around. Billy and his girlfriend are barely there just fodder for another gag or when the plot is needed to move along to the next step. The corporate heads are interesting ideas that become convoluted and mostly generic. Even the great Christopher Lee is wasted here in a role that anyone could have filled as a minor scientist who serves only to introduce the experiments that will in turn produce the gallery of gremlin hybrids.Many point out the fun easter eggs in this movie and how much this shows Dante's love of 50s sci fi. Yes it is fun for a drivein horror junkie like myself to find those hidden gems and appreciate all the little nods to films of past years that Dante worked in but that doesn't even come close to saving this movie from being a mess.About halfway through this my wife and I looked at each other and quickly realized exactly why we had both pushed this to the depths of our subconscious. If you removed the GREMLINS franchise name from this movie you'd have nothing but a secondrate imitation which is all this really is in the end.".

The plot moves along just enough to propel the viewer from one gag to another most of which are not funny by child or adult standards that become a tireless repetitive bore by the end. Naturally most of these gags also serve to introduce us to a bevy of new characters with their own personalities. Yes it smells a little too much of marketing and the need to create new mogwaigremlins as if they figured they missed out on something with only having Gizmo and Stripe as recognizable creations in the original. Most of these new creations are even more annoying than the gags.Even the human characters have become cardboard cutouts this time around. Billy and his girlfriend are barely there just fodder for another gag or when the plot is needed to move along to the next step. The corporate heads are interesting ideas that become convoluted and mostly generic. Even the great Christopher Lee is wasted here in a role that anyone could have filled as a minor scientist who serves only to introduce the experiments that will in turn produce the gallery of gremlin hybrids.Many point out the fun easter eggs in this movie and how much this shows Dante's love of 50s sci fi. Yes it is fun for a drivein horror junkie like myself to find those hidden gems and appreciate all the little nods to films of past years that Dante worked in but that doesn't even come close to saving this movie from being a mess.About halfway through this my wife and I looked at each other and quickly realized exactly why we had both pushed this to the depths of our subconscious. If you removed the GREMLINS franchise name from this movie you'd have nothing but a secondrate imitation which is all this really is in the end.";

	schema:reviewBody "This here is Joe Dante's best film. It's a delightful and absolutely charming dark comedy. I begged my mom to take me to see this back in 1990 and thankfully I can say I saw this on the big screen.Years later when I watch it I can catch all of the little references and nods to other great films of the past. The Warner Brothers Looney Tune cartoons have obviously made an impact on the directorial style of Joe Dante. What's great is the combination of this type of humor blended with these devious little monsters wrecking havoc in the Clamp Building. Speaking of Clamp John Glover was excellent as Daniel Clamp a parody of Donald Trump. He's absolutely hilarious!There are many terrific special effects and sequences in the film. It's hard to tell you which scene is my favorite because I adore every moment of the film. I will say one of the scenes that sticks out for me is when the Bat Gremlin flies out into New York City by day. I just love those excellent shots of him flying through the sky. Of course the Brain Gremlin and the 'New York New York' number is fantastic as well. Is eeeverybody heere? And who could forget when the Gremlins got their revenge for Leonard Maltin's lambasting of the first Gremlins movie?All this is accompanied by a fantastic Jerry Goldsmith score which happens to be one of my favorites of his as well. The collaboration between Goldsmith and Dante isn't unlike that of Hitchcock and Herrmann or Spielberg and Williams.The film abounds with dark jollity and watching it you can tell that the filmmakers had a fun time making the picture. To include the audience as part of the goings on is a real treat.Out of all the thousands of films I have seen none have been or ever will be more entertaining than Gremlins 2.I LOVE it.".

Also this one is much less serious in tone then the first one. With the comedy going way more over the top. Where they break the third wall too many times for me and it takes me out of the picture.Also the first one had such a sad but nice ending. The first one is a great 80's film. One of the most memorable from that time.If your a fan of the first film then chances are you have seen this one and if your not a fan of the first film. Then you most likely won't be bothered with this film at all.One last thing I'd like to add. This was a completely unnecessary sequel.

The sequel is not as good as the original but its not bad either. Here the filmakers did something different. They tried to make this one more of a comedy than the original. The first film was funny but also scary. Gremlins 2 plays more like a Mel Brookstype movie with some of the jokes that are in it. But its hardly scary. Plus it got a little tiresome to watch the gremlins do some of the exact same things that they did the first time around like drinking smoking etc. Nevertheless this is for the most part an entertaining movie that I'd wish had done better at the box office. I think if they had made this three years after the original instead of six years it would have done better. In between the two Gremlins flicks there were all those ripoffs Critters Ghoulies and their sequels and by 1990 moviegoers became tired of it all. But the two Gremlins movies are much better than the Critters and Ghoulies movies. A good job by director Joe Dante. out of four".

The sequel is not as good as the original but its not bad either. Here the filmakers did something different. They tried to make this one more of a comedy than the original. The first film was funny but also scary. Gremlins 2 plays more like a Mel Brookstype movie with some of the jokes that are in it. But its hardly scary. Plus it got a little tiresome to watch the gremlins do some of the exact same things that they did the first time around like drinking smoking etc. Nevertheless this is for the most part an entertaining movie that I'd wish had done better at the box office. I think if they had made this three years after the original instead of six years it would have done better. In between the two Gremlins flicks there were all those ripoffs Critters Ghoulies and their sequels and by 1990 moviegoers became tired of it all. But the two Gremlins movies are much better than the Critters and Ghoulies movies. A good job by director Joe Dante. out of four";

The plot went all over the place and wasn't kept quite together as that in the first movie and there were really no scary or jumpy moments. I wished the story showed more bewilderment and fear from the people who witnessed the gremlins' havoc but they just showed casual concern and intrigue.Overall it's not a very good sequel. It doesn't have the character development unique flavor and suspense as the original movie instead it's just a wild crazyfest of gremlins and overzealous humans trying to deal with all the chaos.

	schema:headline " Too much distance from the first film at the wrong time not enough at the right time...";
	schema:reviewBody "1989 was a terrific year for sequels as four of them made it in the boxoffice Top 10 and three of them would actually have sequels. So I guess when Joe Dante was making the second opus of his 1984 hit Gremlins the results of Ghostbusters 2 Lethal Weapon 2 Back to the Future part II and on the top of them Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade probably made him believe his Gremlins 2 The New Batch would be a sure lock for a great return of investment. It was not.Maybe 1990 wasn't such a good year for sequels after all still my jaw dropped when I read that the film only grossed 40 millions of dollars out of a slightly superior budget. I don't think it's a result even the most skeptical critics expected something happened there let's call it a disastrous and unfortunate accident nothing that really speaks bad statements about the film's quality. It wouldn't have meant much either had the film made it in the Top 10 I don't think Ghostbusters 2 was anyway superior to Gremlins 2 but it must have met with the fans' expectations they had their quartet Billy Murray's wisecracks a worthy villain and a largerthanlife lastminute savior so it was worth the ticket and the popcorn box. So what exactly lacked in Gremlins 2? What didn't lack was the leading pair Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates the cute Gizmo his evil descendants including the Mohawk and the unforgettable three rules that everyone forget. Was there a lack of originality? Not at all the film does try to play in a different field than the first starting with the setting. We're not in the Capraesque Christmas small town but in NewYork giant corporate skyscraper governed by a Donald Trumplike character named Klamp it's a terrific setting as it defiantly pretends to create a microcosm of the urban postmodern world in a rather confined environment so that it ultimately becomes the Gremlins' ecosystem.

The film mocks its own material by toning down the gruesome violence of the Gremlins and emphasizing the jokes and humorous effects.

Gremlins 2 is undeniably original and had better intentions than many more successful sequels it was also served by a nice supporting cast many prestigious cameos from the Looney Tunes to Hulk Hogan from Christopher Lee to Leonard Matlin but its selfreferential approach must have disrupted a majority of teenage fans who probably didn't get all the references to classic films like The Wizard of Oz or Marathon Man. I mentioned that the first movie also suffered from a kind of schizophrenia as it was trying to be a horrorB movie and a 'family' Christmas story but those were twists in the formats while Gremlins 2 tries to be two different things tonewise and it didn't quite succeed although it had some great potential.Three years later another movie would suffer the same fate and would be a boxoffice flop due to a similar misunderstanding Last Action Hero.

	onyx:emotionText "1989 was a terrific year for sequels as four of them made it in the boxoffice Top 10 and three of them would actually have sequels. So I guess when Joe Dante was making the second opus of his 1984 hit Gremlins the results of Ghostbusters 2 Lethal Weapon 2 Back to the Future part II and on the top of them Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade probably made him believe his Gremlins 2 The New Batch would be a sure lock for a great return of investment. It was not.Maybe 1990 wasn't such a good year for sequels after all still my jaw dropped when I read that the film only grossed 40 millions of dollars out of a slightly superior budget. I don't think it's a result even the most skeptical critics expected something happened there let's call it a disastrous and unfortunate accident nothing that really speaks bad statements about the film's quality. It wouldn't have meant much either had the film made it in the Top 10 I don't think Ghostbusters 2 was anyway superior to Gremlins 2 but it must have met with the fans' expectations they had their quartet Billy Murray's wisecracks a worthy villain and a largerthanlife lastminute savior so it was worth the ticket and the popcorn box. So what exactly lacked in Gremlins 2? What didn't lack was the leading pair Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates the cute Gizmo his evil descendants including the Mohawk and the unforgettable three rules that everyone forget. Was there a lack of originality? Not at all the film does try to play in a different field than the first starting with the setting. We're not in the Capraesque Christmas small town but in NewYork giant corporate skyscraper governed by a Donald Trumplike character named Klamp it's a terrific setting as it defiantly pretends to create a microcosm of the urban postmodern world in a rather confined environment so that it ultimately becomes the Gremlins' ecosystem. Billy and his newlywed wife work together in the building he's a shy and obedient executive and she's a competent hostess who tries to fit in New York and people's rude manners.The heroes are given more depth and character than in the first film but so are the Gremlins who're not just a generic group of monsters.

Since John Woo who is one of the kings of the action genre took over for Brian De Palma you can expect Mission Impossible II to be an intense action movie with a majorly dumbed down plot. Everything to do with the plot is laid out for us basically right away. Now all there is to do is sit back and watch those classic John Woo action sequences. In this movie Ethan Hunt is once again a secret agent and he is sent on a mission to stop a crooked agent from stealing a deadly virus for his own use.I liked the first Mission Impossible better because it had a more advanced plot. This Mission Impossible is just a bland shoot 'em up action film. Now there's nothing wrong with that. The movie was still immensely entertaining. It just didn't fit in with the first film. Even the character of Ethan Hunt though still played by Tom Cruise is different. In this movie he doesn't seem as serious about his job. He's more cocky. However I do like that the character now has absolutely amazing skills in hand to hand combat.Overall if you're looking for a smart spy thriller like the first film this ain't it. If you're looking for a fun action film with amazing action sequences this is it.6.510".

Sure the movie wants you to think that she could kick ass if she wanted to by making her a professional thief but isn't very convincing at that. In the end while Tom Cruise is engaged in a very unrealistic battle sequence on a beach she roams around aimlessly considering the possibility of throwing herself off a cliff which would have been a relief.I was going to talk about the extremely pointless car chase sequence between the hero and the chick in which they demolish their cars for no reason whatsoever but I don't really know what to say about it.The only good thing about this film is that it was so boring that I preferred doing the homework I'd been postponing for ages to watching the dumb motorcycle chases.".

'II' pretty much IS a conventional Hollywood thriller.Almost nothing from the first film has been picked up here Tom Cruise? Yes he's back but he's not a spy anymore. He's James Bond minus ANY cool gadgets or charisma. The awesome theme music? Gone replaced with a horrible rock score. The action is typical Hollywood Slowmotion gunplay and martial arts.Ugh I hate this movie! The acting and dialogue is lame the technorock score even lamer and the action scenes are mundane. Here's hoping 'MI III' won't be as cringeinducing as this disaster.".

	schema:headline " Simply the worst film ever made Contains Spoilers!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "I thoroughly enjoyed the first Mission Impossible. It was probably the only film that puts you into the mind of a secret agent as he tries to uncover a conspiracy that wiped out his cohorts. It had excellent twists who would have thought that the hero of the TV series Jim Phelps finally turns into the bad guy.The sequel however has no plot no interesting dialogue just mindless shootouts that would leave Gun and ballistic experts laughing in disbelief. John Woo is not a director he is a second unit director that got lucky. He cannot control his cast he cannot convey any plot and he cannot stage believable action sequences.Woo seems to be directing if you could call it that in his sleep. The storyline seems to slightly mirror the original film in that a member of IMF goes rogue not another one!! and tries to release a Killer Virus called Chimaera on an unsuspecting world.Apparently IMF Boss Anthony Hopkins knows the whereabouts of the Villain's hideout and orders Ethan Hunt to plant the Bad Guy's Ex girlfriend in an attempt to undermine him. Wouldn't it have been better if they just attacked the HQ with commandos etcIn the original film Ethan Hunt gets promoted to Jim Phelps rank within the organisation but in the sequel he is still a Point man jumping around in commando gear. Ving Rhames and his Australian colleague seem to do absolutely nothing in this film other than occassionally tap on a computer laptop keyboard and try to look serious. By removing the team element that made the series so great it makes the whole thing look like James Bond rather than Mission Impossible.An interesting point to note is that since we know that Jim Phelp's salary was 60K PA There is no way the Rogue IMF grunt in this film could afford a massive private army along with a beach front Condo.Some other laughable points in this film includeThe painstaking attempt by Hunt to infiltrate a building by bungee jumping down a giant ventilator shaft while the Rogue IMF villain and his private army gingerly stroll through the front door of said building.The IMF villain must be unbelievably dumb to initiate a shootout including explosions with Ethan Hunt in a deadly VirusChemical research lab.The Second Unit Director's Woo laughable obsession with White Doves that seem to have more screen time than Anthony Hopkins.The throat elastoplast that enables people to talk like other people including perfecting their accents South African Scottish AmericanAnd finally the car and motorcycle chases that seem to break the laws of physics rather than breaking the monotony of the plot.It is hard to believe that it took four years of rewrites and production shooting to create this sorry mess. Even the soundtrack by Metallica and Limp Bizkit is absolutely Tuneless and irrelevant to the film.Although it made an impressive opening weekend this film got so slated by critics and the media that it would be lucky to break even from box office takings. So do not expect an MI3 so quickly.This movie will have the distinction of earning a Golden Turkey award.".

That was here but so overly done that is was absurd and downright annoying after awhile.Tom Cruise our hero should have been shot so many times I lost count. This is director John Woo for you who always overdoes action and sometimes makes it ridiculous.The good points are slick photography interesting characters good surround sound low profanity and a very good soundtrack. Thandie Newton is attractive heroine and Dougray Scott is satisfactory as the main villain.The movie plays more like a James Bond film although it still has MI touches such as the fake rubber masks we saw in the first film. More realism in that 40 minutes would have made this a far better film than it turned out to be. Oveall a bit disappointing.".

Hunt turns to jewel thief Nyah to help him by infiltrating her exlover's Ambrose group to spy on them.John Woo must have thought of the elements he needed to follow up the solid thrills of the original movie.  Big action scenes? Yes.  Slowmotion? Yes. Plot?  Characters?  Good theme music?  Logic of any kind?  Nope  won't be needing those!  Or at least that's how it felt.  The plot of the first film was clever despite being open to holes  the plot here makes the first one look like a watertight piece of genius!  The story only really serves to set up action scenes and the like  I can barely remember the disease and can only recall rubbish action scenes!For a director like John Woo I knew to expect slowmo and OTT action but I didn't know that it would all be so very superficial and weak.  For example the car chase where Hunt and Nyah meet is just ridiculous and very annoying. The robbery of the disease is a pale shadow of the original film's robbery scene and the final motorbike chase is good but only a hint of what Woo has done before.  The plot overuses the whole face mask' thing  it must do it about 8 or 9 times  many of those time's there's no way Hunt could have made a mask of the people involved!  It's another example of how silly it is.While Cruise was cool in the first film here he is slick and tough  an image that doesn't work.  He was much better in the first film.  Scott is nonexistent as a villain and is pretty dull.  Newton is sexy but no more than that.  Rhames is good and Hopkins has an enjoyable minor role.Overall this film is an OTT mess.  The plot is a shambles and the action scenes are silly and often have no logical reason behind them!  The overuse of the face masks just points to the total lack of a good script and Woo's slow motion just feels tired and unimaginative.  Only the final action scene is enjoyable but by then you're ony interesting in turning this off and watching De Palma's much better film instead.".

However that's rarely what audiences go to see films like this for.  The performances are above average particularly Dougray Scott and Thadie Newton. A pity Newton's character is underused during the second half of the film. Besides being beautiful this woman can ACT! It is also refreshing to see a demonstrably romantic and affectionate interracial relationship portrayed on screen in such a positive manner. Newton's race never comes up in the film.  Credit producer Tom Cruise for this one. This is one of those movies I'd rent to give my home theatre system a workout.  This movie succeeds on its own level however I can understand how others could be disappointed. I gave this one a 7 on the IMDB scale.By the way it was a clever touch to have Cruise receive his mission briefing via wraparound sunglasses.  Kind of nice to be reminded of RISKY BUSINESS.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Way back in the 1960s a wonderful television series was released called Mission Impossible. With a legendary theme tune and some great stories the series was followed by an equally superb film in 1996.

It's a disastrous fact therefore that this sequel is an abomination. More like a badly shot MTV movie it is badly acted written and contains some of the worst film fight scenes of all time.After Sean Ambrose Dougray Scott steals a manufactured disease it is up to fellow secret agent Ethan Hunt Cruise to retrieve it. Adding Ambrose's former love Nyah NordoffHall Thandie Newton to the mix and the film descends into a mediocre action packed love triangle.From the opening scenes of Tom Cruise climbing up a cliff without protective ropes you can tell that this film is going to be awful. When he begins to fall in love with Thandie Newton's dire Nyah you're suspicions are confirmed.Finally let's progress to the ending and look at the absolutely diabolical final fight scene. It's never a good idea to analyse the ending of a film but on this occasion the terrible motorbike and hand to hand combat events at the end need to be talked about.The bike scene is awful. Put simply it is a pointless irrelevant battle which collapses in on itself. Following that the combat scene between Cruise and Scott is a farce. Set to your typical MTV soundtrack and with Mortal Kombat style fighting including the rudimentary slow motion death the whole scene is a joke with absolute no merit.It feels only fair to try to find a positive side to this film. In that respect the character of Hugh Stamp played by Richard Roxburgh is the rare highlight of this awful film. Funny and entertaining the character is a surprising joy. It's a small positive in an otherwise major mistake.With a feel of an MTV video Mission Impossible II is an enormous mistake. Badly written acted and shot it is one of the worst films in living memory. Even the brief joy of Richard Roxburgh's Hugh can't save the film from failing badly. A dire movie worth avoiding at all costs.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mission Impossible 2 is to Mission Impossible what Aliens is to Alien. Which is to say it's almost nothing like it.The first film was a mystery. This film's plot is mostly known before the opening credits. In the first film Ethan Hunt subverted the enemy with masks floppy disks and laptops. Here he does it with Berrettas Glocks and grenades. In the first film Ethan is an all American overachiever. Here he's a wannabe James Bond.In short the first film was directed by Brian De Palma and has his style all over it. This film is directed by John Woo master of guns and doves and it's one of his most creatively un stifled American films. How much you enjoy this movie is pretty much dependent upon whether you find Woo's signature blend of slowmotion gun play campy melodrama and unlikely bird nests enjoyable or not.It's certainly fair to say Hollywood wasn't kind to Woo and this was his second to last American release. Indeed this film seemed to make Woo a household name and it's filled with all his hallmarks which were largely ridiculed afterwards.Worthy of ridicule? Probably but hardly unenjoyable. Displaying even more debt to Alfred Hitchcock than the original film this one borrows entire scenes and dialogue bits from Hitchcock's Notorious. Ripoff doesn't do it justice. This is an unlicensed remake.Now there are worse films you could rip off than Notorious. Unfortunately both films premise of a woman going undercover at the request of her government agent lover to spy on an exboyfriend with nefarious plans isn't helped here by the ludicrous relationship between Tom Cruise's Hunt and Thandie Newton's character. James Bondish sexual innuendos and fooling around is somewhere along the line confused with romance. They exchange bad sexuallycharged puns get in a car chase get laid and five minutes later they're having lover's quarrels like an old married couple. It also doesn't help that the two have no chemistry whatsoever.The only thing holding the film's central premise together is Dougray Scott as the film's villain and Newton's exlover. While Cruise and Newton flatline Scott looks like he's having way too much fun playing his renegade IMF agent as one part Bond villain one part Hannibal Lectre and one part abusive boyfriend. He's a butthurt psycho with a snarly grin and slightly unfocused dead eyes. He sells the entire love triangle even though he's only one third of it.Whereas the first film subverted the structure and characters of the TV series this film seems to be content to just ignore it and be an adaptation in name and rubber mask only. Like the first film this is not an ensemble but a star vehicle for Cruise.Back to the story... Hunt is climbing a cliff in Utah without a rope for fun when a helicopter flies by and shoots a pair of Oakley's at him. He puts them on and receives his mission help uncover the truth behind the theft of samples of a deadly virus with the help of a professional cat burglar who looks like a supermodel. Later he learns from Anthony Hopkins the thief is in fact the exlover of a rogue IMF agent who's stolen the virus for unknown reasons. She is to seduce her still obsessed ex while uncovering why he would want this zombie apocalypse inducing virus in his possession.The first 80 minutes of this movie are dedicated to character development and plot. Perhaps not terribly faithful to the old TV series it at least switches things up from the first movie by at least attempting to develop it's characters. Sure Cruise and Newton fail but Cruise isn't any worse here than he was the first time out. And again Scott is excellent.Luther Stickell is back similarly likable as he was in the first film.It's when you hit that 80 minute mark that the film takes a turn and the rest of the movie sees John Woo cutting loose with nonstop car chases gun fights and a bizarre motorcycle jousting match which turns into a kungfu fight.Not that any of this is unenjoyable. Whether you are invested in the love story or are laughing at it whether you are thrilled by the action sequences or slapping your knees because it's all just so ridiculous the film is undoubtedly entertaining.Much as I wrote about the first film this one was under appreciated. As the 2000s would wear on MI2 is commendable for it's oldfashioned stuntwork in lieu of CGI. It's particularly noticeable when compared to the next installment which opts for the digital over the practical. This movie was in many ways representative of the end of the old way of action filmmaking. And it's a thrill to watch however ludicrous.".

This film is directed by John Woo master of guns and doves and it's one of his most creatively un stifled American films. How much you enjoy this movie is pretty much dependent upon whether you find Woo's signature blend of slowmotion gun play campy melodrama and unlikely bird nests enjoyable or not.It's certainly fair to say Hollywood wasn't kind to Woo and this was his second to last American release. Indeed this film seemed to make Woo a household name and it's filled with all his hallmarks which were largely ridiculed afterwards.Worthy of ridicule? Probably but hardly unenjoyable. Displaying even more debt to Alfred Hitchcock than the original film this one borrows entire scenes and dialogue bits from Hitchcock's Notorious. Ripoff doesn't do it justice. This is an unlicensed remake.Now there are worse films you could rip off than Notorious. Unfortunately both films premise of a woman going undercover at the request of her government agent lover to spy on an exboyfriend with nefarious plans isn't helped here by the ludicrous relationship between Tom Cruise's Hunt and Thandie Newton's character. James Bondish sexual innuendos and fooling around is somewhere along the line confused with romance. They exchange bad sexuallycharged puns get in a car chase get laid and five minutes later they're having lover's quarrels like an old married couple. It also doesn't help that the two have no chemistry whatsoever.The only thing holding the film's central premise together is Dougray Scott as the film's villain and Newton's exlover. While Cruise and Newton flatline Scott looks like he's having way too much fun playing his renegade IMF agent as one part Bond villain one part Hannibal Lectre and one part abusive boyfriend. He's a butthurt psycho with a snarly grin and slightly unfocused dead eyes. He sells the entire love triangle even though he's only one third of it.Whereas the first film subverted the structure and characters of the TV series this film seems to be content to just ignore it and be an adaptation in name and rubber mask only. Like the first film this is not an ensemble but a star vehicle for Cruise.Back to the story... Hunt is climbing a cliff in Utah without a rope for fun when a helicopter flies by and shoots a pair of Oakley's at him. He puts them on and receives his mission help uncover the truth behind the theft of samples of a deadly virus with the help of a professional cat burglar who looks like a supermodel. Later he learns from Anthony Hopkins the thief is in fact the exlover of a rogue IMF agent who's stolen the virus for unknown reasons. She is to seduce her still obsessed ex while uncovering why he would want this zombie apocalypse inducing virus in his possession.The first 80 minutes of this movie are dedicated to character development and plot. Perhaps not terribly faithful to the old TV series it at least switches things up from the first movie by at least attempting to develop it's characters. Sure Cruise and Newton fail but Cruise isn't any worse here than he was the first time out. And again Scott is excellent.Luther Stickell is back similarly likable as he was in the first film.It's when you hit that 80 minute mark that the film takes a turn and the rest of the movie sees John Woo cutting loose with nonstop car chases gun fights and a bizarre motorcycle jousting match which turns into a kungfu fight.Not that any of this is unenjoyable. Whether you are invested in the love story or are laughing at it whether you are thrilled by the action sequences or slapping your knees because it's all just so ridiculous the film is undoubtedly entertaining.Much as I wrote about the first film this one was under appreciated. As the 2000s would wear on MI2 is commendable for it's oldfashioned stuntwork in lieu of CGI. It's particularly noticeable when compared to the next installment which opts for the digital over the practical. This movie was in many ways representative of the end of the old way of action filmmaking. And it's a thrill to watch however ludicrous.";

The acting in this movie is okay as porn acting goes luckily the one with the talented throat also could manage a few acting skills. Dolly Sharp as Linda's girlfriend Helen is funny and has an unusual look for those of us used to modernday Bimbo porno queens. What ever happened to Dolly Sharp? Harry Reems is doing his best Groucho Marx imitation as the doctor who helps Linda with her problem. The young looking blonde who is Reems' nurse just seems to be allowing her body to be used as she appears to be a million miles away emotionally and mentally. Great music. Rare to find a porn movie what has lyrics along with the action. Singing a song called Bubbles and making bubbling noises during an oral sex scene comes across pretty funny  but the song that is REALLY funny is the title song Deep Throat with such memorable lyrics as Deep Throat that's all she wrote Deep Throat we have had a lot of fun making up our own lyrics to this song. Highly recommended adult movie. Funny as hell sexy and it will get you turned on. What more can one ask for in an adult film?".

	schema:reviewBody "How on earth does one go about reviewing DEEP THROAT nowadays ? Though it's clearly still the best known adult movie of all time it cannot be called a good film in any objective or traditional sense. Many have speculated over the three intervening decades as to the reasons why THROAT which even in 1972 was hardly the best of its kind became such a huge box office bonanza furthered rather than hindered by its much publicized prosecution. Absolutely everything you need to know about the movie's legal problems and its sociological significance is elaborated upon in the excellent 2005 documentary INSIDE DEEP THROAT. Rather than waste precious space on a futile attempt to put my 2 cents in regarding THROAT's apparent discrepancy between quality and longevity I'll try to give my honest opinion on the film proper unbothered by all that has been said and written about it since it was first screened. Linda Lovelace as Herself according to the credits is a happy hippie chick living of dad's allowance and sharing a house with funloving divorce Helen Dolly Sharp star of the Amero Brothers' DYNAMITE and tons of loops. Their carefree existence is marred only by Linda's inability to achieve orgasm this evidently NOT through lack of trying ! While sex makes her feel all nice 'n' tingly she wants to hear bells ringing dams bursting guns going off prompting Helen's laughing request if she wants to get off or wreck the city. Help is at hand in the shape of wacky Doctor Young the role that forever saddled Herbert Streicher with the ludicrous nom de porn of Harry Reems a psychiatrist who's way nuttier than any of his patients but actually seems to hold the cure to Linda's ills. It turns out that her clitoris isn't quite located where it should be hence her incapacity for total sexual fulfillment but is situated at the back of her throat ! The only way for Linda to climax is to perform fellatio all the way down an act that has been referred to by the film's title ever since. Linda's devouring of Harry's member crosscut with images of yep bells ringing dams bursting and guns going off to indicate the girl's pleasure really is something to see as startling a display of sexual acrobatics now as it must've been 35 years ago. With a demanding nurse  played by Carol Connors later star of Gail Palmer's CANDY movies and mother of mainstream actress Thora Birch whose dad Jack Birch aka Michael Powers also appears as 12 in the Dolly Sharp threesome with one shot John Byron  to consider the good doctor tries to set up Linda with one of his other patients by engaging her as an outcall physical therapist. Some of the sex that ensues consists of loop footage shot prior to principal filming. You can generally tell by the absence of live sound during these scenes compensated by voiceover and the use of silly sound fx. Linda finally finds happiness and gets to perform her party trick once more with feeling with dopey Wilbur Wang the aptly monikered William Love who meets the necessary requirements to hit the lady's sensitive spot.Apart from Linda's oral abilities the sex is pretty much run of the mill raunch generally well covered by utilitarian camera work and editing but not much different from loops of the period. You also never get to see Linda entirely naked due to a large scar running from her chest down to her abdomen as a result of a car crash she almost miraculously survived some years earlier. She was not that fortunate in 2002 when another traffic accident tragically ended her life. Her conflicting accounts of abuse at the hands of then husband Chuck Traynor around the time of filming are but some of the many specters that continue to haunt this movie. While bruises are apparent check out her early poolside dialog bit with Dolly Sharp she does seem to enjoy herself sexually. If she's pretending she might've been a far better actress than she was ever given credit for. Another asset is the film's endearingly awful soundtrack with a number of relentlessly hummable original tunes like its title song yes it does exist the rambunctious Bubbles track that plays over the orgy scene with Linda and Helen lining up the guys for their personal pleasure an almost feminist concept just kidding ! and the raunchy reworking of the New Seekers' I'd Like to Teach the World appropriately supporting what I'd call the Coca Cola scene involving the beverage a clear plastic tube and Linda's private parts. Those who enjoy putting the film down tend to overlook that sophisticated wit was never director Gerard Damiano's goal. This is toilet humor a dirty joke well told akin to the sauciness displayed by burlesque comedians in between strip acts. On that level it works like a charm. So while there were other adult movies at the time that had more sophisticated story lines and more erotic sex like MONA THE VIRGIN NYMPH and SCHOOL GIRL this brash in your face farce offered belly laughs along with the unfettered fornicating to anyone in need of an excuse to enjoy a pornographic film. As it was the first to hit upon that surefire recipe for success it totally deserves to be remembered and occasionally revisited as the adult film that started it all.".

	schema:reviewBody "In  1968 the Production Code was abandoned and replaced by the MPAA  classification system. Valenti gave producers the option of giving  themselves a selfimposed 'X' rather than submit the film for a rating.  X was the only one they hadn't registered a trademark. From 19691970  there was a glut of softcore X rated films in the marketplace like I  am Curious Yellow and Inga. However by 1971 XXX hardcore had  established itself in many urban areas and essentially replaced the  softcore X product. Deep Throat became a test case regarding the  level of pornography that was going to be acceptable in theaters. It  was subject to extension litigation and several were brought up on  charges including Harry Reems. For a period of time it was declared  obscene in New York. I traveled with a group of high school friends to  see it in New Jersey circa 1973 and even though we were underage we  got in. Needless to say with all the hoopla surrounding the picture I  was disappointed. It was a typical boring porn notwithstanding  Lovelace's ability to control her gag reflex. I've seen better and I've  seen worse. The trouble with most porn is that eroticism is both  psychological as well as physical. A truly sensual scene requires  performance some motion picture technical finese as well as the  mechanics of sex. Few porno actresses had any acting talent beyond  faking orgasms and the production value of most XXX features tended to  be poor. Deep Throat is no exception.    Richard W. Haines".

Finding the film to be so intentionally comical was surprising enough  snatches of dialogue and especially the song lyrics heard throughout are virtual howlers  but I certainly wasnt expecting the most infamous of theatricallyreleased adult movies to be this chaste in fact it is so heavily cropped on this disc that its hardcore content is virtually nullified entirely.

Linda Lovelace plays a woman who has been born with a misplaced clitoris and consequently doesnt enjoy the physical act of love. Her best friend doesnt seem to have any such problems and in fact arranges marathon lovin sessions for Lovelace at her home but to no practical avail. Thus she visits a nerdy sex therapist who not only manages to identify her organic oddity in no time but understandably enough comes up with the obvious solution faster than you can say Deep Throat! The cure works wonders and Lovelace is soon employed by the therapist to service his own case studies and himself personally in her own spare time Unlike common knowledge DEEP THROAT was not the first hardcore movie to be exhibited theatrically in America but it was easily the most notorious one of its era. Its unequivocal and overreaching cultural standing need only be assessed by the fact that the mysterious insider in the 1974 Watergate scandal which shook the nation chose to be identified by of all things the name of this porn flick! Besides Oscarwinning director Mike Nichols is said to have personally recommended the film to controversial novelist Norman Mailer at the time of release! While Lovelace appeared in an official sequel two years later and the film itself inspired a featurelength documentary in 2005 there are at least two more adult movies  released in 1987 and 1989  with Deep Throat in their title but these are apparently unrelated to the original.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dr. Young inspecting Linda Lovelace's vagina What do we have here? Linda Lovelace Don't tell me someone left their watch. Humor like this plagues Deep Throat which was a landmark for the pornography industry upon its release in 1972 and it a landmark for me as a film critic being my first official review of a film of the genre not counting the softcore shlock Lord of the GStrings The Femaleship of the String a film I reviewed out of sheer boredom. Am I wasting my time or simply using it wisely? Contrary to what some people may believe I'm a supporter of the porn industry and regard its works in the early seventies as a staple of lowbudget erotic filmmaking as many do. Popular pornstar Ron Jeremy stated in his documentary Porn Star The Legend of Ron Jeremy that in its inception in the seventies lowbudget porn films were equal to Hollywood's Bmovies on a production level.Just watching Deep Throat in 2013 is a pretty fun experience it isn't plagued by the soulless plastic qualities of contemporary pornography which appears as if the actors and actresses can't wait to take their clothes off during the preceding skits. Deep Throat was the first pornographic film to well take its character seriously giving them development and encasing its sex acts and fellatios into a plot regardless of how ridiculous and asinine it is.Not to mention even the sequences that aren't intently focused on the sex are enjoyable and fun to experience. The film stars Linda Lovelace in a breakout role who plays Linda a girl who feels completely unfulfilled during traditional vaginal intercourse. She can't get in the proper mood to enjoy the sex and she can never reach orgasm even after talking with her close friend Helen Dolly Sharp. She claims to only achieve excitement and sexual fulfillment when performing a fellatio. Dr. Young the iconic Harry Reems informs her that this is because her vagina lacks a clitoris and her clitoris lies in the deeper end of her throat. Shall I go further? The humor in this film is extremely tongueandcheek and I'm trying incredibly hard to avoid puns. But Deep Throat is full of them and this provides the film to be viewed as more than a piece of erotic cinema that should be used to give males and females pleasure. There is enough humor here so that a lonesome viewing isn't enhanced by the awkward thought that you're watching something like this. Too often does pornography get the reputation of being a last resort to someone's source of pleasure or just an awkward medium in general.Let me sample some lines of dialog as I did above. When a man is performing cunnilingus on Helen she goes to light up a smoke and asks the man do you mind if I smoke while you're eating? Not at all he states. When Linda is trying to explain to Dr. Young that she can't achieve orgasm she states there should be bells ringing dams busting bombs going off. The only logical thing is for Dr. Young to begin singing the similar lines of the national anthem. And finally when Dr. Young informs Linda how she doesn't have a tinkler and states it's not so bad she replies how would you like it if you had balls in your ears? I could hear myself cumming! he ecstatically replies.Finally there are the sex scenes which still bear a shocking explicitness that will make it comparable to the mainstream genres of contemporary porn. All parts of the male and female are shown and sex scenes are sometimes held for an upwards of eight minutes. The arousal level is pretty slim considering how humorous and lighthearted the entire thing is but there is a surprising level of attraction to the sex as it goes on. Vintage pornography is known to lose its effect predominately because so much more risqu material is out now with the creation of the internet and internet pornography. Deep Throat maintains the graphic and elegant standard of pornography.Deep Throat is a film you'll know if you want to see before you ever read a review or before you do further research outside of a basic plot description. All I can give is a basic analysis a cheap star rating and leave you with something to contemplate as always. A deep throat to you all.Starring Linda Lovelace Harry Reems Dolly Sharp and Carol Connors. Directed by Jerry Conrad.".

There is enough humor here so that a lonesome viewing isn't enhanced by the awkward thought that you're watching something like this. Too often does pornography get the reputation of being a last resort to someone's source of pleasure or just an awkward medium in general.Let me sample some lines of dialog as I did above. When a man is performing cunnilingus on Helen she goes to light up a smoke and asks the man do you mind if I smoke while you're eating? Not at all he states. When Linda is trying to explain to Dr. Young that she can't achieve orgasm she states there should be bells ringing dams busting bombs going off. The only logical thing is for Dr. Young to begin singing the similar lines of the national anthem. And finally when Dr. Young informs Linda how she doesn't have a tinkler and states it's not so bad she replies how would you like it if you had balls in your ears? I could hear myself cumming! he ecstatically replies.Finally there are the sex scenes which still bear a shocking explicitness that will make it comparable to the mainstream genres of contemporary porn. All parts of the male and female are shown and sex scenes are sometimes held for an upwards of eight minutes. The arousal level is pretty slim considering how humorous and lighthearted the entire thing is but there is a surprising level of attraction to the sex as it goes on. Vintage pornography is known to lose its effect predominately because so much more risqu material is out now with the creation of the internet and internet pornography. Deep Throat maintains the graphic and elegant standard of pornography.Deep Throat is a film you'll know if you want to see before you ever read a review or before you do further research outside of a basic plot description. All I can give is a basic analysis a cheap star rating and leave you with something to contemplate as always. A deep throat to you all.Starring Linda Lovelace Harry Reems Dolly Sharp and Carol Connors. Directed by Jerry Conrad.";

	schema:headline " Any good deep reasons to continue to watch the movie Deep Throat not really! It's not even that sexy. This movie hasn't aged well.";
	schema:reviewBody "Compare to modern day porn this movie is pretty much a time capsule of what 1970's thought what was sexy. For somebody who lived the 1970's this movie might serve as a nostalgia erotica but for me the movie is just outdated gross looking. How deep is Deep Throat? Not that deep. It doesn't really have much of a story arch. It's just stupid point A to point B plot of having a good reason to show people having intercourse with each other. The only reason why it has a plot is because porno filmmakers had to provide a story to frame the depiction of sexual activity so as not to run afoul against the United States Supreme Court decision on showing pornographic at theaters at the time. Having narrative elements help the movie from not getting banned nationwide. Now these days sexuality is more in the open so there isn't so many laws against it as it was during those days. Since porno flicks is a computer click away most of these modern pornos will have little to no story. This movie plot is really dumb down to the simple minded question how far does the girl have to go to untangle her tingle? Directed by Gerard Damiano AKA Jerry Gerard the movie is about a sexually frustrated woman Linda Susan Boreman AKA Lovelace credit as herself in the film whom looking for advice on how to achieve a great orgasm. After a sex party with her friend Helen Dolly Sharp provide no help Helen recommends that Linda visit a doctor Harry Reems whom discovers that Linda has a special talent for giving oral sex. The rest of the movie is her taking a job as his therapist looking for the right man for the job to service her. While the plot is pretty stupid but I give credit where credit due because Deep Throat is one of the first pornographic films to feature a plot character development and relatively high production standards that help usher the era known as 'Porno Chic'. Filmmakers were pushing the envelope of what is publicly acceptable. Porno did help the sexual revolution with its libertarian themes. This movie did push buttons on sexual fetishism arousal by having scenes of pubic hair shaving and drinking female discharges with cola coca. I didn't find those scenes attractive one bit. I was kinda turn off by Linda Lovelace. It wasn't that she wasn't attractive looking she was just alright in the looks department. I found Carol Connors the best looking from the cast. It's the fact that I know she was probably forced to do the stuff in the film against her will. She was probably raped threat and beat by her then boyfriend Chuck Traynor. It seem like it did happen and that would explain a lot of the bruising on her body in the film. Just the idea of watching forced prostitution is a turn off by me. Then there is the idea that Linda Lovelace was a mess up person who never took responsibility of her own actions blaming her problems on porn until her death in 2002. She doesn't seem trustworthy because she was such a hypocrisy person. She serve in her later years as a reform antipornographic activism but despite that. She did a number of raunchy photo shoots. Just watching it in the 21th century seem mess up. It's like watching your parents or grandparents have sex. There are better modern pornos to get your kicks off. Most of its actors performing sex in this movie are now dead. It's disturbing watching two once alive dead people having sex. It seems to be a bit taboo as necrophilia. Deep Throat was a subject of obscenity trials around the country with stars like Reems being convicted of violating federal obscenity charges dealing with transporting pornographic material across state lines. It was overturned. The movie also cause protest from Christian and feminism groups asking for a ban of the flick. Although it was banned in 23 states Deep Throat made a lot of money but most of it went to the Colombo mob that financed the production. A lot of criminal money launderings went through back then. Another reason why I hate the film. While this movie really became mainstream in the 1970s. From an artistic point of view it's one of the worst movies ever made. Acting and dialogue are silly and terrible. The story is supposed to be a comedy so it was much more tongue in cheek so to speak but the jokes were pretty unfunny. The music playing the background was as a drug trip as you can hear the bong smoking every minute. It's kinda annoying. The film opens with an instrumental track that echoes the hook of the 1968 easy listening hit Do You Know the Way to San Jose. Despite the movie settling is mostly just Miami  NYC. There is a number of sequels documentaries and remakes over the years that are pretty awful. The movie influence will forever be more famous due to the name given to the source in the Washington Post investigation of the Watergate scandal that brought down a president. In the end I think that Deep Throat should be more famous than this turd. This movie isn't good then and it isn't good now.".

	onyx:emotionText "Compare to modern day porn this movie is pretty much a time capsule of what 1970's thought what was sexy. For somebody who lived the 1970's this movie might serve as a nostalgia erotica but for me the movie is just outdated gross looking. How deep is Deep Throat? Not that deep. It doesn't really have much of a story arch. It's just stupid point A to point B plot of having a good reason to show people having intercourse with each other. The only reason why it has a plot is because porno filmmakers had to provide a story to frame the depiction of sexual activity so as not to run afoul against the United States Supreme Court decision on showing pornographic at theaters at the time. Having narrative elements help the movie from not getting banned nationwide. Now these days sexuality is more in the open so there isn't so many laws against it as it was during those days. Since porno flicks is a computer click away most of these modern pornos will have little to no story. This movie plot is really dumb down to the simple minded question how far does the girl have to go to untangle her tingle? Directed by Gerard Damiano AKA Jerry Gerard the movie is about a sexually frustrated woman Linda Susan Boreman AKA Lovelace credit as herself in the film whom looking for advice on how to achieve a great orgasm. After a sex party with her friend Helen Dolly Sharp provide no help Helen recommends that Linda visit a doctor Harry Reems whom discovers that Linda has a special talent for giving oral sex. The rest of the movie is her taking a job as his therapist looking for the right man for the job to service her. While the plot is pretty stupid but I give credit where credit due because Deep Throat is one of the first pornographic films to feature a plot character development and relatively high production standards that help usher the era known as 'Porno Chic'. Filmmakers were pushing the envelope of what is publicly acceptable. Porno did help the sexual revolution with its libertarian themes. This movie did push buttons on sexual fetishism arousal by having scenes of pubic hair shaving and drinking female discharges with cola coca. I didn't find those scenes attractive one bit. I was kinda turn off by Linda Lovelace. It wasn't that she wasn't attractive looking she was just alright in the looks department. I found Carol Connors the best looking from the cast. It's the fact that I know she was probably forced to do the stuff in the film against her will. She was probably raped threat and beat by her then boyfriend Chuck Traynor. It seem like it did happen and that would explain a lot of the bruising on her body in the film. Just the idea of watching forced prostitution is a turn off by me. Then there is the idea that Linda Lovelace was a mess up person who never took responsibility of her own actions blaming her problems on porn until her death in 2002. She doesn't seem trustworthy because she was such a hypocrisy person. She serve in her later years as a reform antipornographic activism but despite that. She did a number of raunchy photo shoots. Just watching it in the 21th century seem mess up. It's like watching your parents or grandparents have sex. There are better modern pornos to get your kicks off. Most of its actors performing sex in this movie are now dead. It's disturbing watching two once alive dead people having sex. It seems to be a bit taboo as necrophilia. Deep Throat was a subject of obscenity trials around the country with stars like Reems being convicted of violating federal obscenity charges dealing with transporting pornographic material across state lines. It was overturned. The movie also cause protest from Christian and feminism groups asking for a ban of the flick. Although it was banned in 23 states Deep Throat made a lot of money but most of it went to the Colombo mob that financed the production. A lot of criminal money launderings went through back then.

The one thing that ties them together more than the genial contempt they have for one another is the DOUBLE amount of contempt they have for everyone else. To take in extra rent money they decide to let a spare room in their place. After having a lot of fun at the expense of many 'unsuitable' candidates they decide to award the spot to a very dodgy looking character named Hugo Keith Allen who has a shady demeanor and a rather large suitcase.This situation is ripe for betrayal deceit coercion and oh let's not leave out murder shall we? It's dynamite with an unlit fuse just missing a match. And that 'match' is finally struck when the three roommates find a nude Hugo dead the next morning in his room and that in his mysterious suitcase is more cash than the three of them combined will make in a year.Anybody hear a sizzling noise in the background? That's nothing. The explosion is coming and it is a DOOZY! Director Danny Boyle and writer John Hodge certainly know their noir thrillers and they skilfully weave the strands of this twisted story together like a Hitchcock chamber piece filtered through the gimleteyed gaze of the Coen Brothers. With a Glaswegan accent of course.The acting is top notch especially Ewan in his first major movie role. The realistic outcome of each nervewracking situation ratchets up the suspense and the tension without a single false note as the 'straw' friendships of these three notsolikable characters goes up in a puff of spontaneous combustion...all for as the O'Jays put it so aptly the love of money. And speaking of classic songs a great director knows how to infuse a scene with just the right touch of irony comedy or even downright horror such as what Quentin Tarantino did with the confectionery pop standard from Stealer's Wheel Stuck In The Middle With You. I could tell from the word 'go' that Danny Boyle would be one artist to watch just through the way he took a gooey retro classic like Andy Williams' Happy Heart and infused it with chillingly fitting gallows humor for GRAVE'S jawdropping ending that will stay with you long after you've seen it...even after the second or third time! No matter how many times I watch it it still hits me like a ton of...well you know...Highly recommended with great scoring work from artists like Simon Boswell Leftfield and Tomandandy.".

They want to find one person to fill the room that is empty in their apartment and soon they find the right one. However one day something horrific happens and the friends find something very interesting in the new tenant's room. After this incident their friendship starts to change and weird murders appear. I won't tell you more about the story as this must be seen without knowing too much about it. I hope others have not spoilt you and disturbed your viewing experience.This film is about themes of friendship and greed and greed for money especially. Which one is more important huge amount of money or a true friend? Ewan McGregor's voice at the end of the film tells us everything what the main character learned about life and these things throughout the film. This is pretty mean spirited and too much for others because there are so many mean characters and some graphic and gory violence in Shallow Grave and everyone will not tolerate that. After all this is very important film and gives us some difficult questions and something to think about. A human being can easily been seduced and once it has happened everything the one has kept important may not be that anymore and the person's set of values has changed..Technically Shallow Grave is very great and effectively scary. There are great camera movements and angles and weird ways to use camera. Music is okay but nothing too special in my opinion. The atmosphere is pretty disturbing and this should have been enjoyed in the big screen. The real skills of this director are visible more completely in Trainspotting a masterful drama about the world of drugs also starring Ewan McGregor. The scenes in forest are especially spooky and as a horror thriller Shallow Grave is very noteworthy.There are unfortunately couple of scenes or characters' reactions that I couldn't tolerate and that affects to the rating a little bit. The youngsters act sometimes stupidly and are too irritating. And the other fault in this film is that the clues for the gangsters to find these youngsters are not explained and all seems to happen too easily. But these are not too dangerous considering the great horror and cinematic elements of the film. I was waiting a little too much I think because I had read many praising reviews about this film but still I'm definitely not disappointed even though the film could have been closer to perfection.710".

Almost a week goes by and he doesn't come out of his room once so they break down Hugo's door to find him dead with a suitcase full of money.  To keep the money they agree to destroy Hugo's body and draw straws to see who does the cutting.  David ends up doing the deed but it affects him badly and he becomes increasingly erratic and paranoid.  Meanwhile two criminals are dredging the underworld looking for the money.Any film that can pose a moral question that stays with the audience is off to a good start and needs to build on it.  That is the case here with the would you keep the money' question  the answer being yes' in terms of the characters here.  The plot then sees the greed do what greed do best  feed paranoia and divisions between the characters.  It's a theme that has been done before but is still well done here.  The plot has weaknesses in logic and flow  David's paranoia doesn't totally go the way that seems most likely rather the way that the film requires.  Also the film doesn't build good characters.  However what it does do well is turn up tension and drama very well  as the net closes and the characters start to turn on each other.This is where the comparatively short running time helps  it keeps the whole thing from being onscreen too long to be analysed to death while you are watching it.  I didn't question the weaknesses because I was caught up in the story.  It has a good pace on it although it can't keep up the speed it set with it's stylish opening credits which have been impersonated so often since.  The final act is a fitting denouncement and like I said even if some of it doesn't totally scan the film moves along fast enough to cover it.Despite the lack of really developed characters the cast do really good jobs on the whole.  McGregor is great  this and Trainspotting show how great it can be just makes it harder to see him looking miserable in the Star Wars films.  Fox is also very good although she is a lot subtler than McGregor.  However it is Eccleston who steals the film even if he is required to go further than he should have in his downward spiral contrast his character at the start and the end of the film he did very well to gradually go from one to the other convincingly.  The support cast is made up of familiar faces who don't really do that much  McCredie Stott Allen and Mullan.Overall this is not without it's flaws but it works as a tight little moral thriller that is really enjoyable while watching it.  And the ending will have you in the pub or on the message boards talking about it in a good way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shallow Grave the debut film from director Danny Boyle also from his fellow producer and screenwriter from other films he made in the 90s has a fatalistic edge to it but where it will really go is anyone's guess. It's practically impossible to identify with these three main characters Kerry Fox as Juliet Christopher Eccleston as David and Ewan McGregor as Alex as they're all cynical and sarcastic to the bone rarely sympathetic and friends through and through. The latter part might be a little more recognizable in such a very easy kind of story for these characters who after finding their new roommate dead in his room have to 'take care' of the situation. This becomes further complicated both practically and morally when a suitcase of money is found from the exroomer. This is at the core something of a simple dilemma kind of issue tale that could fit very easily onto a kid's show minus all the death of course as findingmoney was also used in Boyle's film Millions. But Shallow Grave also happens to have the ingredients for a horror film as well as filmnoir tragedy as much as thriller with bits of pitchblack comedy thrown in for good measure.One of the cool unnerving things about the film as well is how after a while you can't really be sure who's really sane or not. But even as it is a story of friends it is more closer to being Eccleston's movie as a character who goes through the darkest change out of the three of them. He starts out as the sanest of the uptight middle class three or at least the most reasonable when the circumstances strike up. But through grisly turns of events he becomes the most unbalanced of the bunch and Boyle is able to get with his DP Brian Tufano some really powerful moments visually up in the attic. As further complications go on it becomes not really a tale of morality but one of keeping a bond that is breaking always. But the psychological turns are made better and not too circumspect or dumb by the actors. In truth some of what the characters decide and then go through is a bit too implausible even for a thematically violent film like this. But it's a fresh showcase for all three actors for their gifts McGregor's Alex seems like a sociopath through most of the film and his change doesn't make him more likable but still very intense by the acting. Eccleston has what should be one of the performances of his career as the mildmannered and then looseedged flatmate. And Kerry Fox is good if a little typical as the lady of the house. Her own role in the film is further complicated by lustful intentions and all that she could be considered a femme fatale if it were that easy.And Shallow Grave is above all else a very good film at style trumping the substance which itself isn't that bad as being Bmovie fare to which he would put to best use with Trainspotting. Here I'm reminded of the cinematic freedom and inventiveness taken in such 'pulp' matter by first time filmmakers in the 90s and even in the story's weakest points and there are a few in due to logic and the dialog sometimes it's never boring. There's a cringefunny kind of scene with Alex and Juliet using some new merchandise for some lewd and fed up purposes and it's filmed in a perfectly amateurish way. And in dealing with the more disturbing subject matter it helps that Boyle and writer John Hodge only show what is necessary i.e. some of the 'grave' scenes so that it doesn't become stale or with that sort of kick needed for the material. By the end too as in other noir stories there is a twist that comes but it isn't even much expected as the characters have met their fates. But it has the advantage of not being a copout either. Shallow Grave is when it comes down to it that splendid of things a directorial calling card that speaks to his skills with actors more so in casting to a T mixing comedy and drama and hip use of camerawork. Nothing really 'deep' or great but it's a nifty little midnight movie from merry old England. 8.510".

This becomes further complicated both practically and morally when a suitcase of money is found from the exroomer. This is at the core something of a simple dilemma kind of issue tale that could fit very easily onto a kid's show minus all the death of course as findingmoney was also used in Boyle's film Millions. But Shallow Grave also happens to have the ingredients for a horror film as well as filmnoir tragedy as much as thriller with bits of pitchblack comedy thrown in for good measure.One of the cool unnerving things about the film as well is how after a while you can't really be sure who's really sane or not. But even as it is a story of friends it is more closer to being Eccleston's movie as a character who goes through the darkest change out of the three of them. He starts out as the sanest of the uptight middle class three or at least the most reasonable when the circumstances strike up. But through grisly turns of events he becomes the most unbalanced of the bunch and Boyle is able to get with his DP Brian Tufano some really powerful moments visually up in the attic. As further complications go on it becomes not really a tale of morality but one of keeping a bond that is breaking always. But the psychological turns are made better and not too circumspect or dumb by the actors. In truth some of what the characters decide and then go through is a bit too implausible even for a thematically violent film like this. But it's a fresh showcase for all three actors for their gifts McGregor's Alex seems like a sociopath through most of the film and his change doesn't make him more likable but still very intense by the acting. Eccleston has what should be one of the performances of his career as the mildmannered and then looseedged flatmate. And Kerry Fox is good if a little typical as the lady of the house. Her own role in the film is further complicated by lustful intentions and all that she could be considered a femme fatale if it were that easy.And Shallow Grave is above all else a very good film at style trumping the substance which itself isn't that bad as being Bmovie fare to which he would put to best use with Trainspotting. Here I'm reminded of the cinematic freedom and inventiveness taken in such 'pulp' matter by first time filmmakers in the 90s and even in the story's weakest points and there are a few in due to logic and the dialog sometimes it's never boring. There's a cringefunny kind of scene with Alex and Juliet using some new merchandise for some lewd and fed up purposes and it's filmed in a perfectly amateurish way. And in dealing with the more disturbing subject matter it helps that Boyle and writer John Hodge only show what is necessary i.e. some of the 'grave' scenes so that it doesn't become stale or with that sort of kick needed for the material. By the end too as in other noir stories there is a twist that comes but it isn't even much expected as the characters have met their fates. But it has the advantage of not being a copout either. Shallow Grave is when it comes down to it that splendid of things a directorial calling card that speaks to his skills with actors more so in casting to a T mixing comedy and drama and hip use of camerawork. Nothing really 'deep' or great but it's a nifty little midnight movie from merry old England. 8.510";

	schema:reviewBody "With all due respect to the reviewers who have commented on the humor in this film I must strongly disagree. I see absolutely no humor in 1994's Shallow Grave possibly a slight chuckle occasionally but that is all. This is a very grim and brutal story and if you are a person who is disturbed by this kind of gruesome reality I would suggest you find another film to view when you are in the mood for a relaxed evening. But for those of you made of sterner stuff Shallow Grave is brilliant. Shocking in story line and at times graphic in depiction it is nevertheless an excellent film and story. Filmed in Edinburgh and Glasgow Scotland with some nice location shots it begins with the main characters three young adults two men and a woman interviewing prospective tenants for the spare bedroom in their apartment. We see early on that these persons are fairly callow immature people as they delight in making fun of the prospective roommates who show up to be interviewed. This is interesting because all of them are presented as successful persons in their professions. Juliet played by Kerry Fox is an MD Ewan McGregor is the smart mouthed Alex the newsman and Christopher Eccleston portrays the buttoned down businessman David. It is David who is the most interesting character as we see very early that he is moody and very intense. We are not surprised as we move into the heart of the story that David is most affected by the events the three friends bring upon themselves. Unknown to the three the person they chose to let the spare room to was a professional criminal who assisted in a robbery murder. When he is found dead in his room of a drug overdose with a suitcase full of cash Shallow Grave truly begins. The three make a fateful decision to dispose of the body and keep the money. The decision is made to remove the hands feet and teeth of the dead man so as to make it difficult to identify the remains should they be discovered. At this point the human aspects of Shallow Grave become interesting and very intense as David drew the long straw thus assuming the task of mutilating the body for disposal. We see the psychological changes in him happen right before our eyes as he carries out his grim task and it is mesmerizing to watch. He goes over the edge totally when the dead crook's friends show up at the apartment to search for their friend and the money. Juliet and Alex who had berated the geeky David until now become fearful of him when he murders the two intruders. From this point on the friends become more and more separated by suspicion greed fear and lack of trust in each other. Double dealing and backstabbing change the last 13 of Shallow Grave from nightmarish to intriguing and it is indeed a film which the viewer will lose him  herself to totally. The ending? Well I won't give that away. I will just say that the dark side of human weakness and frailty make for a very interesting climax. If  films such as Shallow Grave are of interest to you then by all means do not miss it. If you have seen it before watch it again as I have noticed something I had not previously every time I view it. To sum up Shallow Grave is an underrated  masterpiece it's just not for everybody.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before getting his big break with Trainspotting Danny Boyle gained attention with a clever intriguing dark comedy. That film was Shallow Grave which can now be seen as a warmup to Boyle's drugrelated masterpiece having the same sick humor tense and paranoid mood and part of the cast and crew producer Andrew MacDonald writer John Hodge actors Ewan McGregor and Peter Mullan.The movie is set in Edimburgh where three people share an apartment or flat as they call it in the UK. For some reason David Christopher Eccleston Juliet Kerry Fox and Alex McGregor suddenly decide to find a fourth flatmate and after discarding several candidates they finally agree on giving novelist Hugo a chance on the grounds that he is interesting. Shame this guy dies mysteriously overnight leaving a suitcase full of money behind. This triggers a conflict between the protagonists as Alex and Juliet want to keep the money while David doesn't think it's a good idea. It takes quite some arguing to convince him to hide the cash somewhere in the flat and get rid of the corpse as fast as possible hence the title. Having done this David starts to develop a dangerous paranoia while in the meantime two gangsters are obsessively looking for Hugo and the money.On a thematic level the exploration of greed and its effects on people Shallow Grave is hardly original yet Boyle manages to compensate this by creating a suitably eerie atmosphere and alternating moments of shock and laughter. This is also due to the great cast the director and writer's decision to focus solely on the leading trio proving both a weakness and a stroke of genius the weakness lies in the fact that no backstory is provided thus giving no information on the exact nature of the bond these people and no explanation to their behavior in some sections of the movie in addition all the other characters who show up particularly the two gangsters are quite hollow their presence having only the purpose of moving the events forward leaving a good actor like Peter Mullan for example with no real material to work on although in retrospect that can be forgiven by Boyle's wise decision to give him a larger role in Trainspotting. On the other hand constantly keeping the eye on the three leads is a brilliant idea given how satisfying the performances are especially the contrast between Eccleston's coldness and McGregor's carefree vitality another hint of things to come while Fox remains in the middle willing to have fun but more rational and subtle than her accomplice. It is the work of these three terrific actors as well as the short running time and consistent pace that keep Shallow Grave interesting and smart throughout with little time to stop and think about minor flaws. And that goes without mentioning the superb conclusion which I cannot spoil of course. Suffice to say it deserves to be discussed in latenight conversations as much as the epilogues of Se7en and The Usual Suspects yes it is that great.8510".

The movie quickly progresses to a trio of flat mates quite involved with each other and living harmoniously. When a new flat mate is introduced I just knew the movie was about to take me on an adventure. An adventure to a shallow grave. I find movies quite predictable and therefore unsatisfying but not with this one. Under Danny Boyle's direction this movie made twists and turns that I did not foresee. Up until the end I laughed in horror as the once close knit flat mates became enemies. This was a movie wonderfully written directed and acted. Excellent.".

I was amused by the quip from the director about the film The film was heavily criticized for its seemingly cold characters. When questioned about the criticisms Danny Boyle responded saying that building plausible characters is something that pleases intellectuals but audiences in general don't invest much as much into the characters in a film. Hmmm considering that a lot of intellectuals were amused by this film and promoted it he should show some gratitude rather than the obligatory swipe at them. Supposedly the film is based on the old discredited canard excessive love of money is the root of all evil. Just naming three monsters of our age Stalin Hitler and Ted Bundy none of them did what they did for the loot and swag. Three superficial roommates go out of their way to find a suitable fourth by humiliating less than hip potential roommates until they land one who is a drug addict mobster type good taste you hipsters. When the new one dies the next day from a drug overdose and they find the bag of money the clock starts ticking Meanwhile there are two ruthless killers torturing and killing to find the loststolen suitcase of money. So all this money of course starts making them all paranoid selfish and mean or were they always that way? Eventually the killers find them and it looks like it's curtains for these callow yuppies. But the accountant one Dave is hidden up in the attic so when the thugs go to get the loot he kills them both. Now here is where the films edges into hip stupidity. The other two flatmates ALex and Juliet who were beaten and bound by the thugs prior to their demise might have done something like thank Dave for saving them from a brutal painful death. Then they might have decided how to divide the money up and all left their own little ways. But Dave retires to the attic to guard the loot and drills holes in the floor to watch his roommates. There is a police inspector on the loose looking for the killers of the people below the same thugs as well as the dead man too. He knows something is afoot but is hardly some moral counterweight to the dead inside yuppie trio. Basically the movie is a prototype for all those hip violent but smug films that the 90's spawned like good old Tarantino an exercise in hollow cleverness. Movies should have some sort of soul and uplift when dealing with such a somber theme and corniness is preferable to hipness".

In fact it seemed rather silly.  I did not really care who got the money or who outsmarted whom.  It was all arbitrary.  None of it seemed enough to make a movie  or even a short story.

The body would be legally removed and you would keep the money.Unfortunately the movie just gets worse from there. It's the most predictable movie I've ever seen. It's just Halloween type music playing while they show some awful slow scenes. Nothing good. Save your time! Don't buy into the hype of people who give it a high rating because of the director he might have other good films but this isn't one of them!";

They play roommates in a Scotland flat hunting for another roommate who will fit perfectly into their weird little friendship. Right from the start though their friendship seems casual you can tell they're strange. They find someone they think will fit but he drops dead in his sleep soon after with gobs of money hidden under his bed. The rest of the movie plays out on their dilemma of what to do with the money and how to deal with their roommates who suddenly seem very greedy...The acting in this movie is wonderful yes but the plotline seems disjointed. It's a black comedy but more of a suspense thriller really as you try to figure out what the characters will do next.It's also a very quiet film using a solemn creepy score. So little action occured in some scenes that I fastforwarded on my first viewing without losing any of the plot! I at first felt tempted to turn it off after the first couple of minutes but I stuck with it and I was happy I didthere were some very funny parts as well as some very creepy parts. I shiver at the thought of having an insane roommate living up in my attic loft? like that...and of finding out my friends aren't as much friends as I thought they were.In the end while every character has his or her unlikeable and likeable moments Alex Law is the one we wind up rooting for. In a very funny and very ironic twist which made me love the ending Alex gets his revenge...I won't reveal how but it's quite funny.".

The scenery looked like something out of a Walt Disney World attraction and the special effects were good making this a very fascinating movie.Innerspace is about a pilot Tuck Dennis Quaid who is accidentally injected in grocery store assistant manager Jack Martin Short when the needle was originally intended for a rabbit.  Jack had only 1 day to get Tuck out before his air supply ran out making for an interesting plot.Martin Short was hysterical in this strange comedy that kind of looks like All of Me.  He physically thrashes around and the comedy suits him perfectly.  Dennis Quaid is good in the role of Tuck who is arrogant and begins to appreciate things after this little incident.Of course no movie would be complete without key scenes that add to the movie.  And of course no movie review would be complete without mention of these favorite scenes.  The scene where Tuck and Jack get drunk off of Southern Comfort together was a riot because I was wondering how much JAck actually drank.  I like how he hiccupped and stumbled around while Tuck asked Jack are you drunk?  My other favorite scene was when Jack first hears voices and yells IM POSSESSED!  The fact that the first scene that introduces him in the doctor's office sets the stage so we know he's a hypocondriac.This movie was very funny and very cute at the end won't give it away. Although it plays like a Disney attractionit probably would be cool.  I highly recommend this movie to Martin Short Dennis Quaid or Meg Ryan fans. Watch out for the vaccinations and definitely don't ignore that little voice inside you it could be a space pod.  Enjoy!".

Martin Short is a real delight as a neurotic supermarket clerk who at first thinks he's possessed only to discover that the only thing in his body is a miniaturized Navy test pilot Dennis Quaid who was accidently injected into him instead of a lab rabbit. Meg Ryan is cute as ever and Robert Picardo costars in one of his best roles The Cowboy. The late screenwriter Jeffrey Boam keeps the story simple but allows for some good suspense and laughs and director Joe Dante keeps the pacing just right. The battle between Quaid and an enemy inside Short's stomach is the highlight of the film. I remember how much I wanted to be Quaid's Tuck Pendleton and have his little pod when I first saw the movie. The ending seems obvious for a sequel but due to the film's surprising box office failure it was not to be. Still this is a really fun movie for the whole family and I hope a Special Edition DVD is not far away.".

Meg Ryan is her usual cutebutoflittlesubstance self and Martin Short is just plain funny  the best guy in the movie.The film offers a good combination of humor and sciencefiction suspense.

From there hijinks ensue.Quaid is annoying as he almost always was and is. His Joker smile and constant mugging grates on the nerves in the early scenes. He's better when things settle down some. Martin Short is the best part of the cast. Very funny and likable. Always love seeing a pretty young Meg Ryan. Although it reminds me of what she's done to herself since which is tragic. Kind of the same feeling I get when watching young Melanie Griffith. This is a fun movie. Joe Dante gets to play with special effects and comedy which is right in his wheelhouse.

	schema:reviewBody "When Joe Dante wanted to do a remake of Fantastic Voyage I liked the way he decided to make his version into a comedy. I was surprised to discover that this film wasn't too successful because I believe Innerspace is good solid entertainment albeit daft.The story begins when Lt Tuck Pendleton Dennis Quaid an excellent pilot but an irresponsible hard drinker volunteers for a highly unusual experiment. He will be placed inside a submersible pod and with the use of two microchips be miniaturised and injected into a laboratory rabbit called Bugs what is it about Joe Dante and Looney Tunes characters anyway?.But just after Tuck has been shrunk a group of Silicon Valley industrial spies break into the lab and steal one of the microchips necessary to reverse the miniaturisation process. In desperation one of the scientists Ozzie runs with the syringe Tuck is in and injects him into the body of Jack Putter Martin Short.Jack is a stressed out hypochondriac who is terrified of life and learning that a shrunken human being is inside his body doesn't make him any less neurotic. With Tuck and Jack now having to depend on each other for survival they team up with Tuck's ex girlfriend Lydia Maxwell Meg Ryan to recover the stolen chip before Tuck's air supply runs out.I must confess to being a sucker for these loser comes out on top stories and this film is no exception. Jack is a man who has nothing going for him in life but with Tuck urging him on Jack manages to find inner confidence he never knew he had and takes control of his life.Both Tuck and Jack's characters go through changes in this film. Seeing the world through Jack's eyes Tuck begins to reflect upon the mistakes he has made in his life. His irresponsible behaviour and heavy drinking was responsible for Lydia breaking up with him and he wouldn't be in the situation he's in now if he hadn't recklessly gone through with this hare brained experiment.Dennis Quaid makes a likable character as Tuck because although he is a wise guy his pep talks to Jack are quite inspiring and how you can learn to take control of your own destiny.Martin Short is also a likable hero as Jack although he does have a tendency to go over the top. Although he is supposed to be neurotic his antics can grate on you a little on occasion. Some of his antics can be funny too such as the crazy dance he does in Tuck's apartment and yelling I'm possessed when he first hears Tuck's voice inside his head.The different scrapes they get into are quite exciting such as Jack's hanging on for dear life at the back of a refrigerated truck although it is a little overlong. Tuck's battle with one of the spies inside Jack's body is very well done and the method of killing him is quite innovative too.One of the funniest scenes is when Tuck alters Jack's face to look like The Cowboy Robert Picardo someone who has come to buy the microchip off Scrimshaw Kevin McCarthy the man responsible for stealing the chip in the first place. The special FX for these scenes are pretty amazing and the look on everyone's faces during these transformations are priceless.The FX used for inside Jack's body are incredible and are totally realistic. One of the best scenes is when Tuck is nearly pulled into Jack's heart and is very nail biting. Another good scene is when Tuck ends up in Lydia's body through a kiss with Jack and sees his unborn child in her womb. That is a very awe inspiring scene and is worthy of the same fascination that made Fantastic Voyage great.I believe this is a criminally underrated film. Admittedly its a hard film to swallow with things like altering Jack's face to look like someone else. How exactly could you do that? But this is a Joe Dante film so you have to suspend disbelief a little. Meg Ryan isn't given enough to do and its a pity her character couldn't have been given enough development.There are also a lot of things happening in this film and not everything is tied up like it should have been. The way Innerspace ends there could have been a sequel but so far it hasn't been followed up. With Dennis Quaid's and Meg Ryan's divorce that doesn't seem very likely now.Still Quaid has got a brilliant rapport with Short and some if not all of the important matters are resolved. Its an entertaining film and you find yourself being pulled along for the ride whether you like it or not. After Gremlins Innerspace is my favourite Joe Dante film.".

Alas the movie having established the tenets of the comic adventure runs out of steam almost at once and becomes a frenzied succession of shouts gun shots car chases delirious antics and ridiculous fights. At least it can be said that it spare us much sentiment. I only winced once when Quaid accidentally is transferred to the inside of his girl friend and discovers she's pregnant and there is romantic music as Quaid's eyes light up and he mutters to himself I'm a Dad and the viewer pendiculates.There are some fine comedies that came out around the same time  The Witches of Eastwick The Freshman Analyze This  but this doesn't belong in the same category.

This miniaturization device is highly sought after by other evil forces and during an attempt at stealing the device Quaid's character is injected into a troubled man played by Martin Short. There are definitely some funny bits involved with the Quaid's character trying to communicate with his new host and Martin Short is perfect for the style of humor that they deploy in this scenario. At this point in the movie I felt promise for it but about halfway through the plot becomes rather convoluted after some other characters are introduced that are trying to gain access to this soughtafter device. One character named Cowboy is not funny at all and his influence on the movie literally tears it apart to the point where the viewer stops caring and the movie becomes a typical chasescene filled mess. The initial humor which should have been built upon is totally flushed out of the movie and it never returns from this point. What could have been a funny movie because of the talent of the actors instead becomes a pretty unnecessary waste of about 1 hour and a half. So watch the first half hour then turn it off because the rest if not worth your time.".

Ryan is cute but in all honesty is not given that much to work with.  It's credit to her talent that she manages to stand out at all.  Mr Igo is a cool villain but one of many elements in the plot that aren't exploited to their full potential.  The film is so bursting with invention that often things are touched upon and then dropped before they've really been explored.  This all goes to show however that the film doesn't stand still for a minute which can only be a good thing especially when you have Quaid firing off the wisecracks.   It's fair to say that amidst all the general good fun the special effects aren't always something you notice but they are superb especially for '87. Never once do they undermine the story.  It really is Quaid's film though personal favourite lines including Dip Dip Dip all you like.  Nothin's gonna fit ya and You better you twofaced sonofabch  An absolute blast from start to finish this really is unfairly overlooked as being 'just another remake of 'Fantastic Voyage' when in reality it compares well with acknowledged classics of the comedy adventure genre such as Back to the Future.".

One scientist is able to escape with the syringe containing Tuck. When he is close to being caught he injects Tuck into Jack Putter Martin Short a neurotic unhappy grocery store employee.Putter is able to hear Tuck and together they work towards getting Tuck back to his normal self and foiling Dr. Scrimshaw and his lackeys. Tuck also tries to help repair Putter's mental state instilling some confidence from the inside.The star of the film are the tremendous Oscarwinning Special Effects which pack a punch even today. My favorite is how Tuck changes Putter's face so he resembles The Cowboy Robert Picardo an ally of Scrimshaw's. It's very funny to watch.The acting is also excellent. Quaid shows the charisma and cockiness that made him a boxoffice star from 19871994 and while he plays an irresponsible lout you can't help but like him. Future wife Ryan sparkles with her bright and cherry screen presence and Short the gifted physical comedian offers surprising chemistry with both actors. A great supporting cast and lots of cameos abound as well.25 years later the film is still an impressive piece of work. Certainly worth a viewing today.".

And that's a shame... in my humble opinion because it really is quite good fun.In these days of 'shared universes' thanks Marvel! I find myself seeing films that look like they could belong in the same 'universe' as others like 'Universal Soldier' and 'Terminator 2'  again just my opinion. And after my most recent rewatch of 'Innerspace' I couldn't help but thinking how much it would fit alongside that timetravelling DeLorean and ubercool hoverboard. It's about a test piolt Dennis Quaid who gets miniaturised inside a pod during a lab experiment and then inadvertantly injected into some random guy's backside Martin Short. The two of them form an unlikely bond as they try to reverse the effects before Quaid runs out of oxygen or the baddies get hold of them!.Now it's fair to say that 'Innerspace' didn't set the Box Office as on fire as its producers would have liked. I don't think it bombed but the filmmakers were hoping for something akin to 'Back to the Future' in terms of successlevels. However there's just something so fun about it that it deserves to be remembered especially during this period of eighties nostalgia.It's first strength is that it never slows down. It's perfectly edited so that you get almost straight into the action and learn to love the characters without any need for lengthy exposition or backstory. And the action flows thick and fast. There's one chase scene that reminded me of 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.' In 'Indy 4' they had to rely on awful computer graphics whereas 'Innerspace' managed it with stunts.Another thing that's worth mentioning is how when there's no action there's humour. And this is down to the rapport between the actors. Everyone plays their part well. And possibly the most important thing about 'Innerspace' is that it's a film that the whole family can enjoy. There's no need for violence or bad language. It acomplishes everything it needs to without any overthetopness.If you saw this back in the day give it another go. Or if you're just looking for something to entertain the kids on a wet weekend this should be enjoyed by all even if you're not part of this current eighties revival!.".

The concept is fairly silly but that doesn't matter because it never takes itself too seriously. There are plenty of laughs from start to finish and a decent amount of family friendly action. Dennis Quaid does a fine job as Lt Pendleton even though he spends most of the time just sat in his pod talking to Jack. Martin Short is a lot of fun as Jack a character that develops nicely through the film from a rather wimpy hypochondriac to a far more selfassured man. Meg Ryan is likable as Tuck's girlfriend who gets drawn into the adventure the rest of the cast are pretty good too. The special effects for Tuck's journey through Jack's body are impressive and there are also some good stunts. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting so good family friendly action there are one or two mildly crude jokes but I suspect they would go over the heads of younger viewers.".

	schema:reviewBody "I like 80s movies like this that take me back to my youth growing up in the 80s. Martin Short as the clumsy hypochondriac who sees his doctor in a nervous wreck and is told he has to learn to relax. His over the top nervousness reminded me of Mel Brook's 70s film High anxiety where Mel acts in a similar way like someone who just had 10 caffeinated cans of soda. Short after telling his doctor about a freaky dream of him helping an arragant woman customer at the grocery store he works at and him first somehow ringing up extreme prices for her items I like how she says that's a little pricey for shampoo don't ya think? and then the lady pulling a small gun on him with him then waking up in a panic. Only a short time later it happens for real at the store exactly like in his dream and then the gun part turns out to be a lighter. It doesn't matter Short who was already a jangled mess completely snaps at the store in front of everyone. At a lab nearby scientists are setting up an experiment for Dennis Quaid to be miniaturized in a submarine and be injected into a rabbit. Quiad gets into a sub the sub starts spinning incredibly fast then shrinks to microscopic size and then pushes off into a syringe. High tech criminals bust into the lab to try to take over a scientist with the syringe with Quaid inside it flees to a mall and accidentally injects the syringe with Quaid into Short who was at the mall to book a relaxation vacation sorry Short change of plans. The scientist gets shot with his last experience being a bunch of people in animal costumes standing over him and funny animal noises forming into his last conscious few seconds while looking at the people in the animal costumes. That bizarre moment was something particularly of the 80s where other bizarre style 80s films like Killer Klowns from outer space provided similar moments. We then get our story of Quaid traveling through the inside of Short's body with fairly convincing special effects to hook gadgets from his craft up to the insides of his eyes and ears to be able to talk to short and to be able to see whatever Short sees. The next hour of the film revolves around Quaid's and Short's experience of the two of them talking to each other Short meeting Quaids girlfriend Meg Ryan she was so young and beautiful hereShort to Meg Lydia shut up and listen!  Quaid from inside  wow you said it good Short explaining to Quaid's lab partners what's happened I like how Quaid on the inside says you better help out you two faced sonofabitch! and Short tells them he says 'thank you' and then Quaid and Short going after the bad guys. I always liked the bad guy who looks all serious and intimidating in his suit and shades with the machanical hand who can shoot from his finger like a gun totally freaking out a kid in the mall while doing it. I also like the scene where Short drinks some whiskey Quaid catches it with a vile while sitting in Shorts throat and drinks some himself and the two of them live it up for a few minutes dancing around intoxicated Quaid let the good times roll. I found quite funny the scene where Short turns on the TV and Quaid says oh great I'm inside a guy who likes game shows. And also funny when Shorts TV and the monitor inside Quads ship catches fire at the same time and then hilarious the way Short jumps while holding the fire extinguisher when Quaid calls his name. I also liked the scene in the doctors waiting room with Quaid on the inside of Short talking to him and the other people in the waiting room thinking he's talking to them one of them asking if he was all right and Short yelling would I be in a doctors office if I was feeling all right!? I also liked Short and Meg's kissing scene with Quaid temporarily transferring over to inside Meg's body and finding a certain surprise. They could've done with out the unessessary add on of the cowboy. It crossed the time limit of the movie over into slightly too long.".

Ridiculously people began to ignore him because of that  either that or they simply thought his cuteness was disappearing and gave him little value for that. But he always proved to be a terrific actor. True there were many many great child actors but he was one of them for sure. Sure his cuteness took him far but it was his talent that made him a legend.After playing a completely different role in the 1993 film 'The Good Son' where he played a psychopath that could very well disguise that nature thanks to his angelical looks a wolf in sheep's clothe he returned to the roles of 'good guys' in all of his 1994 films.'Richie Rich' is not much of a film but perhaps it's a little more interesting than 'The Pagemaster'. It's not a bad movie but it's a somewhat complex film for me to give a fair rating. It has good moments but also very stupid moments particularly from the 2nd half on in my opinion where the movie is at its weakest.Macaulay Culkin plays the title character. Richie Rich is rich like his name suggests lives in a fancy mansion surrounded by comfort and luxury and can even count with a chauffeur that takes him in his majestic and elegant RollsRoyce Silver Cloud whenever it's necessary. But Richie realizes that there is one thing that money can't buy happiness. He feels the lack of friends and possibly bored with his tedious life. He just wants to be like the other kids.About the things I found funny in this film a good example of that is the line Oh my God I look like Michael Jackson! by Richie's mother. Come to think of it... that's not untrue  lol. I'm surprised they put this line in the film because Macaulay Culkin stars in it and considering the friendship he had with the eccentric singer... Other funny details are for example the cute dog that has dollar signs instead of spots and appropriately named Dollar and the scene when Richie doesn't wanna wake up but stares at his personal trainer when he realizes what a beauty she is she is portrayed by the supermodel Claudia Schiffer.Macaulay Culkin had everything to be a great name of the cinema. And he was for a few years mostly thanks to the success of the first two 'Home Alone' films. He was talented charismatic and goodlooking. Too bad he trashed his life later but I believe he turned out to be like this because of his personal problems.".

He is one of the main reasons why I love the first two Home Alone movies so much. Here he gives a very spirited lead performance admittedly not as cute as he was when he was starring in underrated gems like Uncle Buck but he shows once again what a talented actor he was.2 Jonathan Hyde as the butler comes very close to stealing the show a very funny and sly performance. Also Edward Hermann and Christine Ebersole give humorous performances while John Larroquette plays the villain of the piece more than adequately.3 The scenery is quite impressive captured well by the breezy cinematography. The Biltmore estate was gorgeous.4 The soundtrack was decent nice background music especially.5 I liked the moral the film taught All the money in the world can't make you happy thinking about it that is true.THE NOT SO GOOD THINGS 1 While I liked the moral of the film the story itself is predictable and somewhat contrived. it probably doesn't help you have seen it all before.2 The script is quite weak in general. Don't get me wrong there were some good spots like Oh my god I look like Michael Jackson! but the jokes are admittedly very silly and juvenile and the scripting does fall in the danger of becoming clichd.3 The pacing. Now I don't mind films that move fast. I do have more of a problem if the pacing is TOO fast despite the feel good nature of the film and its valiant attempt to rise above superficial material the film feels a little too rushed the ending particularly felt skimmed over.4 The characters feel rather stereotypical. Maybe that is an unfair complaint as it probably couldn't be avoided but I couldn't help thinking yeah I recognise that type of character.Overall definitely not a bad film worth watching at least once but I personally didn't find it that great. 510 Bethany Cox".

Two Dollar is a rare species of dog one of a kind as far as I know the Dollarmation. As in Dalmatian with dollar shaped spots. The dog they got was too small and didn't do all those crazy things to become a hero like in the cartoon. Lastly no Irona the robot maid. She may be just a robot maid but she is just as important to the cast as Richie and Keenbean. Macaulay Culkin does a great job as Richie even though I would have liked to seen his famous sweater with the R on it. But that's minor I give it 8 STARS.".

He seemed about as close to growing from boy to man as you can get while still being a boy. His voice was deeper than in any of his movies back then and on the verge of growing. The Rich's own 70000000000 and Richie has his own Mcdonald's extreme roller coaster a diversion I forget what you call that launches you up in the air and lands you on a mattress and four wheelers to name a few! Reggie Jackson is his baseball coach and Arnold is his fitness trainer! he has Herbert Cadberry as his very likable and proper butler. Richie Miraculously possesses all this while still being likable and not a brat. Mac may seem like a spoiled brat in real life but I know he's a likable person his parents just gave him it. he's not like Brad Renfro. Richie has class with a hilarious teacher played once again by Ben Stein in the same way he plays the economics teacher that gave him his name only funnier here. The only thing he doesn't have is friends. He meets some sandlot kids which makes him yearn deeply for friends so he becomes aqquainted with them. The kids include the Mr. COOL kid the overweight kid that eats a lot the jock and one that seems stuckup and bossy until a little later. the villain is the industries top executive Laurence Van Dough John Larroquette who arranges for Richie and his parents to be killed in a plane by a bomb but Richie wasn't even in it and his parents survive by floating on the inflatable boat. The action is great and goes on for a long time with violence and weapons and Cadberry dresses up like a gangster high tech spying fatal suspense in the science lab and a great climax on Mt. Richmore. Profanity one damn and one s word.".

If you ask me his performance as the devious nefarious adviser Lawrence Van Dough was delightfully entertaining. In my opinion that was what made this film a fun little romp worth seeing. Also I really liked the inventions of the zany Professor Keenbean Michael McShane. Even though I thought that everyone gave a good performance and Van Dough John Larroquette was a bad guy I enjoyed this film very much. Despite the fact that I liked everyone I hate to admit it but he was my favorite character. Anyway I wish everyone lots of luck in the future and look forward to their upcoming projects.".

I had a nice laugh with that one. Here there is no such scene and the film might as well be called Home Alone 3 this time the kids rich! as it has almost the same premise. Granted the parents did not really leave him but rather got into an airplane crash but it is essentially the same as that brat is in this one too. So the story is the kid is lonely and tries to make friends parents disappear after a plane crash some dude is trying to get all the money for himself and there is no robot like there was in the original cartoon still trying to debate if that is a bad or good thing. All I know is that the film for the most part is cringe worthy but as I have said I can not stand Macualay at all so I am going to tend to be against anything he is in. I did not like Uncle Buck Home Alone or any of the movies he has been in. Except for said scene ah yes plunge to your death you spoiled sack of...ahem the only reason I give this movie a two is that there was a joke in it that actually got me to laughing involving this laser or something blowing a chunk out of a stone statue.

	schema:headline " While Richie Rich didn't struck it rich at the box office. It was still somewhat entertaining even if some parts were indeed poorly made.";
	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Donald Petrie 1994's 'Richie Rich' tells the story of a very rich young boy named Richie Rich Macaulay Culkin whom finds out that his family is being targeted by a very extreme corporate takeover by Richie's father's business partner greedy Laurence Van Dough John Larroquette who seeks to gain control of their empire plunder their famed family vault and inherit their vast treasures. Left only with his cunning and youth and some help from his loyal butlercompanion Herbert Cadbury Jonathan Hyde Richie must try to find a way to stop Van Dough in order to save his parents Richard Edward Herrmann  Regina Christine Ebersole's fortune. Without spoiling the movie too much this film is probably best known today as Culkin's final film as a child actor. It's sad to see Culkin immediately withdrawn himself from the big screen after this movie but I can understand why. First off the movie bombed at the box office. Somewhat killing what was left of source material of the same name by 1994 Harvey Comics was no more. Because of that no studio wanted Culkin as the main lead anymore. Another was puberty hitting Culkin really hard. The cracking of his voice throughout this film really shows that. Another problem was the backstage conflict with his personal's family life. He just started to sue his parents to remove them as legal guardians in control of his 17 million fortune. So it really did strain the actor during production. It really shows in his performance as he somehow made the charismatic cocky yet eccentric Richie Rich from the comic book into a dull lonely depressing and gloomy person. I get that half of that problem was due to the awful writing but it seem like he was phoning it in at times. I would rather have the charming over the top billionaire of the comics over this watered down version any day. At least that version he has friends. It's just so weird to see Richie Rich without friends here. It's not like he's overprotective too greedy fearful or condescending to others. So what the hell!? It seems so out of place that he would be that lonely. I get the fact that some rich people might get really get lonely at the top but you would think he would had some friends on his own or at least some people that would act like they were his friends. After all some people always love to surround themselves with people with money. So it doesn't make much sense. It's also funny that the film has this Money can't buy friendship subplot message with Richie. However that subplot quickly backfires as one of the adults bribed some local kids to become friends with Richie. I guess money can indeed buy you happiness. Anyways most of Richie's socall friends were kinda boring. They were so generic and onedimensional stereotypes. First off you got the girllove interest Gloria Pazinski Stephi Lineburg who is somewhat based off Gloria Glad from the comics. Then there is the token black guy Omar Joel Robinson who does nothing but speak in slang and talk about the projects. Then you got the wiseguy Italian kid Tony Michael Maccarone and the fat Hawaiian kid Pee Wee Jonathan Hilario. None of them really seem like they would honestly hang out together in any sort. Honestly if you think deep about it most of these kids doesn't seem to like Richie besides his riches. It never really stated out what makes them want to continue to help Richie besides that. The only character that I found to honestly care about Richie besides his parents was Cadbury. Cadbury's appearance here was so different from the comics and the 1980's HannaBarbera's cartoon version. In that version a character of Irona the Robot Maid was given more of a parentlike role while Cadbury serve more like a background character. While her presence in this film would had help the story greatly due to the fact it shows how lonely Richie is when he has robot butlers to take care of him than people. I get why she was replaced by Hyde's character story wise. Cadbury is the one that drives the story forward following the 'socalled' deaths of Richie's parents. Plus Hyde does a wonderful job. Who knew he has a comedy side? It's so cool to see him here not being typecast as the evil posh British guy like he normally plays. Another factor is the fact that the film is already unrealistic enough with a kid being able to run a company and a Bond's Q like inventor Professor Keenbean Mike McShane. Adding a walking talking robot to that mix would be already too distracting. I'm already having trouble playing attention to the story with all the celebrity cameos and produce placement this movie has. Adding one more badly done 1990's CGI robot would be too much. The CGI in this film is already badly dated. Despite that the movie still has good action. The 1959's North by Northwest style climatic ending mixed with the 1990's 'Home Alone' antics was fun to watch. Also the movie does have some funny moments. Mostly with Richie's parents. Even John Larroquette was somewhat fun to watch as the villain. I just wish the movie stay true to the comics and allow Van Dough to be Richie's uncle. It would had more stakes to the story. Also the music by composter Alan Silvestri was pretty awesome! I also like the fact most of the film was filmed entirely on location at the Biltmore Estate in Asheville North Carolina. In the end overall I kinda enjoyed this film despite the over glamorous lifestyle of the 1ers. It's not the best Richie Rich adaptation out there however its beats the Christmas themed direct to video sequel 1998's 'Richie Rich's Christmas Wish' and the 2015's TV Series of the same name any day. So check it out if you want to.".

	schema:reviewBody "Richie Rich stars the charismatic easilylovable Macaulay Culkin in a role that basically begged for him from the first day of preproduction. Unfortunately nothing else begged much attention in terms of how Richie Rich conducts itself as a piece of family entertainment. Is it serviceable? Absolutely. Just prepare for a rather long and tedious ninetyfour minutes. Kids will appreciate it seeing their favorite hero from Home Alone getting into more hairy little circumstances but the true victims the parents will likely be contemplating better things they could be doing with their time.Make no mistake I was enjoying Richie Rich for about fortyfive minutes on a simply passable level. Then at the hour mark I grew restless and by the finale I was shaking my head at the missed opportunity the film could've capitalized on. I'll come back to this later. The story is inspired from the comicbook character who made quite the name for himself in books and strips that I never found myself reading. He is played by Macaulay Culkin who was born to Richard and Regina Rich Edward Herrmann and Christine Ebersole a couple worth a dollar over 70 billion thanks to their immensely successful Rich Industries. The three live in a house that appears to be sitting two fullsize golf courses and embrace their wealthy status in the way of philanthropy and not personal narcissism.While Richie enjoys living a lavish life traveling in helicopters playing basketball in doors and carrying thousanddollar bills in his wallet he greatly envies the lives of regular middleclass children who have very little priorities and can spend their days playing baseball in an open sandlot.With this kind of setup you'd think the film would be on the track of setting up a lonely rich boy sort of moral emphasizing that all the money in the world can't buy true wholesome companionship right? Well just as we're about to further dive into that a pesky plot point involving corruption attemptedmurder and industry takeover begins to plague the Rich family and with rumor that his parents are dead after a nice pack of TNT was on their private plane Richie assumes the role as the CEO of the company. But just as we're about to go further into that detail we focus on one of Richard Rich's employees who tried to murder the couple and their kid to take over Rich Industries for himself. Not if Richie and his loyal butler Herbert Cadbury Jonathan Hyde can help it though.Right off the bat we just passed up two solid directions this film could've taken instead of the contrived foreseeable one it settled on. Yet if there's one thing that can't be overlooked about this film it's the abundance of characteractors who all do a capable job of doing what they can with what they have  especially Macaulay Culkin. Culkin's gifted easygoing performance makes one sad that this was his last big film as a child actor before landing roles in several underperforming independent films before fading into tabloid obscurity.Cowriter of Richie Rich Neil Tolkin worked on License to Drive a potent lively comedy about a teen and his two friends going out after hours in his grandfather's Cadillac even after failing his driver's test. After that he settled for very little doing both Richie Rich and the atrocious Pauly Shore comedy Jury Duty a year later. When glancing through director Donald Petrie's filmography it appears that he has made a career out of making spurofthemoment comedies that usually do fairly well at the box office before becoming safebets on cable. He has a formula and he should stick to it. It's just sort of upsetting that Richie Rich aspires to be functional rather than successful.Starring Macaulay Culkin Edward Herrmann Christine Ebersole Jonathan Hyde and John Larroquette. Directed by Donald Petrie.".

Richie Rich therefore became Culkin's last major project until his return to film as a 23yearold young adult in 2003's Party Monster.In Rich no actor is in top form. The laughs were too few and too far between especially for a family comedy. The postJurassic Park CGI robot bee may have even been a hindrance rather than a creative flourish. None of the characters were developed beyond the simple caricatures we'd expect and further stripped of comedic potential. By the time the antagonist breaks into the vault anyone over the age of 17 probably knew what was inside that is if they hadn't already stopped paying attention and fallen asleep.Had the film starred another adolescent lead we may have been forgiving but the overall quality of this venture paled in comparison with the Culkin we knew from Uncle Buck the Home Alone pictures My Girl and even his brief appearance in Michael Jackson's 9 minute Black or White rampage. Being that it was filmed in and around the Chicagoland area and that this reviewer is a sucker for anything local this reviewer feels generous giving Richie Rich 4 out of 10 IMDb stars.".

There is one thing thing he doesn't have that he longs for a normal life with some friends but one day he sees some kids playing baseball and wants to join them but they don't want him around. Richie manages to get them to like him however when he invites them to enjoy themselves to his mansion and all its luxuries including a rollercoaster and a McDonald's restaurant. Meanwhile Lawrence Van Dough John Larroquette the Rich family's executive is planning to kill the family and steal their fortune so when Richie realises he with his new friends and trusted English butler Herbert Arthur Runcible Cadbury Jonathan Hyde plan to stop him. Also starring Edward Herrmann as Richard Rich Christine Ebersole as Regina Rich Michael McShane as Professor Keenbean Chelcie Ross as Ferguson Mariangela Pino as Diane Pazinski Stephi Lineburg as Gloria Pazinski Michael Maccarone as Tony and Claudia Schiffer as Aerobics Instructor. It has its moments of slapstick for the kids but it is nowhere as entertaining as Home Alone especially with Culkin reaching the age of 14 and nearly an adolescent. Okay!".

The final cut of the movie isn't nearly what director Donald Petrie wanted this to be. In the director's cut Richie goes all the way in the make out session scene with the old fat woman but in the final he just HUGS HER!?! It destroys the whole meaning of the scene. When Richie makes out with the old lady and puts his tongue all the way up her nostril and she screams your touching my brain it brings realism to the scene. When in the final theatrical cut he just hugs and then she kicks him in the shin. If this movie had been left the way Donald Petrie wanted it to be it would've been a ten out of ten masterpiece. Yet I find it sort of insulting. Yes director John Murlowski would go on to make a more interesting and exciting Richie Rich movies but this is not a good opener. That's not to say that the film is bad. There are many good qualities of the film. The scene where the mom and the dad lick the family dog on Richie's back was left untouched and was excellent but right after that scene they cut to Richie beating his butler with a baseball bat when in the director's cut he is beating the butler with a stick covered in maggots and all of the maggots crawl in his mouth and eat his insides. I had to search through about a billion websites before I could find the director's cut and that makes me mad. 710".

Far from it... the movie tries to show just how gruesome and dehumanizing an extended conflict like this can be. The occupying Soviet and CubanNicaraguan soldiers are not portrayed as monsters. In fact there are many moments when they are shown for exactly what they are... often young and frequently scared soldiers doing the job they have been told to do. There are certain individual characters that are shown as ruthless killers but they are generally the exception. The movie is less an action film and more a cautionary tale of taking things too far and going over a precipice from which it is not easy to return. Neitzsche said Those that do battle with monsters should take care lest monsters they become. The Wolverines start out as a band of scared kids running for their lives and grow into guerilla fighters forced to fight for their freedom. Eventually they take it too far and start to lose their emotional connection to what they are doing. It's hard to say more without giving away some key points of the ending sequences but suffice to say that the kids come perilously close to fulfilling Neitzsche's warning. Those that take this movie simply at face value will lose a lot of the potential impact and will likely miss the messages contained therein.".

	schema:headline " It obviously touched a nerve";
	schema:reviewBody "Reading previous commentary I'm amused by the violent reaction this movie still elicits. The ranting of previous reviewers indicates the movie touched a nerve. I have seen really really bad movies and Red Dawn is certainly not as bad as the ratings it has received here.As is so often the case many previous reviewers are criticizing the film because its premise conflicts with their political philosophy. I wonder how they would have rated this film had the characters been teenaged members of an allblack football team who become partisans fighting bigoted southern whites in a 1960s civil war that never occurred. Would they be so harsh if the movie were about a group of teenage Jewish soccer team members fighting the Nazis in World War II? they might not have rated it nine or 10 stars but I'd bet they would have given it more than one star. Given the current political climate they might even receive it more warmly if the characters were Iraqi teenagers fighting Americans.I understand the temptation to judge movies based on your own preferences rather than the movie's own merits. I recently watched Easy Rider for the first time and absolutely could have kicked myself for wasting the two hours or so it took the silly drivel to play out. Were I to rate it strictly on the way I felt about the movie  the silly situations at the commune where 50 hippies are supposed to live all winter on about a half acre of wheat about enough to produce a loaf of bread the laborious acid dropping scene the cartoonishly villainous red necks the lame acting other than Nicholson  I guess I'd have to give it about a onestar rating. But it was a beautifully filmed movie and it obviously spoke to people at that time. So a more valid assessment from my perspective would be that it's an anachronism that seems a bit silly today but obviously had merit in context.I believe Red Dawn touched something in young people of the mid80s in the same way Easy Rider touched young people in the late 60s. Sift through the silliness of both movies and you find something people were looking for. Prior to this movie young people were told that if World War III came they would either be swallowed by an irresistible communist onslaught or fried in a matter of seconds by a nuclear explosion. Red Dawn said to them If the time comes you will not be helpless. You will fight back and win. It was an entirely unique message at the time and one people were longing to hear. In fact The United States was already fighting back and won it's greatest victory over its most formidable foe without direct armed conflict and bloodshed because of visionary and resolute political leadership.From the time of its release until today Red Dawn has been roundly criticized for the implausibility of the plot. It's quite true that the communist bloc was not capable of a successful invasion of the United States in 1984. But for those who failed to grasp this Red Dawn was not a documentary. The prologue establishes the circumstances under which the invasion occurred and the action that proceeds from that premise is possible. Would communist troops shoot up a school? Their battle record indicates that if they saw it as or mistook it for a tactical objective they most certainly would. Would they shoot civilians? Is there anybody out there so ignorant to suggest they wouldn't?Good Points about Red Dawn The action sequences are well done and look realistic. For instance there's a scene where a plane drops a bomb. You see the fireball first and then hear the sounds. That's a nice realistic touch. The actors handle their weapons properly Beautiful photography There's some good chemistry between some of the actors The outcome is typical of what happens in partisan fighting. Partisans typically enjoy initial success because of surprise and knowledge of the terrain. But they usually eventually succumb to bettertrained betterequipped troops I liked the musical scoreBad points about Red Dawn The communists are a tad too stupid for too long The use of horses is a stretch. Some of the teenage highfiving and exuberance will make you groan Some but not all of the dialog and acting is awfully stiffIn short it's an action picture that will entertain people who like action pictures. It has a unique plot line that has now become an anachronism. At it takes a jab at one of Hollywood's scared cows communism which is refreshing. Nobody should be ashamed of making it acting in it or enjoying watching it.Politically the real question is not why Hollywood made a film like Red Dawn. It is rather why did 50 years of totalitarian communist oppression spawn so few films critical of communism? Why are there seemingly scores of movies about McCarthyism and none about the Soviet gulag system? Schindler's List shows that Hollywood can make an incredible film a film so compelling you can't take your eyes off of it about something so horrible you can hardly bear to think about it. Stalin's body count exceeds Hitler's yet there is no Schindler's List for the Gulag. And that is something to be ashamed of.".

Prior to this movie young people were told that if World War III came they would either be swallowed by an irresistible communist onslaught or fried in a matter of seconds by a nuclear explosion. Red Dawn said to them If the time comes you will not be helpless. You will fight back and win. It was an entirely unique message at the time and one people were longing to hear. In fact The United States was already fighting back and won it's greatest victory over its most formidable foe without direct armed conflict and bloodshed because of visionary and resolute political leadership.From the time of its release until today Red Dawn has been roundly criticized for the implausibility of the plot. It's quite true that the communist bloc was not capable of a successful invasion of the United States in 1984. But for those who failed to grasp this Red Dawn was not a documentary. The prologue establishes the circumstances under which the invasion occurred and the action that proceeds from that premise is possible. Would communist troops shoot up a school? Their battle record indicates that if they saw it as or mistook it for a tactical objective they most certainly would. Would they shoot civilians? Is there anybody out there so ignorant to suggest they wouldn't?Good Points about Red Dawn The action sequences are well done and look realistic. For instance there's a scene where a plane drops a bomb. You see the fireball first and then hear the sounds. That's a nice realistic touch. The actors handle their weapons properly Beautiful photography There's some good chemistry between some of the actors The outcome is typical of what happens in partisan fighting. Partisans typically enjoy initial success because of surprise and knowledge of the terrain. But they usually eventually succumb to bettertrained betterequipped troops I liked the musical scoreBad points about Red Dawn The communists are a tad too stupid for too long The use of horses is a stretch. Some of the teenage highfiving and exuberance will make you groan Some but not all of the dialog and acting is awfully stiffIn short it's an action picture that will entertain people who like action pictures. It has a unique plot line that has now become an anachronism. At it takes a jab at one of Hollywood's scared cows communism which is refreshing. Nobody should be ashamed of making it acting in it or enjoying watching it.Politically the real question is not why Hollywood made a film like Red Dawn. It is rather why did 50 years of totalitarian communist oppression spawn so few films critical of communism? Why are there seemingly scores of movies about McCarthyism and none about the Soviet gulag system? Schindler's List shows that Hollywood can make an incredible film a film so compelling you can't take your eyes off of it about something so horrible you can hardly bear to think about it. Stalin's body count exceeds Hitler's yet there is no Schindler's List for the Gulag. And that is something to be ashamed of.";

Without a doubt Nazism was a force to be despised and resisted yet Triumph remains a fascinating even great film.That said I will not put Red Dawn on the same plane as Riefenstahl's work. It is neither as good a film nor as vile propaganda. But it does underscore a point I see running through many of the criticisms of Red Dawn that have been posted here. Many of the movie's detractors reject the film out of hand because of its undeniably conservative overtones. This I believe is lazy criticism. The movie has an excellent pedigree. I suggest you search on ImDb under John Milius' name to see what other films he has been involved in. Some of his more notable accomplishments include the screenplays of Jeremiah Johnson and coauthoring Apocalypse Now as well as the notably UNconservative adaptation of Clear and Present Danger. Basil Poledouris' score is fantastic with its Coplandesque homages. The touches of authenticity in the film are also admirable including the indoctrination camp see the recently published Gulag or Koestler's Darkness at Noonand Radio Free America scenes not to mention the efforts the filmmakers went to to make the military hardware look Russian as opposed to Russians flying American aircraft in dismal movies like Iron Eagle II and Rambo. Yes Red Dawn is propaganda but just because it may be from your perspective the wrong kind of propaganda you are not justified in invalidating the whole enterprise. It is slick wellmade and memorable.".

I'm basically writing this for those of you who either weren't born or too young to remember those days.  I grew up in the aftermath of the Vietnam War.

So when John Millius and his friends decided to make this patriotic teen movie about resistance fighters fighting invaders from the Evil Empire he was just tapping into the frustration that many people including myself felt at that time.  The scene I remember most vividly is the one when Patrick Swazye shoots the young Russian political officer in the Chevy Blazer.  The audience consisted mostly of guys from nearby Fort Collins and Peterson AFB and they gave this scene a standing ovation.  In this post 11 September world it's hard to imagine a time when during the Cold War flying the flag or loving your native land made many people think you were either a Nazi or a member of the John Birch Society.  Now this film isn't Seven Days in May or FailSafe.  It's just a movie that was made at a time after we had lost a war and many in the world regarded the USA as a paper tiger. That's all.".

Most people argue that your view of the film will be tainted by your political philosophy are you a redblooded American who would give your life to defend the values of your country or a cowardly tree hugger in denial about the imminent CuboRussian assault?Well as neither of those Cubans and Russians teaming up to invade a hick town is completely believable yeah? I hope to be able to give a somewhat balanced review of the film and the fact is it is terrible.The main problem with the film is that it just seems like a bunch of scenes thrown together rather than sequence of events leading to a climax and resolution. There is almost no characterisation apart from a few throwaway lines near the start of the movie and the action starts about 1 minute in to the movie. If alarm bells are ringing good. It's really hard to care about what happens to someone when you haven't even caught their name. Compounding this problem is the woeful acting  the acting is often so wooden I caught myself laughing out loud several times.And as previously mentioned there is no context to the majority of the movie. It's just a lot of scenes of our heroes killing commies in the woods  attacking enemy bases. This is what absolutely killed it for me  most of the time you don't know who they are attacking what purpose it serves what they are trying to achieve what the desired outcome is etc etc. This makes it mind numbing to watch  it's almost like watching stock footage of a war where you don't know which side is which. I understand that this might be the situation they are placed in where they don't know how long they will be fighting for and so on but it certainly does not make for good cinema when you have no reason to care about the outcome of the battles they engage in. I guess what I'm saying is that there's no progression throughout the movie  it would be entirely feasible to cut and paste 80 of the movie into a different order and it would have no bearing whatsoever on the plot.Perhaps the most ironic part of the movie is that the only person to show mercy is one of the Communists. It hardly makes you feel for the Good Guys when they kill people in cold blood throughout the movie yet the Bad Guy is the only one big enough to let a wounded enemy walk away. Actually that's not true the most ironic part of the movie would have to be the moustaches which all the commies have but that's another story....I guess the one thing that saves it for me is that not all of our heroes live  it would have received one star had it been a complete feel good walkover and it's a measure of restraint which the movie could have used a lot more of.So if you're a red blooded American whose eyes brim with tears every time you hear your national anthem then by all means see this movie as you'll probably enjoy it. That doesn't mean it's a good movie though.".

This is what absolutely killed it for me  most of the time you don't know who they are attacking what purpose it serves what they are trying to achieve what the desired outcome is etc etc. This makes it mind numbing to watch  it's almost like watching stock footage of a war where you don't know which side is which. I understand that this might be the situation they are placed in where they don't know how long they will be fighting for and so on but it certainly does not make for good cinema when you have no reason to care about the outcome of the battles they engage in. I guess what I'm saying is that there's no progression throughout the movie  it would be entirely feasible to cut and paste 80 of the movie into a different order and it would have no bearing whatsoever on the plot.Perhaps the most ironic part of the movie is that the only person to show mercy is one of the Communists. It hardly makes you feel for the Good Guys when they kill people in cold blood throughout the movie yet the Bad Guy is the only one big enough to let a wounded enemy walk away. Actually that's not true the most ironic part of the movie would have to be the moustaches which all the commies have but that's another story....I guess the one thing that saves it for me is that not all of our heroes live  it would have received one star had it been a complete feel good walkover and it's a measure of restraint which the movie could have used a lot more of.So if you're a red blooded American whose eyes brim with tears every time you hear your national anthem then by all means see this movie as you'll probably enjoy it. That doesn't mean it's a good movie though.";

	schema:headline " Red Dawn??? False Dawn more like....";
	schema:reviewBody "I like watching movies and love to write good reviews of movies and Red Dawn was a film that I had missed in its original release back in the 80s. I was looking forward to seeing it. I would have been 14 at the time of release and maybe it would have hit a more resonant nerve if I had seen it at that age  but now it is simply dreadful.In 1983  The Outsiders  directed by Coppola starred Howell Swayze and Dalton. It is a fantastic film a great story good acting and superb directing. The next year  1984  all three combine again in Red Dawn to abysmal results. What happened? The cast for Red Dawn was a good one  Charlie Sheen Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey adding more youth and Powers Boothe and Harry Dean Stanton providing some experience. But Milius' handling of the script dialogue action scenes sound everything is terrible.A quick summary of the film's premise is this  soviet troops invade America at the start of WW3. A few teenagers escape to the mountains and wage a guerrilla style attack on the forces over a number of months.What is wrong with this movie?1. The characters. No time is given to their background before the attack starts. And they are so cardboard that they do not even come close to discussing the situation they find themselves in  they simply accept it. Their whole lives change in the blink of an eye and they act as if they are ordering Pepsi because there is no Coke left. 2. The acting. If the characters were poorly developed  the acting was embarrassing. Howell lost all he had gained from The Outsiders within 2 minutes of being onscreen. I blame Milius for this as Howell was great in Outsiders and subsequently great in The Hitcher. In between those films Howell lost out on the Marty McFly part in BTTF and subsequently  lost the franchise to being a very successful actor. All Milius' fault? Maybe not  but seeing as Lea Thompson was in BTTF and in this too  Howell must feel aggrieved. Stanton's 'Avenge me' scene is toecurdling bad.3. The action scenes. Repetitive scenes of our unknown cast of BratPackers wandering around the Rockies blasting everything with a red star. The scenes are slow tedious and downright boring after the umpteenth scenario. The scandal here is that you can see the amount of money spent on explosions  tanks etc. is quite a lot  but there is zero tension in the build up to these. It is like watching a series of unrelated incidents carried out by a bunch of different people every time. You cannot even make out who is doing what. 4. The Dialogue. The amount of times dreadful lines are delivered by incompetent actors is astounding. Did anyone even read this script beforehand? Sometimes I thought the editing room was having a laugh  for in some scenes it looks like the kids are not even fully ready for the upcoming scene. Their delivery is abysmal but in truth the words that were on the paper embarrassingly bad. Boothe's death scene is especially bad. As he is shot through the back and hanging from the turret of a soviet tank  he has to deliver his last words to the kids Shoot straight. For a change. Then he dies. My God I'd say he was delighted that day to finally get off home with his cheque. Not one to show his grandkids that's for sure.5. The Camerawork. Bar the setup introductory shots for the changing of the seasons  which consisted of 2 or 3 shots of the Rockies during December January etc.  the cinematography was downright shoddy. Everything seemed too far away. The camera was too far from the actors to hear what they were saying the sound obviously redubbed on a sound stage afterwards and to see emotion in their faces. If the audience is not close enough to the actors to feel their emotions  then we cannot identify with them. The whole thing looked like watching a football match from the very highest seat in the stadium.6. The Music. Overbearing intrusive and dominating every scene it is involved with by beating it down so hard  your ears start to bleed.7. The Plot. The overall premise is not bad but the execution of it terrible. The soviets must have been thick as planks for we learn during the movie that they are on high lookout for our teenage gang  yet they can walk freely among the town among the soldiers as if they were invisible. Remember this is a small hick town  not New York  they should be noticed. Where did the Wolerines get all the ammo guns RPGs Claymores machine guns for their attacks? Okay they got some supplies from Howell's father's shop  a very convenient gungrocerycamping shop  but do they sell Claymores? I don't think so. It's also hard to swallow the fact that a well organised machine like the Russian army will succumb to a bunch of kids running around the mountains  it just does not ring true. Howell's last stand against the Russian helicopters beggars belief. He is so careful all through the movie not to expose himself but yet decides out of the blue to stand in the open and fire a tiddlywink gun at 2 Russian attack choppers  only to get killed. Why? Too much stuff here to mention but take it on faith that it was bad.All in all a really bad film made by a terrible director. 210  Avoid at all costs.".

The film was an entertaining nostalgic and highly commercial action movie from a time past.....and on a base level I just plain enjoyed it. It made me smile! The trailer reminded me of a video game called Freedom Fighters set in New York you play the part of a plumber leading a resistance force against a Russian invasion which I had enjoyed too i liked the premise so my flatmates and I 2 English 1 Irish and 1 American sat through the movie last night. Once the giggles from the girls had subsided yes Swayze and Sheen look like babies and have not aged too well! the opening parachute invasion got quite a buzz. Handled clumsily and probably with an extremely limited budget it took a good 20 minutes for the Bmovie ethic to settle in but once over that the premise really started to work and you could actually begin to empathise with the kids in their situation. The story became a bit strung out in places the action was cardboardy and basic and the acting was...well....not there really but I don't think that was down to a lack of talent. But it hung together and we all enjoyed it. Where peoples readings of political messages come from I have no idea. I understand that America has it's extremists who hide in the mountains stash mountains of weapons and food for just such an event but the movie certainly doesn't satirise them. The joke in the film of the NRA bumper sticker and the dead guys cold dead hand falls flat if it was intended as a purposeful message and therefore seems more to be an attempt at acknowledging the certain irony of such events in the states. The rhetoric of the kids in their internal arguments is hollow and situational not political and just about manage to hold some water. The movie is and was just a great what if.....? and an amusing 80's Hollywood schtick action movie no more no less. If a backstory of a continued Cold War was introduced I can well see this being ripe for a remake and perhaps then you can apply your kneejerk reactionary theories to it with more basis then...who know?".

Maybe this sounds awesome now but unfortunately it's nothing else then one clich action scene arbitrarily added on the next.

Some said Red Dawn wouldn't dehumanize the Russians. Doesn't the movie start with soviet soldiers shooting young high school students? I have to add these students were actually unarmed unlike these days. Isn't that at least a little onesided? Did somebody really need a propaganda flick like this to feel good about themselves again?

	schema:reviewBody "Some weeks ago I got to see the notorious 1984 film 'Red Dawn' on TV. I had been looking forward to the experience since i played a certain computer game with a similar plot some years back. There was something exotic and fascinating with the thought of a very unlikely Soviet invasion of the USA. Disappointingly what I saw was pretty trashy.In the movie America has been deserted by many former allied because of an extremely unlikely dissolvement of NATO except of the UK of course.

The attack choppers late in the movie doesn't even look like the infamous Soviet Hinds they're just crappy lookalikes.The acting was bad. Seriously it was BAD.

The supporting cast sometimes seem like a group of randomly selected amateurs. The actors have serious problems displaying their characters. Emotions seem fake.

For these imbecilic escapades I suspect his family of being badly inbred. I mean he must have intellectual issues when he makes a bomb like this. When he made this film he obviously had no clue how to make a movie entertaining for people with adequate intelligence.The controversy around this film was caused by its political message.

I had been looking forward to the experience since i played a certain computer game with a similar plot some years back. There was something exotic and fascinating with the thought of a very unlikely Soviet invasion of the USA. Disappointingly what I saw was pretty trashy.In the movie America has been deserted by many former allied because of an extremely unlikely dissolvement of NATO except of the UK of course. As if that wasn't enough Mexico has underwent a Revolution to become a Marxist state. In 1984 the Soviets got unlucky with their harvest which leads to the invasion of the US. Naturally.

The only person I can think of that would have loved this movie is Ted Nugent who's grasp on reality has always been tenuous at best. The people who seem to have loved this movie most of whom are now right wing Republicans probably saw this movie as a boys wet dream of being an action hero and saving his country. And yet Milius went on to be a screen writer for the movie apocalypse now. Go figure. Reading other user comments this movie seemed to appeal to people imbued with a sense of unrealitypeople decrying the intrinsic Communism of Hollywood while most of the reviews coming from outside the US almost universally condemn this movie as being idiotic at best.

Those folks were very vocal back in the seventies and eighties advocated a nuclear freeze and U.S. out of everywhere type policies opposed any sort of defense.  So its not much of a surprise that they would dislike a movie that obviously heralded American values traditions and clearly warned against weakness in the face of enemies. Yet the move doesn't gloss over a great deal in places its quite brutal and its hardly a glorification of violence.  In one of the more interesting scenes a Russian soldier young funny wants to have his picture taken. Minutes later he's desperately crawling up hill as he fearfully cries out that Help they're killing me! as Americans with guns are clumsily trying to shoot him.  It's actually quite a disturbing scene. In another the partisans high school students mostly end up executing both a helpless Russian soldier and an American turncoat.  Though I thought that the fighting between an American resistance and heavily armed Russian Army wasn't particularly well done the basic idea was sound.  In fact I think it might be interesting to watch this movie after watching The Beast with George Dzundza the only movie I can think of that portrays the guerilla war in Afganistan in the eighties.  Both the guerilla fighers many young and poorly trained of Afganistan and Vietnam should instruct those who think a lightly armed American resistance couldn't give a mechanized brutal Red Army fits. Maybe they ought to look into Chechnya as well.  I find the movie to be a bit more complex than those who simplistically assign it to the jingoistic flag waving bin rather I think it is more a warning to Americans to avoid taking liberties for granted that we are not immune from the dangers lurking in the world and that there are those who wish us ill and that martial virtues should not be so easily dismissed.Its rather unsettling to watch American citizens machine gunned by a foreign tank in a small western town but it happens in this movie.  And suffice it to say that the story hardly has a very happy ending.I'd suggest this to anyone who has an interest in understanding the Cold War particularly as it developed in the Eighties to its successful conclusion under the basic ideas advocated by this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've yet to see a serious review of John Milius' magnum opus Red Dawn. For the most part the liberal critics dismiss any discussion of its technical and dramatic strengths and instead focus entirely on the message.  The thrust of complaints against Milius and Red Dawn amount to probably some of the most disingenuous criticisms in cinematic history.  They critics argue that the audience should reject whatever Milius was trying to say he's a conservative and board member of the NA because the scenario is NOT REALISTIC and just a propaganda vehicle.  I've always wondered how liberals who draw the line at it's bad when it comes to understanding war have the gall to judge the credulity of any piece in the genre.My main objection with the Left's attack on Red Dawn is their refusal to acknowledge that Milius' focus on the Wolverines represents only a snapshot of a far larger broader story the remains ever present in the background. When critics complain about how incredulous it is for the Soviets and their Latin allies to attack a small town in Colorado they purposely misunderstand the message Milius explicitly delivered through the Wolverine's conversation with Col. Tannerthese kids are only a small set of actors in a much larger war.It doesn't take that much of a mental exercise necessary to justify the period's well thought out belief that the Soviets could exploit their adventures in Latin America to invade the United States.  Between Vietnam and the nuclear freeze movement right before the Reagan build up the West was essentially in retreat throughout the entire globe.  Whether or not the Soviets could've succeeded in this gamble is another debate but Red Dawn is a story of extraordinary times and circumstances albeit with careful attention to the real world.Even so the focus on the realism of Red Dawn's background story is an attempt to get away from the really other stunning aspects of the film. You may disagree with the conservative themes in this film but one thing John Milius does very well is let his views flow naturally from the experiences of his characters and the realities of war.  There is no Rush Limbaugh avatar reaching into the film to preach through Patrick Swayze or Harry Dean Stanton something Aaron Sorkin can't help but injecting into the endless banter that has become staple to the The West Wing.The most clever critics realize that thematically Red Dawn is a success so they go after the acting  after all that's where half of Milius' conservative propaganda is coming from.  Yet more often than not they dismiss this important part of the film's success without a single attempt to specify their objections.  You might ask what people should expect in the way of expressions and dialogue from high school kids who've been conditioned into guerillas  and I can't say that the kids in the Lord of the Flies featured the timely emoting that we see from say Swayze's character when they first arrive in the mountains.  The terse yet clearly emotional and meaningful chatter between the Wolverines is strikingly credible and surpassed only by Harry Dean Stanton's powerful performance as a Midwestern blue collar thrown into a detention center and Ron O'Neal's slow yet well paced descent into disillusionment with his tiny slice of the war.There's wide agreement that the cinematics were decent given the budget involved and the technology of the time.  The art direction apparantly was so successful that two CIA case officers were alarmed by the attention to detail given to the T72 main battle tank mock ups.  Over all Red Dawn maybe one of the most original well done pieces from the 1980s.".

Both films find a gang of photogenic young Americans fighting a guerrilla war against foreign invaders Soviet Russia in the original film North Korea in the remake.Milius was a notorious right winger conservative and gun advocate so there was some kind of honesty propelling his project. It was racist xenophobic dumb militaristic alarmist violently nationalistic but it felt personal dammit. A selfdescribed rugged individualist Milius' Dawn was also a nutty attack on big government. His well armed guerrillas weren't only protecting Uncle Sam from dirty communists insurgents and evil foreign invaders but protecting their hometowns from an expanding state which sought to take away our freedoms man! And though Milius' heroes were defending a town called Calumet literally peace ie fighting for peace Milius also hinted that America was itself irrevocably corrupt and might not even be worth saving. And so he salivated instead over a kind of nihilistic glorified version of warfare where death battle and survivalists are exalted and those who don't stand up and fend for themselves are weak pu and so deserve to be crushed.Yeah it's stupid but it felt like art. Bradley's Red Dawn in contrast oozed boardroom meetings plastic visuals and decision committees. The film was so cynical it changed the nationality of its invading army from Chinese to North Koreans mid production. Why? Purely for box office reasons. With the North Korean market cut off and potential Chinese market's vast MGM executives promptly ordered the film's enemy race changed. And so Red Dawn bent to the will of the almighty dollar. Seduced by the Chinese cash cow it then spent many months in postproduction MGM lackeys digitally altering flags sets national symbols and dubbing over Chinese dialogue with Korean. No harm done. Right? After all Asians do all look the same.Both films offer few thrills but Bradley's was the more pointless of the two having been released in the wake of Tomorrow When the War Began another Red Dawn remake which likewise demonized Asians and portrayed them as invading menaces. Both films express very western anxieties pander to western fear mongers and stir up very specific resentments China's economy is gathering momentum and so it is perceived steps must be taken to both attack it and forestall the collapse of the US Empire.Of course the notion that the United States is being threatened and is at risk of a North Korean or Chinese invasion is nonsense just as the idea of a communist invasion was nonsense in Milius' era. Indeed from the 1940s onwards the truth was virtually the opposite the US systematically invading or annihilating left leaning communist or socialistic movements across the globe. Today the US has China surrounded has 60 percent of its Navy stationed in the region and wages proxy wars with it across Africa and South America. China may be a threat to the US in the far future but as of now there is no force in the world that can match the US Empire an Empire which has over 700 military bases in foreign countries around the world a multi zillion dollar military budget which dwarfs the combined economies of entire continents possesses stateoftheart military hardware and has its own proxy armies embedded in most of the world's hotspots. And of course far from being at risk of invasion the US spends much of its time invading foreign nations be it secretly or blatantly. The irony is what finally crushes the American Empire  history teaches us that all Empires shrink back down to impotent pinpricks  will most likely not be foreign invasion but perhaps exactly what tended to crush previous Empires overexpansion mounting debts and inflation.There are slight differences between Great Empires of the past though and the US Empire. Past empires were extractive. They succeeded because the value of the resources and wealth extracted from conquered lands exceeded the value of conquest and governance. Rome failed because Romans exhausted manpower and resources fighting civil wars and amongst themselves. The British Empire for similar reasons. Americans meanwhile get few extractive benefits from war. Iraq hit the US public with trillion dollar debts and no Iraqi oil likewise the struggle against the Taliban in Afghanistan. So where's the money going? Not to Washington not to the US state as an extractive organism but to the benefit of a few powerful interest groups parasitic cartels embedded within and beyond the state. Under such a structure conquest therefore stops being the aim  the US did not conquer Iraq and has been forced out politically by the government that Washington established  because success at war no longer matters. Rather extraction now takes place by being at war and the victor nation is as much a victim taxpayer money slowly suckled. The goal is no longer to extract from the enemy but to strip American wealth and liberty as well. This is why the wars cannot end why their goals are purposefully vague or if one does end another promptly starts. And of course to sanction such a state of perpetual war ethics need to be constantly trumpeted war as a humanitarian necessity a universal human right a morally superior action etc.Milius' Red Dawn was somewhat unique in the 1980s. Aesthetically Milius also had a certain audacity executing children teachers and civilians and finding some nightmarish visuals here and there. His career would quickly take a nosedive though before Steven Spielberg hired him to do some rewrites on Saving Private Ryan another albeit less obvious right wing fantasy. Bradley's film in contrast is both generic and anonymous with a cast of token Asians token African Americans a cardboard evil villain and a muscular allAmerican hero. It's unintentionally funny rather than thrilling.710  Worth no viewings.".

And of course to sanction such a state of perpetual war ethics need to be constantly trumpeted war as a humanitarian necessity a universal human right a morally superior action etc.Milius' Red Dawn was somewhat unique in the 1980s. Aesthetically Milius also had a certain audacity executing children teachers and civilians and finding some nightmarish visuals here and there. His career would quickly take a nosedive though before Steven Spielberg hired him to do some rewrites on Saving Private Ryan another albeit less obvious right wing fantasy. Bradley's film in contrast is both generic and anonymous with a cast of token Asians token African Americans a cardboard evil villain and a muscular allAmerican hero. It's unintentionally funny rather than thrilling.710  Worth no viewings.";

It's so bad that people rent it so they can get drunk and laugh at it. Shot as always with Milius with lockeddown cameras and muddy sound it's a wedge of sheer univentive paranoid fear. The premise?

	schema:reviewBody "Before commenting on Red Dawn I have to say that I am from the Evil Empire. It is necessary to include a comparison to a Soviet movie about PartisansResistance Movement called The Black Birch1978 to see where Red Dawn is just propaganda.Black Birch is quite similar to Red Dawn. There is the ruthless enemy in this case the Nazi invasion troops. There is massive destruction of urban areascities by the invasion forces many civilians are killed. The heroes hide in the forest and form a PartisanResistance Group. The group rescues a downed Soviet pilot and fights enemy Snow troops during the Winter.This is where the similarities end. The Partisans in Black Birch are not 7 kids living on canned soup in the mountains they are mostly full grown adults and out of around 50 people about 30 are soldiers trapped behind enemy lines. The leader of this Partisan group is not a High School Football team Quarterback he is an experienced Army Captain who served in an Artillery battery. The unit wages a successful campaign against German Supply trains not because they know how to hunt but because they have the military training and use it effectively.The viewer gets to see what the characters think and how their lives transform during war time and in the ruined cities of peace time after the invaders are defeated. The ruthless Germans in the movie do execute terrorist collaborators they use a woman who treated wounded Partisans as an example to the rest of the local population. In Red Dawn local people are sadistically executed for no real reason in the middle of nowhere to the music of the Soviet Anthem.Black Birch had plenty of scenes to make people think about the hardship and suffering of being a Resistance Fighter in Red Dawn the kids act like Rambo for most of the movie. Suffering? In the middle of a forest with little to survive on no suffering here!Red Dawn was very much like the other American movies starting with Red or Rambo during the 1980's and 90's. There was the handful of superhuman Americans and 1000's of incompetentgreedyevil RedsCommiesRussians. Even Red Heat stereotyped Russians as cold and emotionless. All of the above makes sense if this movie is nothing more than Propaganda. 1. Excessive use of national symbols to build up patriotism in the population. 2. Dehumanizing the enemy. Joseph Goebbels would be proud of some of the scenes several examples a. Just several minutes into the movie before the Paratroopers start killing everything that moves the school teacher is talking about the Mongol Horde and how it destroyed everything in its path wiping out civilization. Historically Nazi Propaganda referred to Russians and Slavs as the subhumans who originated from Asiatic blood the Great Asian Horde from the EastRussia were to be wiped out because they threatened the 3rd Reich. Nazis linked barbaric Mongolian culture with Russian and dehumanize Russians and those like them as subhuman monsters just like in Red Dawn. b. The BTR crew are shown as rapistsdirectly out of Goebbel's own speeches who chase after any woman and sexually assault her in fact as I understand it apparently my own culture is nothing but mafia rapists and maniacs according to the American point of view. c. The execution scene. Again those monsters without souls massacre dozens of civilians without a reason bodies pile up in mass graves. The Director thinks Soviet Army  Waffen SS and that scene associating the Soviet Anthem with Mass Murder was just intentional propaganda. The Waffen SS did it for 2 reasons General Plan Ost Genocide Campaign in the USSR and as revenge for Partisan attacks on German officers in which 100 civilians were executed for each dead German officer. No such policy was ever practiced by the Soviet Army after WW2 because it never worked it always had the opposite effect.3. Heroes with Superhuman abilities. There is no doubt in my mind that the Wolverines represent the American Super RaceAryans. The Director borrows from Fascist propaganda to make his characters appear as perfect individuals fighting against the inferiorRussian enemies. 4. Message is filled with strong feelings for domestic Political Ideology. Just like the UltraNationalist countries the Americans in this movie are depicted as fiercely loyal to their form of government and economics. Even if their government is wrong it is always right. Anybody who associates himher self with other political views is unAmerican. Communism and Socialism are so twisted in this movie that it appears no different from the Racist system of Nazi Germany.Other points a. There were no Reeducation Camps used by the Soviet Army in the 1980's in Afghanistan there were regular Prisons for suspected insurgents. b. In no way was this film realistic as some claim. And Afghanistan and Chechnya are not Colorado. Afghans were trained to fight from age 12 Chechen separatists were formerSoviet Army troops and officers. Afghans live a life stuck in the 12th century with mud brick homes without electricity or running water or any other modern western household items death in battle is the fastest way to heaven. The only real possession 50 of Afghans have is a rifle mostly BoltAction in the 1980's but thanks to American efforts now include automatic rifles. And Afghans fight in Clan wars Pashtuns against Tajiks and Turkmen against Arab Bedouins by the age of 30 most have combat experience while to Americans hunting is only a sport fighting to Afghans means surviving in life. c. During the film Soviet troops are shown in Parade Uniforms instead of Battle Dress Uniform. Long Greatcoats and bright red epaulets were no longer used in front line service by 1960. Olive Draband camouflage was the only color one had on a uniform and Parkas replaced the long brown colored Coats. Body Armor vests and helmets were also issued to Soldiers in 1984.".

	schema:headline " Masterpiece! The greatest Vampire flick ever made!!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Lost Boys 1987 is one of the best and the greatest vampire flick's ever made! A true Schumacher masterpiece and a classic horror film! I love The Lost Boys so much it is one of the best true horror movies ever made from the 80's! I always loved this movie since I was a child and the vampires in here are awesome! It encompasses everything that was so silly and cheesy and fun about the 80's. The hair the clothes the music the attitude  it seemed like nobody ever took themselves too seriously in that time. Hell look at Tim Capello's cameo in the movie for Christ's sake! Super oiledup buff saxplaying dude in tight purple spandex? Only in the 80's!The story is about Michael Jason Patric and his brother Sam Corey Haim who move together with their mother to stay with their grandfather in Santa Carla California. One day Michael meets a girl and falls for her to know later that she is with a gang of guys who are vampires. They give him wine mixed with blood and Michael drinks it without knowing what it contains. Things change for Michael and he finds out the truth. He tries his best to resist the urge of becoming a vampire and fights it with the help of his brother Sam. This vampire movie is the epitome of excellent humorhorror. Just when you are sitting on the edge of your seat getting ready for the next scary scene you get a joke or a snide remark. As you are relaxed by the humor you get hit with a nail bitter of a scary scene. The soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard some of my favorite music came from this soundtrack. One of my favorite movies that I ever love a true classic I think for once Joel Schumacher did a great job as the director He screwed up Batman  Robin 1997 but he made this movie right! This film is probably the best vampire movie I have ever seen one of my favorites and the soundtrack was awesome loved Cry Little Sister and all of the tracks. The cast all around was very solid too I think probably the best cast for a vampire movie yet. I miss the 80's classic films like one of them was Fright Night 1985 this movie is released 2.years later and it is another Vampire movie and right behind him. Gosh I want more Vampire flicks from the 80's like this one is. The Lost Boys is like Twilight of it's late 80's day. The difference between the two is that Lost Boys is a rocknroll vampire flick mixed with some goofy humor to make it the cult classic is has become ever since it came and went from theaters to VHS.In this film are famous stars like are Jason Patric Corey Haim Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer from 24 2001 TV show one of my all time favorite TV shows. Corey Feldman and of course Alex Winter he played in Death Wish 3 Bill  Ted's Excellent Adventure and it's sequel Bill  Ted's Bogus Journey gosh I miss those movies. Why can't they make movies like are this ones today? The Lost Boys Fright Night Death Wish 3 Bill  Ted's Excellent Adventure Bill  Ted's Bogus Journey are classic movies where are they now?Sleep all day. Party all night. Never grow old. Never die. It's fun to be a vampire. When a single mother and her two sons move to the sleepy seaside California town of Santa Clara they discover much more than they anticipated in this visually stunning blend of hip humor horror and rock 'n' roll about the most compelling group of contemporary vampires ever to put fang to vein. That is actually the basic plot of the film! The Lost Boys is a 1987 American horror comedy film starring Jason Patric Corey Haim Kiefer Sutherland Jami Gertz Corey Feldman Dianne Wiest Edward Herrmann Alex Winter Jamison Newlander and Barnard Hughes. Anyway I am giving this film a 1010 because the film deserves it and it doesn't deserve to be bashed and hated from people! I love this film to death I love it!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Lost Boys is one of the movies that I think epitomizes the 1980's. It has a genuine 80's look and feel as well as an awesome soundtrack and some fantastic performances by 80's legends like Corey Feldman.This movie really draws you into it and makes you feel like you're right there in Santa Carla. The music fits the film perfectly. Nothing would have worked better. The setting is perfect. If you were a vampire and you were never going to die where else would you want to spend your time? The amusement park the abandoned cave with all that great stuff in it and the railroad tracks trust me you'll understand after you see it are absolutely incredible. The way Joel Schumacher uses certain POV shots and the eerie fog only add to the mood and atmosphere of the movie.The gore and special effects are great! Since this is an 80's movie there is no CGI thankfully so everything you see is really real. The makeup of the vampires is excellent with their piercing eyes and long fangs. The gore doesn't really show itself until the end though there is a very bloody but quick campfire attack in the middle. Once we do get to the blood and guts it's great! There's a melting vampire in holy water an exploding vampire two excellent impalings and more where that came from.Finally the acting is great. We have a very good cast especially Kiefer Sutherland who puts everyone else to shame. Jason Patric is a little dry but he's great in his role. Max and Lucy have good chemistry as well as Star and Michael. The Frog Brothers are classic and are responsible for most of the humor. Superb performances by all!The Bottom Line A true 80's flick with great performances awesome special effects a rocking soundtrack and Corey Feldman!!!".

	schema:headline " We trashed the one that looks like Twisted Sister!";
	schema:reviewBody "Haha that line makes me laugh every time just for how old school 80s it is. Not to mention the vampire that the kids just trashed didn't really look like Twisted Sister as he did more of a generic 80s pop metal dude. Middle school life in the late 80s junior high back then had some movies that were almost universally thought of as cool. Some of these were Predator Coming to America Top Gun yeah I said Top Gun Big and of course The Lost Boys. TLB was so popular with kids I remember knowing the details of the plot before I had ever seen the movie.Two kids named Sam Corey Haim and Michael Jason Patric move to Santa Carla CA with their mother in hopes of a new life. Sam is looking to just have some fun and find a cable hook up for MTV while his older brother Michael gets involved with some teenage vampire punk kids. Michael is slowly being recruited into the vampire clique that hangs around the boardwalk while Sam desperately tries to turn him back to a normal human with the help of the overzealous Frog Brothers Corey Feldman and some other guy.Slick stylish and shot like an 80s music video this movie was a lot of fun. A few of the 1987 fashions here are enough to make this movie illegal in a some countries but the hip feel of the film keeps it from being too dated. Well in my opinion anyway some kid today might think different. Afterall this movie is nearly 20 years old. Typing that just made me feel very very old. Anyway the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous director Joel Schumacher especially knows how to shoot night scenes. This film was both a horror and a comedy at the same time though I'm not sure which I preferred. Any movie that features both Corey Haim and Corey Feldman is going to be one that you can't take very seriously. If you don't know who these two guys are better you never find out. Just watch the movie. Keep an ear out for INXS Run DMC and The Doors.".

It is though a very good vampire tale.  The cast is superb even Corey Haim and Feldman.  This is definitely the best movie they did together.  This one has a family of three a mother and two sons moving into her dad's home.  They go around town and the younger one hears from some comic book workers that there are vampires in town.  The older son is in fact being recruited by said vampires and is already becoming one after drinking a strange liquid. All in all I love this film and it is one of my favorite vampire flicks. Good mixture of action horror and especially for me...comedy.  This movie is so very well made that you will find it hard to believe that the director of this would go on to make the pretty bad Batman and Robin.  This movie though is good and has one of the best ending lines of any movie.".

	schema:headline " Sex blood and rocknroll!";
	schema:reviewBody "One thing I can always promise you is that when people talk about the best vampire movies of all time The Lost Boys is guaranteed to be on their list. In the 1980's films were all about action sex appeal muscles and very good looking teenagers. Joel Schumacher who was starting out at the time was given the script and it was about kid vampires. He thought it sounded silly and offered a different idea of it being teenage vampires on motorcycles who knew he had one of the best ideas that would create such a huge cult classic for decades? I absolutely adore this movie everything about it it's style the script the humor the horror the make up the cast and the music. While dated it still has a timeless fun style to it that will entertain those who are seeing it for the first time as if it was the opening weekend at the movie theater. I've watched this movie since I was a little girl and it's interesting to see that I still love The Lost Boys so much as an adult I have a different love for it than the boys are sooo cute! well they still are but besides the point The Lost Boys is a great movie that will not disappoint.Michael and his younger brother Sam move with their justdivorced mother Lucy to Santa Carla plagued by gang activity and unexplained disappearances what better place to take your children?! The family moves in with Lucy's father an eccentric old man who lives on the outskirts of town and enjoys taxidermy as a hobby. The center of town life is the Boardwalk which is plastered with flyers of missing people. While Lucy gets a job at a local video store run by a conservative man named Max Michael becomes fascinated by Star a beautiful young woman who lives with the mysterious leader of the local gang David. Meanwhile in the local comic book store Sam meets brothers Edgar and Alan Frog selfproclaimed vampire hunters who give Sam horror comics to teach him about vampires. When Michael meets Star the next night David provokes him into a motorcycle race in which he is baited into almost going over the edge of a sea cliff. David invites Michael to their lair where he is put through an unsettling initiation that includes drinking blood from a wine bottle. The next night while Sam takes a bath his dog Nanook is forced to fend off Michael's bloodlustdriven attack on Sam. When Sam looks for his dog he finds his brother has been attacked but also that Michael's reflection in a mirror has become transparent. Sam calls the Frog brothers for help they say the only way to save his brother is by killing the head vampire who they suspect is Max Lucy's boss and new boyfriend.It's hard to pin point what is so great about this movie. I love the cast starting with Kiefer Sutherland who plays David the lead of the Lost Boys. He has only a few lines but you'd think he was the title character the way he presents himself you can tell he had so much fun with this bad boy role. Dianne Wiest one of my favorite actresses what a beautiful lovely woman she is her character is so warm and wonderful. She plays a great mom and is so believable the way she reacts to the situations she's put in by her crazy sons. This was also the start of The Two Corey's Corey Haim and Corey Feldman who had great chemistry along side with Jamison Newlander as they are hunting for vampires. They're like Rambo's who take themselves way too seriously and that's why they are so hilarious but great at what they do. The make up effects are just great and the vampires had such a sleek sexy look to them but still terrifying the scene where they show Michael their vampire faces is one of the most memorable and most frightening. This is without a doubt the sexiest vampire movie you could watch. It has everything a vampire film should have to entertain. I still love showing this movie to my friends who never saw it I envy the look on their faces at the end when they fall in love with it too as I wish I could say I was seeing it for the first time too. But I watch it each time and love it as if I were watching it for the first time it's a fantastic movie I could go on and on but I'll just end with please watch this movie. You better be buying this movie right now as you're finished reading this comment.1010".

The makeup is top notch as are the special effects and the acting is a perfect fit to the context of the film. Yeah Corey Haim may not be a Dean or Brando but he is pitch perfect as the annoying little brother who talks big and runs fast in the face of trouble.  Jason Patrick is as good as an actor could possibly be in a role that requires very little character development but the big star here is Kiefer Sutherland who channels his scary bad boy look into a character who is as fun to watch as he is frightening. Rounding out the rest of the cast is Dianne Wiest as the sweet mother Corey Haim and Edward Hermann as the vampire killing duo Edgar and Alan a cute Poe reference Frog and 80's movie staple Jamie Gertz as the gypsyesque Star.sidenote Yes that is Alex Winter of Bill and Ted fame as one of the lesser vampiresThe film has many memorable scenes including the vampire initiation and the scene where Patrick first approaches his brother in vampire form. Though the 80's fashion and music are powerful throughout they borderline overdone and are still enjoyable. Plotwise the set up is acceptable Wiest and her two sonsPatrick and Haim move into her father's house in Santa Carla California a quaint little beach side town that has been suffering from a high homicide rate. While mom looks for a job the boys look for something to do Patrick setting his sights on the alluring Star and Haim settling into the local comic den both fail to notice the ridiculous amount of MISSING posters on the walls. Patrick is led astray by a group of youths who like to drag race and hang out in a cave eventually peer pressure rears its ugly head and soon enough Patrick is one of them. Then he finds out exactly why they only hang out after dark.Full of great one liners and comedic performances Barnard Hughes is great as the eccentric taxidermistgrandfather The Lost Boys is a film showcased by the small touches we still have the usual vampire yarn but the youthful overtones create a different effect. Yes its 80's but its damn fun to watch. Schumacher creates a film that is not only a fun take on vampires but a creative take on teenagers and their neverending trek to belong.Reccommended to those who have a sense of humor and enjoy vampire films.8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Without a doubt among the most brilliant of vampire movies ever made in the modern film era. Jason Patric and Kiefer Sutherland are destined to blow away all audiences of this visual masterpiece. However the twist at the end which I plan not to give away was made slightly obvious though well hidden at the same time. Joel Schumacher does a splendid job directing this true work of art. The frog brothers did a great job of adding humor to this otherwise mainly serious film without spoiling the suspense. That made the film far more enjoyable to people with interests in multiple genres. Jami Gertz looks absolutely attractive in her role as Star. However the show is undoubtedly stolen by Kiefer Sutherland in the role of David the rebellious dangerous rude and rambunctious teenaged vampire who seduces Michael Jason Patric into joining his gang of vampires. The story is of a woman Dianne Wiest and her two sons Sam Corey Haim and Michael Patric who move to a small Californian town called Santa Carla often referred to as the murder capital of the world to live with her father after getting divorced. Little to their knowledge the town happens to be inhabited by a motorcycle gang of Jim Morrison obsessed teenage vampires. While the mother begins to fall in love with her boss from the video store where she has been employed Sam spends his time reading vampire comics which were given to him by two brothers Corey Feldman Jamison Newlander who claim the town is infested by vampires. He does not believe them but grows to almost immediately upon realizing that his brother Michael has been seduced by the beautiful halfvampiress Star Gertz and joins the gang led by David Sutherland. He realizes that neither Star nor Michael are true vampire until they make their first kill and they will not become normal again until the head vampire is killed. So he calls up the brothers Frog and gets them to come in and help him solve the job though he is scared that he might have to kill his brother. Overall a cinematic masterpiece. The directing acting writing camera work special effects stunts and of course the epic cinematography work with the astounding score to bring together one of the most loved films of all time. The story is in fact an allegory to that of the lost boys of Neverland from Peter Pan. A contemporary without the temporary classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are many films about vampires but one that is almost always remembered with a shy smile on the face is definitely The Lost Boys. As one of the best remembered films of the 80s this movie has become part of pop culture and a defining film for that period as it showcases most of what was cool or hip in that decade. While its status as horror classic has a lot to do with the nostalgic factor it's an entertaining film on its own right and its modernization of the vampire myth along with its tongue in cheek humor still make for a charming and funny session of pure mindless entertainment.The movie begins with Lucy Emerson Dianne Wiest as she moves to Santa Clara California with her two teenager sons Michael Jason Patric and Sam Corey Haim after a bitter divorce. In Santa Clara Michael becomes involved with a local gang of bikers who have a dark and mysterious secret while Sam becomes friends with two weird boys who claim that the town is being invaded by vampires and its their mission to get rid of them. As Michael begins to act strange Sam suspects that his brother has become one of the undead and begins to take his friends seriously.Directed by Joel Schumacher The Lost Boys is a movie that effectively combines a cool and attractive look with a simple but entertaining plot resulting in a successful and charming film. The story modernizes classic elements of the vampire myth and adapts it to its time with intelligence and definitely tongue in cheek humor. In fact this selfaware comedy approach is what makes the film enjoyable and it relies more on fun and laughs than in actual scares. The plot is rather simple and lacks some character development but it makes an interesting although also quite simplistic analogy between the troubles of youth and becoming a vampire.Visually the movie looks great although by now it has that dated nostalgic look of a past decade. Still the flamboyant visual composition fits perfectly in the film's time and context and it is one of the films biggest assets. Schumacher's fluid and energetic camerawork makes the movie flow at with a nice rhythm and the movie never becomes dull or boring.The cast is very effective and everyone makes a great job. Corey Haim is remarkably good and while he may not be a good actor in this film he is perfect for the role of Sam. Jason Patric is less lucky and he is overshadowed by the very talented Kiefer Sutherland who steals every scene with his charm and presence. Jami Gertz gives a somewhat forgettable performance but veterans Dianne Wiest and Edward Herrmann are both excellent in their roles and have some funny lines.The Lost Boys suffers a lot from its own selfreferential nature it looks old and severely dated by now even when it's 20 years ago when it was released for the first time. The cleverly written plot is very entertaining but somehow the lack of character development and the comedy take on the story make it to never reach its full potential. The premise is quite interesting but the Lost Boys theme is never fully explored leaving at a nice but a bit shallow experience.Definitely most of the charm of The Lost Boys is due to nostalgia as the movie is now basically a time capsule of the 80s. However it is hard to deny that despite being what one would call a popcorn movie in its time it was an intelligent original and fresh take on vampires. While it may not be a landmark of horror of a lifechanging experience The Lost Boys is one of those films that will definitely deliver what they promise a healthy dose of mindless entertainment.".

The only thing i was sure wouldn't age was the soundtrack and of course it hasn't.So for anyone who wants to see how a vampire movie should be made check this out it is still one of the best around.810 Brilliant".

	schema:reviewBody "Corey Haim is excellent for once in this Joel Schumacher comedyhorror.There are two gangs which run the boardwalk of Santa Carla at night. One is a lawless bunch of wannabe bikers the other is a bloodthirsty group of vampires boys. This movie omits the gag war which ensues throughout the literary work but still manages to be a lovable and highlyliked production.In my opinion the reason behind this huge likability of this comedyhorror by the man who killed Batman Yes this is the same man who directed Batman 3  4 is the casting. In all fairness to Mr. Schumacher he also directed Bad Company which I found absolutely delightful and Phone Booth which I found compelling and highly entertaining.These actors were perfectly cast in their roles which lent a most endearing quality and a sense of something right to this endeavor which lacks in so many others. Like Batman 3  4. The soundtrack was perhaps the true star of this production as it was literally the best part of the movie. However the performances were professional witty and realistically offered by these veteran actors.Another element omitted from this work is the fact that Grampa was a veteranretired Vampire Hunter which explains his fortuitous entry at the end of this movie.This starstudded cast each did hisher part to lend to this work a complete believability inside this dark fantasy. Some critics have labeled this movie as pure camp and while the Frog Brothers did lend a campy element to this production the movie itself was of a good quality and deserves the recognition and following it enjoys. Their manes Edgar and Alan Frog are an obvious alludiation to Edgar Alan Poe and is thereby acceptable camp as the homagic element in its purest form.Some of the scenes found within are quite compelling dramatic and portrayed with veteran talent ie the scene where David Keefer Sutherland opens the ancient ornate bottle containing the blood from which Michael must drink. It is perhaps the most compelling scene found within this movie. There are some edgeofyourseat moments good sound comedic elements and an otherwise all around solid story to be found here.The sets were excellent the effects were horrifically believable and the characters were well developed enough as to give the audience a good dose of concern for the principal participants. The addition of Laddie on the milk carton shows the level of detail and care given to this attempt and again the soundtrack just adds so much as the songs are fitting and right with each scene carrying the audience from one scene to the next in smooth dissolves. Very well done.I found the love interest between Michael and Star to be sweet desperate and tragic as I believe it was meant to be. The fact that she chose to make love to Michael rather than feed from him was significant within the story line as was Max's asking for Michael's invitation before he would enter the house and as was Grampa's distasteful curl of the lip at Max's doing so.Very well done production which highly deserves the kudos it's been given. I cannot say this movie was scary but it was suspenseful funny heartwarming creative and extremely regaling. A remake would be in order I think within the next 10 years or so. It would be nice to expound on the gang wars a bit more and give a better character treatment to Grampa in this one. And even though I am a fan of this original work a little more true horror and less comedy would not hurt my feelings in the least. Although it will be very hard in my opinion to recast the role of Sam. This again in my opinion was Haim's best portrayal in any role to date.It rates an 8.910 from...the Fiend .".

	schema:reviewBody "It was the late 2000s and the inexplicable Twilight frenzy had descended in all its sparkling fullforced madness. I'm sure we all remember the ensuing scramble to vault onto the paranormal bandwagon and how quickly the media became glutted with all things supernatural. So it goes without saying that when my mom dragged out a vampire movie I wasn't thrilled.But I guess that's just another example why people go around saying Mother knows best.The vampire movie was director Joel Schumacher's 1987 film The Lost Boys and it's now one of my favorite movies. Despite the fact that it's over thirty years old and has been followed by a tidal wave of movies and books on the same subject The Lost Boys remains a fresh unique take on vampire lore.Unlike many recent paranormal stories the film doesn't try to turn its subject completely on its head in order to carve out an original place for itself. The vampires are dangerous careless and strangely magneticin keeping with their roots. However they've also been updated given a modern edge. Rather than stuffy Transylvanians skulking in castles they're a motorcycle gang racing around the cliffs of California. Instead of redlined capes they wear leather and piercings.The film opens with brothers Michael played by Jason Patric and Sam Corey Haimplus their mommoving to California to live with their grandfather. Their mother begins seeing a new man and Michael the older brother soon falls in with the aforementioned motorcycle gang. Meanwhile Sam passes his time with comic books. At the local comic shop he meets two boys his own age. They introduce themselves as the Frog brothers and warn him that the area has a vampire problem explaining that they're vampire hunters.Sam doesn't exactly take their words to heart but before long he needs to. The motorcycle gang pressures Michael into drinking from a bottle of wine as an initiation rite. He downs it without realizing it's actually blood. However because he hasn't killed anyone yet he only becomes a halfvampire. With some help from the Frog brothers Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander Sam and Michael learn that Michael's vampirism will be reversed if they kill the leader of the vampire gang Kiefer Sutherland.Plenty of great story elements follow. There's a little bit of something for everyone plot twists action romance humorand even water guns filled with holy water. For me however one of the most compelling things is the dynamic between Sam and Michael. It's never heavyhanded or all that sentimentalNo chick flick moments as Supernatural's Dean Winchester famously insistedbut the brothers' relationship is at the core of the movie. Their bonds with their mother and grandfather are also fleshed out giving the film a strong familycentric backbone. Then of course there are the vampires the eternally young lost boys the title refers to. For quite a while now it's seemed like vampires have progressively been getting watered down. This one strolls through sunlight. This one's actually a really nice guy if you give him a chance. That one drinks from Bambi for Pete's sake. After being bombarded by all that I was relieved to find vampires who could be menacing again. My only complaint is the relationship between Michael and another of the halfvampires a girl named Star. While she's the one who gets him involved with the gang in the first place I don't feel like their relationship adds anything to the movie. It seems more the studio tossed it in because they felt like a potential Hollywood hit would need some romance in the mix. However I think that time could've been put to better use by focusing it more on the vampires themselves or on brothers' relationship with each other or with their grandpa. All in all this is one of my goto favorites for recommendations or movie nights. The horror action and humor strike a great balance and aside from the '80s hair and some of Sam's fashion choices this one stands the test of time beautifully. If nothing else it's a blissful reprieve from all the sparkling and humanity of today's vampiresa nod to tradition without bending backwards for it. I recommend this film as the vampire movie for anyone who's sick of vampire moviesbecause that's exactly what it was for me.".

It's a movie that has a flair for comedy and thrills as well as a surprisingly exciting story. This movie doesn't waste anytime with its fastpace. The movie's comical dialog is quotable good! Joel Schumacher does a splendid job directing this movie giving it a wonderfully slick look and a sexual vibe. The special FX are quite good as well the climax of the movie being especially spectacular. The Lost Boys also has an awesome rock soundtrack the Gerard McMann song 'Cry Little Sister' is a great theme for this movie and the Echo and the Bunnymen cover of 'People are Strange' is a perfect touch.The cast is a true highlight. Jason Patric is both attractive and convincing as a teen who is fighting the urge to bite! Kiefer Sutherland may look like he just jumped off of MTV but he makes for a great villain as the leader of the vamp thugs. Jami Gertz is good as a young lady who has fallen in with the gang. Corey Haim provides some comic relief as our young hero who's trying to save his big brother. Dianne Wiest is great as the boys mother as is Corey Feldman as a local kidvampire hunter! Barnard Hughes is a hoot as the grandfather who delivers one funny conclusion for this movie.The Lost Boys is great fun all the way and remains one of the most stylish modern vamp movies around. Defanatly worth checking out. 12 out of ".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie came out when I was like six years old.  Here is a brief little plotsummary  Michael and Sam are two teenage brothers who are moving with their recently divorced mother to Sante Carlo California to stay with their eccentric grandfather.  It is clear from the get go that Sante Carlo is an anything but normal town.  This is explained by shots of the people while a cover of the Doors' People are Strange plays over the opening credits.  Within a few days Michael has already found the wrong girl and hooked up with the wrong crowd.  Pretty soon he's hanging out litteraly all night and sleeping all day.  Sam being the comic freak that he is knows that's something is up and finds assistance by a coupla dorks who claim to be vampire killers.  How would I describe this film?  Entertaining.  Pure and simple.  It is the definitive style over substance flick and that is just fine by me.  This movie is all about entertaining the viewer and nothing else. Over the last thirteen years I have seen this movie probably about thirty times and it has yet to get old.  It is also a great time capsule of the 80s.  There is a highly polished look to the whole thing the music is awesome and the good looking cast doesn't hurt.  When you watch this today you might find some things to be hilarious.  For example that singer on stage with the oiled biceps playing the sax.  Watch that scene with a few friends and you might find that the laughter is highly contagious.  I would have to say that my favorite character would be the grandfather.  He had the best oneliners in the movie and his prescence alone kept me laughing.  I also think that this is one of Corey Feldman's best movies.  He didn't have a whole lot of screen time but he did give a fun convincing performance and it would be cool to reunite the two Coreys for a sequel. If you are one of the few people who have yet to see this you're missing out.  This is what great horror flicks should be. Pure fun.".

It is by far one of the best vampire movies ever made. It had it all. The Corey's Kiefer Sutherland Jason Patric Alex Winter and beautiful Jami Gertz. I've had my own copy of this movie for years now but I still watch it if it comes on tv late at night. That's the only real way to watch a pearl like this!";

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a cult classic that many seem to either love or hate. Personally I'm' sort of somewhere in the middle. Overall it was a decent enough film but it is unfortunately bogged down by the atrocious performance of main actor Jason Patrick. I haven't seen his other work and I understand that this was an early role for him but it was literally one of the worst performances I've ever seen. His mother played by Dianne West was equally annoying as the timid victimtype mother who let people walk all over her. Corey Haim was surprisingly entertaining as Michael's little brother while Feldman and his onscreen brother who may as well have just been a mannequin are selfproclaimed vampire hunters who have never even seen a vampire before. The best performance in the film came from Kiefer Sutherland which should come as no surprise to those familiar with his other work. The only other really notable performance was that of the late Edward Herrmann as Max.This film does have it's funny moments but I found they were just funny enough to make me let out a quick chuckle. The vampires are cool but they are not revealed in their full glory until late in the film which I found a bit disappointing mainly because the rest of the film just isn't strong enough on it's own. There is also an attempt at a romance plot between Michael and Star Jami Gertz but it starts up like nothing and has absolutely zero substance to it.Some may say I'm taking the movie too seriously and I understand it's supposed to be silly but I honestly didn't think it was that funny overall. It kind of felt like the sort of movie you watch while having like a drunken movie night with your buddies. I give this film a 610.PS The title of this review will make sense if you decide to watch the film.".

Sure it's predictable at times and most of the actionhorror clichs manage to warm their ways into the mix but you'll be smiling the whole way through.

The final battle scene was well done too very fun to watch. Directing and scenery were top notch especially at the scene where Michael is 'turned' with the fog and lighting outside. The motorbike race on the sand was very cool. Overall the entire package has a vintage 80s sort of feel freeriding and hardhitting not a care in the world.This is one of those films you revisit every now and then for an enjoyable viewing rather then a spiritual voyage.

The film successfully walks the tightrope between schlockhorrorcomedy young adult romanceadventure family movie and talent showcase. And there is no gore! Like most of Schumaker's work Lost Boys is very Hollywood. Unlike most of the subsequent vampire films however Lost Boys very rarely takes itself seriously. Though most of the film's humor is pretty dated it essentially hybridizes Ferris Bueller's day off and Interview with the Vampire.Corey Haim and Jason Patric are two brothers who have just moved with their mom Rachel Weist to a new boardwalk town. Michael Patric wastes no time getting himself mixes up with a mysterious beauty Jami Gertz and her hive of vampires who literally hang out in a ruined hotel nestled within the San Andreas Fault. Meanwhile his brother Haim has met a pair of ca. 9yearold wannabe vampire slayers. Kiefer Sutherland and Jason Patric give particularly strong performances and really drive most of this film.The cinematography is very good and quite consistent with the film's tongueincheek approach. The script is economical and appropriate though a bit dated. The editing is fine. Schumaker is Schumaker and if your familiar with him you know what you're going to get in his films  wellpaced economical entertainment designed for a big budget which blends Hollywood formulae with big name talent and an at least halfthoughtout plot. In other words Schumaker always at least tries to give a lot of bang for your buck. The formula works here and in my opinion more than it usually does. Unlike most modern gothics Lost Boys uses special effects and make up very sparingly. It is refreshing to see a horror film without CGI and vats full of cow blood. However the film is fairly dated and not all that original similar in style and story to Return of the Living Dead among others. Still it's a better film than it deserves to beand one of my toprated from Schumaker.".

	schema:headline " A transcendent nostalgic pervasively hilarious experience";
	schema:reviewBody "I have been waiting for the right time to review this film. I did not feel until today that I was truly ready to say all I had to say about director Rob Reiner's unforgettable staple of 1980s pop culture. When I first saw The Princess Bride I was only 7 years old and hardly cognizant of film as anything but a pastime. While I remember the movie as being enjoyable I did not have anywhere near as strong a liking or appreciation for it as I do now. I certainly did not remember the film as a theatergoing experience and recently I got the chance to view it on the big screen with at least fifty others in attendance at a midnight screening.Personally I am one of those people who by nature absorbs memorable quotes and by that token the entirety of The Princess Bride is fair game. As I sat there watching I could always hear somebody if not more than one person at least whispering along with the movie under his or her breath. Meanwhile I noticed that there was a wide disparity of age groups. There were preteens teens people in their twenties thirties and some that looked well past forty. If the showing had not been at midnight I do not doubt that there would have been prepreteens as well.With a screenplay written by William Goldman based on his book The Princess Bride is a classic familiar story of a princess her true love and the forces that come between them. As is evidenced by those in attendance this is a story for all ages. The manner in which this fairytale part of the story is executed by Goldman and Reiner is memorable enough to make this a great film. As any fan of the movie will tell you however it is the film's whimsical irreverent pervasive tongueincheek antics that make it an unqualified masterpiece.If you hang around people who love this film do not be surprised if they react to unbelievable situations with the exclamation Inconceivable! Likewise if you tell them to just wait a minute don't be thrown aback when they suddenly sport a Spanish accent in saying I hate waiting. And if you suddenly from out of nowhere hear Hello.my name is Inigo Montoya.you killed my father.prepare to die don't worry. It's not your fault and you're not going to die.While The Princess Bride has the sort of satirical edge more geared towards adults the film is equally effective as a pure fairytale and for this reason there is a little something for everyone. In addition the film enacts a selfreferential tribute to the power and beauty of fairytale stories even in the current age in which many consider them archaic and obsolete.A sick grandson Fred Savage who is spending his time mindlessly playing video games of the nostalgic Atari 8bit type gets a visit from his grandfather portrayed through a wonderful performance from Peter Falk. To the grandson's dismay his elder has brought a book to read to him. When he expresses disapproval at his grandfather's oldfashioned ways the grandfather's response is When I was your age television was called books. Even this quote stands out as resonant and memorable.The grandson starts out expressing skepticism and boredom but of course as the reading of the story progresses this gradually gives way to captivation and praise. Buttercup Robin Wright in her breakthrough role is a fairhaired stunningly gorgeous maiden who has been engaged to the smug cowardly Humperdinck Chris Sarandon the prince who rules over the land of Florin. She of course does not love him and she has been without joy since her true love a farm boy named Wesley Cary Elwes was reportedly murdered on the seas.Of course without Wesley there is no story of true love and we know that he must miraculously return to her someday. This happens through an extraordinary and increasingly hilarious set of circumstances. A group of three bandits kidnap Buttercup with the intent of killing her to precipitate a war between Florin and its enemy Guilder. These three are in order of increasing stature the intellectually pompous Vizzini Wallace Shawn the Spanish swordsman Inigo Mandy Patinkin and the bighearted slowwitted giant Fezzik the late Andre the Giant in one of the most nobrainer casting decisions in all of film history.During the kidnapping however a mysterious man in black closes in on the trail of the three abductors and it is this man who takes on each of the three one by one in battles of skill strength smarts and of course deliciously witty repartee. There is something unusually extraordinary about these battles however.With the exception of Vezzini the abductors are not villains as we might initially perceive them to be. The marvelously choreographed swordplay between the man in black and Inigo and the hilarious absurdity of the handfight with Fezzik are not at all about winning or losing. They embody a sense of honor sportsmanship and nobility that is rarely exemplified in competition both fictional and real.Inigo Fezzik and the man in black do not display their skills pretentiously or flauntingly. Instead they take a strong sense of inner pride in the subtle mastery of their arts. As a result when we see them engage in competition there is not a sense of enmity but a wonderful air of camaraderie.Also included in the mix are a sadistic count Christopher Guest with an odd physical characteristic and a penchant for pain an albino Mel Smith with a stuffy throat the deadly wrath of an R.O.U.S. and a clergyman Peter Cook who makes Elmer Fudd seem eloquently spoken. Most memorable perhaps is the appearance of Billy Crystal and Carol Kane as the miracleman Max and his wife. It has been reported that in the middle of filming this scene Reiner was forced to leave the set because Crystal's improvisations were causing him to laugh to the point of being sick.Regarding the film's casting every single choice without exception is absolute perfection. Cary Elwes not only easily looks the part of a daring ingenious hero but as an actor he has an incredible gift for a subtle mixture of drama and comedy one that easily coincides with the film's sensibilities. Robin Wright easily essays the role of the headstrong princess endlessly devoted to her love with a convincing British accent despite her American origins.For the scene of swordplay Elwes and Patinkin had to study fencing for months which is impressive but onscreen I had no trouble believing that they were characters who had studied for at least several years. Despite his limited acting ability wrestler Andre the Giant is perfect for the role of Fezzik and something would be lost with any other actor in his place. And of course Wallace Shawn is endlessly amusing to watch as the diminutive perpetually exasperated Vezzini.We also don't have to hear Christopher Guest and Chris Sarandon speak any lines to know they are portraying villains. The arrogance callousness and sliminess are readily apparent in their facial and bodily expressions.When all is said and done we have witnessed a wide variety of hilarity captivating acts of love and heroism and of course one of the most satisfying acts of retribution ever put on film one that immortalizes the film's most famous quote and chooses just the right time and placement for the film's sole swear word.For someone who watches this film for the first time and quickly catches on to the film's capricious mix of reverence and satire the film is a marvel to watch simply for the knowledge that you do not know what will come next. Will there be a touching moment? A reflective one? An act of bravado? Or will our expectations be subverted in an act of comical subterfuge? The answer any of them will do as the film has a delectable variety of all of them.From start to finish The Princess Bride is a transcendent magical experience that constantly elicits uproarious laughter and simultaneously immerses the audience in a rich magnificent and almost nostalgic world of folklore that after the end credits roll seems timeless and undying. In the years since its release in 1987 it has grown into a cult film of legendary status and judging by the wide variety of ages I witnessed at the screening as well as the endless barrage of quoting it seems perfectly reasonable to assume that the film will endure for many years to come.".

	onyx:emotionText "I have been waiting for the right time to review this film. I did not feel until today that I was truly ready to say all I had to say about director Rob Reiner's unforgettable staple of 1980s pop culture. When I first saw The Princess Bride I was only 7 years old and hardly cognizant of film as anything but a pastime. While I remember the movie as being enjoyable I did not have anywhere near as strong a liking or appreciation for it as I do now. I certainly did not remember the film as a theatergoing experience and recently I got the chance to view it on the big screen with at least fifty others in attendance at a midnight screening.Personally I am one of those people who by nature absorbs memorable quotes and by that token the entirety of The Princess Bride is fair game. As I sat there watching I could always hear somebody if not more than one person at least whispering along with the movie under his or her breath. Meanwhile I noticed that there was a wide disparity of age groups. There were preteens teens people in their twenties thirties and some that looked well past forty. If the showing had not been at midnight I do not doubt that there would have been prepreteens as well.With a screenplay written by William Goldman based on his book The Princess Bride is a classic familiar story of a princess her true love and the forces that come between them. As is evidenced by those in attendance this is a story for all ages. The manner in which this fairytale part of the story is executed by Goldman and Reiner is memorable enough to make this a great film. As any fan of the movie will tell you however it is the film's whimsical irreverent pervasive tongueincheek antics that make it an unqualified masterpiece.If you hang around people who love this film do not be surprised if they react to unbelievable situations with the exclamation Inconceivable! Likewise if you tell them to just wait a minute don't be thrown aback when they suddenly sport a Spanish accent in saying I hate waiting. And if you suddenly from out of nowhere hear Hello.my name is Inigo Montoya.you killed my father.prepare to die don't worry. It's not your fault and you're not going to die.While The Princess Bride has the sort of satirical edge more geared towards adults the film is equally effective as a pure fairytale and for this reason there is a little something for everyone. In addition the film enacts a selfreferential tribute to the power and beauty of fairytale stories even in the current age in which many consider them archaic and obsolete.A sick grandson Fred Savage who is spending his time mindlessly playing video games of the nostalgic Atari 8bit type gets a visit from his grandfather portrayed through a wonderful performance from Peter Falk. To the grandson's dismay his elder has brought a book to read to him. When he expresses disapproval at his grandfather's oldfashioned ways the grandfather's response is When I was your age television was called books. Even this quote stands out as resonant and memorable.The grandson starts out expressing skepticism and boredom but of course as the reading of the story progresses this gradually gives way to captivation and praise. Buttercup Robin Wright in her breakthrough role is a fairhaired stunningly gorgeous maiden who has been engaged to the smug cowardly Humperdinck Chris Sarandon the prince who rules over the land of Florin. She of course does not love him and she has been without joy since her true love a farm boy named Wesley Cary Elwes was reportedly murdered on the seas.Of course without Wesley there is no story of true love and we know that he must miraculously return to her someday. This happens through an extraordinary and increasingly hilarious set of circumstances. A group of three bandits kidnap Buttercup with the intent of killing her to precipitate a war between Florin and its enemy Guilder. These three are in order of increasing stature the intellectually pompous Vizzini Wallace Shawn the Spanish swordsman Inigo Mandy Patinkin and the bighearted slowwitted giant Fezzik the late Andre the Giant in one of the most nobrainer casting decisions in all of film history.During the kidnapping however a mysterious man in black closes in on the trail of the three abductors and it is this man who takes on each of the three one by one in battles of skill strength smarts and of course deliciously witty repartee. There is something unusually extraordinary about these battles however.With the exception of Vezzini the abductors are not villains as we might initially perceive them to be. The marvelously choreographed swordplay between the man in black and Inigo and the hilarious absurdity of the handfight with Fezzik are not at all about winning or losing. They embody a sense of honor sportsmanship and nobility that is rarely exemplified in competition both fictional and real.Inigo Fezzik and the man in black do not display their skills pretentiously or flauntingly. Instead they take a strong sense of inner pride in the subtle mastery of their arts. As a result when we see them engage in competition there is not a sense of enmity but a wonderful air of camaraderie.Also included in the mix are a sadistic count Christopher Guest with an odd physical characteristic and a penchant for pain an albino Mel Smith with a stuffy throat the deadly wrath of an R.O.U.S. and a clergyman Peter Cook who makes Elmer Fudd seem eloquently spoken.

	schema:reviewBody "There's enough reviews here to show how enjoyable and entertaining this movie is but I had to put my own word in...I simply love this movie. I watched it with my parents when I was very young and have been watching it constantly ever since. It's a movie that I just can't seem to grow tired of. For one I absolutely love the medieval fantasy genre both in books and movies. From a small child I've loved knights castles dragons. the whole sort. This movie quite simply puts the viewer into an imaginative world where everything seems real. Second the characters are so enjoyable to watch you really begin to feel for them  all of them. Even humperdink whose name does him justice gets pity at the end. Lastly the grandfather's list of the qualities of the book at the very beginning are all true... this story has everything. That is why it is such a classic when everything comes down to it. From the moving love story between Wesly and Buttercup to the dynamic and brilliantly scripted duel between the Man in Black and Indigo to even the hilarious bickering from Vezinni to his lovable giant Fezzik... This movie finds a place to include EVERYTHING one can imagine.  The story moves along at a great pace and you feel as though the whole land has been covered when the book is closed. Furthermore the whole conception of using the telling a story approach doesn't taken away from the realism of the story but raises it even more by showing how mesmerized the boy is listening to the tale  just as we are in front of the screen.Maybe it was how I was captivated to the screen watching it as a child... Maybe it was how I'd pop the movie in and turn a boring Sunday afternoon an exciting adventure as I grew up... Or maybe it's how I can sit down with friends and all enjoy the movie together laughing at its funny parts and cheering at it's exciting moments. The movie has a place in my heart and that will never go away. A 10 on the scale and even these words can't begin to tell how much I love this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not exactly sure what exactly it is that makes The Princess Bride such a spectacular film. Or at the very least I just can't pinpoint a single characteristic about it that really rises above all others as the main reason that no one should miss it. Indeed it has a title that should prove to be remarkably uninteresting to the typical action adventure fan okay MALE action adventure fan but even the most diehard Die Hard fan would love this film. It is extremely important not to judge this film just because it has such a flowery and dangerously at the risk of sounding shallow girly name because it is full of wonderful adventure and even some good killing and violence. Does this belong in this kind of romantic comedy? Absolutely! The cover box of the film looks like that of a cheesy romance novel but the film is truly great from start to finish. And indeed the film is very aware of the superficial impression that it leaves and it even presents it directly through Fred Savage's initial response to his grandfather reading him the story. But as the film goes on we begin to have the same reaction that Fred has. We can't get enough. Cary Elwes delivers by far the most outstanding performance of his career as Westley the lovestruck servant to Buttercup a beautiful blonde woman living in a misty romantic fantasy world. Sadly Elwes' later career has been punctuated by roles that do not serve him well especially after such a stunning performance in this role. Liar Liar and Twister come immediately to mind. Robin Wright also gives one of the best performances of her career in her film debut here as Princess Buttercup but the real quality of the performances that makes the movie so great is the fact that they were able to pack the film full of comic relief it was nearly nonstop from start to finish without taking anything away from the tension or the overall respectability of the film. It is interesting to consider the polar opposite effect of the comic relief on the vast majority of the James Bond films. Wallace Shawn is absolutely hilarious as Vizzini the bonehead villain who is completely convinced that he has the whole world figured out Andre the Giant delivers a lumbering but highly impressive performance as Vizzini's enormous idiot sidekick and by far my favorite of all Mandy Patinkin creates one of the most entertaining and likeable characters created in a film in the entire decade of the 1980s My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!'.  This is great stuff. Told as a story read from a book just like The Neverending Story The Princess Bride provides a magical mix of romance and fantasy and action and comedy to provide an enormously entertaining film for moviegoers of all ages.

When Wesley goes away to seek his fortune he is reported to be killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Hearing this really gets Buttercup down and it only gets worse when Prince Humperdink chooses her to be his bride. Hence the title To make a long story short and not give away the ending Buttercup's kidnapped for suspicious reasons and rescued by someone familiar. She's in love and nothing can stop true love! A couple of deaths a would be wedding revenge fulfilled and a couple reunited end this gala of a film. But this doesn't even sum it up I promise! I love this film because it does not take itself too seriously and flows well across the screen. The main characters and their supporting cast are quirky and memorable. You will be repeating classic lines like My name is Inigo Montoya you killed my father prepare to die! over and over again. Through the adventures of Wesley and Buttercup you feel drawn to the characters and fall in love with their ability to amuse you. Do you want to be entertained with a light hearted fantasycomedy? Then head on over to your local video store and pick up a copy. Ready to enjoy? As you wish.".

Every character is a delight and you just want to see more of them.  The Princess Bride is based on the unsurpassed novel by William Goldman who also penned the screenplay. While this is a movie review I cannot recommend the book on which it is based more highly.  It is quite simply the most humorous enthralling fable ever written and will fill in many details that were impossible to include on the screen.

	schema:reviewBody "Cary Elwes Mandy Patinkin and Robin Wright Penn star in this classic fairy tale entitled The Princess Bride. It is based on a novel by William Goldman who also wrote the screenplay. Director Rob Reiner brings life to this story and effectively evokes the enchanting spirit of the witty 1973 novel.The movie opens with a sick boy Fred Savage who receives a visit from his grandfather Peter Falk who intends to read to him from his favorite book. The boy is not exactly pleased to be distracted from his world of video games. However his mood quickly changes as he and the viewer are transported to a place out of time. We are taken to Florin a kingdom in an imaginary land complete with dashing heroes cowardly princes rhyming giants rodents of unusual size fancy swordfights and yes . . . even some kissing.This fairy tale begins on a farm in the countryside. There lives a beautiful young woman named Buttercup Robin Wright Penn who learns that as you wish really means I love you when she falls for her farmhand Westley Cary Elwes. While trying to seek his fortune Westley disappears at sea and becomes an apparent victim of the Dread Pirate Roberts. A few years later Buttercup who is now engaged to Prince Humperdinck Chris Sarandon is kidnapped by a trio of misfits which includes brainsVizzini Wallace Shawn brawnFezzik Andr the Giant and swordInigo Montoya Mandy Patinkin. As they sail away toward the Cliffs of Insanity they notice the pursuit of a man in black. Now begins the adventure . . . .The central idea of The Princess Bride is that true love can conquer all. Throughout the movie there are many hardships and trials that true love must endure. The movie keeps the viewer guessing until the very end whether or not there will be the classic fairy tale ending.This movie is appealing to me because of the classic fairy tale style combined with the witty humor well choreographed action sequences and intense instances of suspense. The characters are well developed and all the actors give an amazing performance which adds to the overall appeal of the movie. The Princess Bride is easily one of my all time favorite movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Princess Bride is one of those rare but very perfect films that everyone once in their life time has seen. Just because it is such a loved film how could you not love it? It has action romance revenge sword fights true love humor friendship etc. I was only 2 when this film was released but I still remember how much I was in love with this film at 4. I would rewind the tape and watch it over and over again the funny thing was my parents wouldn't mind watching it with me it appeals to children as well as adults. I think the reason why this was such a fantastic film was due to the fact that it was the perfect mixture of a fairy tale with humor action and romance. Rob Reiner really knew what he was doing when he made this movie and it all starts with a grandfather simply reading his favorite childhood story to his sick grandson.Buttercup and Wesley are two farm people who eventually fall deeply in love but in order to get money to get married Wesley goes off to find a job and start a life for them. But when Buttercup hears of Wesley's death by pirates she is taken away by Prince Humperdinck who is about to make her his bride. She is then kidnapped by three rebels who wish to start a war with the prince Vizzini Fezzik and Indigo Montoyawho is on a revenge streak to kill the six fingered man who killed his father. But she is saved by an unknown pirate who later reveals himself as Wesley who escaped death but Buttercup is taken once again right as she and Wesley are reunited by Prince Humperdinck. The prince orders to torture Wesley and kill him to keep him away from Buttercup but Wesley ends up being saved by Fezzik and Indigo who will help him save Buttercup.The Princess Bride is a classic film that will never be forgotten. It has classic lines like Hello my name is Inigo Montoya you killed my father prepare to die. And of course INCONCEIVABLE repeated constantly by Vizzini. The acting is perfect and the sets are just amazing. Of course who could forget Billy Cristal and Carol Cane's great performance of the miracle worker and his wife? They were just priceless. Please watch this movie it's one of those movies that's just impossible not to like why not to like it would be inconceivable.1010".

I would recommend it to just about anyone. I've seen it several times and I'm always happy to see it again whenever I have a friend who hasn't seen it yet. I haven't watched it with any kids but I think it has lots for them too. There are wonderful quotes throughout.  I think Mandy Patinkin absolutely steals the scenes he is in as the Spaniard Inigo Montoya bent on avenging his father's death. I gave it 8 out of 10 mainly because it feels very light but I may go back and change to 9 thinking of how happy this movie makes me and it's rewatchability.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Princess Bride has been a film that I've always wanted to watch but never got the opportunity until now Thank you Goodwill!. After finishing the film I can see why it's close to so many people's hearts. Throughout the film I caught myself smiling at moments and bursting with laughter at others. It is a very easy watch. The story's pace is great making the viewer captivated and invested in the characters throughout the entire film. This is done with the help of some fantastically choreographed sword fighting hilarious jokes and an array of diverse characters.Even though I enjoyed this film there are some things I can nitpick. I noticed many continuity errors while watching the film not that it really matters but it was sometimes distracting me from the story. I also felt as though there were times where the plot was too convenient or over the top. This could have been intentional since most child bedtime stories are outlandish but there were scenes such as when they break into the castle that had me scratching my head and saying what the???

	onyx:emotionText "The Princess Bride has been a film that I've always wanted to watch but never got the opportunity until now Thank you Goodwill!. After finishing the film I can see why it's close to so many people's hearts. Throughout the film I caught myself smiling at moments and bursting with laughter at others. It is a very easy watch. The story's pace is great making the viewer captivated and invested in the characters throughout the entire film. This is done with the help of some fantastically choreographed sword fighting hilarious jokes and an array of diverse characters.Even though I enjoyed this film there are some things I can nitpick. I noticed many continuity errors while watching the film not that it really matters but it was sometimes distracting me from the story. I also felt as though there were times where the plot was too convenient or over the top. This could have been intentional since most child bedtime stories are outlandish but there were scenes such as when they break into the castle that had me scratching my head and saying what the???

But it's in the IMDb 'Top 250' so as I manage my viewing to go through that list this one came up in it's proper turn. I'd have to say this one was more than a surprise. It was fairly entertaining and I don't mind saying it had the very best sword fight I've ever seen in any movie which is saying something because I've seen Errol Flynn Tyrone Power and Douglas Fairbanks in action and I don't think any of them could have held their own with either Dread Pirate RobertsFarm Boy Westley Cary Elwes or Inigo Montoya Mandy Patinkin. Now there could have been some special effects involved there but if so it wasn't transparent. Those two put on quite a show.The story also had a few pretty cool concepts like the shrieking eels and the Cliffs of Insanity. The Fire Swamp and the Lightning Sand were kind of original too. The convoluted turn of phrase that old Vizzini Wallace Shawn engaged in trying to outwit the Dread Pirate was pretty amusing and if you try to keep up with it you'll be hopelessly lost so best not even to try. It was also neat to see Andre the Giant in the film one of the wrestling world's all time favorites. Interesting but when he spoke he sounded kind of normal unlike his incharacter TV interviews where he had a much more guttural and heavily accented voice.With all that going on it's easy to forget that the Princess Bride tale is a story within a story as a grandfather Peter Falk attempts to carry on a long family tradition of reading a favorite book to his grandson Fred Savage. It doesn't sound very favorable at the outset with the romance and the 'eeeuw' kissing but the kid warms up to the story when it sounds like there will be some action and adventure. If I had to come up with a minor nitpick it seemed like the picture got a bit more slapstick in the final third of the movie. Otherwise the humor was well placed and I thought it made for fine family fare.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.I know I picked the most quotable line of this epic fairy tale sorry for being such a clich but it was honestly the scene I enjoyed the most in this movie. Rob Reiner's The Princess Bride is one of his most revered films and it has become a cult favorite over time. I didn't fall in love with it however but I can understand the appeal this romantic fantasy has on so many people considering it has it all a tale of true love adventures involving pirates swordfights fantasy creatures and a princess who is forced to marry against her will. The premise is no different from that of your typical damsel in distress fairy tale but the way the film seems to be mocking and honoring those familiar elements at the same time are what makes it stand out. It has a unique innocent quality to it while remaining funny charming and sweet. Perhaps I would've benefited from watching this at a younger age but having waited so long to experience it for the first time was a bit of an underwhelming experience. I wasn't swept away by its magical and fantastic elements and the love story didn't stand out from other romantic tales. There are several fun scenes and unexpected character interactions but during most of the film I felt a bit bored. The satire works in parts and so does the fantasy but it just felt too familiar to win me over entirely. The screenplay was adapted by William Goldman from his own novel of the same name. Although for this film he uses a grandfather Peter Falk to narrate the story as he is telling it to his sick grandson Fred Savage. At first the grandson isn't too keen about having his grandpa read him a story especially because it starts off with kissing but once the adventure begins he's hooked. There are occasional interruptions that bring us back to the kid's room but most of the film takes place in this fantasy land where we are introduced to a very beautiful woman named Buttercup Robin Wright who falls in love with her farm boy Westley Cary Elwes. The two have found true love but having no money to marry he embarks on a trip and promises to return to her. Buttercup is shattered when she hears that Westley was killed by a fearful pirate named Roberts. With nothing more to look forward to eventually she gets engaged with Prince Humperdinck Chris Sarandon of Florin who promises to turn her into a princess. On the eve of her wedding Buttercup is kidnapped by a man named Vizzini Wallace Shawn and his two hired henchmen Inigo Montoya Mandy Patinkin a skilled swordsman who has promised to avenge his father's death and the strong but gentle giant Fezzik Andre the Giant who really doesn't know no better. While holding Buttercup ransom and fleeing from the site they discover that they are being followed by a mysterious man in a black mask. He catches up with them soon and the adventure begins as these men face off with one another and new revelations are made.Allowing for the story to take place through this narrative style was one of the better decisions because it gave the film its unique dreamy style and it wasn't necessary to deliver realistic visuals. It was all part of the fantasy although I would've preferred less interruptions but I guess they had to give Fred Savage and Peter Falk some more lines. The relationship between Elwes and Wright was believable but it didn't stand out because it was too familiar. However they were both the perfect casting choice for these roles. It was Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya who stole the movie for me. I absolutely loved his character and the sword fighting scene was the highlight of the movie for me. It included a brilliant homage to Douglas Fairbanks which I'm sure gave someone the idea that Elwes would be the perfect choice to spoof his Robin Hood character in a later movie. Montoya was probably the inspiration for Antonio Banderas as well when he was cast to play the Zorro. This character has become an icon and he was the saving grace of the film for me. The rest of the characters were OK but he stood out. The exception and I think I'm in the minority here was Vizzini. I found Wallace Shawn's portrayal of him rather irritating and I couldn't stand him. There is also a hilarious scene with Billy Crystal playing a miracle doctor who you'd only recognize due to his voice because he is heavily covered in make up to look like an old man. The Princess Bride had its strong moments but somehow I never managed to fall in love with the fantasy and wouldn't consider it one of Reiner's best films. It does prove however what a versatile director he is because the film is very different from his other works. I'm still a bit shocked that the film is so widely loved but I can't argue it isn't a good movie. httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

The colors are nicely saturated in most scenes it has 5.1 Dolby Digital sound and there are lots of extras including one of the better making of specials. One of my favorite actors is Mandy Patinkin and here he is great as the Spanish swordsman seeking revenge for his father's death at the hand of the sixfingered swordsman played by Christopher Guess. This was Robin Wright's first film as a 19yearold playing Buttercup. Cary Elwes is also perfect as her love interest. Andre the Giant who died in 1993 at age 45 was so fitting in his role as the giant. Overall a fine cast and a fine entertaining funny film. A comic fairy tale in a strange land as read to a child.The moral of the film True love conquers everything.  How could anyone dislike such a story??".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't have this theory about The Princess Bride for years until I came close to the age of the grandfather that Peter Falk portrays.Here's my theory. The grandfather goes to the bedside of his grandson portrayed by Fred Savage prepared to do what grandfathers do  read him a story. But no the grandson protests. Does it have sports in it? This is a silly yucky story full of kissing. Skip the kissing parts! So the grandfather decides to teach the grandson a lesson the beginning of my theory. He takes what was probably a straightforward tale of love lost and found again of giants and evil princes and rescues and magic spells and embellishes it with the wisdom that can only come from living sixty years on this planet. Because let's face it The Princess Bride as we are told has much wisdom in it.What are the chances that a story that has been around for a hundred years has lines such as You fell victim to one of the classic blunders  the most famous of which is never get involved in a land war in Asia. Only somebody who lived through the Vietnam War era the grandfather would come up with this. Too bad Dubya wasn't read this book as a child. Then there is the bit about the Dread Pirate Roberts  an unseen villain who turns out to be a series of villains. He would tuck Wesley into bed each night after he captured him and say Good night Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning. What other sentence so captures the sentiment of working for large corporations these days who will throw you out into the street without a backwards glance? The book hits how people believe something is real or not real based merely on their feelings about it with this zinger as Wesley carries the princess through a dangerous swamp. She cautions him about the ROUS's Rodents of Unusual Size. Wesley's defense  I don't think they exist. One immediately attacks.And finally a great quote about love. An angry Prince Humperdinck after being rejected by Buttercup goes to where Wesley is about to be tortured and states You truly love each other and so you might have been truly happy. Not one couple in a century has that chance no matter what the storybooks say. Only after kissing frogs for decades can I say this is so true. And on it goes.Thus most of the wisdom of living modern life can be found in this tale within a tale and I highly recommend it for its humor its wisdom and uniqueness. I don't think I've seen anything quite like it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is on the higher end of 'meh'. It's seen as something of a comedy classic today and I can see how in 1987 it probably felt very fresh and as such received a very positive response. I'd have probably enjoyed it more if I'd seen it then. But I just don't think it holds up  it's not terrible by any means but I don't think it's quite as good as people seem to remember it as being.So it's a fantasycomedyadventure that obviously doesn't take itself too seriously. As such the plot is fairly predictable and the characters largely played for laughs  which is fine  but I don't think it's actually done consistently well. There are definitely some funny moments but I think I only laughed properly three times in this film. Partially I think it's because that by now we've seen this kind of comedy a lot again at the time I'm sure it was a lot newer and fresher and moved on from comedy based around the fact that apparently Spanish accents are funny here's looking at you Fawlty Towers.It looks really cheap and yes I appreciate it's nearly 30 years old but a lot of films made in the 80s even in the 70s had better effects and sets than this. There isn't really any ambition with the world it's set in  it's very dull and stereotypical and it doesn't really fit with the fact that this is supposed to be a kooky original world. The guy who played the Spaniard aside I just don't think it was acted very well either. The female lead especially is wooden and there was absolutely nothing even comedic to her character or given in her performance. I couldn't really get into the 'story within a story' element either  the granddad telling the story to his grandchild is shown for about 10 minutes and there's nothing to it  I just kept asking myself why? Why did they choose this setup? It doesn't help the overall flow of the film in any way and just seemed like an odd choice.As I said there were a few good laughs but not enough for me to want to see this again any time soon. It has its fans but I think a lot of them need to remove the nostalgic veneer of their memory of this film and come back now and watch it. A warning you may be disappointed. 610.".

In the dinner scene at the Hotel Gay Schluffen Nick Rivers played by Val Kilmer and this may be the best thing he's ever done American rock star is told that he needs a jacket to eat in the dining room but the restaurant will provide one. In the next scene we can see him in the background having a jacket tailormade! The reason it's hard to catch is that there's exposition going on in the foreground a ZAZ trademark. It's funny but the amazing thing is that I've seen this movie many times over a period of something like 20 years and I'd never noticed that before.I believe that this is one of the marks of a great spoof that you can watch it many times and still pick up jokes you've never noticed before. Like ZAZ's other masterworks this one is packed with hilarious oneliners and sight gags. Watch for the scene in the Swedish bookshop that's filmed backwards the way the verses to the East German National Anthem keep getting longer and longer when translated into English and the scene where an unfortunate agent is crushed inside a car and what happens with him afterwards!. And this doesn't even scratch the surface. If Top Secret! isn't ZAZ's funniest movie it's only because it has such strong competition. The men were comedic geniuses when they were together.Val Kilmer was hilarious as Nick Rivers and the movie has a strong supporting cast including Lucy Gutteridge as Nick's love interest Hillary I wonder how Ms. Clinton would feel if she knew her name means She whose bosoms defy gravity? Christopher Villiers as Nigel her exboyfriend they spent some time stranded on a deserted island together and Jeremy Kemp as the evil General Streck. Also look out for Peter Cushing Omar Sharif and Ian McNiece hilarious as a spy whose cover is selling souvenirs novelties and party tricks. And watch out for the French resistance who knows what they're doing in East Germany? each one of whose names is a pun on a French word or phrase Chocolate Mousse Deja Vu etc.The plot? Does it matter? Something about the East Germans planning to take over the world while everybody's paying attention to an international cultural show they're putting on Nick is the American representative and the spies who are trying to stop it. But that's not the point the point is the comedy and I could go on and on about the many hilarious jokes but I'm not going to let me just say without ruining anything that the funniest scenes in the movie involve a cow.It's usually overlooked curiously enough when talking about the great comedies but there's no doubt about it Top Secret!

When they meet him they discover that Nigel Christopher Villiers was Hillary's first lover. Further they learn that there is a traitor in the resistance. Who might be the traitor?Top Secret is a very funny comedy by Jim Abrahams and David Zucker. The plot is a parody to World Was II movies with the French resistance and it is impossible not laughing along the adventures of Nick Rivers in the East Germany. Val Kilmer steals the movie wit ha magnificent performance and singing most of the songs. In the end time is cruel to everyone. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Top Secret  Super Confidencial Top Secret  Super ConfidentialNote On 24 Sep 2017 I saw this film again.".

The plot is a parody to World Was II movies with the French resistance and it is impossible not laughing along the adventures of Nick Rivers in the East Germany. Val Kilmer steals the movie wit ha magnificent performance and singing most of the songs. In the end time is cruel to everyone. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Top Secret  Super Confidencial Top Secret  Super ConfidentialNote On 24 Sep 2017 I saw this film again.";

	schema:reviewBody "Following the popular success of Airplane! and its less acclaimed sequel the ZAZ trio was back to what I believe to be the funniest comedy ever Top Secret! a hilarious parody of the WWII spy films and the 5060's rockthemed movies. Speaking of rock'n'roll one of the most defining songs of the film performed by Val Kilmer aka Nick Rivers is titled How Silly Can you Get? which sounds like a selfreflexive motto.Top Secret! probably features the highest laughsoutloudperminute ratio from any movie as there is not one single moment where the action isn't punctuated by a gag and that this very gag doesn't work. Everything in Top Secret! is both hilarious on an anarchic and cathartic level in the way it plunges you into a neverending positive mindset. You may say that this is the very principle of a comedy what's more a spoof movie but it seems like Top Secret! has been specially concocted for pure and genuine amusement and while the much more respected Airplane! has its slower moments especially during the flashback parts Top Secret! was hilarious from A like Abrahams to Z like Zucker brothers.There are two kinds of gags in Top Secret! the direct and the indirect one. The direct is immediate mostly visual and slapstick like a find him and kill him stamp or a sunbathing girl leaving boobholes in the sand. The best gags are extended and feature a lot of dancing like the ball scene the outrageous ballet sequence or a feetview panic scene. Anyway whether it's an offensive national anthem a singing horse a little German an overhilarious moment when Nick is about to be executed and an old lady slowly approaches to pick up the phone any attempt to list the audiovisual gags of the film is as ludicrous as trying to define which is the funniest. The indirect gag is the elaborated one already funny by itself but leading to a much more delightful punchline.The first one involves a weird shot illustrating the road taken by Nick Rivers and his manager the map looks more and more familiar until PacMan makes his appearance the very gag that sets the tone of the film. When Omar Sharif as Agent Cedric meets a colleague disguised as a party tricks vendor the whole interaction is funny enough but the icing on the cake comes with the You dropped your phony dog pooh an item which obviously is not sold. The gag works even more because we expect it like when Nick is introduced to the French Resistance what would you expect from a man named Dj Vu apart from Have we not met before? It could have concluded here yet the French sounding names punchline was with the black guy named 'Chocolate Mousse which says a lot about an era where anything was acceptable in the name of pure comedy.I don't mean to be too analytical but my regard for Top Secret! is due to one of the two funniest and creative gags from any film starting with the Swedish bookstore sequence a cinematic achievement that would have made Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin proud. During that part there is a gradual suspicion that we're not watching a normal scene even for a spoof movie there is something weird in the walking and the talking that gets funnier as it is more noticeable the scene becomes hilarious when we get the point and yet it goes on and on a book getting in the right place immediately dust from ear to mouth and finally Nick and Hillary 'sliding up' a pole. The sequence goes from funny to not funny anymore until it becomes funny again with the throw away gag of the puppy going backwards leaving the Swedish bookstore owner in a priceless doubted expression.The other and maybe more memorable one as it made it in the poster involves a clever cow disguise that looks like a real cow from our point of view it's simple but someone should have thought about that. Now it became a comedic landmark used in many comedies when a guy disguise as an animal inopportunely choosing the female one and invites a male on heat to come on him but back then it was new that even pushed the outrageousness by involving a little veal thirsty for milk the villain's reaction in the disguise is a laughriot. That's the secret of Top Secret! a comedy that doesn't take itself seriously except for its genuine desire to make us laugh. The rest of the gags are as good as it gets and features many fourthwall breaking like when Nick and Hillary feels that the romance makes it's like a bad movie and then they look at us and many film references are made notably one hilarious climax in a subaquatic Western bar and a clever farewell a la Wizard of Oz.Top Secret! is made in such a way that we either enjoy a gag or wait for one to come so there's no time break. The only little pauses are provided by these moments when we can enjoy Val Kilmer's musical performances but the humor is never away. But my enjoyment of the film is proportional to my sadness to see it so often overlooked by the peers and movie viewers playing on anagrams I want to say that TOP SECRET! is a comedy TO RESPECT!. Indeed when I checked the list of AFI's Top 100 Laughs I was surprised not to see Top Secret! listed while Fargo and Jerry Maguire and less 'lol'ling comedies were I'm even surprised that the film is hardly mentioned among the greatest parodies or that it didn't have any nominations for the Golden Globes.Seriously I can't see regarding Top Secret! how funnier can a movie get.".

	schema:headline " ZAZ Blitzkrieghumor";
	schema:reviewBody "In between their most successful films  Airplane Naked Gun and Hot Shots  the ZAZ team modestly spoofed the espionage and conspiracy theory thrillers in Top Secret! The film involves American teen idol Nick Rivers Val Kilmer in his first big screen role attending a culture festival in Nazified East Germany. The festival merely is a coverup for the sinister and evil practices of the Nazis who kidnapped an eminent scientist. Nick quickly interferes in all this and ends up as member of a resistanceparty existing of French dudes with funnysounding names and weird comical habits like drinking gasoline . Remaining loyal to the ZAZ trademarks 'Top Secret!' is one giant running gag and a spitfire of chuckles in which absolutely NOTHING has to be taken seriously. The Europeanminded character of this film provided the writers with the occasion to make fun of the typical French German and Swedish stereotypes and that forms a perfect contrast with the American surfgeneration. As usual in this type of films the widely elaborated jokes miss their target sometimes they even are painfully unfunny but the smaller background slapstick is hilarious and almost causes you a stomach pain from laughing. The open assaults to immensely successful cinema classics like 'the Great Escape' 'Wizard of Oz' or 'The Blue Lagoon' is something you either love or hate but it perfectly reflects the type of overthetop humor these writers want to bring. Val Kilmer does well in his first major role and his youthful charm helps increasing his teenpopstar credibility. Furthermore there are a few delightful small roles for authentic cinema veterans such as Omar Shariff Michael Gough and my personal favorite Peter Cushing. Top Secret isn't Abraham's and the Zucker brother's best work but it's still great entertainment and the quality balances somewhere between 'The Kentucky Fried Movie' and 'Airplane'.".

Remaining loyal to the ZAZ trademarks 'Top Secret!' is one giant running gag and a spitfire of chuckles in which absolutely NOTHING has to be taken seriously. The Europeanminded character of this film provided the writers with the occasion to make fun of the typical French German and Swedish stereotypes and that forms a perfect contrast with the American surfgeneration. As usual in this type of films the widely elaborated jokes miss their target sometimes they even are painfully unfunny but the smaller background slapstick is hilarious and almost causes you a stomach pain from laughing. The open assaults to immensely successful cinema classics like 'the Great Escape' 'Wizard of Oz' or 'The Blue Lagoon' is something you either love or hate but it perfectly reflects the type of overthetop humor these writers want to bring. Val Kilmer does well in his first major role and his youthful charm helps increasing his teenpopstar credibility. Furthermore there are a few delightful small roles for authentic cinema veterans such as Omar Shariff Michael Gough and my personal favorite Peter Cushing. Top Secret isn't Abraham's and the Zucker brother's best work but it's still great entertainment and the quality balances somewhere between 'The Kentucky Fried Movie' and 'Airplane'.";

In either case it didn't go in 50 directions like recent and unbearable spoofs like Scary Movie 2 3 4 etc.Highly recommended for those who do love the 1980's genuine spoofs and booted cows. Make sure you go to the special features on the disc  the deleted are really funny and I'm surprised they were cut and there's an Easter Egg concerning yet another hilarious scene and its original format.

	schema:reviewBody "Don't give me any of that intelligent life stuff give me something I can blow up! Doolittle.Lieutenant Doolittle is in charge of 'Dark Star' a ship on a lonely mission to destroy unstable planets in systems targeted for colonisation. The ship has been on it's mission for twenty years but the crew have only aged three years. Doolittle has been in charge since an explosion killed Commander Powell rendered the sleeping quarters uninhabitable and destroyed the ship's entire supply of toilet paper. In order to deal with the excruciating boredom of the mission and the frustration at having only three other astronauts for company the ship's computer which has an alluringly soothing and sexy female voice pipes in muzak and easy listening jazz. Doolittle misses surfing. Boiler has taken to shooting holes in things. Talby lives in isolation in the the observation dome. Pinback isn't really Pinback not that anyone even cares. Excitement arrives when an asteroid inflicts damage on the ship's systems prematurely activating one of the highly intelligent eager and earnest planet killer bombs. To complicate things the alien needs feeding and Bomb 20 just wants to do its job and is getting increasingly frustrated and belligerent.Bomb are you willing to entertain a few concepts? DoolittleI am always receptive to suggestions! Bomb 20'Dark Star' was made in 1974 initially as a college project and launched the careers of John Carpenter and Dan O'Bannon amongst others Tommy Lee Wallace and Nick Castle long term Carpenter collaborators both worked on 'Dark Star' and the ship's interior and exterior were designed by the great Ron Cobb. From the very start Carpenter's style is evident the widescreen image is utilised to absolute maximum effect without a bit of wasted space on screen the signature electronic music is present throughout with the exception of the cheerfully optimistic trucker song 'Benson Arizona' which serves as title song and the pacing and editing are perfect. The film is not boring for a minute despite the lack of resources. The special effects while cheap and cheerful serve the film perfectly I've always managed to suspend disbelief more easily in the face of cheap practical effects than I have when faced with unconvincing computer generated effects particularly the psychedelic hyperspace sequences. The film as a whole is a tour de force of tricks and gags a veritable 'How To' of practical effects that once staples of cinema are now being superseded by CGI.

It's funny and moving Pinback's video diary is burned in my memory and a groundbreaking movie in 1974 it still feels fresh 31 years later. The product of postVietnam and Watergate era America it still resonates today because in an age of ever smarter bombs and increasingly advanced technology we remain at the mercy of chance and human frailty.It's also the only film in history to feature a man discussing phenomenology with a bomb.

Doolittle.Lieutenant Doolittle is in charge of 'Dark Star' a ship on a lonely mission to destroy unstable planets in systems targeted for colonisation. The ship has been on it's mission for twenty years but the crew have only aged three years. Doolittle has been in charge since an explosion killed Commander Powell rendered the sleeping quarters uninhabitable and destroyed the ship's entire supply of toilet paper. In order to deal with the excruciating boredom of the mission and the frustration at having only three other astronauts for company the ship's computer which has an alluringly soothing and sexy female voice pipes in muzak and easy listening jazz. Doolittle misses surfing. Boiler has taken to shooting holes in things. Talby lives in isolation in the the observation dome. Pinback isn't really Pinback not that anyone even cares. Excitement arrives when an asteroid inflicts damage on the ship's systems prematurely activating one of the highly intelligent eager and earnest planet killer bombs. To complicate things the alien needs feeding and Bomb 20 just wants to do its job and is getting increasingly frustrated and belligerent.Bomb are you willing to entertain a few concepts? DoolittleI am always receptive to suggestions! Bomb 20'Dark Star' was made in 1974 initially as a college project and launched the careers of John Carpenter and Dan O'Bannon amongst others Tommy Lee Wallace and Nick Castle long term Carpenter collaborators both worked on 'Dark Star' and the ship's interior and exterior were designed by the great Ron Cobb. From the very start Carpenter's style is evident the widescreen image is utilised to absolute maximum effect without a bit of wasted space on screen the signature electronic music is present throughout with the exception of the cheerfully optimistic trucker song 'Benson Arizona' which serves as title song and the pacing and editing are perfect.

The story about the humdrum nature of flying in space for an interminable time has several layers peeled in the script.  If I judged the film solely on those merits it would indeed do well.  However the film has a snail's pace and some uneven plot twists not to mention some not very good acting.  Many of Carpenter's  soontobesignature trademarks are clearly evident in this film.  No denying it the man has talent.  The film was made with a shoestring budget but Carpenter and crew do a workmanlike job with the resources they had.

	schema:reviewBody "Opinions vary widely on this one and I can see why.  In the movie's favor is its bizarre energy and atmosphere which makes its melange of scifi horror and comedy intermittently hypnotic.  On the downside are the truly amateurish production values and pathetic acting.  Most of this movie has the look of some longhaired grad film school students with no life shooting a quasihomage to 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY guerilla style in their college dorm in the middle of the night.  Aspects are intriguing though including the alternatively exasperating yet also humorous renegade beach ball monster attacks which are clearly Dan O'Bannon's fledgling version of his later far scarier and cleverer ALIEN screenplay.  The dialogue between the astronauts and the Hal 9000esque bomb is definitely the funniest sequence the movie probably should have been a 20 minute short focusing on this portion rather than a full blown feature length effort with all the other boring subplots which feel tackedon like they decided to extend the movie at some point but couldn't come up with anything resembling an organic structuring to justify it.  Carpenter does come up with interesting solutions to budget problems like creating a fake futuristic elevator by using forced perspective on their dorm room floor and turning the camera on its side.  The effect very nearly works!In all this is probably best viewed as an early failed effort by two talents who went on to bigger and brighter things.  Carpenter's techno music is at its disharmonically buzzy worst here amazing that a mere four years later he would craft the masterful music script and direction for the truly harrowing HALLOWEEN.  That movie bears almost no resemblance to this one and is a testament to how far someone can come in such a short span.  It has to give the worst hack considerable hope along the lines of James Cameron going from PIRANHA II THE SPAWNING to TERMINATOR. If you rent this for 0.99 and go in with no expectations you'll probably still be disappointed but there are a few inexplicably charming moments amidst the mostly boring and monotonously dated peek into the future world of the 1990s by minds of the 1970s.  1.5  4 stars but I still pause on it whenever I stumble onto it on late night cable.".

I will also give this movie credit for originality by having the focus of the last 20 minutes be the crew of The Dark Star trying to talk a sentient bomb out of exploding and does this by teaching philosophy to it arguably that was the number one sentence I didn't think I'd ever utter. But did I like it as a whole?... I'm sorry to say I didn't and it's a damn shame because I think it was overly ambitious and succeeding in the realm of production value even if the effects are wonky at best I'll argue it was their first movie and I personally was not expecting it to be like this even if it's admittedly cheap and has some creative ideas for comedic situations. I'll say watch it if you're a film student and want to see how Dan O'Bannon and John Carpenter got their start or if you're just interested in that check this movie out.".

Despite a couple amusing things like using an ice cream man I would have to say no. What's amazing is I seem to be in the complete minority about this being kind of a suspense thriller mixed with 2001 ideas. The beach ball alien was frightening because of it's cheap and silly appearance just like the doll in Trilogy of Terror and the weirdo creatures in Don't be Afraid of the Dark. Also JC's music is eerie and shows his talent in that area although of course a basic effort. The rest of the film is just a strange incomprehensible take on A Space Odyssey with not a single funny moment. I'm so glad Carpenter learned as he went and blossomed into arguably the best scary movie maker in history. Interesting only to see where he started.

In the end he's in Washington trying to diffuse another terrorist plot. He's amazing. What CAN'T this guy do? Yes it's ludicrous....but it's not meant to be taken seriously folks! It's just entertainment for fans of action movies nothing more.There is a nice twist at the end of this story and it involves a very intriguinglooking woman Francesco Neri. I just love that woman's face very sexy especially for someone her age. She's also in Hannibal but I think the rest of her films are Italian. I would like to see more of her work. There are also some short appearances by two alwaysentertaining actors John Turturro and John Leguizimo. Scharwarznegger's action films usually have a fair amount of tongueincheek humor and those two actors help along those lines in this film.Elias Koteas plays the toogungho FBI guy. Hollywood just will not portray an FBI CIA DEA or any government agent in a positive manner. That would offend their liberal peers in the movie business so Koteas plays the lawman you can't trust in this movie. In fact they make it so you don't know if you can trust anyone in the government which also is typical Hollywood fare.Don't believe the national critics however if they panned this film. It's two hours of good escapist fare.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember a time in the not too distant past when any new movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger was treated as an event.  Nowadays his films slip in and out of town with nary a person even noticing.  What's happened?  The sad but obvious explanation is that as he's aged Arnold has had to make way for younger more dynamic action stars leaving him stuck with leftover crumbs like Collateral Damage' a dull lackluster action film that manages to kick itself into high gear only in its final half hour or so. Collateral Damage' was of course one of those films whose original release date had to be postponed in the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks.  In this case the sensitivity arose as a result of the film's storyline which revolves around a group of Colombian terrorists determined to strike at targets on American soil.  Schwarzenegger plays fireman Gordy Brewer whose wife and child are killed in an explosion at the Colombian consulate in Los Angeles.  Brewer feeling that the U.S. government has little concern with exacting revenge from the terrorist leader responsible for the explosion decides to mount a oneman crusade to see that justice is ultimately done.  The film obviously indifferent to its own need for plausibility sends this virtually unarmed fireman into the unfamiliar jungles of South America to take on what appears to be the entire Colombian police force as well as the guerilla fighters whose actions resulted in the deaths of Brewer's family.  Brewer of course despite his own inexperience and the formidable odds against him manages to talk andor fight his way out of every dire predicament before rescuing his nemesis' wife and their adopted son. There isn't much to say about Collateral Damage' except to report that the film does achieve a certain tension in the closing stretches when Brewer returns to Washington D.C. to help foil a plot to detonate a bomb in that city.  Thanks to a few nice plot twists the film ends up not being a total loss when all is finally said and done.It's never much fun to have to witness an actor in the sunset of his career. But if Schwarzenegger's films don't start improving soon he may well have to switch to that career in politics he has reportedly been looking into between films.".

However I was surprised that in the context that it was used it wasn't too cheesy.I saw a 'behind the scenes' thing on HBO and everyone involved was saying that this was something really different for Arnie.  Why is it that people say that about every movie he's in?  They're all the same!  But that's okay. We're used to it.  In 'End of Days' he played an alcoholic.  We knew this not because we ever saw him drunk but because some one brought it up every ten minutes.  These are things that we've come to accept about Arnold's movies.  So stop telling us that this is something new.At least that's what I've felt for a while now.  This movie is a little different.  It's not a stretch or anything radically different.  But it isn't the exact same thing that Arnold's done before.  It is however the same thing we've seen from other people before.  It seems that he looks at what is popular and he does his version of that.  People like government agents I'll do 'Eraser.'  People like supernatural stuff I'll do 'End of Days.'  What's all this I hear about a movie with a twist at the end being brilliant?  I suppose I'll do 'Collateral Damage.'So is it good?  Is it bad?  It just is.  One thing I am glad about is that is was rated R.  I am sick of movies being cut down to PG13 simply because some people feel that things should be accessible to the family.  Cutting stuff to do that ALWAYS detracts from the quality of a movie.  I've actually heard directors say that they needed to take the energy level down on a scene in order to qualify.  Why would you want to do that?Yes this movie's release was postponed.  We all have our own opinions on that and nothing not even seeing the movie is going to change our minds.One final note Am I the only one who when watching Cliff Curtis can only think You know what I think?  I think you're stealing gold. ?".

Remember?Anyway in Collateral Damage Arnold is actually a vulnerable character. He gets BEAT UP more than he beats up others.  Now while Arnold fans myself included prefer Arnold to be invincible in this case it works really well.  Not just because it moves the story along but also because it makes the protagonist more believable.  Ok sure Arnold saying gracias to some Columbian bus driver is HARDLY believable but I think you know what I mean.You will also find yourself saying who is the REAL villain here? on more than one occasion.  Sure terrorists kill.  That's what they do.  But why do you THINK they became terrorists to begin with?  Collateral Damage touches on the subject briefly  enough to humanize the terrorist leader even!Most of the reviews I've read here have been negative...  But those same reviewers were probably Arnoldphiles who were expecting something along the lines of Commando 2.  As it is personally I really enjoyed Collateral Damage.

	schema:headline " Surprising in more ways than one";
	schema:reviewBody "I chose to rent this movie for a simple reason I was in the mood for something nice and stupid  a nobrainer action flick starring Arnie would perfectly fit that mood. What I got was something else.The story Firefighter loses family in terrorist attack goes on revenge mission to Columbia to find and kill terrorist. Sounds pretty dumb to me  and let's face it a lot of aspects of the movie are incredibly dumb. Mostly those parts of the movie concerned with Arnie getting to Columbia travelling through Columbia and getting into the rebel campBut and here's the catch some are not. What starts out a simple movie with linear plot evolves slowly. After the rage comes a period of reflection. There are twists and turns in the plot and the first half is full of timefilling minutes spent getting to know yetanothercomedic sidekick who will disappear entirely from the movie within minutes couldn't they have stuck with one sidekick? Or not bothered at all? but then as the plot turns around the audience is suddenly faced with an interesting moment which is later ruined by cheesy dialogue. Well this being an action movie the smart bits can last only so long and then it all goes to pieces in a desperate attempt to have a traditional climactic good vs bad battle. So the end is a big letdown.Still the movie IS entertaining apart from a few minutes of boredom and confusion in the Columbia part and surprisingly wellacted. Arnie is no character actor and the mess he made of End of Days was embarrassing. Sixth Day brought some more flexing of acting muscles and I actually liked his performance in that movie. Collateral Damage takes all he learnt and puts it to the test. He will never manage a BruceWillis alike 6th Sense  Unbreakable career turnaround but he acted his role well and was convincing. Mostly at least. The support cast filled with aforementioned comedic sidekicks a CIA agent a FBI agent and the terrorist and a Columbian woman  all do their jobs well. I kept wondering where I'd seen Cliff Curtis before until I looked it up on IMDB  he was the charismatic leader of the Iraqi resistance in Three Kings. Here he manages to dominate the screen just as well and once again is a showstealer. Definitely the most memorable character of the movie.So we have good acting good entertainment stupid action a stupid end and some reasonably intelligent bit somewhere along the way. The body count is high but surprisingly Arnold does not actually kill many people you can count his victims on the fingers of one hand. There is a gruesome scene involving a snake which is basically pointless but that did not reduce my enjoyment of the movie. All in all a good movie to watch. Not brilliant but not as bad as some people may think either.".

	onyx:emotionText "I chose to rent this movie for a simple reason I was in the mood for something nice and stupid  a nobrainer action flick starring Arnie would perfectly fit that mood. What I got was something else.The story Firefighter loses family in terrorist attack goes on revenge mission to Columbia to find and kill terrorist. Sounds pretty dumb to me  and let's face it a lot of aspects of the movie are incredibly dumb. Mostly those parts of the movie concerned with Arnie getting to Columbia travelling through Columbia and getting into the rebel campBut and here's the catch some are not. What starts out a simple movie with linear plot evolves slowly. After the rage comes a period of reflection. There are twists and turns in the plot and the first half is full of timefilling minutes spent getting to know yetanothercomedic sidekick who will disappear entirely from the movie within minutes couldn't they have stuck with one sidekick? Or not bothered at all? but then as the plot turns around the audience is suddenly faced with an interesting moment which is later ruined by cheesy dialogue. Well this being an action movie the smart bits can last only so long and then it all goes to pieces in a desperate attempt to have a traditional climactic good vs bad battle. So the end is a big letdown.Still the movie IS entertaining apart from a few minutes of boredom and confusion in the Columbia part and surprisingly wellacted.

	schema:headline " As an action movie it is poor but as a piece of writing it is shockingly simplistic and tasteless";
	schema:reviewBody "Gordy Brewer is a good clean allAmerican type with a wife and young son and a selfless job as a firefighter. While his wife and daughter wait for him to collect them they are caught up in a terrorist attack and die in the bombing. Brewer's loss turns to guilt turns to anger when he sees the Government involving themselves in political wrangling with Columbia rather than going after the evildoers. With the weight of American moral justice behind him Brewer heads into Columbia to travel deep into the jungles find the terrorist leader and kill him.Those who claim that this film is a tasteless attempt to cash in on 11th September 2001 forget that it was made before that terrorist attack and that it was shelved until a later date  however they are right in their claims that it is tasteless. In regards 11901 the film was sold on the back of American anger and demands for revenge that the film pandered to with little thought  at a time of healing the marketing of this film fed the fire and in return was fuelled by it. It is impossible though not to view this film in regards the subject matter because although not offensively simple in regards the 119 attacks it is still about terrorism and for the majority of the world terrorism has been around for a long time in my case my life in Northern Ireland. With any awareness of the complex issues involved many viewers will find this impossible to stomach thanks to its simplistic view of events and the solutions it puts forward.The plot sees one man takes up weapons to deal with terrorists. Suggestions that talks and peace are the way ahead are dismissed any discussion over why is brushed away by Brewer in his meeting with the terrorist leader and at the end of the day fighting terrorism is one big action movie where the good guys win and the sinister bad guys always lose. The script is so simplistic that it is hard not to feel sullied by it. As an action movie it is poor partly because you cannot ignore the sheer offensive simplicity of the whole thing but mainly because it lacks excitement enjoyment thrills or entertainment value on so many levels. OK if you want to see things go bang and nonwhite terrorists being beaten by American might then you may get something from it but for me it was just one big collection of action movies clichs wheeled out one after the other until I just couldn't care any more.The cast do nothing to help matters even though there are a number of well known people involved. Arnie is bland and his performance is one of such moral and ethical simplicity that it made me worry that this is how he actually sees the world  I really hope it is not. Koteas is a fine actor but is totally wasted here and cannot do anything with his role. John's Leguizamo and Turturro add a bit of interest but again are just poorly used. Curtis is just a pardon my language clichd coloured bad guy  his character is so underdeveloped that he makes the bad guy in True Lies look like a thoughtful discussion of antiAmerican feeling across the world. There are a handful of other recognisable faces floating around but none of them do much so I won't waste my time.Overall looking at this film as an action movie it is messy uninvolving dull lifeless and soaked in more clichs than can be good for anyone. Sadly though it is impossible to just view it as an action movie since it uses the response to terrorist attacks as its subject matter. With this difficult issue and don't forget terrorist murders didn't start in September 2001 the film makes such a pathetic case that it is hard to stomach  it made me watch the film right to the end but only because I really couldn't believe that anyone thought this would be a good story to tell  even more so surprising that such an insensitive jingoistic and simplistic view of the world could be presented after America itself found out what a complex issue it is. A poor movie that is only made worse by a horrid script.".

	onyx:emotionText "Gordy Brewer is a good clean allAmerican type with a wife and young son and a selfless job as a firefighter. While his wife and daughter wait for him to collect them they are caught up in a terrorist attack and die in the bombing. Brewer's loss turns to guilt turns to anger when he sees the Government involving themselves in political wrangling with Columbia rather than going after the evildoers. With the weight of American moral justice behind him Brewer heads into Columbia to travel deep into the jungles find the terrorist leader and kill him.Those who claim that this film is a tasteless attempt to cash in on 11th September 2001 forget that it was made before that terrorist attack and that it was shelved until a later date  however they are right in their claims that it is tasteless. In regards 11901 the film was sold on the back of American anger and demands for revenge that the film pandered to with little thought  at a time of healing the marketing of this film fed the fire and in return was fuelled by it. It is impossible though not to view this film in regards the subject matter because although not offensively simple in regards the 119 attacks it is still about terrorism and for the majority of the world terrorism has been around for a long time in my case my life in Northern Ireland. With any awareness of the complex issues involved many viewers will find this impossible to stomach thanks to its simplistic view of events and the solutions it puts forward.The plot sees one man takes up weapons to deal with terrorists. Suggestions that talks and peace are the way ahead are dismissed any discussion over why is brushed away by Brewer in his meeting with the terrorist leader and at the end of the day fighting terrorism is one big action movie where the good guys win and the sinister bad guys always lose. The script is so simplistic that it is hard not to feel sullied by it. As an action movie it is poor partly because you cannot ignore the sheer offensive simplicity of the whole thing but mainly because it lacks excitement enjoyment thrills or entertainment value on so many levels.

I think you can strike a balance between these two ways of making movies.Those who blame action film makers for lack of realism forget that an average person already has realism in his life with its limitations rules laws bureaucracy politics and lack of interest in your personal troubles. If I need realism I can just go to Chicago south side get robbed by some friendly neighborhood minorities because I'm white only to see complete lack of action or response from the Chicago police because they are playing politics and will not protect me for fear that those same neighbors who robbed me will start yapping all over call Jesse Jackson and it will affect them in an undesirable way I'm citing an actual reported incident here. Sorry folks but that's the ugly reality.An action hero is a way to relax and get away from all that and finally see a man get things done and set things right for once be strong and empowered. People identify with a hero. They sympathize they believe it would be great if they were so empowered. That is why people watch action movies.Collateral Damage is somewhat farfetched as others have mentioned but it does give you that feeling of empowerment that an average Joe can in fact stand up and avenge the death of his family in spite of all those political games our government loves to play.Two things I found irritating in Collateral Damage was the ending and Francesca Neri's silicon lips that make her look like a cheap blowup doll pay attention to her face when she examines photos at CIA headquarters. Arnie closes the door and an explosion takes place behind it. The heavy metal door gets blasted off with the concrete wall so hard that it flies and Arnie is dragged across the floor. He walks back and is attacked by the terrorist who isn't even burnt even though he was in the middle of the explosion not like Arnold behind a concrete wall. I think that was making it too farfetched.But don't let the ending discourage you from watching the movie. It's really not important we all know the bad guy always dies in these stories. It's the process we are after the action asskicking explosions...There's plenty here. There is a Whole lot of Collateral Damage.".

He gets really pissed and decides to go into Columbia and kill the terrorist leader himself.  From there we see Gordon going on his journey through Columbia which was pretty interesting to see.  John Leguizamo had a great funny role that provided some comic relief in the film.  In Columbia he meets up with the terrorists and....I dont wanna spoil it for you.  I would recommend this movie to anyone that needs to escape from reality for a while as the believability of this story is about as high as Total Recall.

	schema:headline " Ridiculous";
	schema:reviewBody "Arnolds 80s movies and early 90s movies are most of them great. Something must have happened during the second half of the 90s. Suddenly Arnold started to make bad movies like End of Days T3 and this one. Of course he would make one halfentertaining and quite alright movie named 6th day which would satisfy some of his fans but disappoint most of them. But of all those movies this must be the baddest of them. Let me tell you why.First of all the story is anything but original. Original and trend setting story's could be seen in many of Arnolds early films like Terminator Conan Running Man and the most typical Arnoldmovie of all time Commando. The story of a fireman who lost his family in a terrorist attack and seek revenge is both ridiculous and unrealistic. I can understand any mans sorrow in such incidents but no one tries to kill the terrorist after the attack. What I'm trying to make into a point here is this Take 911 for an example. Many men lost their families. So far no one has taken revenge for that. If I woke up any feelings with that example I apologize. What I'm trying to say here is this the story in this movie is the first step to the annihilation of Arnolds career. I wrote 'not original' up there and it still ain't. Well I don't mean that the exact story has been done in many movies I mean the entire revenge concept.Second its a kinda silent movie. Don't get me wrong I don't mean that there is no gunfire or explosions or so cause there are. Plenty of it too. What I mean is there are many silent suggestive scenes where they try to make a drama out of it. Those scenes are horrible. Just like in many action movies where they try to make strong dramas out of it. I think its superfluous to mention them thats why there are no examples. Another point I'm trying to make is that Arnold shouldn't be in those positions where he have to be dramatic. That's exactly what ruined Commando. And it ruined this movie too. Not completely its just one of the many bad parts in this movie.Third the characters are bad unrealistic and stupid. Take Arnolds character Gordy. He suffers from heavy temperament problems. Not only he become angrier than necessary his temperament shifts a lot. And he is not the only one with that problem. Selena Perrini Francesca Neri has the exact same problem. First moment a lonely sad mother trying to take care of her son. Next moment a ruthless killer. The bad guys so sick and unrealistic that I wont bother describing them with another sentence than 'plain stupid'. See the movie and you'll understand exactly what I mean.Further reasons is a weak production bad directing and a ridiculous script. I suppose I don't have to describe that any more than I just did right? Arnold is currently governor in California. A major disappointment since he should return to the movie world and make more movies in the same style as the ones he made during the 80s. But I guess he needed an excuse to not continue with turkey movies like this one. For gods sake Arnold! I want another Total Recall or Red Heat!".

	schema:headline " It is one of my favorite best action movies of Schwarzenegger and I enjoy it.";
	schema:reviewBody "Collateral Damage 2002 is one of the most decent Schwarzenegger action flicks. The story worked for me Cliff Curtis was good as the villain Arnold was great the twist at the end was nice the action scenes were fun and altogether I think it's a very solid movie.For me Collateral Damage  End of Days are the only Schwarzenegger movies where he actually gives a acting performance. I think both of the films are very underrated and bashed for their credits for it. This one is the 7h movie that in my opinion are his best movies and Collateral Damage is one of them. It is my favorite best movie that I absolutely love. Collateral Damage is above average action thriller very underrated from the early 2002 people just hate this movie I loved it This movie rules!Great movie if you like Arnold Schwarzenegger I would recommend this movie if you like a lot of action packed scenes and explosions. Collateral damage is very good movie and entertaining. I love the twist! You cannot take the law into your own hands.While The September 11 2001 terrorist attacks and Collateral Damage may not be classic examples of art imitating life and vice versa the reallife attacks did put a temporary halt to the film's scheduled October 2001 release. And certainly the film does share a few primary similarities with that day. Collateral Damage's hero is a firefighter and a terror attack in a major U.S. city  Los Angeles to be exact  leads to panic and the main character's own struggles with loss and a thirst for revenge. But otherwise director Andrew Davis' Above the Law Collateral Damage plays as a fun and superficially routine Action flick that's full of explosions and gunfire but that goes above and beyond the call of duty crafting a surprisingly deep plot one with a rather heavy emotional undercurrent  even beyond the loss of the main characters' family  and a few quality twists and turns that keep the movie fresh and its landscape always evolving. While this may not be the quintessential Action movie  it's no Die Hard  or even the finest flick to Andrew Davis' name this is a good high quality high yield Action movie and as is always the case with a Schwarzenegger film it's well worth seeing if only for the star's presence energy and charisma. Firefighter Gordon Brewer is plunged into the complex and dangerous world of international terrorism after he loses his wife and child in a bombing credited to Claudio The Wolf Perrini. Frustrated with the official investigation and haunted by the thought that the man responsible for murdering his family might never be brought to justice Brewer takes matters into his own hands and tracks his quarry ultimately to Colombia.After his family is killed by a terrorist act a firefighter goes in search of the one responsible.I love this Action flick How Arnold went on his own in to the jungle of Colombia to find the terrorists responsible for his family murder. I find this very Entertained action film for a Schwarzenegger fan like me. I love this film and I have always enjoy it. Collateral Damage is so much better film than Terminator Genisys Maggie or Sabotage were. I don't care about the new movies Arnold is doing today they are all crap Escape Plan and The Last Stand are his last films that were really good to watch the rest of the films he did weren't. Arnold stop making such a bad films this days please! I love the action scenes the explosion in all movies Arnold kills the bad guys with guns and knives. In this film he uses plastic explosives and his intelligent skills. The end and the twist was fantastic the action scenes were just perfect. This film isn't above average so stop hating on it. The film tells the story of Los Angeles firefighter Gordon Brewer Arnold Schwarzenegger who looks to avenge his son and wife's death at the hands of a guerrilla commando by traveling to Colombia and facing his family's killers. I disagree with all the haters of this film including Stan Goff this film is not horrible. Terminator Genisys  Sabotage and Maggie are far worst films than Collateral Damage is.

The film was released in the United States on February 8 2002.810 Grade B Studio Warner Bros.

	schema:reviewBody "Both versions of Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much are well worth watching and each one has its own strong points.  While this British version cannot match the Hollywood remake in terms of star power and lavish production it has several strengths of its own it is fastpaced filled with wit and nicely atmospheric.  Despite being 20 years older it is also more 'modern' in its portrayal of the woman whose child is kidnapped.Aside from Peter Lorre always a big plus to any movie the cast does not have too many names that would be familiar to today's audiences but they all are good actors who fit in well with the style of Hitchcock's British films exuding selfcontrol and goodnatured wit even in the most trying of circumstances.  Edna Best as the heroine is noticeably different from Doris Day lacking the glamour but giving a convincing performance as a more determined resourceful mother.There are some interesting settings in this version too with much of the action taking place in some interesting buildings in a less elegant neighborhood in London.  A lot of it looks a bit murky in the old blackandwhite print but in a sense even that adds to the atmosphere.Certainly there are those who have good reasons for preferring the remake but every Hitchcock fan should watch the original too.  Hitchcock's British films had a pleasant style all their own and while this one might not measure up to The Lady Vanishes or The 39 Steps it's still very entertaining.".

Alfred Hitchcock used Conrad's novel for his film SABOTAGE in 1936. But two years earlier he did the film THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH. It was the first of two films in which Peter Lorre was directed by him. It was also the only one of his movies that he remade complete with title. But he decided to use the film to film a scene from British criminal history  the January 1911 Siege of Sidney Street.There had been an incident in December 1910 when several Russian aliens were involved in a burglary in Houndsditch. The proceeds of their robberies aside from supporting themselves helped fund antiTsarist activities in Russia. They killed three constables in making their escape from the shop. They were eventually tracked down to a house on Sidney Street and fired at the police who tried to get them to surrender. The Home Secretary of the day a politician named Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill sent out troops sharp shooters and artillery. The cannon set the house on fire and the men found inside were found to be dead. The best account of the event is Donald Rumbelow's THE SIEGE OF SIDNEY STREET called THE HOUNDSDITCH MURDERS in Great Britain.Here instead of radicals called anarchists in 1911 we have foreign conspirators planning an assassination in London of a foreign head of state. Peter Lorre is the leader. Leslie Banks and his family are on vacation to Switzerland. Banks witnesses the murder of a Frenchman Pierre Fresney a great French star of the period  this English film is a rarity for him. Fresney reveals the assassination plot to Banks and Lorre and his associates kidnap his daughter Nora Pilbeam to keep his mouth shut. But the police are aware that he heard something from Fresney and try to pressure him to talk.So we watch Banks try to track down his daughter and get captured himself while his wife goes to the Albert Hall to see what she can do.The finale of the film is based on the Siege  with some exceptions one of the bobbies in the Houndsditch tragedy is shot and killed in the start of the movie's version of the incident. But Hitchcock maintains the suspense to the end when the last villain is taken care of.It's an interesting film  not a great one. And it is somewhat different from the 1956 remake.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must confess that I rather like this earlier version more than the definitely more polished bigger budgeted 1956 version. Don't get me wrong that film is a fine film too but the lower budget the quick pace and the presence of Peter Lorre make this one a gem. Alfred Hitchcock the undeniable maser of suspense shows his early skills as a director able to create suspense and engineer circumstances that affect individuals who would normally NOT be affected by them  a Hitchcock trademark. Here we have Leslie Banks and Edna Best playing the parents of a young teen girl who has been kidnapped because her parents were the last ones spoken to by a mana friend at a party in a European country. Intrigue abounds the man tells Best who then tells Banks of a note in a brush handle that alerts them to some international incident that will occur in England. Well the kidnappers alert them of what they have done and shut them up. But through parental devotion once in England the father begins to hunt for his daughter. This film has all those Hitchcock trademarks that we know Hitchcock for. We have the normal persons put into extremely difficult and complicated situations. We have expressive camera angles. We have humour amidst taut tense action. We have good allaround acting. Banks just a year or so removed from his awesome portrayal of General Zaroff in The Most Dangerous Game gives an incredibly lowkey convincing performance as a father trying to find his daughter no matter what. He is able to inject light touches of humour here and there to make his performance all the more real. Best is adequate although a bit wooden. Hugh Wakefield as the uncle is a real hoot. Cicely Oates as a nurse is also very convincing. Peter Lorre however solidifies his EnglishAmerican career as a heavy. Coming from a Hungarian background and not able to speak English yet Lorre learns his part phonetically  which is all the more impressive when you see his performance as a killer with little scruples yet a generous sense of humour. Lorre conveys menace in his everalert eyes and his almost sugary voice. Hitchcock knows just how to use him and the climatic scene really is pulled off rather well. This movie is not very long and it is a tad creaky. It has little budget as well but it conveys lots of action and suspense and has some very good performances. The air of conspiracy another director's trademark touch pervades the film almost from beginning to end.".

It was the first film that got him noticed outside the United Kingdom it led to bigger budgets for Hithcock to work with in British film industry and eventually to his departure for America.Leslie Banks and Edna Best Mr.and Mrs. upper class British couple on holiday in Switzerland with their adolescent daughter Neva Pilbeam. A Frenchman they befriend Pierre Fresnay is killed right in front of them on a dance floor and he whispers something to Banks about a planned assassination in London to occur shortly. The spies suspect what the dying Fresnay has said to Banks and grab Pilbeam to insure the silence of her parents.The rest of this short 75 minute feature is Banks and Best trying to both foil the assassination and get their daughter back. At the climax Best's skill at skeet shooting becomes a critical factor in the final confrontation with the villains.Peter Lorre made his English language debut in The Man Who Knew Too Much and was very effective with the limited dialog he had. I've often wondered why Hitchcock never used Lorre more in some of his later features.Although the 1956 version has far better production values this version still holds up quite well and is worth a look.".

The spies suspect what the dying Fresnay has said to Banks and grab Pilbeam to insure the silence of her parents.The rest of this short 75 minute feature is Banks and Best trying to both foil the assassination and get their daughter back. At the climax Best's skill at skeet shooting becomes a critical factor in the final confrontation with the villains.Peter Lorre made his English language debut in The Man Who Knew Too Much and was very effective with the limited dialog he had. I've often wondered why Hitchcock never used Lorre more in some of his later features.Although the 1956 version has far better production values this version still holds up quite well and is worth a look.";

	schema:headline " Early gem by the Master of Suspense";
	schema:reviewBody "Very few artists have done as much for the thriller genre in film as British director Alfred Hitchcock who not only was a pioneer of many of the techniques that would become widely used nowadays but also across his career he literally invented a great amount of the rules that would shape the genre. While his career didn't seem to have started on the best way his first movie The Pleasure Garden was a failure after the success of The Lodger in 1927 Hitchcock would become one of the most popular young directors in the United Kingdom and it wouldn't take him much to be recognized worldwide. That recognition came in 1934 when his thriller The Man Who Knew Too Much was released becoming his most acclaimed and successful movie to date and the one that would make him to be noticed by Hollywood. Not only this movie would introduce Hitchcock to America it would also introduce one of cinema's most important actors Peter Lorre.The Man Who Knew Too Much begins in Switzerland where Bob and Jill Lawrence Leslie Banks and Edna Best are on a winter sports holiday with their teenage daughter Betty Nova Pilbeam. The reason for their visit is that Jill competes in a target shooting competition and a family friend Louis Bernard Pierre Fresnay competes in a skiing event. During a dinner Bernard is murdered by an unseen shooter but before dying he informs the Lawrences about a conspiracy to kill an important diplomat in London. The Lawrences are confused at first by the spy's revelation but soon the confusion becomes a preoccupation as the conspirators have kidnapped their daughter Betty in order to keep them quiet. Now the Lawrences know too much and that knowledge may cost them their daughters but while unable to tell the police their situation the couple decides to find their daughter themselves.The screenplay for The Man Who Knew Too Much was written by Edwin Greenwood and A.R. Rawlinson although it was based on a story cowritten by D.B. WyndhamLewis and Charles Bennett. While the writing of the film was a cooperative effort it is Charles Bennett's style the one that's shown the most through the story. Bennett's plays and screenplays became the basis of many of the most representative Hitchcock thrillers and one could say that along with the Master of Suspense he shaped the genre in its early days. The Man Who Knew Too Much includes many of Bennett's trademarks such as criminal spies their political conspiracies and the innocent people that are dragged unto them all spiced up by a very British humor that makes the whole thing even more enjoyable.While by 1933 Hitchcock already had made several remarkable films The Man Who Knew Too Much is probably the first of his movies that truly can be considered as an emblematic Hitchcock film as his style is finally shaped in this movie. Taking the best of WyndhamLewis and Bennett's story Hitchcock brings to life a captivating tale of adventure and mystery that literally takes its innocent characters to the darkest alleys of London. Visually the movie is a joy as with the excellent work by cinematographer Curt Courant Hitchcock shows the influence of German expressionism in his work and creates wonderful images of striking contrast between light and shadows. His dominion of suspense shines in many scenes of the film particularly in an impressive sequence that serves as climax of the movie where Hitchcock takes full advantage of the introduction of sound to movies.The performances by the actors are of an excellent quality with Leslie Banks leading the cast with his charming presence and very British wit. His ability to mix drama with comedy makes his character a very real and likable person that portrays remarkably the everyman placed in an uncommon situation. While Banks truly makes a great job the real star of the film is the amazing Peter Lorre as the leader of the conspirators. In this his first work in English Lorre shows off his enormous talent and steals every single scene he appears in a remarkable task considering this was his first movie in English and that he had to learn his lines phonetically. Edna Best is good albeit nothing spectacular quite the opposite are Frank Vosper and Nova Pilbeam who make an amazing work considering their limited screen time. Hugh Wakefield has a very funny supporting role where he masterfully displays his talent for comedy.When most people hear about The Man Who Knew Too Much the instant memory is often that of Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day trying to recover their kidnapped son in the 1956 version of the movie. That is because Alfred Hitchcock decided to remake this classic in color and with the benefits of being a more experienced filmmaker and having a bigger budget to do it. But even when the Master himself prefer the remake personally I think that the original movie is the superior version. True the 1934 version of The Man Who Knew Too Much is not a perfect film it has an irregular pace at times too slow at times too fast and its plot has some very unlikely situations however it has a great charm and a powerful style very difficult to ignore. It is certainly dated by today's standards but while the remake is technically superior this one has a heart.After making this movie the Master's career would only go higher and higher as the next year he would follow the success of this film with another legendary masterpiece penned again by Bennett The 39 Steps. It has been quoted many times that Hitchcock named this underrated movie the work of an amateur as he stated his preference towards the 50s remake but here I must disagree with the Master as personally I think that this is the version of The Man Who Knew Too Much that should be seen. 810".

	schema:headline " Vastly underrated";
	schema:reviewBody "One of Hitchcock's best films and entirely undervalued. I love most of Hitch's films. His bigger productions of the mid1950s to the mid1960s are probably best loved but I really like his grittier more realitybased films as well. During that period The Wrong Man is almost entirely overlooked despite being one of his greatest achievements. This kind of film was most common during his British career where he had less money to work with. I myself am least familiar with the first chunk of the man's career but I have seen enough of them. My favorite so far is definitely Sabotage 1936 which is another criminally underrated film. The first version of The Man Who Knew Too Much is a close second favorite. A terrorist group led by Peter Lorre kills a secret agent in Switzerland. Bob and Jill Lawrence discover that the group is planning to assassinate a foreign diplomat in London in the upcoming days so the group kidnaps their daughter to keep them quiet. They're unwilling to tell the police about the kidnapping and eventually take it upon themselves to find her. They have to do it quickly for if the diplomat is killed because they withheld information from the police a second World War could rest upon their shoulders. The story isn't particularly complex but Hitchcock's cinema is as spectacular as it ever was while aiming for a low key. There are a dozen memorable scenes in the film most notably the concert with the slowly revolving camera as Jill Lawrence scans the room for the assassin. And I love the realistic standoff near the end of the film as the police slowly move citizens to safety as the terrorists shoot from the dark. The acting is also very good with Edna Best as Jill Lawrence and especially Peter Lorre how can you not love this guy? standing above the rest. 1010.".

Having seen them recently backtoback my personal opinion is that they are both flawedbut in different ways. The earlier film is quaintly primitiveparticularly in matters involving continuity use of sound editing and other technical issues. On the other hand the later version seems excessively padded with much extraneous material has a male juvenile actor who is quite inferior to Nova Pilbeam in the original and has villains who lack the unique menace of Peter Lorrewith his rare combination of subtle humor wit and terror.In the end the viewer is left with a sort of Hobson's Choice.

	schema:reviewBody "The first time I watched this film I could barely differentiate characters I was so unused to watching old highcontrast BW films. By the third time around I had made everything out and it became one of my favorite movies of all time. The 50's remake though James Stewart is one of my favorite personalities in the history of civilization just isn't the same film.First and foremost Peter Lorre. Anyone who has seen him in M then laments his minor roles in Hollywood films should see this film. It's too bad that Hollywood couldn't create more roles like this for him. Abbott is one of the greatest of Hitchcock's sympathetic villains... better than Claude Rains in Notorious better than James Mason in North by Northwest comparing favorably to Robert Walker in Strangers on a Train and Shadow of a Doubt's Joseph Cotton in a fraction of the screen time. He is charming wellmannered and portrays more warmth humanity and poetry in his words and actions than any of the above.On the other hand he is an assassination plotter and kidnapper and this is lighthearted entertainment unlike the second version which is all nerves and no wit.The cinematography is wonderful. The thing I love most about very early Hitchcock is the German influence he interned at UFA and his first film the Pleasure Garden was a German coproduction. Of all of Hitchcock's great works this is the one most in tune with the aesthetics of silent film and an important benchmark for one of the few directors whose careers encompass so much of film history. Even the classic 39 Steps filmed the following year does not make such extensive use of camera tricks as Hitch would come to deride them later in his career.The closeups of Frank Vosper's hair the pin associated with Nova Pilbeam the POV shots of Edna Best's fainting and Hugh Wakefield tuning out at the church the entire Albert Hall sequence... they're wonderful touches from the era of telling stories strictly through pictures that you just won't find even in Hitch's later British work. There are plenty of striking frame compositions over the shoulder through the gate formations of people and that beautiful shot towards the beginning of silhouetted father and daughter looking out the window at Mum and revealing pans a la Carl Dreyer my favorite are when Peter Lorre swirls from Vosper to Leslie Bank's face as the music on the radio crescendos Banks raising a cigarette to his mouth... and at the very end with the police camera pans to the door rifles rise.Hitch also milks the soundtrack for all it's worth. The early films of both Lang and Hitch stick out for their creative and stylistic use of sound. Most overtly M had Peer Gynt The Man Who Knew Too Much has the Stormcloud Cantata. There are plenty of more subtle audio cues the best of which is Peter Lorre's chiming pocket watch. Using music as a coverup is a motif as well as sounds of warning and interruption. Compare and contrast the instances intelligent patterns emerge. This is one well thought out little thriller.When the characters talk they usually have something clever to say. Leslie Banks has the perfect voice for delivering the obligatory dry British wit... just leave me a bone on the mat sir you have beaten my wife and she has run off with another man... you are a dirty dog and my favorite has it been fireproofed? But if Banks has the best lines Lorre has the best speech in the scene setting up the Albert Hall sequence. possible spoilers on horizon In the 50's version this scene is purely informational basically the villains filling in the audience on the particulars of the plot. But in the original this is the money scene. Lorre brings in little Nova for a touching scene of father and daughter reunited relates with flair and humor the assassination setup to Vosper then the whole Shakespeare... a great poet speech. Nova is torn from Daddy and the scene ends with a closeup of the obviously moved Lorre slowly casting his eyes down. Also scope that earlier quick cutaway shot of him eyes downcast framed by four coconspirators. Nice composition.Is the acting solid? Wouldn't normal people be really thrown off by these events like in the 50's version or the more recent Ransom? Let's say the acting is great in the context of the film. Banks and Lorre of course carry the film. Cicely Oates is a prototypical Mrs. Danvers. Nova Pilbeam who I never noticed much until after watching Young and Innocent smiles frowns looks back and forth between adults and cries daddy daddy! to sink your heart. Lovely. Edna Best turns away from the camera to show she is crying. She gets nicely worked up in the Albert Hall sequence but she has nothing on Doris Day in the remake nor Frank Vosper on Reggie Nalder. But the camerawork carries the day. Kudos also to the bit parts of all the policemen at the end. The many brief but poignant or at the very least discernible characterizations keep us caring after the emphasis shifts from the main characters.An extremely subjective 10 out of 10. This is not a great film in the manner of M or Shadow of a Doubt. It's mind and eye candy probably best appreciated by silent film buffs. I'd recommend it to students of German expressionism fans of early Lang etc. And of course British Hitch fans shouldn't overlook this in all the accolades given to 39 Steps and Lady Vanishes. Same goes for Young and Innocent and Sabotage. Even Secret Agent has interesting things about it though not that many and Peter Lorre is reduced to a role more like the kind he is delegated to in many a Humphrey Bogart movie.".

Lorre brings in little Nova for a touching scene of father and daughter reunited relates with flair and humor the assassination setup to Vosper then the whole Shakespeare... a great poet speech. Nova is torn from Daddy and the scene ends with a closeup of the obviously moved Lorre slowly casting his eyes down. Also scope that earlier quick cutaway shot of him eyes downcast framed by four coconspirators. Nice composition.Is the acting solid? Wouldn't normal people be really thrown off by these events like in the 50's version or the more recent Ransom? Let's say the acting is great in the context of the film. Banks and Lorre of course carry the film. Cicely Oates is a prototypical Mrs. Danvers. Nova Pilbeam who I never noticed much until after watching Young and Innocent smiles frowns looks back and forth between adults and cries daddy daddy! to sink your heart. Lovely. Edna Best turns away from the camera to show she is crying. She gets nicely worked up in the Albert Hall sequence but she has nothing on Doris Day in the remake nor Frank Vosper on Reggie Nalder. But the camerawork carries the day. Kudos also to the bit parts of all the policemen at the end. The many brief but poignant or at the very least discernible characterizations keep us caring after the emphasis shifts from the main characters.An extremely subjective 10 out of 10. This is not a great film in the manner of M or Shadow of a Doubt. It's mind and eye candy probably best appreciated by silent film buffs. I'd recommend it to students of German expressionism fans of early Lang etc. And of course British Hitch fans shouldn't overlook this in all the accolades given to 39 Steps and Lady Vanishes. Same goes for Young and Innocent and Sabotage. Even Secret Agent has interesting things about it though not that many and Peter Lorre is reduced to a role more like the kind he is delegated to in many a Humphrey Bogart movie.";

He passes information to them relating to an assassination but before they can pass on the information their daughter is kidnapped for their silence.  Back in London they decide to start looking for the kidnappers and prevent the assassination themselves.Hitchcock's strength here is that an wholly unlikely plot which is full of holes is masked by a sense of wit and good feeling that covers the flaws. The whole thing falls down under scrutiny and as a thriller it doesn't really cut it as well as I'd hoped  it certainly doesn't compare to The 39 Steps.  However the film is very classy and very very British.I expect to American audiences nowadays that the very polite gentleman like approach of the film is very strange but it works quite well.  The final shoot out lacks excitement simply because it is unrealistic in the extreme but it's still quite enjoyable and has it's moments.  Lorre is good as the villain but lacks the smarmy qualities he brought to later films.  Leslie Banks is very good as the solid British hero and Best is good as his sassy if underused wife.  Wakefield has a good comedy role as Banks' side kick.Overall the age of the film means it feels very stagy and very stiff but there's still much to enjoy with good settings comedy and vintage Hitchcockian touches.".

	schema:headline " Interesting idea not the best execution";
	schema:reviewBody "Hitccock's first major release in the USA and Peter Lorre's first Englishspeaking role are two firsts scored by this 1934 thriller. This is of course also Hitchcock's first attempt to to make this film. His second released in the mid50s was more successful and better funded. This very British and relatively pithy film retains most of the character of Hitchcock's earlier efforts but is lean and economical with less camera play and simpler cinematography and pacing.The acting is generally very good. Of the main cast Nova Pilbeam who plays the kidnapped daughter of Leslie Banks and Edna Best is the only survivor today at the age of 87. Most of the action centers on Banksand he is fine but and I tend to think this is Hitchcock's doing very emotionally compressed throughout the film. Banks' Bob Lawrence has a loving flirty wife Best and a delightful young daughter Pilbeam. They are away on holiday in the alps when a new friend of their is shot dead while dancing with Best. As he dies he passes along some information which creates the family's predicament. Lorre and his people kidnap young Pilbeam in exchange for Banks' silence and he must then decide what to do. It seems that no matter what he does his daughter is likely to die.It is remarkable that Lorre did not even know what he was saying throughout most of this performance. The legendary actor as usual dominates all of his scenes and gives the film a creepy psychotic feeling that would have been difficult to achieve without him.The plot is a bit light on logic but brisk satisfyingly convoluted and entertaining. The script is OK but often maintains too stiff an upper lip. A few opportunities for elaboration were missed  probably a limitation inherent in the original Wyndham Lewis story. I think it would have been interesting and more credible if the authorities had followed up on their knowledge that Banks knew something and trailed him throughout the film. This could have added an extra layer of potential suspense mystery and obfuscation since Best's heightened paranoia might have lead him to suspect all sorts of things about anybody keeping tabs on him.Hitchcock definitely knew he had a potential gem here and it is a credit to him that he revitalized the film with Jimmy Stewart in the 1950s  after establishing himself as a force to be reckoned with.Worth seeing for Hitchcock fans and those interested in early British film as well as fans of the 1950s version. Ow only very mildly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of Alfred Hitchcock's earliest classics made before he came to Hollywood. A couple's daughter is kidnapped to keep her parents quiet about an assassination plot. The couple is played by Leslie Banks and Edna Best. Banks is good in a role that's a long way from his florid performance in The Most Dangerous Game from a couple of years earlier. Best is impressive in a sympathetic turn. Peter Lorre is menacing and even a little creepy as the leader of the assassins. This was his first Englishspeaking role he learned the language while filming. Nice photography from Curt Courant and some fun little creative touches from Hitchcock. The dry humor is blended nicely with the action and suspense. The cult of sun worshippers and The Royal Albert Hall scene are both worthy of Hitch's highlight reel. Perhaps one too many abrupt cuts from one scene to the next often as a character is in midsentence. But clearly Hitch was still honing his craft. At least he was trying things as opposed to the static direction of many of his contemporaries.Remade in 1956 by Hitchcock himself with James Stewart and Doris Day. That version is more polished and Hollywood and is arguably the more popular of the two. Although neither film is perfect I prefer this one. It may not have the two decades of advancements in production techniques or the bigger budget of the remake but it has a tighter plot shorter runtime faster pace darker tone and it builds suspense without the distracting side stuff of the remake. Plus there's no incongruous scenes of Doris Day singing.".

It's true that the later version is glossier more tense and edgier but this one is a lot of fun. We don't really worry for a moment that the kidnapped child Nova Pilbeam of Leslie Banks and Edna Best will be harmed. Nor can we readily imagine that the anonymous ambassador will be assassinated at the Albert Hall. Leslie Banks and his pal who are trying to locate the place in London where the child is being held don't seem to take the threat too seriously either. Where Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day played the pursuit almost entirely straight with the exception of one ludicrous scene in a taxidermist's shop Banks and Buddy make wisecracks and engage in one comic adventure after another  even a horrifying scene is the office of a sinister dentist who grins demoniacally as he intones That one had better come out. Gulp. Edna Best as the anxious mother isn't around all that much. The place occupied by Doris Day in the remake is taken by Banks' somewhat mentally stunted male buddy. You can get more laughs out of a male buddy than out of a fearful wife. You can bop the buddy over the head hypnotize him hit him with folding chairs and pull his tooth. Try doing that to a nearhysterical Doris Day.Yes the 1956 version is a more polished film but it's a different kind of film too. This one is almost farcical and has Peter Lorre as a suavely sneaky murderer. It has a climactic shoot out that isn't particularly well done. But they're both identifiably Hitchcockian.

	schema:reviewBody "Hitch's first international success and a picture he was to remake himself over twenty years later. It is also the earliest of his espionage adventure thrillers  he would set his own template for this type of film a year later with The 39 Steps but here he was still experimenting.When Hitchcock remade The Man Who Knew Too Much in 1956 he wanted to put the original completely out of mind and start from scratch with same basic synopsis. But even if Hitchcock wanted to think of them as completely separate pictures comparing them directly shows just what had and what hadn't developed yet in his filmmaking formula. The most significant difference for me is in the character who kidnaps the child. By 1956 a Hitchcock film wasn't a Hitchcock film without the audience being misled at some point hence the kidnappers being a friendly middleaged couple that noone would suspect. In 1934 however the kidnapper is played by the very sinister German actor Peter Lorre. For those who don't know Lorre made his debut playing a serial child killer in Fritz Lang's M and well let's just say he got kind of typecast from then on.The storyline in 1934's Man Who Knew Too Much is quite uneven and episodic moving from one set piece to another. Some sections are way too long while at other times it seems to skip forward a bit too fast. But it's all good fun and rarely gets boring. One of the little set pieces I particularly like is the scene with the struggle over teeth pulling and laughing gas. Hitchcock probably chuckled to himself here as he exploited the fear virtually everyone seems to have of going to the dentist.The plot builds up to the climactic assassination scene at the Albert Hall. It's a brilliant mix of editing being varied shots to build up tension in the style of DW Griffith or Eisenstein which Hitchcock was so good at even in his early days. Here the build up is given even greater strength by the booming orchestra score which it is synced to. To compare the versions again the 1956 Albert Hall climax has a much wider scope and a more frantic feel but the 1934 version keeps that surreal sinister edge which wasn't as sharp in Hitchcock's later films.The film ends with a shootout between the cops and the villains. This section seems a bit overlong and repetitive and bizarrely seems to turn into a scene from Oliver Twist at the end. Mind you it's more enjoyable than the corny Doris DayQue Sera Sera ending of the 1956 version.As far as the practical directing style goes it's fairly typical of Hitchcock's British period. Heavily influenced by German Expressionism particularly the work of Fritz Lang it's full of irregular camera angles cramped and dingy interiors closeups of faces looking directly into the camera and early camera tricks such as dissolves and double exposures. It also contains an early example of one of those unique Hitchcock camera movements where he draws you in on a particular object in this case a gun planted in someone's back.The acting talent is OK here with the usual faceless plummyvoiced English cast typical for early Hitchcock pictures. The one standout is Peter Lorre who was in his first Englishspeaking role and learnt his lines phonetically. He struggles a fair bit with the English dialogue but his physical acting is absolutely superb. I have to say as well  another comparison  Nova Pilbeam is a much less annoying child actor than that little brat in the 1956 version.I'm not sure whether I prefer the 1934 or the 1956 version. Both are very good but neither are brilliant. However considered alone 1934's Man Who Knew Too Much while not the most wellconstructed film is good fun and one of the better films of Hitchcock's British period.".

WyndhamLewis and Emlyn Williams the films journeys from St. Moritz where an English couple's daughter has been kidnapped by a group of international criminals with plans to assassinate a foreign dignitary to London where most of the film takes place. The exposition of the early scenes in Switzerland is somewhat vague and unsatisfying but once the action moves to England things improve considerably. There are political and social undercurrents throughout the film which seems from time to time to be either anticipating or warning about a world war. Foreigners i.e. nonBrits come off badly though the British are themselves presented as scarcely more competent if a good deal more benevolent.By today's standards this is a primitive film though to anyone with a feeling for the past it's a delight. The London of 1934 is presented as a largely seedy place of forbidding underlit streets populated by often unsavory characters. Several scenes stand out as set pieces notably a tense semicomical trip to a dingy dentist's office. Also a standout is a meeting in the church of a strange sunworshipping religious sect used as a cover by the criminals climaxing in a humorous mle in which characters throw tables and chairs at one another. A shootout between the criminals and the police is extremely well done as we get to view it from several different perspectives at streetlevel from the rooftops and so on.As the mother Edna Best gets to play a character at once ladylike and heroic while the father portrayed by the very capable Leslie Banks while certainly brave enough is somewhat ineffectual if witty. Nova Pilbeam as the daughter has an odd sharply angled face that makes her strangely compelling and sympathetic. Peter Lorre's ringleader with a white racing streak in his hair comes across as a basically gentle soul unfortunately beset by demons he cannot control which in turn make him do distasteful things he disapproves of and comes to regret.Hitchcock does a fine job of directing the film arguably the first real Hitchcock picture and a big hit when it first came out. He maximizes suspense and has a way of stressing relationships between characters that are not in the script but come about because of the way they're photographed. The criminals are at all times presented as human while the good guys are flawed in many ways. We can see many of the themes that turn up in Hitchcock's later filmsthe wrong man the way international events impinge on provincial AngloSaxons the incompetence of the policein their early stages. What had yet to emerge was the smoothness the perfect timing the elegant construction of his later American films. The director's talent like Chaplin's in his early films is still in a kind of music hallvaudeville phase which is to say crude with wonderful shining moments but lacking the finetuned lapidary qualities one associates with his best work.

	schema:reviewBody "This film was inspired by a real event a prolonged street battle between Engish police and a group of violent anarchists holed up in a house in a fairly respectable workingclass neighborhood.

But Hitchcock uses his editing brilliant not only within scenes but moving scene to scene to effect a rapid pace that never gives us time for reflection on such issues. Instead we hold onto the hero's coattails and hope for the best even when the worst threatens at every turn.A truly remarkable suspense film that still packs a punch. Far superior to the '50s remake which tends to be inflated beyond the story's natural strengths a bit gaudy largely overacted and lacking in the solid if troubling political grounding we find here.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm crazy about Alida Valli. I'd seen every film she's ever done except The Paradine Case until today that is. Today I met Mrs Paradine for the first time. Strangely enough it doesn't feel like Hitchcock it feels more like Carol Reed the director who gave her a major International hit with The Third Man a couple of years later. I fell in love with Alida Valli in the 1954 Luchino Visconti's tragic romantic epic Senso. Now having seen The Paradine Case I see a glimpse of the woman in Senso where her actions are also atrocious but govern by love. A love who will only lead to tragedy. Visconti showed us an Alida Valli that other than a great beauty was also a great actress. Hitchcock introduced her as VALLI in this film a gimmick with very short legs. Here she plays the widow of a blind man that allegedly she killed. The casting of Gregory Peck is a major problem maybe not for the box office in 1947 but it certainly detrimental to the suspension of disbelief so needed in a thriller. Charles Laughton is superb in his few short scenes. I wonder if Hitchcock himself was the inspiration for his role. A judge a lascivious man with an roving eye for young pretty women. Ethel Barrymore plays his wife to absolute perfection. Then Louis Jourdan beautiful of course Charles Coburn Ann Todd but it is Alida Valli who gives this film that extra something. Considered a minor Hitchcock by most but not by me. 910".

What is of consequence is not the performance of Todd or Laughton but Hitchcock's sequence of visuals deftly edited to enhance the effect.A third unusual image of the film is the introductory shot of Louis Jordan.

	schema:reviewBody "Often unjustly dismissed as one of director Alfred Hitchcock's lesser works' THE PARADINE CASE stands up as well as any 1940's courtroom drama when taken on its own terms.  And the central theme that of a lawyer passionately and wrongly convinced of a beautiful and intelligent client's innocence because he wants to trust his emotions and not the evidence certainly seems to strike a chord with audiences.  It has been used countless times from the silent era to the present day e.g. MADAME X GUILTY AS SIN BODY OF EVIDENCE etc...  Unlike reviewer stills6 I found the central trianglebetween lawyer Peck his wife Ann Todd and lovely client Alida Valli whose motives are always kept nebulous until the end believable and surprisingly complex.  Each has hisher own agenda with Peck wavering between the lovely warm Todd and the beautiful coldly mysterious and sensual Valli who seemingly represents an attitude toward love and life he has presumably never known but finds appealing nevertheless.  Valli has the most difficult role here having to both woo Peck to her cause while keeping him emotionally at a distance but Todd also acquits herself admirably by bringing depth and sensitivity to what could have been just a runofthemill suffering wife role.  She refuses to suffer in silence and uses words to argue her cause passionately saying wryly at the end That's what comes from being married to a lawyer.'  Of course a cynic could point out that when Todd insists Peck defend and acquit Valli she is being unjustly noblebut I think Todd's stoic suffering and her explanations to Peck quickly undercut this idea.  And in fact if Peck did follow up on his offer to Todd to quit the case halfway through this wouldn't be much of a movie!Indeed the wordiness of this film seems to be one of its detractors' biggest complaints.  But in this I think Hitchcock has perhaps unintentionally made a sly point the characters talk circles around each other particularly Peck and the always deliciously malevolent Laughton but manage most of the time to completely miss the realities of the situation.  Only the womenthe silent Valli the barely repressed Todd and the caustic Joan Tetzelrecognize the truth.  The men doomed to arguing and finagling miss the pointand the truthcompletely in their attempts to sacrifice each other to their own individual causes.Even considered strictly within the Hitchcock pantheon it's clear THE PARADINE CASE has many Hitchcockian trademarks dazzling cameras moves wonderful imagery sweeping romantic themes blurred triangles of love desire and hate between all the principle characters brutal men devious women an impending sense of doom and even a character noted for her masculine' interest in the legal technicalities of the case.  Clearly Hitchcock found these women pursuing masculine' interests fascinating as they seem to pop up in many of his films e.g. Patricia Hitchcock in STRANGERS ON A TRAIN Barbara Bel Geddes in VERTIGO.   But I also find in the women here a darker prelude of Hitchcockian things to come.  No one in THE PARADINE CASE is entirely happy or even one might argue happy at all but each sticks firmly to her own emotional path able to see the potential tragic outcome but unwilling to waver enough to change it. Kim Novak's character follows a similarly torturous internal journey in VERTIGO as does Tippi Hedren in MARNIE.So if you have the time to be absorbed by this imperfect but still compelling drama take another look at THE PARADINE CASE.  You might be surprised.".

Even as evidence mounts that she may have done the crime after all he risks his marriage and reputation on the slightest of chances to find new evidence.  It moves quite slowly but is helped by the presence of many good supporting characters and a fine cast that portrays them convincingly.  Things come together in a lengthy courtroom sequence that is sometimes uncomfortable to watch but tense and realistic.Many viewers feel let down by the film because it lacks the energy and excitement found in most of Hitchcock's films and because the courtroom setting creates expectations that are not quite filled.  Indeed it does have its faults and it's hard to believe that someone of Hitchcock's creative genius could not have thought of some ways to give more life to the body of the picture because there are times when it really crawls along. But taken on its own merits it is a pretty good movie carefully filmed as always and one that gives the viewer plenty to think about.  There are some good scenes with the best one being the subtly crafted opening sequence of Mrs. Paradine being arrested in her elegant home and taken to prison.Many Hitchcock fans will not particularly enjoy this one although if you like his more somber masterpieces such as Vertigo you might at least want to give this one a try  not that it is nearly as good as Vertigo how many films are but it is somewhat similar in tone.  It works much better as straight drama rather than as suspense or mystery and as such it is worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Paradine Case has gotten an undeserved bad reputation as one of Alfred Hitchcock's least interesting films simply because it does not use any of the gimmicks and brilliant visual touches Hitchcock is famous for a man being chased by a crop duster inventively shot murder scenes in locations such as the ones in Psycho people dangling from Mt. Rushmore unusual settings such as a cramped lifeboat. As if these touches were all that made Hitchcock great! If these touches are all we watch Hitchcock for it's as shallow a reason for watching films as going to see summer movies merely to see special effects. A great director like Hitchcock deserves more credit than that.The Paradine Case is on the contrary one of Hitchcock's most entertaining films if you are willing to concentrate on dialogue and characterization rather than flashy visuals. Gregory Peck is the barrister assigned to defend Mrs. Paradine a woman on trial for the coldblooded murder of her blind husband and it is immediately obvious that Peck is so besotted by this beautiful mysterious woman that he is in no position to be objective about his client. Peck does quite a good job but one can only wonder how Laurence Olivier who was busy filming Hamlet at the time and who was Hitchcock's first choice for the role might have played it. Hitchcock wanted Greta Garbo for the role of Mrs. Paradine but was unable to get her and settled for Alida Valli who is excellent if not as beautiful and mysterious as Garbo. Louis Jourdan plays a suspiciouslooking witness in the case but Hitchcock wanted Robert Newton famous for playing Long John Silver and other disreputable characters for the role and Newton would have provided a far more different and repulsive characterization apparently Hitchcock's intention.Charles Laughton unforgettably plays the judge at the trial as a sadist and a supremely dirty old man who hates Peck because Ann Todd as Peck's wife refused his advances once and Ethel Barrymore brilliant in her limited screen time is Laughton's intimidated and submissive wife.The majority of the film does take place in the courtroom but so does Witness for the Prosecution and no one has a bad word to say about that film. Would they have done so if Hitchcock had made that one? The Agatha Christie thriller doesn't contain any flashy visual touches either.Those who love Hitchcock for only his trademarks perhaps need to look a little harder and think a little deeper and then they will appreciate this excellent film.".

Louis Jourdan plays a suspiciouslooking witness in the case but Hitchcock wanted Robert Newton famous for playing Long John Silver and other disreputable characters for the role and Newton would have provided a far more different and repulsive characterization apparently Hitchcock's intention.Charles Laughton unforgettably plays the judge at the trial as a sadist and a supremely dirty old man who hates Peck because Ann Todd as Peck's wife refused his advances once and Ethel Barrymore brilliant in her limited screen time is Laughton's intimidated and submissive wife.The majority of the film does take place in the courtroom but so does Witness for the Prosecution and no one has a bad word to say about that film. Would they have done so if Hitchcock had made that one? The Agatha Christie thriller doesn't contain any flashy visual touches either.Those who love Hitchcock for only his trademarks perhaps need to look a little harder and think a little deeper and then they will appreciate this excellent film.";

	schema:headline " Hitchcock's Courtroom Fizzle";
	schema:reviewBody "There are some films that are forever lost that one wishes still existed the complete GREED and THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS Welles final cutfor examples. In the cinema of Alfred Hitchcock THE PARADINE CASE as he originally shot would have been of great interest. Whether it would have been better is another matter. THE PARADINE CASE is generally conceded as among Hitchcock's lesser films. It's most interesting parts of the performances of the leads except for Alida Valli who is quite dull and the famous sequence of the portrait of Valli whose eyes seem to follow the camera standing in for Gregory PeckAnthony Keane as it passes from one room to the next.Hitchcock told Francois Truffaut that he felt the casting was wrong. He wanted Greta Garbo for Mrs. Paradine but Selznick had Alida Valli signed up. He wanted Ronald Colman or Laurence Olivier as Keane but Selznick had Gregory Peck signed up. He did not want Louis Jourdan as LaTour but wanted Robert Newton. Again Selznick said no. As a result of our general respect for Hitchcock the suspense film artist we sympathize with his comments and dismiss Selznick as a bullying producer who destroyed a masterpiece. I seriously question this view.First of all David Selznick for most of his career as a producer was way ahead of the majority of such Hollywood figures because of his taste and ability. Anyone who could create GONE WITH THE WIND David COPPERFIELD SINCE YOU WENT AWAY and other high caliber movies is not one to dismiss so cavalierly. Most of the films he did with Hitchcock whom he brought to Hollywood in 1939 were very good films REBECCA SUSPICION SHADOW OF A DOUBT LIFEBOAT FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT  they were not crappy. Secondly he was aware of difficulties in getting performers Olivier was working in England in 1948. Colman was working mostly at MGM but was a bit too old for the role. And Peck was not an unknown talent He had worked with Hitchcock already. As for Garbo she had been in retirement for six years and there was no sign she was interested in a film comeback. The Jourdan  Newton problem is another matter. LaTour in the film is Colonel Paradine's loyal batman now a valet and groom on the estate. Mrs. Paradine has made a play for his affections and he has rejected them out of loyalty to his master. Hitchcock felt that Robert Newton with his physical appearance would have looked more like a man who worked in the mire of a stable than Louis Jourdan did although as Jourdan remained the Colonel's personal servant that seemed a minor casting point in favor of Newton. Hitchcock also skirted the issue soon to be handled in ROPE STRANGERS ON A TRAIN and NORTH BY NORTHWEST of a homosexual relationship between his characters. LaTour was supposed to be more openly close to the Colonel in Hitchcock's opinion. But it was a 1948 film  how close was the relationship supposed to be? Furthermore Selznick as producer would be aware of one defect regarding Newton not found in Hitchcock's account to Truffaut Newton's alcoholism. Given the size of Newton's benders he was a poor risk in most film acting roles no matter how available he was. Not so with Louis Jourdan. The film was brought in under 93 days and that record would not have been possible if Newton had been in the cast and kept getting drunk. As for the homosexual relationship it never is fleshed at all in the film. But would a 1948 audience have been willing to accept that? I don't think so.The supporting players particularly Ann Todd Charles Laughton as the sadistic Mr. Justice Lord Hawfield and Ethel Barrymore as Lady Hawfield gave good accounts of themselves in the film especially Laughton as the Judge who takes out his frustrations with Mrs. Keane ANN TODD to wreck her husband's case. His best scene where he compares a walnut to a human brain sums up the character's beastliness. I think that what Hitchcock fans fail to notice here is that it is Hitch's only real courtroom film. While his characters face hearings and sentencing in court like in the start of NOTORIOUS they rarely are shown being tried. I CONFESS is an exception  and the bulk of the film is not a trial. Here the bulk of the film is the trial of the antiheroine Mrs. Paradine. It is not typical Hitchcock and fails to fascinate the audience. The highpoint is the verbal clashes between Laughton and Peck sometimes assisted by Leo G. Carroll as the prosecutor Jourdan's collapse in the witness box when Keane attacks him for secretly betraying his master with the defendant and Valli's final condemnation of Keane in court. But the circumstances and the dialog do not fascinate the viewers. Compare the way the trial in THE PARADINE CASE compares with those in Billy Wilder's WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION and in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. Laughton's Sir Wilfred Robarts enlivens the film and his tactics in attacking Torin Thatcher's case for the prosecution of Tyrone Power are solid and interesting in the former. Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch in defending Brock Peters on a rape charge in a segregated bigoted South are cutting and sensible. The key is the script  both of those films have better scripts based on better writings Agatha Christie and Harper Lee than the Robert Hitchens novel. One can bemoan the loss of the three hour version or the 119 minute version that we lack now but if it was anything as dull as the slow moving courtroom sequences of the currently extant film I doubt that any improvement would have appeared.".

	schema:headline " Lives up to its reputation";
	schema:reviewBody "Why does this movie seem so dull? The acting isn't bad once you get past Gregory Peck's British accent. None of the performances are outstanding they're just not bad. The roles restrict the performers' range. I think Alida Valli smiles once. Louis Jourdan seems to have only one expression a bitter barely controlled anger. If he tried to smile he might crack. The actor given the best lines is Charles Laughton who hams it up and brings a bit of life to the screen. Remarkable how the convolutions of a walnut resemble those of the human brain. And that flabby sweaty palm as he takes the hand of Peck's wife squeezes it lasciviously and places it on his thigh.Well I can think of three reasons why it's dull. 1 It's overwritten. The script needed somebody like Daryl F. Zanuck to hack out some of the underbrush. Peck is questioning Valli in court. It goes something like this Peck What did you say to Latour. Valli I told him to leave the room. Peck But why did you tell him to leave? Valli Because I no longer wanted him present. Peck And why did you no longer want him present? Valli His presence was disturbing. And so on. How did the jury stay awake? Some of the scenes are pointless. Not the sort of interesting meanders you might find in other Hitchcock movies. Just pointless. Peck visits a country house to talk to Latour who promises to show him the garden and then beats it pronto. An hour or two later Latour shows up banging on the window of Peck's room at the inn having changed his mind for no apparent reason. The fiveminute conversation that follows could have been condensed into half that time and benefited from some supplementary bits of business. Instead the two adversaries sit there like mahogany idols hiding information from one another. That's a poor script for you.2 Hitchcock's imagination seems to have been asleep during the shooting. Perhaps the director himself was asleep. It happened from time to time. It isn't necessary for every Hitchcock film to have a bravura shot in it. The camera needn't always swing down from an upper story and wind up with a closeup of the key in someone's hand. But there is maybe one shot in this flick that bespeaks Hitchcock. When Andre Latour is first called into the courtroom as a witness Hitchcock keeps the camera focused on Valli's face in the defendant's chair and circles it slowly around her so that we see Jourdan walking slowly into the room past her behind her and can almost feel her incandescent desire to turn around and look directly at him. 3 Hitchcock had a great sense of humor and it's entirely absent from this movie. It must in fact rank among the least humorous films he's ever made. And it's surprising because he was usually able to insert some piece of business into even his most serious works. Not including Vertigo. Often the humor centers around meals. A dowager stubs out a cigarette in a jar of cold cream or the yolk of a fried egg. A police inspector is forced to eat fancy dishes that a Kurdish camel driver would turn up his nose at. Or the humor lies in montage as in The Man Who Knew Too Much when Jimmy Stewart escapes from a clumsy setto with the staff at a taxidermist's and the scene ends with a shot of a stuffed lion's head gaping at the slammed door. SOMEthing anyway to lighten things up. But not here. Put it all together and you have a pretty dull movie one of the several serial flops that Hitchcock ground out in the postwar period. It isn't exactly painful to sit through. It's just that it's not very enjoyable.".

Valli His presence was disturbing. And so on. How did the jury stay awake? Some of the scenes are pointless. Not the sort of interesting meanders you might find in other Hitchcock movies. Just pointless. Peck visits a country house to talk to Latour who promises to show him the garden and then beats it pronto. An hour or two later Latour shows up banging on the window of Peck's room at the inn having changed his mind for no apparent reason. The fiveminute conversation that follows could have been condensed into half that time and benefited from some supplementary bits of business. Instead the two adversaries sit there like mahogany idols hiding information from one another. That's a poor script for you.2 Hitchcock's imagination seems to have been asleep during the shooting. Perhaps the director himself was asleep. It happened from time to time. It isn't necessary for every Hitchcock film to have a bravura shot in it. The camera needn't always swing down from an upper story and wind up with a closeup of the key in someone's hand. But there is maybe one shot in this flick that bespeaks Hitchcock. When Andre Latour is first called into the courtroom as a witness Hitchcock keeps the camera focused on Valli's face in the defendant's chair and circles it slowly around her so that we see Jourdan walking slowly into the room past her behind her and can almost feel her incandescent desire to turn around and look directly at him. 3 Hitchcock had a great sense of humor and it's entirely absent from this movie. It must in fact rank among the least humorous films he's ever made. And it's surprising because he was usually able to insert some piece of business into even his most serious works. Not including Vertigo. Often the humor centers around meals. A dowager stubs out a cigarette in a jar of cold cream or the yolk of a fried egg. A police inspector is forced to eat fancy dishes that a Kurdish camel driver would turn up his nose at. Or the humor lies in montage as in The Man Who Knew Too Much when Jimmy Stewart escapes from a clumsy setto with the staff at a taxidermist's and the scene ends with a shot of a stuffed lion's head gaping at the slammed door. SOMEthing anyway to lighten things up. But not here. Put it all together and you have a pretty dull movie one of the several serial flops that Hitchcock ground out in the postwar period. It isn't exactly painful to sit through. It's just that it's not very enjoyable.";

	schema:reviewBody "With all the proficiency in production for which both Hollywood veterans were recognized David O. Selznick and Alfred Hitchcock seemed to go halves in creative effort on a polished piece of stagnant entertainment in their ceremonial Paradine Case. Dub it a mystery melodrama even if that doesn't completely sum it up any more than it did Rebecca a preceding much superior production by the two. Classify it as a romantic courtroom wouldbe tragedy alongside a marriage soap opera. It's all of these things rolled together in one intermittently interesting movie effortlessly told via Hitchcock's sophisticated camera.If you recall the lingering distress which Rebecca the apparition femme fatale of that film set off all the other characters albeit she herself was dead that's the kind of shadowy trouble that the poised Mrs. Paradine affects all the characters in this narrative except she's quite alive. Nevertheless her husband a blind man is dead and she's on trial for his murder. The story itself has much prospective tension especially putting Mrs. Paradine at the hub of the drama. It's never cut and dried what she's up to and though the seductive effect of a woman under suspicion on a man with influence is and was nothing new the plot progresses on its own distinctive path as she is a distinctive character. The issue is that unlike Hitchcock's British films this American Hitchcock film set in Britain dulls the blade of the dramatic elements and turns. Hitchcock's camera has a way of acting like an adept trial lawyer whirring calmly along with customary material and swiftly punctuating with fluent theatrics and also unsurprisingly the movie's furnishings have a lush David O. Selznick guise. However despite Hitchcock's simplistic mastery of when and how to move the camera each scene is a dialogue piece that I to my own surprise found would be much more impactful in other perhaps grittier and more contemporary hands.Slowly overemotionally but gracefully enough this picture files the potentially much more intriguing story of the eponymous widow's swaying lure over many who are impinged on by her trial in addition to a predetermined eyeopener to the nature of the character herself. It makes a pale wink at the covetousness she provokes in the officiating judge a typically sharptongued Charles Laughton whose urbane hostility has altogether sent his wife over the edge another powerful narrative element that seems to have been glossed over. There's also disquieting suggestion of Mrs. Paradine's clutch on her husband's valet a man upon whom keen suspicion is aimed before and during the trial though mainly it follows the zeal she rouses in the stiffpostured man appointed as her defending counsel and of the torment this causes his wife.Gregory Peck is fervent as the prominent young London barrister who lets his heart callously ensnared by his client control his head while Ann Todd would be much more persuasively griefstricken as his wife were it not for Franz Waxman's gushy score being poured on her every word like syrup. Italian import Alida Valli makes the confined Mrs. Paradine a composite of inscrutability ambiguity and sensuality and Louis Jourdan is pretty intense as the harassed valet.It isn't a momentous Hitchcock effort by a long shot save to the degree that it infers the cave dweller beneath everyone's practiced etiquette and concrete integrity and barristers' wigs. And it isn't a momentous script either for the intent of cinema that is developed by Selznick himself from Robert Hichens' novel. After a hazy buildup of evidence and of passion in the lawyer's heart the story finally goes into a static but enthralling courtroom and thankfully remains there for most of the second hour.".

	schema:headline " Crushing Out In Old Bailey";
	schema:reviewBody "This was Gregory Peck's second and last film with Alfred Hitchcock. He plays an English barrister who starts crushing out on his beautiful client who in this case is Alida Valli. Kind of hard to understand because at home he's got a porcelain goddess in the person of Ann Todd who definitely rates as one of Hitchcock's cool blonds. I guess Valli had a touch of the exotic for him as she did for Joseph Cotten in The Third Man.For an English based film most of the cast is American. The English in this film are Charles Laughton Ann Todd Leo G. Carroll and Joan Tetzel. Had Hitchcock had his way he would have gotten Sir Laurence Olivier over here to play Peck's part. Peck does his best but I think Olivier would have been really something in the part. His performance as George Hurstwood in Carrie which is a similar role proves that.Peck is suggested as counsel by Charles Coburn solicitor for Alida Valli. She's been arrested for allegedly poisoning her rich and blind husband who was a war hero. The only other one around when the crime occurred was valet Louis Jourdan.The thing I've always found curious about The Paradine Case is that while Peck's courtroom skills are brilliant as he tries alternative theories of the crime he still allows himself to be ruled by the client because of his male member. A lawyer not so emotionally involved would have just sat Valli down and told her the legal facts of life. Valli refuses to let that happen.Among the supporting cast look for a deliciously malevolent performance as Judge Horfield by Charles Laughton. Both at home where during a dinner party he makes a clumsy attempt to seduce Ann Todd and later on in court where during the trial he slams Peck at every opportunity. Laughton is a picture of corpulent corruption.In the films of Alfred Hitchcock the most expensive part of the film is the set of Old Bailey courtroom which is completely rebuilt to scale. The set is quite impressive. Although Hitchcock had experimented with a one set film with Rope and later on Dial M for Murder was done almost entirely in a small apartment the set really is most like the set in Rear Window. Nearly the entire cast is present in Old Bailey each in his assigned location like the people in the courtyard apartments in Rear Window. Visually I find it quite impressive. Although Peck is not well cast he's a good enough player to overcome the obstacles. The Paradine Case did not do as much for him as his earlier film for Hitchcock Spellbound. Still it hurt no one's careers by association with it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I disagree with many respondents who find major flaws in this minimasterpiece of cinema. The Paradine Case concentrates on witty wellwritten dialog to create complex characters and to move the action along. Since postmodern audiences especially those under thirty have been spawned on action flicks or blockbuster special effects a classic intricate wordoriented drama forces them to work harder than they're willing. Those who don't appreciate words will rarely honor great film writing instead they will base success or failure of a movie on whether it's bloated with computer animated flash.In The Paradine Case the subtle gestures the characters employ like the grasping of Ann Todd's hand by Charles Laughtin as she slyly calmly cleverly uses parlor room banter to rebuff his advances are brilliant. Some of the lines in the film are equally understated yet profoundly amazing. Gregory Peck and Todd so gracefully inhabit their characters that they make the acting seem effortless so effortless that some may overlook the excellence of their performances in this fine film.One test of a great movie is whether the conflict strongly continues the momentum in every scene and in The Paradine Case conflict is present in each deftly crafted moment.Ethel Barrymore is superb. Her facial gestures her hand wringing her breathless fear and trepidation her pathetic love for the cruel but brilliant attorney Laughtin is academy award winning. Every actorcharacter in this wonderful film shines. In this movie the artful use of shadows and light the cinematography the costuming the script the directing ALL contribute to the overall creativity of this rare cinematic treat.The Paradine Case can teach modern wouldbe film makers a great deal. The 3 million dollar price tag on this movie an astronomical amount for 1947 was money well spent. Anyone who appreciates classic filmmaking should see this picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alfred Hitchcock is a director too well known by his trademarks.  His career spanning five decades has been summarised and typified and broken down and examined so often by so many that we have drawn a caricature of his style.  We know precisely what we want from a Hitchcock film.  We want an innocent accused and on the run we want a playful camera a streak of black humour a gimmicky setup a McGuffin an icecold tease.  Any combination of these trademarks adds up to Hitchcock.  Any combination used by another director adds up to Hitchcockian.With such a fixed and narrow idea of what makes a Hitchcock film it's no surprise to see many complain The Paradine Case is a disappointment.  We don't want him to explore new territory.  We want what we want.  That the film lacks many of his trademarks should not be a criticism.  It should instead come as a pleasant surprise that one of cinema's greatest directors was far more versatile than our caricature admits.In The Paradine Case Gregory Peck is Anthony Keane a brilliant lawyer making a name for himself in England's green and pleasant courtrooms.  He's married to a woman who worships him envied by lawyers everywhere on his way to the top.  Life is good.  It gets more complicated when he is hired by Mrs Paradine a cold but beautiful woman accused of murdering her husband. Keane finds himself falling for her obsessed with her his judgment impaired by his infatuation.  That's the plot explained pretty much in its entirety a waferthin story that sometimes has trouble filling its running time.  But while this is some way below classic Hitchcock with or without the trademarks it's a worthwhile film one that deserves a better reputation.Its first half is a little weak.  Not much happens beyond Peck looking vaguely troubled but what we have here is real emotion and its consequences  rare indeed for Hitchcock.  If we can approach this as a drama and not a thriller the threat of romantic fantasy on a practical marriage is quite engaging.  The second half of the film picks up the pace as it turns into a courtroom drama.  Here we see how blinded Peck has been that his concentration has been focused on what Paradine feels for him and every other man in her life that he has betrayed her by ignoring the needs of his client.There are some fine performances that elevate the film further.  Peck is typically restrained and moral as Keane his English accent convincing but troubled by vowels.  Charles Laughton impresses as a sleazy biased judge. Alida Valli is suitably frosty as Paradine but in its female characters the film is very much of its time.  The four main women represent four stereotypes loved by Hollywood.  In Mrs Paradine we have a coldhearted temptress able to ruin a man with a single pout.  In Peck's wife we have an adoring child loyal to the point of stupidity forgiving her husband's roving eye.  In her friend the daughter of Peck's colleague we have the inappropriately intelligent and feisty young woman.  Naturally she's unmarried.  In Laughton's wife we have the submissive downtrodden creature controlled by weak emotions.  They are uncomfortable clichs but avoiding them would mean avoiding anything made before the 1970s so we'll just have to let them go.There is more to enjoy if you're a fan of invented subtext and the psychobabble that has Hitchcock lusting after his leading ladies.  The Paradine Case comes from a novel by Robert Hichens and was adapted by Hitchcock's wife Alma Reville.  Here we can see Hitchcock as Keane Paradine as any number of leading ladies and Reville as Keane's forgiving but wounded wife.  If you want to imagine more subtext you could have fun with the fact Keane's wife is called Gay.  But we'll leave that for the film students determined to read anything into everything.The Paradine Case is a solid effort but it's easy to see why it's not better remembered.  There's no crop duster no challenge no kicker of an idea no black humour and only one standout shot.  Perhaps your opinion of it depends on what expectations you bring to it.  If you're only after Hitchcock's trademarks you'll be disappointed.  If instead you're prepared to see him as a more versatile director who naturally returned to familiar themes through his fifty year career maybe you'll appreciate this more. It's belowaverage Hitchcock but an aboveaverage film and had there been another name attached its reputation would be quite different.".

The edginess of the film comes in the uncomfortable way Keane obsesses over Mrs Paradine which hurts his wife Gay Ann Todd. The casting of goodlooking Louis Jordan is often cited as a weakness but I think he was fine  Hitchcock and producer David O Selznick just hit a nerve with the whole thing.If ever there were two men who knew something about obsessing over beautiful women it was Selznick and Hitchcock.Selznick's adoration of his wife Jennifer Jones beginning with cuttingin on her first marriage is well known. Hitchcock famously obsessed over just about all of his leading ladies culminating in all that weird stuff with Tippi Hedren.Here the main character's destructive obsession with a beautiful duplicitous woman was a warmup for Hitchcock's Vertigo made ten years later. The telling scene is when Keane first meets Mrs Paradine and observes that her blind husband didn't realise the sacrifice his wife had made in marrying him because he hadn't seen her  Anna Paradine knows she's got Anthony Keane hook line and sinker.Although she wasn't one of his famous blondes Hitchcock and cinematographer Lee Garmes went to town on her look. Alida Valli was stunning and that haunting beauty was never captured more effectively than in this film.The cast is fabulous. If you are a Laughton fan this is one of his best. It's a delicious performance but he is totally odious as Judge Tommy Horfield complete with cruel observations on the impermanence of beauty.This film is a class act from beginning to end and Franz Waxman's velvety score gives it a sumptuous quality.I think Hitchcock fans can watch his best films over and over Rear Window North by Northwest and others  The Paradine Case is one I would add to the list.".

	schema:headline " Premonition  Through My Eyes";
	schema:reviewBody "I feel as though I perhaps see more into movies than either a what  may actually be meant or b what others may see in the film. This could  be true with this movie as well but I think it is the latter.  With many movies it is difficult to give a real review without giving  away much of what needs to be experienced first hand. That is  definitely the case with Premonition. So first I will say that the  exhausting but powerful performance by Bullock was commendable. She was  in every single scene and the toll must have been heavy. She pulled it  off with gold stars.  The story was very unique. The dialogue did not stand out as  incredible but you have to understand that this is almost a one woman  show. So far I see no flaws in the writing. I will watch it again but  I think that most of the common confusions with the stories lines can  be explained.  The movie goes back and forth and you really need to pay attention and  have a great sense of time. It can be tricky to figure out if what is  happening is past present or future. But if I could figure it outI am  sure anyone can.  Now I want to discuss what this movie said to me. It may however be a  gateway to spoilers. So if you plan on watching this movie and want to  do so with a fresh headdo not read any further. Just know that it is a  movie worth watching you need to pay attention and definitely open  your mind.  Bullock's character in the film was a housewife with a husband and 2  daughters. She was a stay at home mom and it was clear that she had  been experiencing some depression prior to the news of her husband's  death. Through out the movie you go back and forth through moments when  her husband is dead and alive. After she learns of his death she  experiences lapses in time when she seems to jump through timelines in  her life changing little experiences here and there that impact the  next timeline. Does that make sense? Anyway. She learns he was about to  have an affair and for a moment decides she prefers him dead and that  even though she thinks she MAY be able to help avoid his death she  wonders if she should even do that. We learn during these times that  their relationship was on its last breaths. They seem almost resentful  and bitter towards one another. She then has a conversation with a  clergyman and asks his opinion on what she canshould do. He basically  tells her that she needs to find something to fight forsomething to be  hopeful about. She finally decides that she wants to not only save her  husband but their marriage. The night before she thinks he is going to  die she explains to him in very little words  mostly tasteful and  romantic actions that she wants their marriage to survive. They end up  making love. The next day she wakes up and it is the day he is to die.  She does what she can to stop it. She finally gets in touch with him on  his cell phone and tells him that she knows all about the affair and  that she doesn't care  she loves him. They exchange 'I loves yous' a  few times and she sees his car ahead of hers right at the spot he was  suppose to die. She tells him to turn around  thinking that will  change the course and he would survive. But when he does this a gas  tanker hits his car  obviously killing him.  She wakes at the end you know it is months later and she has a  pregnant belly.  She was able to changes the details in her life. She was able to  forgive her husband before he died instead of him dying while they  both lived in contempt of one another. She was able to come to terms  with the possibility of his death instead of the sudden shock. She was  able to allow him to spend some quality time with his children knowing  she may not be able to stop his demise. And of course she was able to  create another child  one that would have never existed otherwise. But  she was not able to change his ultimate fate. She was not able to stop  his death.  This is how the film spoke to me being a depressed housewife and  mother whose marriage has seen better days We can change how we behave  and react in our lives right now. We can decide to make our lives  better for the moments we are in presently. We can make little changes  that can affect us forever. But we truly have little control over our  ultimate fate. And when it comes down to it  we all have the same  fate death. It can come when we least expect it. It can come after a  long hideous illness. But it will come. What we need to do is live our  lives for the happiness and love that sit in our paths right now. RIGHT  NOW.  Not a new theory. Nothing I am saying hasn't been heard a million times  before. But perhaps this needs to be drilled into our heads  though  movies music books newswe need to start living the way we deep down  know we should. You want to know the meaning of life? This is it my  friends. As simple as that. Life is short. Live love give and  appreciate. Period.  Most of us won't have the opportunities the characters had in this  movie. We need to take those opportunities now because instead of  waking up to yesterdaywe may not wake up at all.".

It is a fairly well done thought provoking experience and is carried by some better than average performances by a strong cast.The Hanson family is introduced as the husband Jim Julian McMahon and wife Linda Sandra Bullock buy their new home. Jump forward after the credits to a family that now includes two young schoolgirls Shyann McClure and Courtney Taylor Burness a seemingly mildly depressed Linda and a workaholic Jim. Abruptly Linda is informed by a police officer that Jim has died in an auto accident and her close friend Nia Long and mother Irene Ziegler help Linda through the early moments of the tragedy. Yet Linda continues to 'relive' moments one day Jim is dead the next he is alive and all of the pieces of the puzzle that erode Linda's mind become clues to investigate information she doesn't want to know. She encounters a warped psychiatrist Peter Stormare and a possible 'other woman' in Jim's life Amber Valletta and as she attempts to mold the puzzle pieces to make sense she learns about the possible 'why' of the mental state in which she is trapped.The film has problems holding credibility but then the premise is a novel enough to allow such missteps. Sandra Bullock takes over this role completely gains our empathy and in the end the film works because of her. She is becoming an actress who is learning the value of understatement and that aspect of her craft serves her well. No this is not a great movie but it is a wellproduced little mystery that asks the audience to engage both mind and imagination and that is a good thing! Grady Harp".

It is quite well shot and Sandra Bullock does a commendable job carrying the whole film. However the writing is a letdown and the background score acts as a spoiler. The supporting cast does not stand out much as they are not given much to do. Julian McMahon is quite okay. 'Premonition' pretty much turns out just to be another one of those thrillers that one can watch once and then forget. Towards the end the writer throws in the religious angle Bullock's character was not portrayed as someone religious or one who lost faith thus this does not quite fit which looks forced and of course the usual Hollywood ending. It is not exactly a boring film as one would sit through it till the end. Mostly because we are interested to know what happens to Linda Bullock makes us care about her. Other than that the film creates a mood that keeps the viewer somewhat involved.".

And Sandra Bullock held herself quite nicely throughout the film putting forward one of her better performances.That being said the entire film comes to a screeching halt with one of the sloppiest endings I have ever seen. It was bad enough that I could see the crux of the finale from a mile away. But what pounded it in further was that this crux comprised the entirety of the conclusion. Not only is it not enough to be the ending but it resolves nothing. When the screen faded to black and credits began to roll the entire audience where I was began to chuckle and I could hear a chorus of Is that it? That's the ending?This is one of those films that could be enjoyable so long as the viewer stopped before the final scene. Even that might leave the viewer feeling let down but not nearly so as having to watch what is surely the sorriest excuse for a finale I've seen in a professional film in a long time. Premonition showed lots of promise and delivered throughout but collapses just before the finish line. A wasted opportunity for all those involved and sadly so.".

The lack of consistency in this movie was incompetent and lazy.Another problem with the movie was its feeble attempt to present a deep message without providing it. Although there was a pretense about the importance of love and faith it was her decision to honor her love for her husband that led her to attempt to save her husband's life. Ultimately this love resulted in his death. The decision to honor this love was partly influenced by a discussion about faith with her priest. So her faith caused his death. If what happened to her happened to me I'd throw faith out the window and never set foot in a church again.Simply put this movie shows a lack of respect for the intelligence of audiences.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here's a clue on how to watch this movie If you're looking to be disappointed based on any inconsistencies pay closer attention to the movie. The socalled inconsistencies are actually based on a series of events that combine to actually change many of the things you end up seeing happening early on in the movie. Remember The events that you see happening on the screen aren't happening linearly. The calendar hops all over the place throughout the movie so it is possible for events that transpire one day to effect what ends up happening in future days. There are two days that are especially noteworthy in terms of what would change the events of the future and they happen toward the end of the movie. Think of how these events will affect the other events that happen in the future and remember that as you see what happens at the end of the movie.I think the reason this movie hasn't been garnering a lot of critical praise is because movie critics don't really want to have to utilize logic while watching a movie. Another poorly reviewed film starring Sandra Bullock the truly brilliant The Lake House was an even bigger victim of movie critics' pathetically anemic logic processing skills. In watching both movies you really have to keep your faculties alert and not lull yourself into a sense of okay I can just turn my brain off now. And really even though this movie isn't as good as The Lake House it is equally blessed with the beautiful talented Ms. Bullock on top of featuring the beautiful talented Nia Long the totally likable Julian McMahon and some very good acting by the child actors. And the film is very beautiful to look at too I now understand why Bullock was raving about the cinematography and direction.So please do see this movie and don't be dissuaded by the negative remarks. You really do have to pay attention to this film in order to enjoy it but once you do pay attention you will be richly rewarded. I'm glad I went to see it and so should you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite the rather thorough drubbing it suffered at the hands of some of the nation's most prestigious critics Premonition is actually a pretty wellthoughtout and tightly wound thriller given emotion and heart by its star Sandra Bullock. It's not a movie I would be wiling to go to the mat for but as throwaway thrillers go this one is really not half bad. Bullock plays Linda Quinn Hanson a suburban mother of two who receives the shattering news that her husband has been killed in an auto accident. However when she wakes up the next morning she finds him strangely sitting in the kitchen suddenly alive and well benignly sipping coffee before heading off to work. The question quickly arises did she dream the story of his death is she dreaming now or is she undergoing some sort of mental crisis precipitated by the shock of her loss? Or is she caught in some sort of bizarre time warp that allows her to jump back and forth between the periods before and after his death and if so might she be able to step in and alter the course of events to prevent the accident from happening in the first place? In both concept and form Premonition is pretty much an assemblyline thriller designed to tweak the audience's brain cells for a couple of hours before sending everyone home with not a whole heck of a lot left to think about once it's over. Still it's intriguing enough while it lasts and only the true nitpickers among us will feel compelled to put its twists and turns in logic under the scrutiny of a critical microscope. Despite a few weak moments in her performance Bullock actually makes us care about the character and the very strange thing that is happening to her.The Premonition is by no means a classic  or even first rate  chiller but those with a few spare hours on their hands and a penchant for brainpuzzlers could do worse than check it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had expectations for what this film was going to be like. It fell short horribly. Maybe I had too great of expectations. The movie starts out really well and is strong for a while. As it progresses there are plot holes. It goes through all the days in a week and there are inconsistencies between the days. A lot of the occurrences work out as the days progress but some of them don't and just leave you wondering why did they think that? they knew what really happened. Even if Sandra doesn't know what happened in the previous days everyone else does and at points they blatantly don't seem to know about things they should. Also Sandra will do things on a later day of the week because of something that happened earlier in the week. Why is she doing those activities if she does not know about the earlier events yet? It's tough when dealing with time to work out all the kinks. At some points it seems like the movie works out but then some things don't. I thought Sandra's acting was solid she gave a good performance. The daughters were also good little actresses. McMahon's performance was bad. He puts out nothing until the very end where it looks like he is actually showing emotion. I don't think he was well suited to the role.The ending seemed to negate the entire point of the movie. It's the only ending that could make sense I guess and yet it did not fit. It left all of us in the theater wondering Is that it? That's how it ends?! It resolves nothing and leaves you with a bad taste. The very end of the movie is also a huge clich that I wish the movie would just have avoided. Over all I thought the movie was entertaining for a while. Then it lost its steam. I will probably not see it again once is enough. It's a good movie if you don't analyze things. If you simply want to watch a movie then maybe you'll enjoy it. However if you prefer to also think about what you've seen this probably isn't the movie for you.".

There were a few good scares even.The moment I saw the title on the poster a few months back I thought to myself 'How can this do anything different that the Final Destination series hasn't?'

This movie was put together amazingly and seemed very original to me.The only flaws I see with this movie is that you seen the end coming from 34 through the movie and I sympathized more at the beginning of the film rather then the end.

I don't even know how else to describe it except disappointing. As others have pointed out there were some inconsistencies in the plot but they could have been explained by Linda changing the future by knowing what is going to happen before it does except that it only happens when it is convenient for the director as in the daughter who is fine the first day  Thursday when we later see that she ran through a glass door on Tuesday. But despite that I enjoyed the movie until the end and I guess a lot of people feel that way. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie unless you have nothing better to do and it is free.".

This was a very interesting movie and worked upon an original idea and executed it in an above average manner. The only gripes I had with it were that the priest in the end and Dr. Roth were casted very poorly and detracted from the punch in the end. Speaking of the ending it wasn't nearly as a let down as people say on here either. Not quite a movie I'd see more than once but it kept me interested and entertained until the end what more could you ask for? The scenery and cinematography were excellent and the whole movie seemed like it took place either at sunrise or at sunset which added a serene and quiet backdrop to it which I noticed right away. The soundtrack was fantastic and right up there with the Sixth Sense in terms of effectiveness none of it got in the way of the action.I highly recommend this movie to families and couples it's a great way to forget about the outside world for an hour or so!

It must all add up so that there are no plot holes but half way through the film the writers and director drop the ball and make a large continuity error which ruined the film from there on in a lost more interest as the film went on.The characters were also not likable and you really don't care what happens to them i had no vested emotions in anyone...except maybe the husband who i felt sorry because he was married to such a wet blanket.In the end you are left feeling depressed and wonder why they bothered to even make the film.

It must all add up so that there are no plot holes but half way through the film the writers and director drop the ball and make a large continuity error which ruined the film from there on in a lost more interest as the film went on.The characters were also not likable and you really don't care what happens to them i had no vested emotions in anyone...except maybe the husband who i felt sorry because he was married to such a wet blanket.In the end you are left feeling depressed and wonder why they bothered to even make the film. Avoid this film.";

	schema:reviewBody "I really had no interest in seeing Premonition the trailer in itself looked very confusing but it was my friend's pick tonite so her me and a few friends saw it and it pretty much lived up to our expectations. I mean it was a little better but the story just in some ways did not work and not to mention that the ending was a disappointment. Because I do not want to give any spoilers I'm not going to give away anything but there is a daughter who is injured in the movie and her injuries are a continuity problem throughout the film like the first scene but you'll see what I mean.Linda is a mother and wife pretty typical days that usually involve taking the kids to school working out and cleaning house. She is also involved in a marriage that has lost it's spark but unfortunately one day she finds out that he was killed in a car accident. But the next day she wakes up and he's alive! Day by day it changes where he is dead then alive then dead then alive but slowly she puts the pieces together by writing herself a day by day diary and finds out truly what happened.The acting was alright and the story just could have been better. The ending was a little off you'll see what I mean. But the story just had some flaws that I couldn't get by it was just an average thriller that you could figure out in the first hour if you are used to the suspense thrillers. So I would recommend you wait this one for a rental it's nothing exciting just an alright movie that you might enjoy at home.510".

	schema:reviewBody "The major flaw of this movie is it's script. The idea's involved are not well thought out and at time's it feels as though there were parts of the movie that were written out. The character that Bullock plays is a tool of destiny meaning that she receives this information we'll get to why in a bit and instead of trying to prevent it she takes every step she can to move towards it. For example early on when she flashes to after her husband's death she finds she has been prescribed lithium and the doctor who prescribed it to her would in fact commit her. When she tries to find this doctor in the phone book she finds that the page with his name has been torn out. Now flash forward to the past before the husband death and logic should dictate do not contact the doctor but of course this does not happen. Instead she immediately goes to the phone book and mockshock rips the page out goes to his office and tells him that her husband is going to die and that she knows this because she is living her life out of order and mockshock the doctor prescribes her lithium. This is about the time where a normal person would think maybe I should try to change this... Once again no. In fact at no point does anyone try to discover if this can be prevented. Bullock more or less hurdles towards the end where mockshock she finds she is the reason behind the husbands accident and she can't save him because everything she has done was the cause of it. Now on to the truly ridiculous. The reasoning that we're giving for Bullock's problem is her loss of faith in god however we never see where she looses her faith. In fact other than the priest saying it's been a while since he's seen her we have no reason to think she even had faith in god.The inconsistencies in the movie are even worse. The daughter of Bullock on Tuesday of this insane week. Runs through a pane of glass slashing her face up however on Wednesday when we first see the girl there is no sign of this at all. Also Bullock is at the scene of the horrid accident when it occurs which begs the question why did the cops have to come and tell her. Finally the only person who believes her at all is in fact her husband proved by that fact that he triples his life insurance policy the day of his death... but he doesn't even ask how he dies!!! No one not even the man who dies tries to prevent this from happening until 5 minutes before it happens. The list does go on but I'm afraid I'd have to publish a book in order to list them all. Simply put the script was awful the characters were beyond stupid the camera work brought back thoughts of the Blair Witch and it was extremely predictable. This is basically a glorified Lifetime movie.".

Part of the big letdown is that the trailer made out the movie to be a thriller or a mystery but the psychotic jumble of outofsequence of scenes became tedious instead of interesting.The husband's character was lame and shallow. I kept thinking why is she even married to this oaf? He had no personality whatsoever partly because he had very few lines in the movie. I blame this on whomever wrote the script. Did we even believe for a second that the husband cares for her? The husband was such a jerk by the time the movie ended I actually WANTED him to die.Also after the accident with the sliding glass door the husband says why didn't you put stickers up?. He was accusing his wife of being guilty for his own daughter's stupidity. How dumb was that? Having grown up with sliding glass doors my whole life we never put stickers on ours and little kids didn't try to run through the glass. That scene was very unrealistic.The ending was just plain stupid. The husband turns his car around on the WRONG side of a hill  if he got killed he deserved to for being such an idiot. If Sandra's character really wanted to save him she should have told him to get out of the car and run up the hill. You wouldn't tell him to turn around and block traffic. Once again stupid and unrealistic!! Finally my main complaint is that the movie itself has lots of dramatic moments that you make a mental note of and then they are never explained. You find out at the end that none of them mean anything. I don't like being highjacked at the end by being told that the whole film had been meaningless.I give this movie a grade of D minus.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me first start out that the premise of the story is interesting but the script and the execution of it was off and in some scenes waaaay off. This is about a woman played by Sandra Bullock who gets a strange phone call and then she gets a knock on the door and a policeman informs her that her husband was killed in an auto accident.That night she sleeps and wakes up to find that her husband is alive and nothing bad has happened. She keeps going forward and then backward in time. This is all causing her to question her sanity. On top of that she suspects that her husband is cheating which is causing her conflicted emotions.Now this seems interesting and it was to a degree but the execution and certain scenes just made this movie suck big time. For instance there was a scene where she could not believe that her husband's body was in the coffin that was inside a hearse. As the pallbearers were taking the coffin out she grabs at the coffin to see who is in the coffin. Well this causes the coffin to be dropped and the top half of the coffin to be ripped out of the coffin where a head pops out and rolls around the ground. I can tell you that I busted out laughing so hard that tears were streaming down my face. I mean what kind of coffin is it that the top half just falls apart and then like a scene from Jackass the head starts rolling around on the ground? I mention Jackass because there was a scene where Johnny Knoxville was driving a hearse up a hill and the coffin slid out and a body burst out causing people to gasp in horror. The creators of the movie must of thought of that when they made this scene.Another laughable scene was where the daughter runs around the house and manages to burst through the glass door to the patio and her face is all cut from the broken glass. Can such a thing happen? Possibly but this kid was not going full tilt straight to the glass door but rather was lazily running to the glass door. Now I don't know about you guys but I have a glass door myself that leads to back of the house and I have had kids hit the glass door and nothing like that has happened.There were some CGI's in this movie that seem poorly done such as the bird and the bees scene.Overall a dumb movie.".

It was like time travelling.The scenes of the film were not put in the right order maybe because the pages of the storyboard got mixed up and it's like someone is constantly pressing the rewind  fast forward buttons on the remote control. Overall it is definitely overrated on IMDb and I completely forgot about it after 5 minutes when I seen it and makes no difference whether you watch it or not. Anyone who has rated the movie a 5 out of 10 or more must be fallen asleep and had a sweet dream and their rating is based on that dream so don't fall for it.".

He says I thought you were going to put up stickers I mean how long had they lived there anyway? Plus it made me mad that he still bought the farm because she was too stupid to say pull over right now instead of talking and driving. she should have said pull over get out and walk back to my car. or top the hill. him turning around in the road without looking was lame. him not getting out of his non starting car when he sees a jacknife truck coming at him lame. shes yelling for him to get out the car when the roof is crushing in and then it blows up. she didn't know what was important? but in the end shes having another child alone. I hated that I wasted my money on it. it should have been called destiny because everything came out the same unless the child wouldn't have been born or the fact that he decided not to have the affair was done. but was he really going to the interview or was that just an excuse to meet that other woman? it was like if shed left things along  he would have lived but she didn't know that. because he had already died. i keep expecting her to wake up in a mental ward and the doc to be telling her that she had been in shock for 5 years after finding out that her husband and his mistress were in a car accident and that she caused the accident and that was why her daughters face was scarred and that she had found out that she was pregnant the day of the accident and had gone to see him and that she caused him to be hit by a truck by ramming him from behind because she caught up to him on the road and saw him kissing his mistress. but no it was a lame story.".

I hated that I wasted my money on it. it should have been called destiny because everything came out the same unless the child wouldn't have been born or the fact that he decided not to have the affair was done. but was he really going to the interview or was that just an excuse to meet that other woman? it was like if shed left things along  he would have lived but she didn't know that. because he had already died. i keep expecting her to wake up in a mental ward and the doc to be telling her that she had been in shock for 5 years after finding out that her husband and his mistress were in a car accident and that she caused the accident and that was why her daughters face was scarred and that she had found out that she was pregnant the day of the accident and had gone to see him and that she caused him to be hit by a truck by ramming him from behind because she caught up to him on the road and saw him kissing his mistress. but no it was a lame story.";

Anyway back to the horrible movie  from that very opening scene I did not believe a word that was coming out of the actors' mouths. I didn't believe they were a youngish couple in love  you have to assume they were in love at the opening since they didn't have their kids yet and become disconnected from each other as happens later in the movie. There is not one scene wherein I don't think the people on the screen are acting. From the lead on down  even Peter Stormare who I liked in 8MM Dancer in the Dark  The Big Lebowski  I never thought these were real people it all seemed phony. The plot line is good enough but there are these ominous moments  Jim's already Dead her Mom tells Bullock  that are seemingly put in for dramatic effect but I'm not buying any of it. Bullock stares at her Mother after her Mom says that as if to say I know better I have the power to stop it and HIS LIFE IS IN MY HANDS! The movies sucks period.".

It can be a macho thriller a subtle romance an ironic look at ourselves or a combination of all these things.  The great thing about this movie is not so much the plot but the individual situations and scenes. What is meant to be portrayed as paranoid behaviour by Mel Gibson's character Jerry Fletcher becomes quite funny when the viewer recognizes his or her own self doing similar things but in a context that is supposedly normal.  Jerry's having a padlock on his refrigerator and a combination lock on his coffee will bring a smile to the lips of anyone who has to deal with numerous computer logons and passwords to gain access to even the most mundane things in our computerdominated workplaces. Likewise the writers and director are spot on when they show poor paranoid Jerry going to separate mailboxes to post his various letters while many of us here in the online world will routinely use pseudonyms proxies remailers etc for the very same reason that Jerry takes his seemingly abnormal precautions i.e. to avoid potentially prying eyes.   So who's paranoid?  I thought this was very insightful.  As for overt humour perhaps my guard was down but I laughed until tears came to my eyes when Jerry tossed off joke about a man who had only three minutes to live.  Mel Gibson's delivery of the punch line was perfect.  As for pathos and those human moments scenes in which Jerry would gladly die for just a brushing kiss from his worshipped Julia Roberts might bring  back memories of anyone's naive tender years and momentarily make your heart ache.  And a scene in which Jerry is unable to explain why he compulsively buys copies of the same book over and over again is very poignant indeed.  Mel Gibson put a lot of energy into what was obviously a demanding role and as usual Julia Roberts lights up the screen in every scene she's in.  The film might be a fantasy but it's the sort of fantasy many of us can appreciate.".

My favorite part has to be the self destruction of his apartment that was quite imaginative.  Before I saw this i was expecting something along the lines of Lethal Weapon being the same star and same director.  But it was so completely different from what I thought it would be and it actually ended up being a better film as a consequence.

The film becomes very complex little by little and we are confronted to various security agencies fighting one against the others to capture that man and the main names are CIA and FBI. What makes the film even more complex is that the man is in love and we know that from the very first moment he is tompeeping onto her with the woman who works for the Justice Department third official security force in the picture. The point is to understand why these people are after him and why he is after the Justice Department to which he wants to speak. What is the secret in that man's head and mind? The film is a perfect thriller because of the action but also because that action is not for itself for the sake of itself for its own sake. That action is treacherous because we do not know whether we have to support those official security services or the woman who is kind of an innocent witness trapped in the middle of a mud pile or the man who seems to be justified in a way to run away because of the violence the security services put on the table. The end will be tricky in many ways but the film will remain one more film on the danger of the industrial military complex and the divided loyalties of the security services in such situations. Some of them are after all maybe not so bad. Maybe we can sleep in full peace and in one piece trusting the faithfulness of some security agents who will reprieve the bad reputation of their agencies.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne University Paris 8 Saint Denis University Paris 12 Crteil CEGID".

Conspiracy Theory however did.The first time I saw this I was on the edge of my seat.  It was very suspensful.  I won't go into details if you haven't seen it but it's really one of the best suspense films I've seen.This wasn't a completely romantic film no.  In fact I wish it would've touched on the romance more than it did.  Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts had great chemistry.  Although nothing really happened between them the audience could clearly see Jerry's Mel Gibsonlove for Alice Julia Roberts.Now the plot.  Jerry Fletcher has many wild conspiracy theories  including one that NASA is trying to kill the President with earthquakes.  He's a cabbie  tells lots of people his ideas.  But the one person he seems to tell the most to and thinks can help him is Alice Sutton an attorney.  He saved her months before the movie takes place when she was mugged.  He seems to get on her nerves but she puts up with him.  He goes to her office all the time.  He's obviously in love with her but she doesn't feel the same way.  Well somehow they CIA FBI you know they find out about Jerry's crazy conspiracies  they go after him.  He and Alice are in danger.The acting in this movie was terrific.  This may be Mel's best.  His portrayal of a crazy cabbie was so good and believable.  It's not really like any other role he has played.  He did it so well  the audience sympathized with him completely.  Julia was good too.  Her role wasn't really difficult to play but she made it believably nevertheless. Patrick Stewart also stars in this.  He made a great bad guy.Overall this movie was great.  It was very suspensful  the acting was outstanding.".

Her role wasn't really difficult to play but she made it believably nevertheless. Patrick Stewart also stars in this.  He made a great bad guy.Overall this movie was great.  It was very suspensful  the acting was outstanding.";

The thing that I didn't tell her was that...I had driven a taxi just the year before I met her. Oh this is just getting too close here now. Okay shall we...I had absolutely no idea what she was talking about but I went and saw the movie. I don't think totally so but maybe some small similarities could be possible...I guess. So I was talking to someone when I drove professionally and realized there was no one in the back...so what!The casting was beautiful all the players were superb! The plot was right on the twists that would occur here and there kept you guessing and hopeful. The action was brisk and well set propelling and then slowing to a place of horror for a little while then back 'on' again moving fast! No matter what the opinion of the average moviewatcherJoe Gibson always has a different feel. It doesn't seem like he is a movie star more rather a real solid guy it seems that he is who he is portraying. There is a certain style that he has that seems like he could be related or someone that you would like to hangout with and enjoy a beer. Julia Roberts shines in this. She cares she is real and it comes through from the time they meet on to the departure and before the next meeting. Hey there's a thought Mel and Julia could take another 'pairing' of roles together.This was a truly wild ride with a very different ending. Worth Gibson fan's or Roberts fan's time. This is a must see if you enjoy a solid story with racy action and a wonderful plot that moves along and then slightly twists toward the end. Recommended excellent ".

Patrick Stewart was good as.....I'm not going to tell you but he was good. And The movie had an excellent script and the characters interacted wonderfully together. It's a great film and I'm glad it wasn't filled with loads of Fwords like other R rated movies. It's actually a good film for kids I'd say 12 and older it's really not all that violent.

	schema:headline " What if all those crazy conspiracy theories end up being true.";
	schema:reviewBody "Now this movie is just brilliant. It is exactly the type of movie that I just love. There so much happening in the background and you are never sure what really is happening. The theme of this movie is the truth will set you free but what really is the truth. The movie leads you to believe one thing and then confronts you with something that destroys everything the you had built up only to knock this down as well.What really is true? You will never know. You follow the main character through out the movie  and this character really knows a lot. On the outside he appears to be a nut with all of these conspiracy theories but then a layer is pealed off to reveal a little more about this character. What does this character really know? Who is he  well the movie may tell you or it may not.You know who the bad guy is or is he really the bad guy. The only certainty is Julia Roberts' character. She seems to be legit or is she. Yes I am being ambiguous for this is the whole aspect of this movie. Ambiguity reigns and as you dig deeper in to look for the truth the more questions that are raised.As such this movie is brilliant. It is in the similar vein to the Usual Suspects. It creates a story only to tear it down and leaving you wondering what happened. It is the ultimate conspiracy theory. The conspiracies that Mel Gibson's character brings out seem to be ultimately wild  yet they do seem to make sense.Mel Gibson's character is brilliant. He is like a child with huge amounts of knowledge. At first is appears to be a simple cab driver with a tonne of wild ideas and then the layers of his character begin to be peeled off. What does he really know? The character doesn't know the answer to this question. One thing that is very definite is that he really brings out patterns. He can see a pattern in almost everything and the patterns he pulls out really makes one think  are these really conspiracies.One brilliant aspect of the movie are the little tricks and gadgets that are used. They do not dominate the movie but they are there to show us how intelligent this character really is. The Firewall and the Beer Bomb are two examples. The beer bomb is where a bottle is balanced on the door knob and when the knob is turn the bottle breaks. The firewall is a much more brilliant thing for it will utterly destroy the apartment without damaging anything else. If it is brilliant and clever tricks that you are looking for then this is a movie to see.Patrick Stewart plays the bad guy  or is he a bad guy. Stewart is a brilliant actor unfortunately his seven year stint in Star Trek has dulled his edge. When I see Stewart on the screen I immediately think of Captain Picard. This to me can really destroy a really good actor. Mel Gibson is seen as Mel Gibson Julia Roberts is seen as Julia Roberts but one cannot help seeing Patrick Stewart as Captain Jeanluc Picard. There was one gripe I had with the movie but I cannot tell you because if I did it would spoil it. It is one the really would have made it absolutely brilliant but in a fallen world nothing is brilliant.Remember the words of the movie  the truth will set you free.".

The theme of this movie is the truth will set you free but what really is the truth. The movie leads you to believe one thing and then confronts you with something that destroys everything the you had built up only to knock this down as well.What really is true? You will never know. You follow the main character through out the movie  and this character really knows a lot. On the outside he appears to be a nut with all of these conspiracy theories but then a layer is pealed off to reveal a little more about this character. What does this character really know? Who is he  well the movie may tell you or it may not.You know who the bad guy is or is he really the bad guy. The only certainty is Julia Roberts' character. She seems to be legit or is she. Yes I am being ambiguous for this is the whole aspect of this movie. Ambiguity reigns and as you dig deeper in to look for the truth the more questions that are raised.As such this movie is brilliant. It is in the similar vein to the Usual Suspects.

	schema:headline " Mel Gibson Goes Crazy";
	schema:reviewBody "Movie superstars love to indulge themselves in vanity projects that reflect this eccentric facet of their personalities. In the cinematically polished but complicated amnesiac mysterythriller Conspiracy Theory Mel Gibson impersonates a flaky New York cabbie named Jerry Fletcher. Although he imitates the formula action hero he limned in the Lethal Weapon movies Conspiracy Theory qualifies as a vanity project because Gibson plays an everyday citizen instead of a crusading cop. Moreover Jerry is not tightly wrapped. Forrest Gump and he might have hit it off okay. Jerry's prone to fits of anxiety and paranoia. Sometimes the least little thing will touch him off. As Jerry Gibson acts perfectly rational one minute but totally loony tunes the next instant. If incarnating such a Bohemian character were not enough Gibson models his harebrained hack on the sarcastic Warner Brothers character Bugs Bunny. At one point Jerry compares his antics to the Road Runner but at heart he's clearly a Bugs kind of guy. Conspiracy Theory on closer inspection emerges as a rather lengthy Merry Melody cartoon with villainous Patrick Stewart sharing some characteristics of Elmer Fudd Bug's perennial adversary while Julia Roberts appears as a Tweety Bird of sorts.The cartoon comparison seems valid when you consider the outrageous elements in Brian Assassins Helgeland'S murky script along with Gibson's selfdepreciating humor. Jerry's cluttered apartment resembles Bug's hutch and this cabbie has an escape hatch that Bugs would truly envy. Jerry loves to play pranks and he pulls one in the tradition of American Graffiti on the spies who are supposed to track him. At other times Jerry outsmarts himself like Bug's often does and gets caught. Stewart's first encounter with Jerry is straight out of A Clockwork Orange. Before the interrogation ends Jerry has bitten Dr. Jonas's nose and is careening about in a wheelchair screaming hilariously at the top of his voice. Gibson's Jerry proves as much a Houdini as Bugs is in his escapades with Elmer.As written by Helgeland Conspiracy Theory is hard to follow because he throws out enough red herrings to pickle the plot. During the opening credits we get to watch Jerry blitz his passengers with his crack pot conjectures. For example he believes the metal pins in new hundred dollar bills are really tracking devices. He complains too that Benjamin Franklin on the new bills resembles the love child of Rosie O'Donnell and Fred Mertz I Love Lucy's next door neighbor. Or that the fluoride in the water does not promote our dental health but is rather to break down our mental health. Jerry publishes a conspiracy theory newsletter but only five people subscribe to it. The good conspiracy is an unprovable one he tells Julia Roberts. Jerry scans the daily newspapers for any trace of a coverup. Early in the film Jerry is convinced NASA is going to kill the president so he visits Federal attorney Alice Sutton Roberts to warn her about the plot. At first Sutton thinks Jerry is a polite wacko until she starts to see some of his warning signs.Enter Dr. Jonas Patrick Stewart an urbane bespectacled Harvard shrink who desperately wants to lay his hands on Jerry. Stewart plays Dr. Jonas with a Borg in his eye. Stewart's commanding presence lends credence to his villainy. Jerry it seems participated as a Jonas experiment in mind control program along the lines of the 1960's paranoid thriller The Manchurian Candidate where the Chinese brainwashed U.S. troops and turned them into assassins. Jonas tried to make Jerry into a killer but his efforts proved futile. Somehow somebody else grabbed Stewart's subjects and he has been trying to catch Jerry since to learn who stole his technology. Meanwhile another super secret agency represented by Hatcher Cylk Cozart has been keeping tabs on Jerry to capture Dr. Jonas. In the middle stands federal prosecutor Alice Sutton who has just been told to stop investigating the murder of his father a federal judge. Although she reluctantly believes Jerry initially later she comes to hate and fear him.Director Richard Donner and Helgeland are careful to present Jerry as a mad as a March hare hero. Meanwhile they construct Alice Sutton as the paragon of intelligence and sanity. The character that Julia Roberts plays is indispensable. She proves Jerry is paranoid but she realizes eventually that his paranoia is justified. Conspiracy Theory is really two stories woven into one. Jerry Fletcher searches as much for his own sanity as Alice Sutton does the murderers of his father. That's the other plot. Alice Sutton's father a federal judge has been murdered and she refuses to give up the investigation. Integrating these two apparently unrelated plots together into a smooth unobtrusive way forces scenarist Helgeland and director Donner to add about a halfhour's worth of story to the film.Since the filmmakers dump all this convoluted narrative onto you with as little exposition as possible you may find Conspiracy Theory more than a little overwhelming. Conspiracy Theory struggles to be North by Northwest with a sprinkling of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. Actress Julia Roberts has more to do than just stand around and look like a pretty woman in Conspiracy Theory. As a hard nosed Federal prosecutor she gets to shoot guns ride horses and talk her way out of tightspots with the FBI. Gibson and she develop real chemistry when they go on the run. While Jerry gets to play hero in the first part of the film Alice Sutton gets to dominate the heroics in the second half. Ultimately all it boils down to is Mel Gibson. He gets to play a resourceful hero and a sympathetic victim. We are rooting for him the entire time because there is no way Mel Gibson can be a crook. As charismatic as Gibson is as Jerry Fletcher you cannot mistake his insouciant wit as anything other than a Bugs Bunny gesture. Now if Mel had only uttered What's Up Doc?".

Jerry Fletcher I still believe to this day is Mel Gibson's best role ever. He does an amazing job performing a paranoid New York cabbie. Patrick Stewart who is one of my favorite actors by far is Dr. Jonas who is the only one who knows Jerry's true history.After I first saw this film about ten years ago it became my favorite film and though opinions change over the years it still remains among my most favorite. It is full of so many twists and so many angles on the truth you're not sure who to really believe until the end of the film. It is one of the most suspenseful films I have ever seen.

Jerry Fletcher was a tragic hero to me really  similar to the Martin Riggs character in Lethal weapon who lost his wife in a car accident. Here its the relationship to Alice Julia Roberts which gives the movie the emotionality  Mel and Julia were a wonderful couple.  Conspiracy theory sometimes reminded me of The fugitive but also of Hitchcocks North by northwest. Speaking of  movie classics there were some nice hommages in it the nosebite Chinatown! and the assault on Jerry The marathon man!. Besides Carter Burwells soundtrack is a musthear and gives the movie a very special atmosphere. After the few times Ive been watching it this is one of my absolutely favorites.

However after watching the DVD now that I have studied and researched many of the conspiracies mentioned by Jerry throughout the movie I know that most have been proved to be true conspiracies and not theory. This is what makes the movie more interesting to me that information released later has backed up most of the theories.The lesson to be learned is that Jerry was never crazy. He was injured and unfortunately he was set up to have problems nearly impossible to prove. If no one had believed enough to listen to him there would have been no story.The question is why do viewers still come away with the belief that Jerry is crazy and got himself into trouble when he was doing about all he could to deal with his post traumatic condition and was picked up just for discovering some CIA offices by being suspicious.The movie has a lot of twists and turns and maybe a few too many toward the end but I was amazed to find that most of the conspiracy theories mentioned are now known and documented as true.".

In the context of the film the conspiracies are real but it doesn't really matter whether they're real.  Jerry thinks they're real and that makes his battle  against the conspiracies and his own flashbacked confusion  heroic.

His buddy Lieutenant Kurt who is in charge of the camp has her brought to a party in the pub. There Walter has a chance to talk with her. Having grown indifferent to people suffering he is now awakened to unsuspected emotions and experiences a change of heart. When he next meets the girl Walter convinces her that Nazism and war. Her fate and love make anew man of him. He gives a package of medicine for the inmates of the camp to Petk a Bulgarian antifascist worker but the German find them and destroy them.

It concerns the story of a corporal named 'Walter' although his real name is never known and played by Jrgen Frohriep with quiet complexity and his relationship with interred German Jewess Ruth played by the beautiful and powerful Sasha Krusharska against the background of Nazism in Bulgaria populated by inhuman oafs like Kurt a repellent character played well by Erik S. Klein and freedom fighters like Petko Stefan Pejchev and Blashe Georgi Naumov.The film was made in 1959 centering on events in 1943 when the Jews were rounded up held prisoner and eventually shipped to the death camp at Auschwitz. It does not flinch from their predicament denied medicine herded together like cattle huddled quietly and hopelessly in congested rooms. The music score uses Jewish songs to pinpoint the action and underline scenes which are otherwise silent  panning along the faces of the refugees in their dignified acceptance of their situation or following the death transports as the men women and children are packed into carriages and sent away from Bulgaria like animals going to the slaughter.The power of this film is in its matteroffact treatment of what the Germans did to their Jewish countrymen and compatriots in the name of racial purity and how out of this one human relationship between  on the surface of it  enemies could grow and flourish. This concentration on Walter and Ruth makes the ending also the beginning of the film before the flashback all the more poignant and touching.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all an almost unthinkable idyll is presented to the spectator considering that we are in times of war A sergeant named Walter and his superior Kurt are far off the combat action and supervise civil workers in a small Bulgarian town where they are also responsible for a community of Greek Jews waiting to be transported to their final destination. This happy constellation encourages Kurt to nothing else but to find intensified sensual pleasures in dissipated carousals gluttonous feasts or with local prostitutes whereas Walter experiences an important dawning of consciousness that will change his life.The decisive turning point is his encounter with Ruth a Jewish girl that asks for his help when a pregnant woman of the captivated community is about to give birth. It is her who succeeds in getting going again the humanitarian mechanisms that Walter seemed to have forgotten. For he quite unexpectedly smuggles a civilian obstetrician into the camp just one day after he has refused her request in the curt coldness that is typical for Third Reich soldiers. Could it be possible that Germans are human after all?Or maybe it's just another love adventure that Sergeant Walter is after. At least there are night dates about which the sensual Kurt goes green with envy Walter and Ruth meet several times for an extensive walk across the deserted streets of the town where they are unnecessarily guarded by a soldier who is walking discreetly behind.Surely this provokes certain expectations of the public but of course we definitely aren't in a Hollywood movie. The usual boymeetsgirlplot which almost in any case culminates in some sort of physical love making is replaced by longwinded dialogues of philosophical content which in the end are responsible for a spiritual approximation of two characters who initially seemed to be incompatible. These verbal encounters become the true highlights of a quiet and smoothly developing movie that deliberately abstains from intricate plot movements.Walter and Ruth predominantly discuss the question whether there is room for any changes. Is it possible to eradicate evil? In view of the impending deportation of the Jewish community to Auschwitz every kind of hope seems nonsensical and foolish. Evil is eternal that's exactly what it is Walter disheartenedly insists. But Ruth convinces him that it is the duty and the responsibility of every human being to revolt against the evil forces.Man left to his own devices is powerless though. Walter finally has to recognize this when he reaches the railway station a moment too late The train with the Jews has just left and he can only run behind without the slightest chance to catch up with it. The only thing that remains and reminds him of Ruth is her torn off star of David which is lying neglectedly in a dark puddle only slightly illuminated by the cold light of the night sky. It is the ironic confirmation of what she has said before Every human being has got a protective star in the sky but once you rip it off from its place Man can do nothing but perish.Nevertheless Walter isn't to be discouraged by that saddening realization and the subsequent tragedy which he is unable to prevent. At the end of the movie he continues on the road once taken and the determination with which he supports the Bulgarian partisans seems logical. Maybe through the collaboration with others he will achieve something which was denied to him when he was still fighting on his own to defy evil and help to create a more humane world.".

Is it possible to eradicate evil? In view of the impending deportation of the Jewish community to Auschwitz every kind of hope seems nonsensical and foolish. Evil is eternal that's exactly what it is Walter disheartenedly insists. But Ruth convinces him that it is the duty and the responsibility of every human being to revolt against the evil forces.Man left to his own devices is powerless though. Walter finally has to recognize this when he reaches the railway station a moment too late The train with the Jews has just left and he can only run behind without the slightest chance to catch up with it. The only thing that remains and reminds him of Ruth is her torn off star of David which is lying neglectedly in a dark puddle only slightly illuminated by the cold light of the night sky. It is the ironic confirmation of what she has said before Every human being has got a protective star in the sky but once you rip it off from its place Man can do nothing but perish.Nevertheless Walter isn't to be discouraged by that saddening realization and the subsequent tragedy which he is unable to prevent. At the end of the movie he continues on the road once taken and the determination with which he supports the Bulgarian partisans seems logical. Maybe through the collaboration with others he will achieve something which was denied to him when he was still fighting on his own to defy evil and help to create a more humane world.";

	schema:reviewBody "Sterne or Stars is an East German  Bulgarian blackandwhite film from 1959 so this one is already almost 60 years old. The director is Konrad Wolf one of the GDR's most successful filmmakers. He was not the most prolific filmmaker also because of his fairly early deathbut stuff like Solo Sunny or Ich war neunzehn is still known today. His work here is one of his earlier career projects. He was in his early 30s here. The 1950s were of course also in film mostly about coming to terms with the years of Nazi Germany and World War II and this is what the film is about too. It focuses on the romantic relationship between a Nazi officer and a Jewish woman who is held prisoner with many others. I must say I am lightly surprised that this topic has not been used in films that many times really. Of course it is a bit absurd because Nazis hated Jews but if you see the German soldier as an individual which they all were then it totally makes sense. Lead actor Jrgen Frohriep portrayed him convincingly and his female equivalent Sasha Krusharska was at least as good. What a shame she did not pursue a career in films.I also liked some of the metaphors in here such as the use of the baby he manages to save early but that still dies eventually because of the difficult conditions something that can be seen synonymously for their relationship with death awaiting at the very end. I personally believe many of the early warthemed films from the 1940s and 1950s were fairly forgettable and had little to offer about the subject really but this one here is a bit of an exception. Wolf shows his skill and Bulgarian writer Angel Vagenshtain shows us why he was asked to work on several scripts back then that resulted in a handful films that are still aboveaverage known compared to the many GDR films that vanished into oblivion over the decades. If you like blackandwhite films and are interested in the complex subject of Nazi Germany then this one is absolutely worth checking out. This film does not even attempt to be a defining work in terms of submitting knowledge to the audience. instead it goes for the very personal lives of the two main characters and manages an emotional achievement. Good decision I recommend the watch.".

The great thing about this movie is that although billed as a romantic comedy it is more of a drama that explores the difficulty of being an outsider this film doesn't give in to teenflick cliches it is almost relentless in terms of causing the audience to feel sorry for Lucas and at times it's downright scary. This film really made me think about how stupid high school social structures can be it really is that bad for some people in fact it's worse. I think this film is an emotional moral masterpiece. I hate high school I love Lucas. If you want to see high school for what it really is...skip Ferris Bueller or 10 things I hate about you see Lucas good stuff.".

He falls for the pretty new girl in town who happens to be a few years older. She on the other hand has the hots for hunky Charlie Sheen and Lucas is relegated to friend status. As if he ever had a chance with her in the first place. Lucas is played by to perfection by Corey Haim. In fact this is most likely his best film role. It sure beats the heck out of Blown Away!. Kerri Green I wonder what she's doing today plays the new girl in town.They along with the rest of the cast is top drawer. Many of the main characters are wellknown celebs today. Look for Winona Ryder in her screen debut as a nerdy girl who has a crush on Lucas. The lovely Courtney ThorneSmith plays Sheen's hottie girlfriend before he dumps her for Green.As the action unfolds we see Lucas try everything to win Green's affection to no avail. At one point he even tries out for the football team and proceeds to get clobbered by the bigger upperclassmen. We as the viewer feel for the kid because we all know the deck is stacked against him.This film is truly special. It packs a real emotional punch at a time when most movies dealing with teens were pretty shallow. We can all relate to Lucas to some degree. We have all pretty much had strong feelings for someone we knew we could never have. This film captures the pain involved with crushes better than any other I have seen. In some ways it can be tougher to just be friends with a girl you like than if she never talked to you at all. Another thing that is really great about the film is the ending. It isn't simply your runofthemill happy ending where the hero gets the girl. Lucas fails to win her over but at least he wins the respect of the guys who have been tormenting him.If you haven't seen this one SEE IT! If you have SEE IT AGAIN!412 of 5 starsSo sayeth the Hound.".

We have always watched movies like Lucas along the ages I have watched plenty of movies like it and have disliked them all. Not that Lucas is great but you know what I say about 'Love Actually? If you express it with this film Lucas is good as a movie but almost brilliant as a family inspirational picture.What happens in the film is like a taleAn old tale of a boy who is not accepted in his everyday environment and tries to live with it. The hero of this tale is the special Lucas played by Corey Haim as a boy who is definitely stranger and more intelligent than the rest of his companions it's something you notice immediately.Or at least Maggie Kerri Green notices it. She spends the entire summer with him and when school starts he doesn't know what's going to happen. Logically he has his two or three nerdy best friends that are there for him included a girl named Rina the first role Winona Ryder ever played with 15 years old or soGorgeous who obviously likes him and follows his look while he is searching for Maggie on the first day of classes. It's not that Lucas dislikes his friends but that he had sensed something different when knowing Maggie. But Maggie is older and interested in older guys like Cappie a very young Charlie Sheen for example. In a very good scene where Cappie takes care of Lucas Maggie thanks him and they both talk about LucasMy brother thought Maggie was in love with Lucas but I told him that she had a crush on CappieThe movie understands the characters so well that it turned out the way I said of course.The language these kids deal with the situations they live are real. David Seltzer who directed and wrote the film puts strong and hurtful words in his screenplay so they generate an impact in the picture's most moving moments. But that doesn't turn you on does it? Lucas tells MaggieThat's not the kind of phrase you'd commonly listen a 13year old say even less on a film. That's the way Seltzer shapes his characters in a way that we believe everything they declare and in a way that the only thing that becomes predictable in the movie is the storyline itself.A known writer Seltzer has directed few things. As a director he also preserves his characters. Watch a beautiful scene where the choir is singing and the camera goes from side to side showing each of the main characters looking at the person he likes but not one of them being corresponded with the look. That's perfect directing even more in a film of this typeSo classic the simple edition Priscilla NeddFriendly Down to Earth the touchy score Dave Grusin The Goonies Hope Floats Selena.What I'm trying to say is that to Seltzer is all about the movie. The actors don't show off Corey Haim is the hero but not the star. It's about the movie a piece with an absolutely clichd resolution that we find inspiring and therefore embrace.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lucas was a very interesting movie which gave extra dimensions to the young characters and explored their level of maturity. I only gave the movie a 6 because of a few major flaws. First the good points. The characters who were in different stages of physical and emotional maturity. Note how the Sheen character is allowed to grow early. By being a sort who shoots up in physical growth early he capitalizes Cappy on the chance to mature as a leader as well preferring some intellectual friends to the immature teammates who still pick on Lucas. The fun loving offensive lineman character and his middle level of maturity is also interesting. Lucas is a nerd but tries to expand his horizons. And the casting crew and director made sure to make this a female appeal movie by casting the ugly duckling girls as the glamor girls and the gorgeous girls as the nerds. The major flaw was Lucas dropping the ball in the end. We've all played different roles in life and any guy can tell you that in that situation Lucas catches the ball 100 times out of 100. The character of the coach who is well defined as a punk from the beginning is very hard to envision as keeping his job maybe he didn't. One weird bit a woman must have had the most say in the casting because easily the best looking girl was the one in the band and I remember being a high school boy. There is no way the boys would be chasing the two plain girls in the movie and ignoring the foxes like that girl in the band. Looks like a female fantasy. All in all a worthy movie.".

The jock is paired with the blond shapely head cheerleader of course.Then an appealing athletic redhead moves to town. She brings a story about her randy father that hints that she could in time not be ass innocent and sweet as she is when we meet her. She befriends the small genuinely appealing guy who develops a crush. But in time she dates the jock. Both continue to be principled friends. An event occurs where the kid. Lucas goes from being bullied to celebrated and the third girl who has been admiring in the wings is set up to be his real love.As I said the cheerleader is tall buxom and blond. The contested new girl is fair redheaded less shapely and average height. The third girl is smaller yet black haired not sexy at all.Now why this is remarkable is because each of these girls is played by an actress who is clearly directed to be as appealing as they can. Almost surely they each are using traits that are close to their real beings. The blond is the least talented actress and though she has the sexy equipment and plenty of cheerleading scenes we are ready to not focus on her.The redhead is played by Kerri Green who had a run as a child actress playing the appealing perky redhead. She made her impressive debut as the girl in The Goonies. She is the center of attention for most of the movie for us the writers and the two boys. Things are pleasant enough.We don't see the third girl until much later in the film. But when she comes on she shines and so completely overwhelms every other character you know from the first moment that she will be the real prize. We end up learning nothing at all about her. We just see her face and hear a few unimportant lines. This was Winona Ryder's film debut and it really underscores why she rose so fast  and probably suggests why her career stalled when she outgrew what we would accept from this presentation.This isn't a John Hughes movie where you play with the notion of stereotypes. That's what made the man an interesting filmmaker. It is instead just taking the stereotypes and moving them around like game pieces. But wow Winona does charm. No wonder Johnny Depp ended up with her name tattooed.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.".

This was Winona Ryder's film debut and it really underscores why she rose so fast  and probably suggests why her career stalled when she outgrew what we would accept from this presentation.This isn't a John Hughes movie where you play with the notion of stereotypes. That's what made the man an interesting filmmaker. It is instead just taking the stereotypes and moving them around like game pieces. But wow Winona does charm. No wonder Johnny Depp ended up with her name tattooed.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.";

	schema:reviewBody "A troubling movie in the teen genre that only half gets it so I'm only giving it half the stars out if 10.This lesser known entry in the brat pack oeuvre has early career performances from Winona Ryder Charlie Sheen and Jeremy Piven among others. It tells the story of a sincerely likable dork who falls in love with a class beauty. While she initially accepts him and shares in his bug collecting hobby over summer vacation once school resumes in the fall she develops feeling for a football jock instead.The film is unflinching in showing the anguish of the dorky kid as he comes to realize he just isn't and never can be attractive to this girl in the way the jock is. He even discusses this in hard terms as natural selection. This hard fact is tragic yet probably true the film stresses the tragedy of falling in love with an unobtainable object and his having to realize that the fact he can't impress her is something to do with aspects of himself that he cannot and never will change.About halfway through the film I could not believe how honestly this difficulty was presented with the main character considering suicide because he realizes that he doesn't have what it takes to be a football jock  physically diminutive and uncoordinated he can't overcome these things. Even the adults in his world sanction the view of him as an outcast and his home in a trailer with an alcoholic father offers no respite. At the halfway point it seemed like this could be a classic of cinema verit.However at this point ideology steps in. Rather than honestly dealing with this situation that could have pushed some kids over the brink to suicide or Columbinetype violence the film takes a big turn into fantasy and avoids the searing critique it could have been. Via this fantasy the boy commits suicide by instead joining the football team and even after flubbing the game is awarded a letter jacket by his former jock tormentors and gets the nerdy girl who was meant for him all along  Winona Ryder in her first screen appearance. Thus supposedly accepting his place as the pet dork of these jocks and settling for a nerdy girlfriend is supposed to make him content. It's hard to believe that the boy who has been presented as highly intelligent would be satisfied with such superficial palliatives.Clearly Hollywood could not face the ideological strife this film prompts at the halfway mark. Instead Hollywood applied the standard solution of all teen films if you can't beat 'em join 'em. The strategy in all films about teen misfits is to convert the oddball back into something more normative and acceptable to dominant ideology  turn the nerd into some form of jock or at least something acceptable to jocks.Here Lucas is defused by making him an honorary jock even though he didn't deserve it as if somehow that gesture wipes away the pain and real difference that he experiences. It's as bad as the old sitcom Saved By the Bell in the end which always performed the same recuperative move to make sure the dorks got reassigned to their place in the jockdominated order by letting them be the jocks' token friends.This film missed a big opportunity to be a powerful ideological expos and instead became simply a vehicle for ideology.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERSI am split about this movie. On one hand the acting and the dialogue was very good. There are a few scenes that I will always remember like when Lucas saw Maggie for the first time playing tennis or when he got onto the stage was embarrassed but still had a good time making fun of the coach.On the other hand I couldn't believe how much people acted like football was instant suicide for Lucas. I couldn't get past how ridiculous it was. Of course no one ever started trying out a week before the first game of the season either. But people seemed to act like this kid was a paper bag and football was played with Lions and not people.I went to a high school that was somewhat football centric In Illinois like the movie unlike some high school in Texas or Pennsylvania maybe and there were a couple smaller kids on the football team. If they weren't good then they just didn't play much. Anyway the only reason the kid got hurt was because he took his helmet off which would have resulted in a penalty in real life. That whole game was ridiculously unrealistic. I feel the unrealistic game and the attitudes about football are so hard to believe that it takes away from the great heartfelt stories of the film.The great thing about the film is how atypical it treated the top jock and the girl Maggie. They were both really nice kids. The movie made all three characters Lucas Maggie Cappie very whole people and not just clichs. Someone had obviously put a great deal of thought into these characters. The movie doesn't force anything and we are left to make up our minds about the characters based on something more personal to us. I tried to think of the football in the movie as just equivalent to superficiality in general in our society. Personally I think the movie could have been a lot better if it had handled it differently somehow. The attitudes from all the adults in the movie the school administrator the coach about the kid wanting to play football being crazy just seemed too ridiculous to me.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie had its fans particularly those whom who like its honest portrayal of the highs and lows of adolescent it's not so stereotypical 1980's teen characters and the theme of the little guy trying to become somebody within his society but for me I found this movie to be somewhat unwatchable. I'm not a fan of this movie at all. I give the movie some credit the movie does have a terrific young cast. Both the main actor Corey Haim and the female lead Kerri Green were amazing and very attractive in their role. Supporting actors like Charlie Sheen and Winona Ryder weren't that bad as well. However this movie wasn't that inspirational to me. The reason why I'm say this movie is a poor man Rudy is because unlike the 1993 movie which had a very inspiring main character wanting to join the football team in order to better himself and his family by getting a college education. This coming of age movie about a socially inept boy Lucas Blye Corey Haim trying to join the high school football team only because he was suicidal by heartbreak. By heartbreak I meant that the local girl he has a crush on Maggie Kerri Green doesn't want to date him. You can see the problem of the story right here. He isn't doing this because he has love of the sport he just doing this in order to change her mind of him. It's in the same mindset levels of a man like John Hinckley Jr shooting the President in order to impress Jodi Foster. It's disturbing. It felt a little more selfcentered and selfish than inspiring. I hate the fact that this movie was market as a sport movie because it isn't all about his dreams of being a football player at all. The football plot only plays a part toward the end. The movie is more about learning to deal with first love and teen angst. Don't get me wrong I love 1980s coming to age stories that deals with this. After all 1985's Breakfast Club is one of my favorite movies of all time but this movie directed by David Seltzer really anger me in saying it's a sport movie when it's barely is. The reason why Rudy works and this film doesn't is because Rudy's not only fighting to get into the team but also driven to help others reach their goals. They is a reason to root for him. Not only does Lucas barely show any interest in the sport but he rarely treat his friends any better. Ignoring them isn't going to help you. The movie really tries to make him into a hero with the idea of him being a victim of bullying but when you think about it the school wasn't really that mean to him. Most kids in his school honestly somewhat accept him. It's only a few guys that really doesn't like him! Honestly how many nerdy teens in the 1980s do you know are able to hang out with the captain of the football team while also being cool with one of hottest girls in school? Not that many. So I don't buy the whole stand up against natural selection BS this movie is saying because of the fact that there are girls that secretly love Lucas. Yes I get that his best friendssomewhat betrayed him when his olderbrother figure Chappie Roew Charlie Sheen and his crush fall for each other. However as upsetting it is to him and for me to see those two hook up. I still can't feel too much pity for Lucas. I feel worst for Chappie ex Alise Country Thorne Smith because she end up with nobody in the end. The reasons why I couldn't felt pity for Lucas is because he still good friends like Reda Winona Ryder. It's very stupid to see him always overlooking her sexual advances throughout the film. You have to be really crazy not to want to date a girl like her. I would love to see a scene where Lucas finally admit that he mistreated Reda so badly and ask her to forgive him. You know like address the love he has for her. It would had made a better ending than the misguided slow clap for Lucas after getting himself nearly kill and quitting football. Honestly what the hell!? How is getting a football jacket supposed to solve anything!? He still lives poor with his alcoholic father. He's now suffers from a severe concussion and most likely not going to finish school. Also the fact that the movie never resolve that conflict with Reda nor does look for a solution to the love triangle between Chappie Maggie and him. What a horrible ending! I hate how the movie ends so abruptly with him getting a varsity jacket. Anyways take off your nostalgia glasses people! That wasn't the only problem with this movie. The whole symbolism with the locust was also a bit off in its message in morphology. I get the movie wants to use it as a metaphor for growing up but if the filmmakers read any science book they would know that having locusts around isn't a good thing like having butterflies. They're a serious economic threat to agriculture. If anything the sign of locusts returning is bad news than good. Overall Besides the good acting the wonderful music by Dave Grusin this movie isn't a film I will rewatch anytime soon. If you want to check it out go ahead. You might like it but for me. I'm staying far away from this film. It upset me too much.".

Then again him getting his head knocked off on that punt return was enjoyable also. You do have to like that this movie was somewhat realistic. One Lucas was a poor nerd and he didn't end up with the pretty girl. Not only that he didn't end up with anyone. What did he really achieve? Pseudoacceptance from the jocks who terrorized him? A friendship with Charlie Sheen's character who stole his woman? At least he got a letterman jacket to wear at the end. At least he'll be warm in that.".

The only commercial that I ever saw that had Lucas in it was the clip where he and Maggie are sitting underneath Ravinia listening to the concert.The other reason that it didn't do quite as well was that it was different from the teen comedies of the day which you could more or less split into two groupsJohn Hughes movies and naked horny teen movies. Lucas was far too intelligent to be a naked horny teen movie but not quite funny enough to be in the same league as a John Hughes movie. I always thought that the movie veered unnecessarily into melodrama after Lucas got sacked and you found out that his dad was an alcoholicespecially considering that the plot point was never used again and didn't seem to change things.So many good actors came out of this movie Winona Ryder Courtney ThorneSmith Charlie Sheeneven Corey Haim and it works on so many different levels. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a warm relatively inoffensive comingofage movie. Just fastforward through the shower scene where Lucas thoroughly takes out one of his tormentors. True he gets some Liquid Heat in a very notcool place but it's still worth it.".

The answer by the way is yes it can be done.  Thus while his Wayne's World' partner Mike Myers is out there making both a fortune and an indelible impression on pop culture with his Austin Powers' franchise poor Dana Carvey is reduced to appearing in disastrous vehicles like this one. Now don't get me wrong.  I love Carvey's work on Saturday Night Live' especially his impersonations of many of the major political figures of our time.  However Carvey's manic overthetop style is apparently a whole lot easier to take in small doses.  Watching him mug cavort and pratfall his way through a laughless script for the better part of an hour and a half ultimately becomes as wearying as it is embarrassing to watch.Stealing much of its concept from The Mask' The Master of Disguise' involves Carvey in some nonsense about a family of crime fighters who are able to magically don all sorts of disguises at a moment's notice.  This allows the filmmakers to enlist the aid of a number of real life celebrities who end up making cameo appearances in the misguided belief most likely that this was going to be a fun entertaining movie comedy.  Boy were they misled.  Actually I have rarely seen a film in which the jokes bits' and setups fall as consistently flat as they do here.  To get a general notion of the level of humor in this film please note that the running gag involves one character's tendency towards uncontrollable flatulence.  It isn't funny the first time it happens and believe me it is even less funny the fourth fifth or is it sixth? time around.In addition to the celebrity walkons Bo Derek Jesse Ventura Paula Abdul among others Harold Gould James Brolin Jennifer Espinoto Brent Spiner and Edie McClurg are all good sports who deserve better material than what they have been handed here.  So is Carvey when you come right down to it. But then Carvey wrote the screenplay so he HAS to be a good sport about it. After all he handed HIMSELF this material.  I hope the other actors trapped in this mess at least got paid well for their endeavors.The only good news is that in the closing credits we get to see many of the scenes lines and characters that were apparently filmed then dropped from the final product.  One can only imagine how much worse the film would have been had they all been allowed to stay in.".

I guess so because it happened over and over again.I don't find his fake Italian accent as annoying as many of the reviewers but how the hell is repeating the word turtle over and over again while dressed in a turtle suit to get into a turtle club supposed to be funny let alone plausible in the plot? Was everybody involved with the film consistently drunk as this was being made? Surely somebody must have said something like Guys this really sucks. Lets burn it and never speak of it again.

I can understand why most of you people didn't like it because he made this especially for his children who are under 13. I loved his little Italian accent and I thought he looked so cute. I went with my dad who's in his 40's and my 10 yearold sister and they both laughed! My sister was laughing out loud and there were some parts that I laughed so hard tears came to my eyes. I think I laughed the hardest at the Turtle Guy part. I really liked the guy from India who was charming the snake. I loved the voice he used. Yeah this movie ain't nothing like the work he did on Saturday Night Live but he does use his talent here and I just enjoyed it. I laughed and that's what Dana wanted the people to do when they saw this movie. It was so great.  Oh and I will own this movie when it comes out on video!!!".

There were many good injokes as well like Pistacchio's impersonation from the hit movie Shrek since Mike Myers and Dana Carvey have worked together on many ventures. Interesting that Adam Sandler is one of the executive producers and this is about 1000 times funnier than his anger filled junk.".

The entire film seems to have been haphazardly constructed to string together the many character impersonations he has developed unfortunately at the expense of an actual plot.The result is a disjointed storyline that even the prepubescent target audience must have found confusing if not down right annoying.

I remember the run and chase plot of the book better than the film's plot. The only things I remember of the film are its sad maybe gloomyatmosphere and Curd Jurgens who was captured by spies of the villain and was blinded with a redhot iron stick. The sequence made such a strong impression on me that although I have forgotten almost all the other aspects of the film the events happen in Russia I have never forgotten it. I must have noticed the existence of Sylva Koscina who has been one of my boyhood idols for the first time in Michel Strogoff. I have completely forgotten Koscina's image in Michel Strogoff but still remember her Playboy photographs shoving her naked in water.It would just be a wonderful nostalgic pleasure if I could have a DVD of Michel Strogoff!

	schema:reviewBody "Set in a future postWorld War III society where emotions have been outlawed Equilibrium tells the story of John Preston Christian Bale a government agent who begins to have doubts about the policy he is enforcing.Equilibrium is the perfect example why I do not rate lower for derivativeness or unoriginality. The film is basically highconcept combination of Fahrenheit 451 1966 George Orwell's novel Nineteen EightyFour original published in 1949 film versions appeared in 1954 1956 and 1984 The Matrix 1999 and a bit of The Wizard of Oz 1939 thrown in for good measure. What matters is not how original the ideas are assuming it's not a case of plagiarism as whether something is original or not is an epistemological problem that tells us more about our own familiarity with other material rather than the precedent status of the artwork we're questioning but how well the material is handled. The highconcept material in Equilibrium is handled brilliantly.On its surface after a brief actionoriented beginning Equilibrium is basically a progression from a fairly complex scifi film meaning simply that it takes a lot of exposition to get up to speed to a thriller to a gun fustyled actioner. The progression is carried out deftly by writerdirector Kurt Wimmer who unfortunately hasn't shown the same level of elegant panache in other films I've seen from him including Sphere 1998 and The Recruit 2003 with all of the genres somewhat present throughout the film. Wimmer is so austerely slick here that Equilibrium sometimes resembles a postmodernist automobile commercial. The transition from genre to genre is incredibly smooth.The most impressive material on this surface level is the gun fu action stuff which almost outMatrixes The Matrix in style if not volume. Preston is so skilled to be an almost invincible opponent. His solitary misstep as a fighter occurs once he gives himself over to emotion. This is nicely related to the common advice from kung fu senseis that emotion lessens one's effectiveness in combat.Of course a big part of Equilibrium is the set of philosophical points it has to make about emotion. There are sections of the film that are appropriately dialogueheavy and Wimmer is more than conspicuous with this one of two primary themes. Just as important as dialogue for Wimmer's commentary on man's emotions are body language and behavior. Some viewers might see it as a flaw that characters frequently show what they consider to be signs of emotions in their comments or behavior but that's part of Wimmer's agenda. Because it's difficult to even say just what counts as an emotion and emotions are so wrappedup with being sentient beings it would be difficult if not impossible to fully eliminate them and it's certainly not recommendable. The cast does an excellent job of portraying characters who are supposed to be mostly emotionless but with cracks in the stoic armor continually poking through.Wimmer has a harsh view of our society's selfmedication epidemiceven the title of the film seems to be a stab at the common claim that drugs like Prozac and Xanax are taken to help one smooth out or equalize extremes of mood or extreme dispositions. The Equilibrium government extends this agenda into the tangible material realm as they also attempt to smooth out mood swings by eliminating any cultural artifacts that might promote varied moodsemotions. Wimmer seems to see it as a nottooexaggerated extension of the modus operandi behind Prozaclike drugs.The other primary theme is one of institutional control. Wimmer has a lot to say about unquestioningly following authorities and he's careful to show that it's not just governmental authorities that can be a problem. He does this by tightly wrapping religious allegory with his depiction of Equilibrium's government. The leader is known as Father and the government secret service members are clerics. Those outside of this control are shown as authentic free individualistic and happy despite the hardships involved with their embrace of forbidden thoughtitems.More subtly Wimmer employs the now overused washed out bluegray cinematography of late 1990searly 2000s genre films towards an unusual end. It's not just a stylistic device here but represents a particular kind of reality. Under the purview of the fascistic government bluegray predominates. When glimpses of freedomauthenticity enter the film the bluegray look is gone replaced with strongly saturated warm colors and occasionally a more nostalgic subdued tone. This is one of the film's similarities to The Wizard of Oz although maybe not the most significant one.If you're someone who cherishes originality for its own sake you might not like Equilibrium as much but you have much more serious epistemological problems to sort out. Otherwise this is a film worth watching and thinking about.".

The film is basically highconcept combination of Fahrenheit 451 1966 George Orwell's novel Nineteen EightyFour original published in 1949 film versions appeared in 1954 1956 and 1984 The Matrix 1999 and a bit of The Wizard of Oz 1939 thrown in for good measure. What matters is not how original the ideas are assuming it's not a case of plagiarism as whether something is original or not is an epistemological problem that tells us more about our own familiarity with other material rather than the precedent status of the artwork we're questioning but how well the material is handled. The highconcept material in Equilibrium is handled brilliantly.On its surface after a brief actionoriented beginning Equilibrium is basically a progression from a fairly complex scifi film meaning simply that it takes a lot of exposition to get up to speed to a thriller to a gun fustyled actioner. The progression is carried out deftly by writerdirector Kurt Wimmer who unfortunately hasn't shown the same level of elegant panache in other films I've seen from him including Sphere 1998 and The Recruit 2003 with all of the genres somewhat present throughout the film. Wimmer is so austerely slick here that Equilibrium sometimes resembles a postmodernist automobile commercial. The transition from genre to genre is incredibly smooth.The most impressive material on this surface level is the gun fu action stuff which almost outMatrixes The Matrix in style if not volume. Preston is so skilled to be an almost invincible opponent. His solitary misstep as a fighter occurs once he gives himself over to emotion. This is nicely related to the common advice from kung fu senseis that emotion lessens one's effectiveness in combat.Of course a big part of Equilibrium is the set of philosophical points it has to make about emotion. There are sections of the film that are appropriately dialogueheavy and Wimmer is more than conspicuous with this one of two primary themes. Just as important as dialogue for Wimmer's commentary on man's emotions are body language and behavior. Some viewers might see it as a flaw that characters frequently show what they consider to be signs of emotions in their comments or behavior but that's part of Wimmer's agenda. Because it's difficult to even say just what counts as an emotion and emotions are so wrappedup with being sentient beings it would be difficult if not impossible to fully eliminate them and it's certainly not recommendable. The cast does an excellent job of portraying characters who are supposed to be mostly emotionless but with cracks in the stoic armor continually poking through.Wimmer has a harsh view of our society's selfmedication epidemiceven the title of the film seems to be a stab at the common claim that drugs like Prozac and Xanax are taken to help one smooth out or equalize extremes of mood or extreme dispositions. The Equilibrium government extends this agenda into the tangible material realm as they also attempt to smooth out mood swings by eliminating any cultural artifacts that might promote varied moodsemotions. Wimmer seems to see it as a nottooexaggerated extension of the modus operandi behind Prozaclike drugs.The other primary theme is one of institutional control. Wimmer has a lot to say about unquestioningly following authorities and he's careful to show that it's not just governmental authorities that can be a problem. He does this by tightly wrapping religious allegory with his depiction of Equilibrium's government. The leader is known as Father and the government secret service members are clerics. Those outside of this control are shown as authentic free individualistic and happy despite the hardships involved with their embrace of forbidden thoughtitems.More subtly Wimmer employs the now overused washed out bluegray cinematography of late 1990searly 2000s genre films towards an unusual end. It's not just a stylistic device here but represents a particular kind of reality. Under the purview of the fascistic government bluegray predominates. When glimpses of freedomauthenticity enter the film the bluegray look is gone replaced with strongly saturated warm colors and occasionally a more nostalgic subdued tone. This is one of the film's similarities to The Wizard of Oz although maybe not the most significant one.If you're someone who cherishes originality for its own sake you might not like Equilibrium as much but you have much more serious epistemological problems to sort out. Otherwise this is a film worth watching and thinking about.";

	schema:reviewBody "I went in to see Equilibrium with no knowledge of the movie other than a two line synopsis from a local newspaper and the movie poster in the theater lobby.  As usual I was practicing my theory of lowered expectations.  I expect a movie to be horribly awful ahead of time so I can not be disappointed.  I was not disappointed. At the end of the film I could not sit still in my seat.  I felt the urge to go out into the world and proclaim the utter awesomeness of Equilibrium.  Such words as Sweet Crazy and Righteous sprang forth from my lips in rapid succession when I talked about the movie with my friends. Not since the Fellowship of the Ring have I desired to sing a movie's praises.  And I mean literally SING.  Equilibrium could and should be the sleeper hit of the year.  The film's action sequences stir up the blood and pump the adrenaline as if you were riding a rollercoaster.  The art style while minimalistic and thus maybe confused for lowbudget by some is actually quite successful in portraying a totalitarian and emotionless society.  The acting is excellent as well and quite possibly the best I have seen in an action film in long time. While the naysayers will say that the film is too unoriginal borrowing elements of its story and premise from Fahrenheit 451 and Brave New World these complaints can be disregarded as the movie adds enough of its own style and story to make the comparisons plausible in basic premise only. In the end like any movie Equilibrium is meant as entertainment. And entertain it does. It does it so very well.  It mixes action and with substantial plot and original style to make an excellent whole.  Go see it. Go see it twice.  Go see Equilibrium Cleric.".

Not that Equilibrium is inherently new  it borrows a fair few plot concepts from Farenheit 451 and Nineteen EightyFour to name the most prominent examples. It is the way in which the old ideas are combined with the new that makes Equilibrium a fun and underrated experience.The premise is simple enough. In a kneejerk reaction to the horrors of World War Three the survivors outlaw what they blame the chaos upon. Their own emotions in other words. As the lead character has a series of revelations we begin to understand that in so doing they have also outlawed much of what gives our existence a point. In the bland lifeless world that the lawabiding citizens inhabit everything that the audience takes for granted to make their lives worthwhile is being systematically destroyed. Shades of the America of today the whole principle of throwing the baby out with the bathwater are shown in a stark horror show.I've read people comparing this film to The Matrix or its sequels. Where The Matrix series' fights were overlong and often with no payoff Equilibrium's fights are short and to the point. The difference this makes is needless to say as uplifting as Preston's fight to regain the humanity he stripped so many others of. Instead of having fights with no emotional connection to the characters the story is given sufficient development to make the audience care what happens.The film is not entirely without flaws. The Prozium element seems to have been written with no regard for the facts about psychiatric medicines. Their purpose is not to suppress emotion at all but to balance the chemical system of the brain in order to give the patient better control of them. Sure they're not without problems of their own but exaggerating them like this does not do the portion of the community that needs them any favours. That aside however the oncamera struggle is one of the most intriguing I've viewed for some time. Ergo this minor plot problem is made up for. The only other real complaint I have is that the film could have done with a little more footage to give some characters more of a chance to develop.I gave Equilibrium an eight out of ten. It's not the best negative science fiction you'll ever see but it is enough of a breath of fresh air that this won't entirely matter. If the MPAA made more films like this it wouldn't be suffering the constant financial dire straits that it so loves to blame everyone else for.".

The idea of a future enclosed society in which a Fascist Government or regime tries to exert total control over it's population  one lone inside rebel sets out to do something about it has been done before in various SciFi films  books like THX 1138 1971 Demolition Man 1993  George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eigthy Four 1949 along with rippingoff other SciFi flicks like the empathy test from Blade Runner 1982  of course The Matrix 1999 inspired action scenes in which the frankly silly sounding concept of someone being able to mathematically work out where someone will fire bullets  therefore avoid them named 'Gun Kata' is used. In fact there are a lot of clichs in Equilibrium  the basic concept is flawed since Libira seems to be one city but what about the rest of the world? Would they not still have emotion? Who would join such a society anyway? The basic idea that all emotion is suppressed is just hard to swallow as well it just wouldn't work under the ultra strict conditions in Equilibrium. Having said that if you can get past the shaky concept  writing then the character's are alright the story moves along  there's some decent action scenes  ideas but the basic concept which I don't think works at all is it's biggest flaw.The action scenes do look like they have come straight out of The Matrix  in fact are inferior there's certainly not a lot of action so don't expect fights  shootouts every few minutes. The depiction of the future is reasonable it's not that different than it is now apart from the basic morals of the society the actual technology doesn't seem to advanced as people still drive around in cars  live in apartment blocks. As you would expect from a film set in an emotionless society the production design is deliberately bland yet stylish people wear blacks  greys apartments are bare with no colour or carpets or wallpaper  even everyone looks the same.With a supposed budget of about 20000000 this was actually fairly low budget  that probably accounts for a not too spectacular vision of the future. Filmed in Germany  Italy before some reshoots in Canada. The acting is alright although Sean Bean has nothing more than a three minute cameo despite near top billing in the credits.Equilibrium is a film that within itself works quite well  is entertaining enough but for a SciFi film that takes itself extremely seriously the plot  concepts therein don't stand up at all. I liked  disliked it in equal measure.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here's a true story  This evening I went to see a movie called Equilibrium.  Now normally I save every movie ticket and throw them in a shoebox filled with precious mementos.  On my trip through the parking lot I pulled out my Zippo and proceeded to burn it.  Then proceeded to speed home so I could take an extremely violent crap.  I don't know what was worse how painful the bowel movement was or how painful the movie was.Roger Ebert gave this movie 3 stars out of 4.  As soon as I'm done writing this review I'm going to track him down and forcefeed him his review. Laced with Strychnine.  I realize you're probably thinking Shouldn't the punishment fit the crime?  But frankly I'm a busy man and I don't have time for 6 months of chakra torture.I suppose you're expecting some sort of review of the movie so I guess I should make an attempt.  Then again if I put as much effort into this review as writerdirector Kurt Wimmer put into his screenplay I could call it a day right now.Equilibrium gives us a society Libria which is opiated by a drug known as Librium a necessity after World War III.  The survivors in power decided that it was man's emotion that led to war and in order to prevent any such future occurrences they constructed a society based on emotionless.  This is aided by the destruction of all art music and cultural relics not to mention 3 doses a day of the aforementioned Librium injection.Those who forsake the drug are known as Sense Offenders and these criminals are tended to by an elite class of soldiers known as Clericks. And by tended to I mean Terminated with extreme prejudice.Within the first 20 minutes of the film we've encountered Clerick John Preston watched him kill his partner for being a sense offender and discovered his wife was executed for Sense offenses 4 years earlier.  But thanks to his Librium doses he doesn't seem to mind much.  Watching this movie I suddenly wished they made a drug which made horrible movies good.All is well and good in emotionless Libria until Preston accidentally knocks a vial of his Librium off the bathroom sink and doesn't have time to pick up another dose.  Suddenly he is overwhelmed with emotion and continues to abstain from his medication leading him to question authority and rebel.  And by rebel I mean Terminate with extreme prejudice.I suppose you're expecting me to say something along the lines of At this point the movie degenerates into a Matrixwannabe.  Unfortunately the movie was that from the moment Preston and his partner show up to tend to the first lot of sense offenders.  Christian Bale was dripping with Keanuosity from the slickedback black hair black garb and generally emotionless acting ability.Although one would be hesitant to mention the dullness of his performance given the fact he was on the drug he was only on the drug for the first 20 minutes.  After that I would've expected him to suddenly become warm and likeable.  Instead he merely dives into his best Keanu Reeves impersonation and begins dealing with ludicrous amounts of heavily armed soldiers in his attempt to overthrow Libria's regime.  And by dealing with I mean Terminating with extreme prejudice.During the course of the movie we are subjected to no less than 6 major gunfight scenes not a single one of them memorable.  The Clericks display incredible superhuman agility and strength which would be fine if this was the Matrix but this isn't.  It's set in the future in the real world and yet we're supposed to digest the idea that humans can jump 20 feet into the air and dodge the bullets of 20 closerange gunman using statistical probability.I suppose by now you're thinking to yourself This movie sounds awful.  I should go see it just for the cheese factor.  This is where I warn you that I saw the Transporter and the One and I enjoyed both on a cheesy action movie level.  I feel confident saying this movie makes abysmal blush. Gutwrenchinglyawful could stand next to this movie and therefore look attractive in comparison.  After seeing this movie ritual seppuku seemed like a fun way to pass the time.This movie will be the low marks on the resumes of actors and actresses like Christian Bale Taye Diggs Sean Bean and Emily Watson.  Kurt Wimmer whose visuals were forgettable and his screenplay full of clichs and attempts to rip off many other successful movies and books will hopefully never write a screenplay again.  And I sincerely hope the entire special effects team returns to throwing together lowbudget effects for advertising because Terminator 2 had more believable special effects.In short  Do not see this movie.  Ever.  If you see it on movie store shelves run in the opposite direction screaming.  If not for yourself then at least for the children.  Do it for the children.".

As soon as I'm done writing this review I'm going to track him down and forcefeed him his review. Laced with Strychnine.  I realize you're probably thinking Shouldn't the punishment fit the crime?  But frankly I'm a busy man and I don't have time for 6 months of chakra torture.I suppose you're expecting some sort of review of the movie so I guess I should make an attempt.  Then again if I put as much effort into this review as writerdirector Kurt Wimmer put into his screenplay I could call it a day right now.Equilibrium gives us a society Libria which is opiated by a drug known as Librium a necessity after World War III.  The survivors in power decided that it was man's emotion that led to war and in order to prevent any such future occurrences they constructed a society based on emotionless.  This is aided by the destruction of all art music and cultural relics not to mention 3 doses a day of the aforementioned Librium injection.Those who forsake the drug are known as Sense Offenders and these criminals are tended to by an elite class of soldiers known as Clericks. And by tended to I mean Terminated with extreme prejudice.Within the first 20 minutes of the film we've encountered Clerick John Preston watched him kill his partner for being a sense offender and discovered his wife was executed for Sense offenses 4 years earlier.  But thanks to his Librium doses he doesn't seem to mind much.  Watching this movie I suddenly wished they made a drug which made horrible movies good.All is well and good in emotionless Libria until Preston accidentally knocks a vial of his Librium off the bathroom sink and doesn't have time to pick up another dose.  Suddenly he is overwhelmed with emotion and continues to abstain from his medication leading him to question authority and rebel.  And by rebel I mean Terminate with extreme prejudice.I suppose you're expecting me to say something along the lines of At this point the movie degenerates into a Matrixwannabe.  Unfortunately the movie was that from the moment Preston and his partner show up to tend to the first lot of sense offenders.  Christian Bale was dripping with Keanuosity from the slickedback black hair black garb and generally emotionless acting ability.Although one would be hesitant to mention the dullness of his performance given the fact he was on the drug he was only on the drug for the first 20 minutes.  After that I would've expected him to suddenly become warm and likeable.  Instead he merely dives into his best Keanu Reeves impersonation and begins dealing with ludicrous amounts of heavily armed soldiers in his attempt to overthrow Libria's regime.  And by dealing with I mean Terminating with extreme prejudice.During the course of the movie we are subjected to no less than 6 major gunfight scenes not a single one of them memorable.  The Clericks display incredible superhuman agility and strength which would be fine if this was the Matrix but this isn't.  It's set in the future in the real world and yet we're supposed to digest the idea that humans can jump 20 feet into the air and dodge the bullets of 20 closerange gunman using statistical probability.I suppose by now you're thinking to yourself This movie sounds awful.  I should go see it just for the cheese factor.  This is where I warn you that I saw the Transporter and the One and I enjoyed both on a cheesy action movie level.  I feel confident saying this movie makes abysmal blush. Gutwrenchinglyawful could stand next to this movie and therefore look attractive in comparison.  After seeing this movie ritual seppuku seemed like a fun way to pass the time.This movie will be the low marks on the resumes of actors and actresses like Christian Bale Taye Diggs Sean Bean and Emily Watson.  Kurt Wimmer whose visuals were forgettable and his screenplay full of clichs and attempts to rip off many other successful movies and books will hopefully never write a screenplay again.  And I sincerely hope the entire special effects team returns to throwing together lowbudget effects for advertising because Terminator 2 had more believable special effects.In short  Do not see this movie.  Ever.  If you see it on movie store shelves run in the opposite direction screaming.  If not for yourself then at least for the children.  Do it for the children.";

However in the mood for a bit of slick action I rented this film and was pleasantly surprised by it.  The plot may not be original  but what is these days?  The film has shades of 1984 and Brave New World about it and it uses these ideas reasonably well.  The concept does fall down a little bit with too much thought but on the surface it works well enough to suffice for a scifi action movie  the running time doesn't allow for much more than superficial thought here although there is enough in this future to be thought provoking.The action is good considering the low budget involved here.  Yes it's all very much thanks to the influence of the Matrix but at least it is quite stylish and exciting in it's own right rather than just being a lazy copy. The action scenes are well spread out over the film and they have good pace despite being very much style over substance.  The explanation for all the acrobatics and semiinvincibility here is not as good as the explanationjustification for the same in Matrix but again it is acceptable for this level of film.  If anything the plot goes too fast and too far  it is difficult to accept that things happen so fast but generally it works.The cast is a strange mix but works.  The thing that surprised me was the sheer number of British actors in the cast.  Bale is good in the lead role despite his American accent he is pretty cool and manages to do the emotional change required despite the rush enforced on him by the film. Diggs is disappointing  his character doesn't get enough screentime and he doesn't fulfil the role of rival to Bale he is a good looking guy but that isn't enough here.  The support cast features Bean Pertwee Connelly Fincher and McFadyen but really it is totally Bale's movie and he does pretty well to make it together.Overall this is not a great film but it is an enjoyable action scifi that manages to produce an interesting if unoriginal plot and some slick and fun action that is no less slick or fun for being a low rent version of The Matrix's effects.  Well worth a Friday night look!".

It's obvious that the movie didn't had a terribly high budget and I must see that they handled this well and made the best out of it.The fight scene's are fairly good but simply too much overthetop to find it really entertaining or believable. Also the ending disappoints heavily and overall the movie leaves a bad aftertaste.Christian Bale on the other hand is simply cool and wonderful in his role and he portrays a good main characterhero. Sean Bean also has a quite good role but don't be fooled people his role is very limited the same goes for William Fichtner.Quite frankly I don't see what this movie has got to distinct itself from other Bsciencefiction movies. It has a unlikely and silly handled story that never flows really well and the action leaves a pointless impression. Yes not a lot of people are going to agree with me on this but in my opinion the critics were absolutely right this time.

	schema:reviewBody "A 9 out of 10 only for some budget deficiencies that show a bit. By all means skip the director commentary because its all whining about lack of funds. Understandable but obnoxious to sit through. Let me just comment on a few things not much mentioned in the customer reviews. First despite what's stated by many and even the IMDb plot summary the population shown here is not drugged to the point of being emotionless. People have to feel enough to care about family obeying the rules succeeding at their jobs etc. Rather the highs and lows of emotion have been chemically eliminated. Although this is taught from birth to be necessary for sense purity the real reason is that it makes it easier for a repressive regime to stay in power and at least partially prevent rebellion. And for anyone who thinks the mass public attendance of televised political harangues is unrealistic go rent Triumph of the Will by the chronicler of Nazi ascendancy Leni Riefenstahl. And remind yourself that Hitler's adoring masses weren't even drugged.Second although the drug is used to control emotions its good old indoctrination that dictates behavior. The drugged state is reinforced by every mind control practice you can think of. Children are rewarded for ratting out parents friends tattle on friends etc. While the immediate reward is continued survival of the ratter at the expense of the rattee you still get the sense that even children can feel some level of satisfaction in having earned brownie points done their duty cleansed their family whatever. Careful watching or rewatching of this movie shows that people around the edges of the main characters express flickers of emotion according to their job status with those in more regular jobs having less rein on their responses. By contrast one key character is obviously off his meds though some viewers seem to think this was either bad acting or some kind of continuity error. Actually its important to the plot.In a truly emotionless society no one would even bother to procreate or care for children. So even John Preston Christian Bale seems permitted to indicate a flicker of pride over his young son's acceptance into the cleric training school which he expresses right in front of the most important boss he has. From what we see its only he and his fellow Grammaton Clerics who are trained to squelch their emotions entirely as well they might since they are the cruel enforcement arm of their society's vicious goals.Third Bale deserves a lot of credit for the way this movie succeeds. He does a wonderful job of making us care about a nearlyexpressionless man who sets his own liberation in motion through one simple accident or is it? while brushing his teeth a small personal cleansing that suggests bigger things are coming. He's soon slammed hard by emotions he's never been allowed to feel emotions that both intrigue and frighten him and which he dare not express. Its almost worth the price of rentalpurchase to see him play a man hearing his first music or sitting and watching his children sleep late one night. Even as we realize he's feeling paternal love to a degree he's never felt it before the fact remains he still can't show it and his kids can't know it or they'll turn him in. By the time he reviews a key event in his personal life you can feel its horrific impact on him by the merest flicker of reaction on his face and in the tiniest changes in body language. The tension between what he realizes and feels and what he dares to show builds to an agonizing subclimax that sets the finale in motion.Fourth the ironic different between what is expected of people in this dark future and how human nature really operates is used to great effect. Preston's special skill as a cleric is his ability to anticipate what lies beneath what's behind the wall what his quarry is thinking. In other words to sense. This makes him suspect as well as valuable to his masters. The feeling of personal jeopardy builds wonderfully as he experiences more and struggles harderto hide it particularly as he realizes his special mission is being scrutinized by his new partner.The best scifi is never about technology the best martial arts movies are never about the fighting. The human heart may never have perfect equilibrium and this quiet little classic of a movie sure never got its due in a limited theatrical release. But its worth your time and then some.".

Children are rewarded for ratting out parents friends tattle on friends etc. While the immediate reward is continued survival of the ratter at the expense of the rattee you still get the sense that even children can feel some level of satisfaction in having earned brownie points done their duty cleansed their family whatever. Careful watching or rewatching of this movie shows that people around the edges of the main characters express flickers of emotion according to their job status with those in more regular jobs having less rein on their responses. By contrast one key character is obviously off his meds though some viewers seem to think this was either bad acting or some kind of continuity error. Actually its important to the plot.In a truly emotionless society no one would even bother to procreate or care for children. So even John Preston Christian Bale seems permitted to indicate a flicker of pride over his young son's acceptance into the cleric training school which he expresses right in front of the most important boss he has. From what we see its only he and his fellow Grammaton Clerics who are trained to squelch their emotions entirely as well they might since they are the cruel enforcement arm of their society's vicious goals.Third Bale deserves a lot of credit for the way this movie succeeds. He does a wonderful job of making us care about a nearlyexpressionless man who sets his own liberation in motion through one simple accident or is it? while brushing his teeth a small personal cleansing that suggests bigger things are coming. He's soon slammed hard by emotions he's never been allowed to feel emotions that both intrigue and frighten him and which he dare not express. Its almost worth the price of rentalpurchase to see him play a man hearing his first music or sitting and watching his children sleep late one night. Even as we realize he's feeling paternal love to a degree he's never felt it before the fact remains he still can't show it and his kids can't know it or they'll turn him in. By the time he reviews a key event in his personal life you can feel its horrific impact on him by the merest flicker of reaction on his face and in the tiniest changes in body language. The tension between what he realizes and feels and what he dares to show builds to an agonizing subclimax that sets the finale in motion.Fourth the ironic different between what is expected of people in this dark future and how human nature really operates is used to great effect. Preston's special skill as a cleric is his ability to anticipate what lies beneath what's behind the wall what his quarry is thinking. In other words to sense. This makes him suspect as well as valuable to his masters. The feeling of personal jeopardy builds wonderfully as he experiences more and struggles harderto hide it particularly as he realizes his special mission is being scrutinized by his new partner.The best scifi is never about technology the best martial arts movies are never about the fighting. The human heart may never have perfect equilibrium and this quiet little classic of a movie sure never got its due in a limited theatrical release. But its worth your time and then some.";

Equilibrium is set in the near future after a third world war in order to prevent future war a drug has been developed to suppress all human emotion. This has not led to a Utopia however this future is very much a dystopia anybody who is suspected of committing 'sense crimes' is executed without trial this summary justice is carried out by 'clerics' such a John Preston a man so devoid of emotion that he executed his own partner and barely batted an eyelid when his wife was taken to be incinerated. That is until one day he fails to take the emotionsuppressing drug. As time passes his feelings get deeper and he realises that he must fight against the system a fight that could mean sacrificing innocent people to get close to Father the leader of this emotionless world.This was rather better than I had expected the dystopian world was genuinely chilling it became clear that anybody could die when John Preston's partner was killed early on as he was played by Sean Bean I was sure he'd be a major character. Christian Bale put in a fine performance as Preston and Emily Watson was fine as Mary a woman he arrests. If there was a major flaw it was the ending I prefer my dystopian dramas to be a bit more downbeat. Instead of such an ending Preston goes on a rampage skilfully slaughtering dozens of police before confronting his Nemesis. While the action was spectacular and well choreographed it was a bit too stylish. Still it was a decent film overall and I'd recommend checking it out.".

His performance was as ever slick and for most the the performance  genuine. His character was well portrayed and really captured the transition from his initial robotic persona to his latter more emotionally free state of mind. This was illustrated both in his professional life and his social interactions and really showed how his entire existence was shaped totally by the numbing of emotion. Some great ideas and proficient acting not to mention lots of traditional destroying the place action mixed in really gives this movie the edge over many other similar titles within the broad action genre.".

In real life it's just trying to give a martialarts explanation for a semimystic ability to shoot everybody around you.Christian Bale seems to be continuing to act by showing as little emotion as possible.

The woolly blanket in this case was around my heart. Kal Ho Naa Ho is by no means perfect. It has its share of illogical moments and cliched scenes. But while watching Indian films one must get over such hurdles to appreciate them. Or like Naina we'll be left criticizing everything in sight and forgetting to enjoy the moment. Also we must remember that although its important for the film industry to grow and evolve its equally as important not to lose what is inherently our Indian identity which is apparent in the songs and the emotional quotient of hindi movies.That said for me Kal Ho Naa Ho will go down as one of my all time favorite movies. The performances were wonderful. Shah Rukh Khan gives another performance that will be remembered. He may not be the greatest actor who ever came out of Bombay but he is one of the few who manages to create characters who seem so friendly and lovable you would think of him as your own. No one else in the industry has this knack of creating an atmosphere of 'apnapan'. Preity Zinta as Naina is wonderful and a perfect choice for the role. I have no idea how Dharma productions even considered Kareena Kapoor for the role of Naina. Saif Ali Khan is also incredible. Rohit is very similar to Sameer in Dil Chahta Hai but with a lot more emotional depth. I don't care how many times Saif plays that character I still love him for it and I don't think I'll ever tire of seeing it. Jaya Bachchan who plays Jenny Naina's mother is incredible in this small role. This character is very real and you can really sympathize with her because of Mrs. Bachchan.I was very disappointed with the music when it was first released. But the songs grew on me after watching them on screen. The title song is especially good as are Pretty Woman and Mahi Ve. Kuch To Hua hai is also much better on screen. Cinematography is wonderful another aspect that makes this movie magical. Direction by Nikhil Advani is surprising to say the least. He did an excellent job bringing the story to life. And I will look forward to his next movie. It must have been hard for Karan Johar to give away his story but Nikhil justified Karan's confidence in him and possibly made a better film than Karan might have. One of the many things I loved about the movie was that it was quite funny. Even during the dramatic moments I was either laughing or smiling. The screenplay and the dialogues were excellent. Nikhil Advani must have a real talent for comic scenes because they were terrific.And finally I'd like to commend Karan Johar for writing such a wonderful story with characters that are very down to earth and real. Even though I loved his previous films Kuch Kuch Hota Hai  Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham Kal Ho Naa Ho is definitely my favorite. I hope we get to experience many more of his wonderful stories that are hopefully made with SRK  because they are the dream team. If I ever meet Karan Johar I will shake his hand and give him a hug for creating such a heart warming film.".

It is so worth watching and with it Karan Johar has confirmed the he is indeed a milestone in Hindi Cinema history. The movie is definitely directed by a another Nikhil Advani but it is a Johar camp movie. With the Johar camp you associate a good story good production good songs and the 'King Khan'.What would you compare it to? Well to be honest .nothing. It has the originality of Kuch Kuch' the splendour of K3G' and the freshness of Dil Chaata Hai' but it cannot be compared to any of these or other movies. It is in a league of its own. The story may start as the runofthemill hindicinema story but just when we begin to get comfortable with it it takes a turn down another path. Don't get me wrong it is not a complex story at all  but it is unique and compelling.Would you watch it again? Well to be honest I am writing this after having watched it a second time. What is so rare about this movie is that even the second time round I laughed at the jokes tapped at the music and got emotional in the sad scenes.What's it about? Well it will not be fair to tell you about it as it's an experience you should have first hand. But it has its plus points the comedy is great both in the gujju digs as well as the 'kantabein' scenes the music grows on you maahi ve being the best the guest appearances of 'charmed' actresses the acting  excellent all round from SRK to Zinta to Saif to Jaya along with good direction and production. It also has its negative points  but then so do other movies and I would rather not get into those.It may not be the DDLJ or Lagaan of hindi cinema but it's the best movie of the year and definitely a movie that will entertain me for years to come.".

Be it talented Jaya Bachchan Sushma Seth Lillette Dubey Sweetu Rajpal Yadav or the highlight Kantaben. Simone Singh was good as well  she attempts a bit of skinshow desperately wanting to breakfree from the Heena image.03. Comedy Comedy tracks have been really worked upon. There are many pokings at Gujju's directly the audience on both my sides appeared threatening!  but in spite of that the G.U.J.J.U. song makes up for all the damage. Clever very clever. Kantaben was good and so was Satish Shah and his English. 04. Location The movie is a proper New York Darshan bus. The trivial mistakes about jogging to Central Park from Queens can be easily overlooked in the age where the scripts have crater sized holes. 05. Music SEL have given one of their best compositions to date. Be it the title song or Mahi Ve  all of them stay with you for a long time. My favourite is Its the time to disco Vasundhara Das rocks she bring out the voice of Nazia Hassan. 06. Lyrics The title song is definitely Javed Akhtar caliber. For the rest he should give the credit to a pseudonym.07. Spl. Appearances Sonali Bendre and Sanjay Kapoor have extended special appearances. And in blinkanmiss appearances by Kajol  Rani lucky mascots of Karan Johar Uday Chopra and Jugal Hansraj. 08. Protagonists SRK plays his part extremely well in the author backed role as the good Samaritan however does succumb to a bit of his usual hamming. Saif proves yet again that he is a dependable actor and at times can steal the show right under the nose. His performance at the restaurant proposing scene is wonderful. Preity does full justice to her character Kareena  sour grapes! sour grapes!.09. Tracks In fact the movie is full of tracks but interesting ones. Be it Kantaben Simone Singh the wrong house 7day proposing Sweetu revamping of the restaurant or Gia's adoption track. The director has just done a good copypaste of it.The makers have ensured that there is maximum utilisation of resources at all fronts. For a firsttimer Nikhil Advani has done a commendable job obviously under the baton of Karan Johar who ensured that Yash Johar films flag remains high and rising.Definitely worth a watch.... with family.PS Its interesting to see that from time to time SRK acknowledges Aamir Khan in his movies here the Lagaan song and in K3G the Ghulam matchstick.".

	schema:reviewBody "For all those who want to know whether Kal Ho Naa Ho is a remake of Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Anand the answer is yes. And no. Shah Rukh Khan's character Aman is largely inspired by Rajesh Khanna's happygolucky charmer in Anand. But on the whole Kal Ho Naa Ho is as different as they come. The film kicks off with Manhattan resident Naina Catherine Kapur Preity Zinta narrating the story of her life over her daily morning jog. Don't Miss! The characters in Naina's life are introduced with the same energy that Naina puts into her jog. There is her mom Jennifer Jaya Bachchan in jeans who shares a lovehate relationship with her motherinlaw Sushma Seth at her loudest Punjabi best. Mommy runs a flop restaurant. Grandmother is a flop singer. Together they are chaos. Enough reason for Naina to turn into a boring bespectacled spinster type who takes life too seriously.

	onyx:emotionText "For all those who want to know whether Kal Ho Naa Ho is a remake of Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Anand the answer is yes. And no. Shah Rukh Khan's character Aman is largely inspired by Rajesh Khanna's happygolucky charmer in Anand. But on the whole Kal Ho Naa Ho is as different as they come. The film kicks off with Manhattan resident Naina Catherine Kapur Preity Zinta narrating the story of her life over her daily morning jog. Don't Miss! The characters in Naina's life are introduced with the same energy that Naina puts into her jog. There is her mom Jennifer Jaya Bachchan in jeans who shares a lovehate relationship with her motherinlaw Sushma Seth at her loudest Punjabi best. Mommy runs a flop restaurant. Grandmother is a flop singer. Together they are chaos. Enough reason for Naina to turn into a boring bespectacled spinster type who takes life too seriously. The only interesting person in Naina's life is buddy Rohit Patel Saif Ali Khan. He is uncool with women but thinks he is cool.

All the actors give a very moving performance. This movie can make you laugh and cry all at the same time and the storyline isn't the same old things you see in Bollywood films. The main reason I like this film is because it contains modern elements in it. Its set in NY and its has Western culture blended into it also. Being a teenager living in the US I personally enjoy being able to relate to the movies I watch and I don't really like movies that are too traditional. I think if you like modernized Hindi movies you'll love this movie. Even if you don't its most definitely worth watching.".

Straight to the point Kal Ho Naa Ho is a fantastic film....definitely worth seeing and worth seeing over again.Shah Rukh Khan does a great job...as usual. I guess nobody else does emotional scenes AND comedy as well as he does. Saif Ali Khan is great. Again as usual since he plays that role in many of his films but he holds the story together....!! And Preity...well it's her year. She rules Bollywood this year. After Koi mil gaya she comes back in KHNH with a much stronger role probably her strongest role since Kya Kehna....and she excels in it. Yes why was Kareena Kapoor even considered for this role??? Jaya Bacchan is also worth a mention. Nobody else could have played this role. She is fantastic!!! The special appearances make the film...well...special!!!Some of us would go see any film for 5 seconds of Kajol....especially next to Shah Rukh!!! And all credits to Karan Johar and Nikhil Advani. To Karan for coming up with the film trusting Nikhil and making it happen and to Nikhil for a firstclass job in his first direction... And the music is wonderful...ShankarEhsaanLoy definitely establishing themselves further in Bollywoodland. And Farah Khan plays her usual magic with the choreography especially for the song Kuch to Hua Hai which will keep you giggling in your seat...Now the loopholes Why do all Caucasian looking people in America speak Hindi with an awful accent as well especially when some of the Indians sometimes afford to speak English!!??!! Why could they not spend some more time and effort to make Shah Rukh mime his rap words well in the Pretty Woman song?? Why when Saif and Preity find out about Shah Rukh they both seem more worried about their love lives than their friend's....well...LIFE!!! Why did I leave the cinema feeling that if Shah Rukh was given a dialogue full of hope before then end of the film I'd have felt better...coz surely that was the point of the film hope. I felt that the last 20 minutes were not wellexplored enough...and too sketchy. One second SRK and Preity love each other and the next she's still getting married...Why are we not shown the process that goes in between. It would have been good emotional and more realistic...But maybe I'm just moaning about details. Maybe I am being a bit of a Naina Catherine Kapoor....So I'll end on this note rather...Seen in the broader context of Indian Cinema this film is a proper landmark....It's a perfect blend of the East and the West. After rather unsuccessful attempts at copying American Piestyle comedy in Indian films SOMEBODY finally showed us what it takes to make a success of this kind A modern comedy hilarious jokes with modern direction cool style of storytelling I thought in a true Indian setting. Modern music but perfectly blended with Indian melody and lyrics. This film will take Indian comedy to new heights. And takes the EastWest blend to new heights. And it takes a great film to do that...And it will leave u not just proud of being Indian but of being a Western Indian. Perfect blend....".

	schema:reviewBody "Hands down this is the best film of the year and deservingly so. Although Nikhil Advani started off in the backseat it looks like from now on his job is in the director's chair. With the support of Karan Johar and Papa Yash Johar it's almost impossible to go wrong. With such blockbusters as Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham to his name Karan Johar is ready to add another feather to his cap with his beautiful and heartwarming Kal Ho Na Ho. Kal Ho Na Ho is directed by Karan Johar's associate director Nikhil Advani and produced by Karan Johar who has also written the screenplay for the film. Nikhil Advani was Johar's close assistant in all his films including Kuch Kuch Hota Hai K3G and Aditya Chopra's Mohabbatein.. The main cast has Shah Rukh Khan Preity Zinta Saif Ali Khan and Jaya Bachchan in the lead and a plethora of others including Sonali Bendre in support.Kal Ho Naa Ho takes place in Manhattan New York and is the story of three friends Aman Shah Rukh Khan Rohit Saif Ali Khan and Naina Preity Zinta who travel on a journey that teaches them the true meaning of friendship. It teaches them to discover themselves and to find the courage to live through times of happiness and times of sorrow. With the constant arguments and bickering in her semiPunjabisemiChristian family Naina 23 is completely distraught by the conditions which surround her. In addition to this she is bombarded with the responsibilities of taking care of her younger brother and sister as well as helping her mother Jennifer Jaya Bachchan handle the family's economical complications. Between all these burdens Naina never has time for herself.As far as the technical performance of the film goes it is almost impossible to create a more perfect film. The editing skills are extremely sound and the cinematography shows the viewers what a difference a few angle adjustments can do for a film. The overall effect of the film is merely jaw dropping for a lack of a better term. To put all rumors to rest Kal Ho Na Ho is NOT a copy of Hrikesh Mukherjee's 1970s classic Anand. Although Nikhil and Karan have adopted a shade of the film by no means is it a copy and should be regarded as a purely original story written by Karan himself.The greatest asset that Kal Ho Na Ho has is its cast. The magnitude of chemistry between Shah Rukh Khan Preity Zinta and Saif Ali Khan is mind blowing! Adding Jaya Bachchan to the mix creates for an even more awesome effect. It's safe to say that this is one of Shah Rukh Khan's best performances ever. He breathes so much life into his character Aman and literally has you feeling for him as if he was your very own. He puts on a mesmerizing performance and will definitely earn himself many awards.Shankar Ehsaan and Loy are a major part of this film as well. There music which has been topping the charts ever since its release brings a beautiful touch to the film. Their soft yet mellifluous melodies compliment the film wonderfully. To top it all off Javed Akhtar's mastery of the language creates for some heart warming lyrics.".

	schema:headline " The best Hindi Film of 2003";
	schema:reviewBody "Har pal yaha jeebhar jiyo jo hai samaa...kal ho naa ho...It takes a special person to apreciate a great Bollywood movie.  There's the constant melodrama the endless love triangles and dress changes the randomly inserted songs and hammy dialogue...not to mention the ageold desire to be everything to every viewer. There are so many Hollywoodesque problems that threaten its quality so many qualms that any selfrespecting American critic would feel compelled to point out that loving it seems like a chore.  If anybody can do so however it is an Indian.And I LOVE being an Indian.KAL HO NAA HO Tomorrow May or May Not Come is the third film involving writerdirector Karan Johar and Dharma Productions an Indian film label that has become synonymous with boxoffice and critical gold.  Their first two productions KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI and KABHI KHUSHI KABHIE GHAM were both  in their respective times the most popular Hindi films of all time and with good reason.  They were the ultimate crowd pleasers a perfect mix of comedy and drama with compelling stories masterful performances catchy music and impeccable direction.  They hit every emotional high and low possible in the typical Bollywood audience and the end results were magnificent.  KAL HO NAA HO continues this tradition in grand style.Naina Catherine Priety Zinta is the eldest daughter of Jenny Kapoor Jaya Bachchan and a father whose suicide has wreaked havoc on the entire Kapoor family.  The constant bickering among the members of her household has transformed Naina into a pitiful bore who has forgotten how to smile. Her best friend is Rohit Saif Ali Khan a fellow MBA student who has seen Naina through all her troubles.  The two have never been more than just friends.Along comes Aman Mathur Shah Rukh Khan a charasmatic man who enters the Kapoors' home and changes their lives for the better much to Naina's dismay.  Aman helps every member of the family with any problem and seems to have all the answers  he is perfect.  Aman eventually wins over Naina and changes her into a smiling young woman once again but not before she begins to have feelings for him.  What's more Rohit soon reveals that he loves Naina.Yet all is not as it seems.  There are secrets to be uncovered pasts to be mended and futures to be made and what the trio find out may suprise them.This is firstly an immesnly pleasing film.  The first half jumps right into the act with some wonderfully comedic scenes showcasing the talent of all three leads and the flair of firsttime director Nikhil Advani.  A particular scene involving a housemaid who suspects Aman and Rohit of being gay is among the most humorous Hindi film moments I've seen.  Karan Johar's fort with dialogue really shines here everything is quickwitted and funny yet never insulting to the intelligence many Hindi films can be. We grow to love and care about these characters quickly but thankfully characterization does not bog down the forward motion of the marrative. The first 90 minutes literally flies by.The most noticable aspect of KHNH is the tone the writer and director bring to the film it's incredibly energetic and light and takes chances with material that worked for me.  Many times the characters seem to speak oneonone with the camera in an interview style to convey personal feelings or thoughts an interesting tactic.  There are other little touches the Day 1 Day 2 etc. introductions stand out in particular see the film to find out what I mean.  There is an incredible scope and vibrant feel to the movie as in an Dharma production.The second half of the film gives all involved a chance to really shine. Once the twist is revealed things take a downward turn and the climax begins. Much of the light tone from the first 90 minutes creeps its way into the second half at all the right moments but there are some truly heartwrenching scenes toward the end of the film. This is to be expected but their impact is heightened by the skill of the filmmakers.  In most cases Hindi films pile crying scenes on top of one another in the hope of eliciting some if any reponses from the audience but KHNH succeeds due to solid characterization and wonderful performances.This is clearly Shah Rukh Khan's film and he acts his heart out.  It's the same performance we've seen a million times from him but his skills aren't broke so they don't need any tuning.  His screen prescence is unmatched in this industry and he captivates you during both the comedic and emotional scenes.  This was a chance for him to paly a different type of character and his natural charisma lends itself well to what the part requires. Priety Zinta finally steps into the limelight as Naina with a wonderful performance that reveals her true potential.  Watching her onscreen transformation is as unexpected as it is alluring.  Saif Ali Khan essentially echoes his character from DIL CHAHTA HAI but the magic has not worn off.  He has a knack for playing the straight man with unfulfilled and still unkonwn desires.  Supporting performances are from the usual Johar suspects and are accordingly wonderful.ShankarEhsaanLoy finally enter the Johar ring with this entry and certainly hold their own.  The title song is my choice for song of the year  a gently sung ballad about living life to the fullest complimented by wonderful lyrics from Javed Akhtar and great singing by Sonu Nigam.  The other romantic song Kuch To Hua Hai is a very contemporary song with an international flavor that manages to please with an unusual beat and interesting composition.  It's The Time To Disco is the loser of this disc although its film picturization is likable enough and the much hyped Pretty Woman yes based on the classic American song is surprisingly upbeat and entertaining.  The obligatory BSMDGC Big Set Many Dancers Good Choreography dance number is Maahi Ve a very catchy tune that bears some resemblance to the hit Shava Shava from KABHI KHUSHI KABHIE GHAM.  Farah Khan's onscreen choreography for the song does not disappoint and the art direction is simply marvelous.This film marks a new standard for Hindi film editing and shows just how much Bollywood has learned from its L.A. counterpart.  We have quick cuts new wipes and even splitscreens...all used wisely and not for cheap effect. The editing really brings the first half of the film to life giving every song a get up and dance feeling that never hurts.Above all this is Nikhil Advani's film.  Remarkably this novice helmer shows no signs of being a rookie.  In true Johar style he handles all the film's emotional scenes a perennial marker for directorial excellence with confidence and talent.  Having served before as assistant director to Karan Johar and Aditya Chopra Advani pulls out all the stops here giving us epic dramatic camera direction eliciting great performances and nearperfect pacing.Sure a good 10 minutes shaved off the finished product would be in the film's favor but it is a minor qubble in a sea of compliments.This is ultimately a story about hope and love  the hope to keep moving and beliving the love to keep surviving.  It is a story about the choices we make for love and the effects those choices have on our loved ones.  It is about living life to the fullest and seizing the day for Kal Ho Naa Ho?".

	onyx:emotionText "Har pal yaha jeebhar jiyo jo hai samaa...kal ho naa ho...It takes a special person to apreciate a great Bollywood movie.  There's the constant melodrama the endless love triangles and dress changes the randomly inserted songs and hammy dialogue...not to mention the ageold desire to be everything to every viewer. There are so many Hollywoodesque problems that threaten its quality so many qualms that any selfrespecting American critic would feel compelled to point out that loving it seems like a chore.  If anybody can do so however it is an Indian.And I LOVE being an Indian.KAL HO NAA HO Tomorrow May or May Not Come is the third film involving writerdirector Karan Johar and Dharma Productions an Indian film label that has become synonymous with boxoffice and critical gold.  Their first two productions KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI and KABHI KHUSHI KABHIE GHAM were both  in their respective times the most popular Hindi films of all time and with good reason.  They were the ultimate crowd pleasers a perfect mix of comedy and drama with compelling stories masterful performances catchy music and impeccable direction.  They hit every emotional high and low possible in the typical Bollywood audience and the end results were magnificent.  KAL HO NAA HO continues this tradition in grand style.Naina Catherine Priety Zinta is the eldest daughter of Jenny Kapoor Jaya Bachchan and a father whose suicide has wreaked havoc on the entire Kapoor family.  The constant bickering among the members of her household has transformed Naina into a pitiful bore who has forgotten how to smile. Her best friend is Rohit Saif Ali Khan a fellow MBA student who has seen Naina through all her troubles.  The two have never been more than just friends.Along comes Aman Mathur Shah Rukh Khan a charasmatic man who enters the Kapoors' home and changes their lives for the better much to Naina's dismay.  Aman helps every member of the family with any problem and seems to have all the answers  he is perfect.  Aman eventually wins over Naina and changes her into a smiling young woman once again but not before she begins to have feelings for him.  What's more Rohit soon reveals that he loves Naina.Yet all is not as it seems.  There are secrets to be uncovered pasts to be mended and futures to be made and what the trio find out may suprise them.This is firstly an immesnly pleasing film.  The first half jumps right into the act with some wonderfully comedic scenes showcasing the talent of all three leads and the flair of firsttime director Nikhil Advani.  A particular scene involving a housemaid who suspects Aman and Rohit of being gay is among the most humorous Hindi film moments I've seen.  Karan Johar's fort with dialogue really shines here everything is quickwitted and funny yet never insulting to the intelligence many Hindi films can be. We grow to love and care about these characters quickly but thankfully characterization does not bog down the forward motion of the marrative. The first 90 minutes literally flies by.The most noticable aspect of KHNH is the tone the writer and director bring to the film it's incredibly energetic and light and takes chances with material that worked for me.  Many times the characters seem to speak oneonone with the camera in an interview style to convey personal feelings or thoughts an interesting tactic.  There are other little touches the Day 1 Day 2 etc. introductions stand out in particular see the film to find out what I mean.  There is an incredible scope and vibrant feel to the movie as in an Dharma production.The second half of the film gives all involved a chance to really shine. Once the twist is revealed things take a downward turn and the climax begins. Much of the light tone from the first 90 minutes creeps its way into the second half at all the right moments but there are some truly heartwrenching scenes toward the end of the film. This is to be expected but their impact is heightened by the skill of the filmmakers.  In most cases Hindi films pile crying scenes on top of one another in the hope of eliciting some if any reponses from the audience but KHNH succeeds due to solid characterization and wonderful performances.This is clearly Shah Rukh Khan's film and he acts his heart out.  It's the same performance we've seen a million times from him but his skills aren't broke so they don't need any tuning.  His screen prescence is unmatched in this industry and he captivates you during both the comedic and emotional scenes.  This was a chance for him to paly a different type of character and his natural charisma lends itself well to what the part requires. Priety Zinta finally steps into the limelight as Naina with a wonderful performance that reveals her true potential.  Watching her onscreen transformation is as unexpected as it is alluring.  Saif Ali Khan essentially echoes his character from DIL CHAHTA HAI but the magic has not worn off.  He has a knack for playing the straight man with unfulfilled and still unkonwn desires.  Supporting performances are from the usual Johar suspects and are accordingly wonderful.ShankarEhsaanLoy finally enter the Johar ring with this entry and certainly hold their own.  The title song is my choice for song of the year  a gently sung ballad about living life to the fullest complimented by wonderful lyrics from Javed Akhtar and great singing by Sonu Nigam.  The other romantic song Kuch To Hua Hai is a very contemporary song with an international flavor that manages to please with an unusual beat and interesting composition.  It's The Time To Disco is the loser of this disc although its film picturization is likable enough and the much hyped Pretty Woman yes based on the classic American song is surprisingly upbeat and entertaining.  The obligatory BSMDGC Big Set Many Dancers Good Choreography dance number is Maahi Ve a very catchy tune that bears some resemblance to the hit Shava Shava from KABHI KHUSHI KABHIE GHAM.  Farah Khan's onscreen choreography for the song does not disappoint and the art direction is simply marvelous.This film marks a new standard for Hindi film editing and shows just how much Bollywood has learned from its L.A. counterpart.  We have quick cuts new wipes and even splitscreens...all used wisely and not for cheap effect. The editing really brings the first half of the film to life giving every song a get up and dance feeling that never hurts.Above all this is Nikhil Advani's film.  Remarkably this novice helmer shows no signs of being a rookie.  In true Johar style he handles all the film's emotional scenes a perennial marker for directorial excellence with confidence and talent.  Having served before as assistant director to Karan Johar and Aditya Chopra Advani pulls out all the stops here giving us epic dramatic camera direction eliciting great performances and nearperfect pacing.Sure a good 10 minutes shaved off the finished product would be in the film's favor but it is a minor qubble in a sea of compliments.This is ultimately a story about hope and love  the hope to keep moving and beliving the love to keep surviving.  It is a story about the choices we make for love and the effects those choices have on our loved ones.  It is about living life to the fullest and seizing the day for Kal Ho Naa Ho?";

The male lead Shah Rukh Khan THE Indian Top Star seems not be able to act but nobody seems to care the story is outrageously simple and pure kitsch the movie is extremely long the actors tend to break out in song and dance for no reason whatsoever etc. However the movie is quite charming in its way. The actors Khan included are lovable and do not even try to display any skills at the Robert de Nirotype of method acting. The overly emotional acting is highlighted by dramatic panning and freak breezes that even turn up in closed rooms but it is exactly what the audiences want and it goes hand in hand with the overthetop lavish extravaganza of the sets and the wellchoreographed song and dance sequences since ENTERTAINMENT is all the movies aim at. So if you are a purist if you cannot accept kitsch for all it is worth and if you want psychological drama instead of bright sets and sentimental love stories DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. If however you occasionally indulge in something that is neither intellectually challenging nor deemed high art but that is clean bright and bubbly fun you will enjoy this picture. There I will not bother you with a synopsis but I will only point out that you will probably want to watch one or two other movies to understand this phenomenon. The chances are high that you will see the same actors again playing the same roles again only with different names.".

The Performances were great maybe sharukh get the praises but I personally appreaciated 2 performances. One of Priety and Saif's. Saif is really funny and the best thing about him is he doesn't overact to make people laugh. I am just wondering how long does he have to wait till people start giving him credit for what he deserves Saif carries his role wonderfully. Priety is like Julia Roberts of Bollywood Preety woman. She could act she proves yet again that she is not just a cute girl with a dimple on her cheek. The highlight of the movie is the funny moments of the movie and it is filled with them. Shahrukh was good yet again but Saif is the surprise. The movie was specially interesting with glimpse of all the stars Sonali Bendre and Sanjay Kapoor Rani and Kajol Uday Chopra Farah Khan. The supporting cast was very good too. Jaya Bachchan proving as her husband Bachchan that despite of her she still one of the best actresses. Lillete Dubey is a M.I.LF. Rajpal Yadav should overtake Johnny Lever any time in Bollywood top comedian slot. Sushma Seth Dara Singh the eternal macho man. Reema is nice. Satish Shah and Katki Dave are delight to watch as Gujus. Harry Potter look alike kid and her baby sitter were cute and ofcourse THE KANTABEN homophobic maid was very funny. It was nice entertainer nice fun more funny then emotional. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw Kal Ho Naa Ho I was surprised by the extremely modern way that was used to illustrate the film. I liked to see the Indian actors walking through New York's streets and having an ordinary life of American or at least IndianAmerican people. The film was a wonderful comedydrama about NRIs which makes it very special because none of the Indian films about NRIs in the past have done it as convincingly as this one. It portrays the life of New Yorkers in a rather satirical but realistic way.The first part of the film was very nice funny and entertaining. I liked the wellwritten characters. Naina Zinta is an angry insecure and square girl who has no life. Her friend Rohit Saif is a cool guy with a gold heart but without self confidence. Jennifer is a weary working woman while her mother inlaw Lajjo is a typical Punjabi mother inlaw. The film is interesting and flows well and then suddenly from nowhere comes Aman Shahrukh a happygolucky guy who seems to have no problems in life but he does want to solve the problems in Naina's family when he meets the rather complicated girl whom he falls in love with the first moment he sees her. The character of Aman adds a lot of comedy and humour to the film. Aman tries to get close to her and then when she finally understands she is in love with him he rejects her! It is weird but then we get the real secret disclosed. Aman knows he cannot be with Naina so he tries to serve as a matchmaker between Naina and... Rohit who also fell in love with her! A typical Karan Johar love triangle indeed. But it is not it is done in a very different and charming way.Up until that point I really loved the film. The really big problem comes in the fourth quarter of the film It is so so slow! This is a realistic but overly cheesy and probably the longest sequence of its sort to have been made in recent years in Bollywood.Anyway the direction of Advani is very good. The music is out of this world and every song contributes to the film in its own way. The dialogues are nice intelligent and never go over the top which is great. Cinematography is terrific editing is good sound is superb mainly because it's live sound and acting is natural throughout. Shahrukh Khan is OK. His comic timing is fantastic but in some moments he overacts. Saif Ali Khan is the film's biggest surprise. After Dil Chahta Hai he makes it big one more time with a terrific performance. Note the scene when Naina tells Rohit about loving Aman and his expressions. Preity was brilliant and delivers a great performance. It goes without saying that she is the best choice for this role. She had given better performances than this one before but she comes with a very credible performance all through especially toward the end. Jaya Bachchan shows how much this industry missed her and what a wonderful actress it lost during the two past decades. She is natural and slips into her character in an extremely convincing way. There were undoubtedly too many emotions but Kal Ho Naa Ho works wonderfully as a complete entertainer. It has a nice quite innovative script in terms of writing style and the background of the characters. The makers paid attention to the American style and environment of the film and I found the contradiction between the bright free of worry New York and the tearjerking proceedings of the story toward the end very interesting.".

The songs composed by shankareshaan and loy are a complete masterpiece.The songs completely meld with every situation in the movie.Not to forgetchoreography of the songs just add to the icing and makes all the songs so beautiful and mesmerizing.Certainlyone of the best songs of Bollywood are present in this movie.

The film is a wellbalanced blend of typical Karan Johar bonhomie and the modern hiphop culture and the result is a delightful treattowatch. The USP of KHNH is its brilliant starcast and trendy music. Thats where the film signs off in style. The film is good enough to go down as one of the best ever  probably the 6th in SRK's kittyACTING SRK shah rukh Khan shows that he is getting better with age. After delivering some of Bollywood's biggest blockbusters like DDLJ KKHH DTPH and Baazigar King Khan makes another significant contribution with KHNH. His portrayal of Aman is poignantly done and weighs romance style and flair on an equal footing. If SRK is the king of the film Preity Zinta is the undisputed queen. The dimpled darling's increasing demand in Bollywood is natural after she delivers such good performances. Her role as the central character in the story Neha Katherine Kapoor is strong and likable. Zinta shows all the variants of acting  from poignancy during death hours to rocking vibes in the song Its the time to Disco. Saif too has a great role in the film as compliments the King Khan beautifully. MUSIC  Rocking youthful and yet melodious. Watch out for the moving title track.A must see  specially for all SRKPreity fans".

I notice that Kareena Kapoor was originally offered the role of Naina and I must say that I am glad she asked for too much money because Preity Zinta completely changed my impression of her with this film. She displayed much acting talent in a complex role and is no longer the annoying girl from the Liril ads to me.This is very much like an Indian remake of Autumn in New York though and despite knowing this I was not prepared for the conclusion. If you just like singing dancing and happy Bollywood I'm not sure this one is for you. But if you are looking for a plot and characterdriven Indian film I completely recommend this one.

He goes up against Jack Palance an Apache he knew from his boyhood who is returning from several years at an Indian agency school that is supposed to have civilized him also based on fact many Indian children were forcibly sent to such a school in Carlisle Pennsylvania. Heston unlike the local military and civilian authorities doesn't believe that Palance has been civilized and suspects that he's secretly planning to lead the Apaches in attacking and massacring the local white population. This is a tough and for its time brutal little western well written and directed by Charles Marquis Warren and pulls no punches in its depiction of racism on both sides Palance hates whites as much as Heston hates Indians and both have no compunction about killing those on the other side they've known for years simply as a matter of course. Palance and Heston are suitably intense in their rolesHeston perhaps a bit too much soand the action scenes are handled very well although the final confrontation between Heston and Palance is a bit of a disappointment.

	schema:reviewBody "Arrowhead the mere mention of it in Western circles sometimes induces a sharp intake of breath even a furrowed brow or two. Starring Charlton Heston and Jack Palance directed by Charles Marquis Warren who also adapts the screenplay from W.R. Burnett's novel Adobe Walls Arrowhead rewrites the Indian Wars and firmly paints the Apache as distrustful thugs. Based in essence on real life Indian scout Al Seiber with Heston in the role but named as Ed Bannon here story is set in Texas 1878 at the Fort Clark Cavalry post. Peace has been brokered and the good old Cavalry boys have arranged for the Apache led by a newly educated Toriano Palance to be dog tagged and whipped off to some arid land in Florida. However the pesky Toriano has been plotting a revolution and is ready to lead his people in an all out assault on whitey and to hell with the treaty. Only white dude who smells a rat is Bannon who with some Indian blood coursing through his veins hates the Redskins and will never trust them. But the Cavalry hate Bannon as well because he is in the way causing friction a hindrance to their wonderful ideas for piece. No surprises for guessing what happens next! If Warren and the big wigs at Paramount Pictures were aware of the racist overtones here in 1953? Is cause for debate. I tend to agree with the theory that puts this as a sort of anticommunist allegory but of course that doesn't excuse the xenophobic narrative whoever is on the receiving end! Yet surely the makers were genuine in trying to make a good old Cavalry versus Indians actioner? That the picture often meanders and is not carpeted with action is a little moot but it is well put together well acted and looks nice with its actual real Bracketville location filming Ray Rennahan on cinematography. Paul Sawtell does one of his robust thematic musical scores and fine acting support comes from Robert Wilke and Brian Keith. It's a solid routine Oater and can be enjoyed if you can forgive it its sins? Forgive them for they know not what they do...or something like that! 610".

Now from a cinematic standpoint Heston is best remembered for his contributions to the epic both historical and biblical and cult science fiction genres so it's not surprise that his contributions to the westerncowboy genre is often overlooked. In the case of this particular film though it's probably just as well that most people outside of his fan base don't remember it too well. Major Dundee and Will Penny were considerably more worthy efforts the latter in particular.Plot in a nutshell Heston plays a grumpy mean spirited cavalry scout and exconfederate to boot VERY loosely based on a real man who is so deeply possessed by his hatred of Native American Indians especially the Apache that it threatens to ruin just about everything around him. If he were any less civil towards the immediate soldiers in the fort led by Brian Keith none of whom want anything to do with the surly prick he'd probably be voted out Survivor style. When an apparently domesticated Indian played by Palance back when it was considered politically correct and practical to take a white guy and essentially paint him to look like some other ethnicity presumably to barter peaceful relations Heston continues to badger everyone not to trust him. In the long run Heston turns out to be correct as Palance's character rallies together his fellow Indians and goes on a killing spree massacring every white person unlucky enough to get his line of sight including a mild mannered fellow who was actually his 'blood brother' as children. This gives Heston's character the chance to step up and play the hero as much as the character is capable of such.Heston does the best he can with a thoroughly unlikable character who never really grows or learns or in any way redeems himself. Palance delivers the kind of quietly intense performance that put him on the map in better films such as Shane. But the climactic clash between the two legendary tough guy stars is surprisingly underwhelming and disappointing. Brian Keith arguably gives the best performance of the film. Some okay action scenes and nice Technicolor help but not enough. Of interest primarily for western fans and fans curious to see earlier works for Heston.".

Jack Palance is not going to go quietly off to a reservation.None of which is really explored in the finished product. I have the feeling the editors left a lot of this film on the cutting room floor. Also Heston's relationship with Katy Jurado who acts as a spy while living without benefit of clergy with him is similarly untouched. But for that I blame the Code. What there is is quite daring for its time.The ending is kind of silly also. When he has the drop on Palance Palance asks Heston why he doesn't shoot him. Good question Jack I can't figure it out either. More I won't say.The film was shot on location in Texas and done very well. Palance fresh off the acclaim he received from Shane has the best role in the film.

He has since rejoined white civilization and he now has nothing but contempt for the native people around him. So by fifties' standards he is supposed to be the Injunhating hero.Add into the mix Jack Palance as an Apache who was sent east to be educated by white men. But while he was at school in Pennsylvania he refused to cut his long hair and act much like a white. Now he's come home to Texas where he will take off his hat show off his long hair proudly and declare he is still Apache which means instant conflict with Heston's character.This all seems rather interesting until the script takes both characters in a somewhat vicious direction. Heston is given all kinds of dialogue that today seems quite politically incorrect where he disparages the Apaches calling one of them dirt. But the tipping point where we learn who the filmmakers want us to root for is when Palance goes into an office to meet a white guy he once played with as a child. He has decided that it was a mistake for an Apache to have bonded like a blood brother with a white man. Just as the man goes to call his wife and young son to meet Palance's character Palance pulls a gun out and shoots him at point blank range instantly killing his old friend. It is depicted as a senseless brutal act.Of course this sets into motion a series of scenes where Heston as the good guy must avenge the other white man's death and bring Palance and his lawless Apaches to justice. As I said it's hard to decide whether either one of them should be who we root for. Do we root for Palance who is filled with his own blind rage against whites and trying to seek vengeance against those who have taken so much from his own people? Or do we root for Heston who supposedly has law and order and civilization on his side but is filled with just as much contempt toward the natives?".

It's exciting at the most not for the squeamish filled with good intentions. This is really a war monger western. Charlton Heston is here tall handsome strong the authentic hero as American are used to show in their features. But he is a f...racist and some people in the audiences may be influenced by his feeling about Indians. We can say it's somewhere disgusting. The same thing about Jack Palance. He is tall handsome strong wild attractive at the most and he preaches war and destruction for the White people...Get what I mean? Nothing to do with James Stewart and Jeff Chandler in BROKEN ARROW....But even if it is nasty it remains a very good feature a great western. It changes from anti racist or pro Indian ones.And I LOVE being surprised !!!There have been some films with their leads who were racists or bad ones but the audiences got very quickly that the heroes were actually anti heroes and they finally understood that they were on the wrong way. The audiences were not confused about that. Those movies denounced racism or something else...Take CROSSFIRE for example starring Robert Ryan.But that's for another comment...".

Basically the movie is an antiApache harangue complete with a large cast actual location filming in Technicolor and plenty of action. Maybe too much action. Maybe too much talk too. Certainly the movie would benefit from astute cutting but what to cut is the problem. Cutting Katy Jurado's scenes is the obvious method of attack but she is not in the movie all that much anyway. Mary Sinclair could also go but she has only one or two brief scenes. Throwing them away is not going to make any difference. Besides Mary Sinclair was actually a prolific TV actress who made only two movies the other playing herself briefly in 1974's Alice Goodbody so it would be a shame to cut her brief role in Arrowhead. And it would also be difficult to cut Jack Palance's footage as just about all of it is essential to the plot. So the scissors would have to be sharpened for Charlton Heston. Although he's the good guy the character was actually based on a real army scout named Al Seiber and he's always in the right this role is actually a bit of a liability as he often tends to rub the audience  as well the people on the screen  the wrong way! Available on an excellent Paramount DVD.".

I could never figure out the Charlton Heston character. He plays someone who learned everything he knows from having lived and been raised by the Apaches yet he hates them with a vengeance always referring to them in degrading and subhuman terms. At home however he has no problem using the beautiful MexicanApache laundress Katy Jurado as his concubine.Poor Katy Jurado. Only a year away from her pillar 1952 role in 'High Noon' this doll with more class and talent in her little finger than most of her female Hollywood contemporaries can only get offered this role playing a halfbreed concubine to a hatemongering character who insults her at will and doesn't deserve her company. Kind of puts it in perspective why 40 years later we similarly didn't see most of the intelligent kids from 'The Cosby Show' cast in any roles of substance once that nonstereotypical show ended. Maintaining your integrity while remaining employed is a monumental challenge for many in Hollywood. No wonder Katy never relinquished her Mexican citizenship or Mexican movie acting career.The end credits to the movie state that Heston's character is based on the true life of the Army's Chief of Scouts during this period Al Sieber 18441907. If so it isn't exactly a flattering portrayal. After seeing the movie I wonder if Sieber's family sued the studio for 'definition' of character. Watch this one only if you've never seen how Hollywood depicted American Indians in the West.".

Actually it's Charlton Heston's character Ed Bannon who appears to be the equal opportunity hater in the story he expresses his displeasure with just about everyone including his sidekick Sandy Milburn Stone during an opening segment.The first appearance of Jack Palance on the scene was fairly impressive he looked like he could have passed for a real Apache Indian. The idea that he was a returning Eastern student to take up the mantle of the Invincible One for the Chiricahuas was an interesting element particularly since he never stated that role for himself. Perhaps even more so was the blood brother pact Bannon forced on his Apache foe to set up the final confrontation between them. However the denouement between the two did come across as a bit of a letdown Bannon seemed to handle him just a bit too easily.Nice support here from Brian Keith as Captain Bill North and Katy Jurado as Bannon's half Mexican half Apache paramour Nita. I couldn't really grasp the dynamic there from Nita's perspective Bannon was pretty much a heel toward her most of the time. Nor could I rationalize the attraction Leila Clark Wilson Mary Sinclair held for the Indian scout when he was such a lout to her as well especially in the company of more refined guests. Social manners were apparently not his strong point.Based loosely on the life of real life Indian scout Al Sieber it appeared to me the connection was pretty much by reference only. Though Sieber did engage Apache Indians in battle during his scouting days he was just as apt to be cooperative while running work crews that included Native Americans. Sieber even gave up scouting for a time in the 1890's when he became dissatisfied with treatment of the Apaches at the San Carlos reservation.".

	schema:headline " No Peter Cushing  No Frankenstein?";
	schema:reviewBody "Being a huge fan of Hammer's brilliant Frankenstein cycle starring the immortal Peter Cushing I delayed the viewing of The Horror of Frankenstein 1970 several times convinced that a Hammer Frankenstein without Cushing could only be disappointing. Having finally seen it a few nights ago I must say that while the film is nowhere near as great as the Cushing Frankensteins I actually liked it quite a bit. My main concern before seeing this film was that nobody but Peter Cushing could effectively play Baron Victor Frankenstein in a Hammer film. While he is definitely not en par with Cushing however Ralph Bates is actually very convincing in his role of a younger and very different Baron Frankenstein here. Actually I must say that Bates' performance as a very cynical and coldhearted Frankenstein is one of the greatest aspects of this film. I did not like how Frankenstein became a pure villain in this one but that can hardly be blamed on Bates. Peter Cushing's Frankenstein character was obsessed and unscrupulous but he was also likable and did what he did convinced of doing what was best for mankind though he became quite villainous in Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed of 1969. The young arrogant and entirely coldblooded Frankenstein in this film shares none of these positive character traits which is a bit of a shame. That being said Bates gives the character a glorious touch of sarcasm which made the film enjoyable. In the beginning the film annoys with pseudofunny episodes in Frankenstein's youth but it gets a lot better after a while when he has reached adulthood. Frankenstein is a womanizing cynic who has no scruples whatsoever in order to reach his goals. Two incredibly beautiful women his maid Alys Kate O'Mara and his former schoolmate Elisabeth Veronica Carlson fall for him yet his only true dedication is the creation of artificial life. The Horror of Frankenstein was directed by Jimmy Sangster who is mainly famous as the masterly screenwriter of many Hammer classics including such milestones as The Curse of Frankenstein 1957 Dracula 1958 and The Brides of Dracula 1960. Sangster deserves a lot of praise for his magnificent writing work. His work as a director is less memorable it includes this film the equally mediocre Lust for a Vampire 1971 as well as Fear in the Night 1972 which I haven't yet seen. Unlike other Hammer the Frankensteins which all had a original and innovative storyline this one merely repeats the story of Frankenstein's first creation which had already been told in an incomparably superior manner in The Curse of Frankenstein 1957. The monster in this one is quite a letdown and I was surprised to see David Prowse who would later become worldfamous as Darth Vader perform so poorly in the role. I couldn't say whether it was the fault of Prowse or director Jimmy Sangster but the monster looks real silly here and seems like an angry thug rather than a real monster. Prowse would also play a monster of Frankenstein's creation in Frankenstein and the Monster From Hell 1974 the last film by legendary director Terence Fisher starring Peter Cushing as the Baron. The makeup was way better in that film one of Hammer's best and so was Prowse's performance. The Horror of Frankenstein has some atmosphere Frankenstein's castle laboratory is a terrific setting and it also has its moments otherwise but it certainly isn't too memorable. Overall it wasn't nearly as disappointing as I feared and therefore a positive surprise. The Horror of Frankenstein is recommendable to my fellow Hammer fans but only AFTER seeing all of the marvelous Frankenstein films with Peter Cushing.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd heard nothing but bad things about 'Horror Of Frankenstein' but after watching it I was surprised at how entertaining it was for the most part. The first two thirds are pretty damn good in my opinion. It's basically a remake of the first Hammer Frankenstein movie but with added humour which in places reminded me of Stuart Gordon's 80s classic 'ReAnimator'. Ralph Bates who was in a few Hammer movies during this period like 'Lust For A Vampire' the disappointing sequel to 'The Vampire Lovers' plays an intense young Frankenstein who isn't that far removed from Jeffrey Combs' Herbert West. Bates gives a strong performance and the supporting cast includes lovelies Kate O'Mara the French governess in 'The Vampire Lovers' and Veronica Carlson which certainly helps a lot as well as Jon Finch 'Frenzy' and a great comic turn from Dennis Price 'Theatre Of Blood' 'Vampyros Lesbos' as an eccentric grave robber. So far so good but unfortunately when we finally see Frankenstein's monster played by David Darth Vader Prowse it's very anticlimactic. Prowse's monster is the worst I've ever seen in any Frankenstein movie and things fall apart very quickly from then on. Oh well. Anyway while this movie ultimately disappoints I think Bates and Price make it worth watching all the same and O'Mara is extremely sexy as a saucy servant girl. But it must be said that 'The Horror Of Frankenstein' ties with 'Lust For A Vampire' and 'Dracula A.D. 1972' as the weakest Hammer movie I've seen to date.".

	schema:headline " THE HORROR OF FRANKENSTEIN Jimmy Sangster 1970 12";
	schema:reviewBody "This was top Hammer screenwriter Jimmy Sangster's first directorial effort for the company incidentally I watched the other two  LUST FOR A VAMPIRE 1971 and FEAR IN THE NIGHT 1972  in quick succession. I hadn't picked this up on DVD earlier because of its muchmaligned reputation however I was extremely surprised to find it quite effective! Given that it's basically a remake of THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN 1957 Sangster took a radically different approach  treating the events as black comedy the resulting film is very funny indeed at times though it almost feels like Carry On Frankenstein witness the disembodied hand coming to life to give the twofinger gesture and Ralph Bates' comments at Kate O'Mara's cleavage!. The film features an abrupt doubly ironic ending  while as opposed to STRAIGHT ON TILL MORNING 1972 there's plenty of gore here but no nudity. Still despite being made on the cheap it all looks pretty decent a virtue common to most Hammer product in fact.Bates who showed real promise but essentially came to Hammer too late and Dennis Price as a cheerful body snatcher who likes to have his pregnant wife do the dirty work for him! are very good from the rest of the cast  which includes Jon Finch as a dogged police lieutenant who happens to be a former colleague of Frankenstein's  O'Mara as Bates' sexy but conniving housekeeperlover comes off best though Veronica Carlson who's somewhat underused here also proves undeniable eyecandy.There are faults however Bates's scientist is ultimately too glum in comparison to Cushing's animated characterization the monster itself is an unfortunate creation pun intended  Dave Prowse's physique is certainly ideal for the role in fact he returned for FRANKENSTEIN AND THE MONSTER FROM HELL 1974 and proved far more successful at it but as depicted here it comes across as a mere killing machine showing no emotion or curiosity at its surroundings such as when the monster kills the O'Mara character or when it ventures outside into the countryside.Essentially then the film emerges as an interesting but not entirely successful reinvention of the Frankenstein saga and actually a curious attempt on Hammer's part at this particular stage  given that it followed closely on the heels of one of their finest and bleakest efforts! That said having now watched Hammer's entire Frankenstein series I can safely say that it's superior overall to their Dracula films.The extras include a 14minute career overview by Hammer starletbeauty Carlson  she feels lucky and privileged to have worked three times for the studio and in the company of such talented people as Freddie Francis Christopher Lee Terence Fisher Peter Cushing Jimmy Sangster and Ralph Bates. Sangster describes in the Audio Commentary how when he started as a screenwriter he was careful not to overstep the limitations set by the budget  which he learned from having been a Production Manager for Hammer for the previous several years as a director then he often consulted with his editor to determine whether the latter got all the necessary coverage for any particular scene. He also discusses the rest of his career going into some detail on the making of such films as TASTE OF FEAR 1961 and THE ANNIVERSARY 1968 and seems baffled  but at the same time amused  by the critical aboutturn Hammer's output has enjoyed in recent years. With respect to THE HORROR OF FRANKENSTEIN itself he admits that he was initially averse to the idea of Ralph Bates as Baron Frankenstein  but eventually the two became very good friends and in fact Bates appeared in all three films Sangster directed! By the way Travis Crawford's interesting liner notes compare the film's selfmocking attitude to the even more radical 'revisionist' approach to the Mary Shelley tale seen in FLESH FOR FRANKENSTEIN 1973.".

Still despite being made on the cheap it all looks pretty decent a virtue common to most Hammer product in fact.Bates who showed real promise but essentially came to Hammer too late and Dennis Price as a cheerful body snatcher who likes to have his pregnant wife do the dirty work for him! are very good from the rest of the cast  which includes Jon Finch as a dogged police lieutenant who happens to be a former colleague of Frankenstein's  O'Mara as Bates' sexy but conniving housekeeperlover comes off best though Veronica Carlson who's somewhat underused here also proves undeniable eyecandy.There are faults however Bates's scientist is ultimately too glum in comparison to Cushing's animated characterization the monster itself is an unfortunate creation pun intended  Dave Prowse's physique is certainly ideal for the role in fact he returned for FRANKENSTEIN AND THE MONSTER FROM HELL 1974 and proved far more successful at it but as depicted here it comes across as a mere killing machine showing no emotion or curiosity at its surroundings such as when the monster kills the O'Mara character or when it ventures outside into the countryside.Essentially then the film emerges as an interesting but not entirely successful reinvention of the Frankenstein saga and actually a curious attempt on Hammer's part at this particular stage  given that it followed closely on the heels of one of their finest and bleakest efforts! That said having now watched Hammer's entire Frankenstein series I can safely say that it's superior overall to their Dracula films.The extras include a 14minute career overview by Hammer starletbeauty Carlson  she feels lucky and privileged to have worked three times for the studio and in the company of such talented people as Freddie Francis Christopher Lee Terence Fisher Peter Cushing Jimmy Sangster and Ralph Bates. Sangster describes in the Audio Commentary how when he started as a screenwriter he was careful not to overstep the limitations set by the budget  which he learned from having been a Production Manager for Hammer for the previous several years as a director then he often consulted with his editor to determine whether the latter got all the necessary coverage for any particular scene. He also discusses the rest of his career going into some detail on the making of such films as TASTE OF FEAR 1961 and THE ANNIVERSARY 1968 and seems baffled  but at the same time amused  by the critical aboutturn Hammer's output has enjoyed in recent years. With respect to THE HORROR OF FRANKENSTEIN itself he admits that he was initially averse to the idea of Ralph Bates as Baron Frankenstein  but eventually the two became very good friends and in fact Bates appeared in all three films Sangster directed! By the way Travis Crawford's interesting liner notes compare the film's selfmocking attitude to the even more radical 'revisionist' approach to the Mary Shelley tale seen in FLESH FOR FRANKENSTEIN 1973.";

He is a cold blooded emotionless character who uses Frankenstein as his personal executioner. He is also intelligent and careful to tie up loose ends. Great Halloween time film.

	schema:reviewBody "The Horror of Frankenstein is the sixth and second to last entry in their Frankenstein cycle. Many and I mean many revile this film as nothing to do with the other films in content style and acting. It is the only film that does not star Peter Cushing as the evil Baron Frankenstein. That in itself is a huge obstacle to get past. I love Cushing in everything he does. He personifies the character of the Baron with his cold heartless calculating mind. Cushing with Terence Fisher the director in most of those previous Frankenstein films always made the Baron the focal point of the film rather than the monster. This is a huge departure from the Universal cycle. Cushing's creation stayed very much in character for all of the films until the last one Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed. In that film Cushing moves from that cold heartless baron with some ethics to a womanizing truly evil and terrifying man bent of personal pleasure as much as creating life. That film is not one of my favorites in the Hammer cycle however The Horror of Frankenstein takes that Victor Frankenstein and runs amuck with it in this version written and directed by the very very talented Jimmy Sangster. Ralph Bates is that very same Baron only younger and yes this is really just a reworking of The Curse of Frankenstein with some additional violence a younger cast some more graphic effects and plenty and plenty of glorious cleavage. Bates is rather good in this role as a weaselly Baron who cares only about himself and how individuals can please him and when they no longer can they no longer have value in his eyes except for whatever value he can place on pieces of their anatomy. Sangster defines his characters fairly well and I enjoyed the story and the acting and the film much much more than I had thought upon hearing so much negativity for the film. Is it as good as The Curse of Frankenstein? No way. The Revenge of Frankenstein? Nope. Any of the others  probably not though I found it more entertaining if not as good as Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed AND Frankenstein and the Monster From Hell. Sangster's direction is very typically Hammeresque and the acting follows suit with some great character performances by Bernard Archard as the braingiver and Dennis Price chewing up scenery as the resurectionist. His lines are worth seeing almost by themselves. And how about Veronica Carlson and Kate O'Mara? I cannot think of four  I mean 2  things that are more captivating in the film. The Horror of Frankenstin is not groundbreaking at all and it does marshal in the beginning of the new Hammer direction of sex and bloodier violence soon to hit the screens with the likes of The Vampire Lovers and what followed. but it is not overthetop at this point and is much better than some would have you believe. The apparatus for acid used throughout the film was very intriguing and a wonderful set piece.".

It's actually based upon a fairly straightforward Frankenstein theme semimad doctor wants to make monster the brain is damaged and the monster kills people but Dr. Victor Frankenstein very credibly played by Ralph Bates comes off as a classic if cultured psychopath. He cares naught in the slightest about the sanctity of human life as long as his vision of creating a man from used parts is fulfilled.Here are the numerous characteristics events which generate most viewers' dark paradigm of this particular Dr. Victor Frankenstein 1. He has the sex drive of Don Juan and Rasputin combined and any consequences of his amorous advances do not concern him in the least. After impregnating his University Dean's daughter he just drops her like a hot rock never giving her a further thought. He also demands doubleduty from his lovers... sex slave on demand and housekeeper routinely.2. He really savours killing people you can tell by the smirk on his face as he does so including his father a highwayman whom he also decapitates his best friend and assistant the provider of his corpses and a local professor via poison. He even kills an associate's pet tortoise with a smile! 3. He much enjoys setting his monster to killing the corpsesnatcher's greedy wife a lover and a woodsman who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.4. He's really into personal intimidation of those who are supposed to be his superiors while he is a medical student and later on too.This 1970 British story goes like this Dr. Frankenstein decides as a student that his big goal will be to create a man basically from corpse parts so he takes on a pal whom eventually becomes more and more skittish as the experiments with body parts become more and more audacious and heinous. People who get into the way of the young Doctor's plans are snuffed without a second thought. So what I'm saying here is that there are no huge surprises.True to the Hammer philosophy this film is not hairraising scary like say The Exorcist Halloween or Hitchcock's Psycho albeit it's a much darker film than all the other Hammer Frankenstein flicks. This is clearly due to the fact that this movie was directed by Hammer's fairhaired horror writer Jimmy Sangster who had clearly been drooling to actually direct one of these films. It's really all just quite entertaining.There are even intermittent moments of sly humor to be found throughout the movie. At one point a buxom lass of the Doctor's former acquaintance is practically displaying her mammalian wares for him and he wryly comments You've gained weight in a couple of places. Nicely put! The monster is a bit of an enigma. Played by David Prowse his face is left pretty much unchanged makeupwise  there is just the addon to the top of the head. The monster thus looks a lot like one of my larger neighbors. He's not a very shrewd monster as the brain of course was damaged somewhat by the corpsesnatcher having dropped it. Just your basic killer who generally follows his master's instructions in order to get fed. This particular brain by the way was a sort of steelblue in its hue and I thought that was a little strange.The filmscore is superb composed and conveyed by Malcolm Williamson. It embraces that late 60s atmospheric ambiance which goes along so well with period monster flicks akin to the themes of the great Les Baxter. The film is shot in letterbox and the sets and locations are outstanding. The long shot of the ominous castle is simply timeless. The color saturation is of equal highquality.In summary we do somewhat miss the great Peter Cushing in this Hammer entry however it's a fine performance by Ralph Bates and his supporting cast and I think overall is one of the best Frankenstein films that I've seen anywhere.".

However I caught part of it on ITV4 a few weeks ago and thought 'I wouldn't mind watching that'. Remembering that I had the DVD as part of a box set I settled down recently and prepared myself for what many people consider to be not only the worst of the Hammer Frankensteins but one of their worst films generally and found my opinions whilst not totally blown out of the water were to change considerably. Inevitably the lack of Terence Fisher and Peter Cushing takes its toll one only need compare 'The Evil of Frankenstein' 1964 directed by Freddie Francis to the others in Hammer's canon to realise just how much Fisher brought to the Frankenstein movie sub genre and it was once said of Peter Cushing that he could have been the next Olivier. Despite these apparent shortcomings the director Jimmy Sangster does manage to adhere here and there to accepted Hammeresque aspects and does include a couple of nice scenes there's an almost fairy tale quality to the scene of the monster lumbering towards the woodsman's cottage and although the majority of direction is pedestrian at best there is the occasional flourish that suggests Sangster at least had the ability to do better. Ralph Bates does a good job in his role as the young Baron Frankenstein the fact that so many people have described how pompous spoilt cold and unpleasant he is providing proof of the quality of his performance and the juxtaposition between his utter contempt for human life a contempt that leads him to murder several people including his father thereby killing off the old values for good and his goal of creating life is quite well considered. Dave Prowse who played the strongman in 'Vampire Circus' 1970 and a far more sympathetic monster in 'Frankenstein and the Monster From Hell' 1973 has little to do other than lumber around killing or threatening people but there is no denying that his is a physically intimidating creature that you really wouldn't want to come across while walking through the woods. Despite the lack of 'monster' makeup I actually found the design interesting and felt it suited this particular variation on the Frankenstein myth perceiving the monster as a deeply psychotic extension of the Baron's already disturbed personality. Kate O'Mara is very convincing as the conniving Alys. Physically she reminds me of Nell Quick in James Herbert's excellent novel 'Once' and Veronica Carlson does her best with a fairly weakly written role. The next acting honours must go to Denis Price as the grave robber and Joan Rice as his downtrodden wife. I was I suppose surprised at how tame this movie was. Given the strength and gore quotient in the same year's 'Scars of Dracula' it would have seemed obvious to extend the gore factor in this one there is very little horror in 'The Horror of Frankenstein' beyond the horror of what humans are capable enough if they are driven in the way Frankenstein appears to be here. All in all though 'The Horror of Frankenstein' is a fairly intriguing relic a reminder of a time before cinema audiences were so completely desensitised that they need shock after shock to sustain their interest and an unusual if watered down echo of Hammer's prior greatness.".

	schema:reviewBody "Victor Frankenstein is a gifted but zealous medical student researching into the mysteries of existence. Whilst on a summer break he determines that he will create a man from the body parts of dead people and give him life. Can this madness succeed ?This is an engaging straightforward adaptation of the classic Mary Shelley novel almost like a colour remake of the James Whale  Boris Karloff version. When Hammer Films made The Curse Of Frankenstein in 1957 they weren't allowed to copy Jack Pierce's iconic flatheadboltedtogether look but Prowse alias Darth Vader is an impressive lookalike here a mute stomping creepy destructive evil force. Despite not being Peter Cushing Bates is excellent as the Bad Baron giving a performance which is so direct and unflamboyant Kenneth Branagh please take note as to be stylishly unstylish. He matteroffactly kills his father his best friend his lover a neighbour and  most fiendish of all  a pet tortoise for the sake of his blackhearted work all the while maintaining a clear unflappably calm pragmatic even agreeable intellect. This was the second of five key roles Bates made for Hammer and he is terrific in all of them particularly Dr Jekyll  Sister Hyde. The only truly original aspect of this version is the new character of the scheming loverhousekeeper Alys played with great aplomb a somewhat wobbly accent and a dress that's about to fall down by O'Mara. The agreeable cast is filled out by the equally ravishing Hammer regular Carlson check her out also in Dracula Has Risen From The Grave a rather corpulent Price as a cheery graverobber who meets a grisly end and the always watchable Finch Frenzy The Tragedy Of Macbeth who underplays it nicely in the burgermeister role which is so frequently hammed up.

	onyx:emotionText "Victor Frankenstein is a gifted but zealous medical student researching into the mysteries of existence. Whilst on a summer break he determines that he will create a man from the body parts of dead people and give him life. Can this madness succeed ?This is an engaging straightforward adaptation of the classic Mary Shelley novel almost like a colour remake of the James Whale  Boris Karloff version. When Hammer Films made The Curse Of Frankenstein in 1957 they weren't allowed to copy Jack Pierce's iconic flatheadboltedtogether look but Prowse alias Darth Vader is an impressive lookalike here a mute stomping creepy destructive evil force. Despite not being Peter Cushing Bates is excellent as the Bad Baron giving a performance which is so direct and unflamboyant Kenneth Branagh please take note as to be stylishly unstylish. He matteroffactly kills his father his best friend his lover a neighbour and  most fiendish of all  a pet tortoise for the sake of his blackhearted work all the while maintaining a clear unflappably calm pragmatic even agreeable intellect. This was the second of five key roles Bates made for Hammer and he is terrific in all of them particularly Dr Jekyll  Sister Hyde. The only truly original aspect of this version is the new character of the scheming loverhousekeeper Alys played with great aplomb a somewhat wobbly accent and a dress that's about to fall down by O'Mara. The agreeable cast is filled out by the equally ravishing Hammer regular Carlson check her out also in Dracula Has Risen From The Grave a rather corpulent Price as a cheery graverobber who meets a grisly end and the always watchable Finch Frenzy The Tragedy Of Macbeth who underplays it nicely in the burgermeister role which is so frequently hammed up. Cowriter producer and director Sangster was in many ways the backbone of Hammer penning the scripts and assisting in the production of a great many of these classic British horrors.

This is easily the best that Hammer has ever had to offer in the Frankenstein Monster genre.First off this movie has been rated R but there are no displays of nudity much to my dismay. There are some sexually oriented scenes though and some wonderful cleavage of the wenchful Miss Kate O'Mara. I provide these facts merely for those of you interested in early 70s Hammer norms.The film's opening credits with a vivisection of a woman's print sets the tone for what's to follow. Our young Frankenstein if you'll pardon that one is the most vile and villainous iteration of the good Baron that I've ever witnessed on the screen and yes that includes any that Cushing had done prior. Young Bates is the epitome of evil which is witnessed from his beginnings as a student when he kills off his dad The Baron. His depraved behaviour is what carries this film through to its ultimate end and the monster be damned. In fact the good Doctor winds up killing off more people in the end than the monster could ever hope to.This film has many great characters. A greedy graverobber some lovely lady love interests and an assistant that is the antithesis of Fritz from the original Universal outing.One giveaway to a quote in the film The Dean in the University that young Frankenstein is attending calls him into his office. He then exclaims his young daughter to be pregnant which was the young Baronstudent's obvious doing. His reply? Congratulations. As you can see this film is not without humour.This film is my second favorite Hammer film of all time after Curse of the Werewolf but it is unfairly maligned in its IMDb rating. Pay no attention to this as it is unwarranted. Watch this fantastic film at all costs which was 10.49 at the IMDb owner's site.".

The robust and enthusiastic acting from a game cast helps matters a whole lot. Dennis Price is a sleazy riot as a cheerfully vile graverobber Frankenstein hires to procure body parts for him. Jon Finch Jerry Cornelius in The Final Programme has a nice supporting part as a dashing policeman. Graham Jones does well as Frankenstein's wideeyed reluctant assistant Wilhelm. Better still the women are breathtakingly beautiful buxom blonde Veronica Carlson looks ravishing as the hapless Elizabeth and foxy brunette Kate O'Mara supplies a tasty eyeful as sexy but clumsy housekeeper Alys.

	schema:reviewBody "The Horror of Frankenstein shouldn't be considered as an official part of Hammer Horror's excellent Frankenstein series as it doesn't star the series' stand out actor  Peter Cushing and by all accounts is really just a rerun of the classic Mary Shelly which Hammer already did with The Curse of Frankenstein some thirteen years earlier. This fact alone ensures that the film is never going to be as great as the other films in the series as simply put we've seen it all before. What made Hammer's Frankenstein sequels so brilliant was the way that they played around with the base story and created something fresh and exciting whereas here it's just the base 'Frankenstein creates a monster' story. This was great in 'Curse' as we had an amazing Peter Cushing performance to delight over  but here we only have Ralph Bates to keep us entertained. Bates definitely is one of Hammer's better smaller stars and he offers a worthy interpretation of the character for sure  but Peter Cushing is a hard man to follow and Bates' just hasn't got what it takes.One thing Bates does try his hand at though is the side of Frankenstein that Cushing did best  the egocentric confidence! Seeing Bates take the Mickey out of a number of people is always entertaining and his lines are surprisingly well written. Ironically it's when the monster is introduced that the film really trips over as in the first two thirds we've always got Bates' humour to revel in but once the monster is introduced that all fades. Adding to the woe is the fact that the monster is really terrible and doesn't even nearly compare to any of the monsters seen in the 'real' Hammer Frankenstein movies. It's surprising how much influence the Hammer Frankenstein movies have given Stuart Gordon's brilliant ReAnimator and it's influence is evident in some parts of this film. While this movie isn't Hammer's best by a long shot it's still definitely worth a shot as it features many elements that Hammer are famous for and despite the fact that it was made in the 1970's Hammer's eccentric camp style is still omnipresent. Not great...but certainly not all bad.".

	schema:headline " Perhaps the weakest of the Hammer Frankenstein cycle.";
	schema:reviewBody "In their penultimate Frankenstein entry the Hammer folks return virtually fullcircle to the first film in the series The Curse Of Frankenstein. Apart from a few changes in personnel and the way that this one goes for a peculiar black comedy approach the two films are almost identical. Despite the fact that times had changed between the completion of the two films one would hardly notice it after viewing The Horror Of Frankenstein. Oldfashioned predictable and familiar in the extreme it is arguably the weakest of the entire series.Brilliant young student Victor Frankenstein Ralph Bates is the scourge of his teachers and the wet dream of all the girls in his class. He goes to university in Vienna where he enrages the dean by impregnating his daughter. Also whilst in Vienna he befriends another student Wilhelm Kassner Graham James and persuades him to return to the family castle when the teaching term is over. Frankenstein inherited the castle along with a buxom housekeeper named Alys Kate O'Mara when his father was killed in a shooting accident. Once at the castle Frankenstein and Wilhelm are soon engaged in scientific experiments involving the forces of life but gradually Wilhelm grows unhappy with the direction the research is taking. Wilhelm is perfectly happy to lethally inject then revive a tortoise but Frankenstein seems to have bigger ambitions including eventually reanimating a dead person. Wilhelm prepares to leave but is murdered by Frankenstein after threatening to expose the immorality of his research. The young scientist doesn't stop there  after purchasing various body parts from a local grave robber Dennis Price he begins to bump off more of his close friends. Slowly but surely he assembles all the parts he needs to construct a man but when the crude disfigured human monster David Prowse is eventually reanimated it has uncontrollably violent tendencies and smashes its way out the castle to go on a killing spree in the adjacent countryside.Lots of reviewers say that The Horror Of Frankenstein suffers from the absence of Peter Cushing but in truth I think that Ralph Bates is one of the few positive things about this film. While certainly not in the same league as the legendary Cushing Bates still manages to bring much to the role playing the evil doctor as a supremely confident smug and singleminded type. The female characters are also nicely played with O'Mara oozing feline sexuality as the promiscuous housekeeper while Hammer regular Veronica Carlson is also solid as Frankenstein's childhood friend. The film suffers from its uninspired story and leisurely pacing. Also the monster played by Prowse is far too unintentionally funny and has none of the scare factor that Christopher Lee demonstrated in the original movie. Prowse resembles something from a gay's only Halloween party with his disfigured head muscular physique and tight boxer shorts. When he is on screen the film should be peaking into a crescendo of horror but instead it becomes an accidental comedy! The Horror Of Frankenstein is naturally going to be of interest to those who like and have seen the others in the series but for the more casual viewer it provides little to get excited about.".

	onyx:emotionText "In their penultimate Frankenstein entry the Hammer folks return virtually fullcircle to the first film in the series The Curse Of Frankenstein. Apart from a few changes in personnel and the way that this one goes for a peculiar black comedy approach the two films are almost identical. Despite the fact that times had changed between the completion of the two films one would hardly notice it after viewing The Horror Of Frankenstein. Oldfashioned predictable and familiar in the extreme it is arguably the weakest of the entire series.Brilliant young student Victor Frankenstein Ralph Bates is the scourge of his teachers and the wet dream of all the girls in his class. He goes to university in Vienna where he enrages the dean by impregnating his daughter. Also whilst in Vienna he befriends another student Wilhelm Kassner Graham James and persuades him to return to the family castle when the teaching term is over. Frankenstein inherited the castle along with a buxom housekeeper named Alys Kate O'Mara when his father was killed in a shooting accident. Once at the castle Frankenstein and Wilhelm are soon engaged in scientific experiments involving the forces of life but gradually Wilhelm grows unhappy with the direction the research is taking. Wilhelm is perfectly happy to lethally inject then revive a tortoise but Frankenstein seems to have bigger ambitions including eventually reanimating a dead person. Wilhelm prepares to leave but is murdered by Frankenstein after threatening to expose the immorality of his research. The young scientist doesn't stop there  after purchasing various body parts from a local grave robber Dennis Price he begins to bump off more of his close friends. Slowly but surely he assembles all the parts he needs to construct a man but when the crude disfigured human monster David Prowse is eventually reanimated it has uncontrollably violent tendencies and smashes its way out the castle to go on a killing spree in the adjacent countryside.Lots of reviewers say that The Horror Of Frankenstein suffers from the absence of Peter Cushing but in truth I think that Ralph Bates is one of the few positive things about this film.

The film fails on both counts because of the cheapjack production values and the general air of mockery and because Bates plays the Baron as an arrogant dissolute youth with few redeeming features completely lacking the icecold authority of Peter Cushing in his prime.

There are minor virtues Dennis Price enjoys himself as a graverobber who goes about his business with an unseemly glee and the wonderful Kate O'Mara is upstaged by her own cleavage but horror fans won't be amused by the film's rambling plot and halfhearted attempts at humor. Thankfully the series bowed out in style three years later when Peter Cushing reteamed with director Terence Fisher for the dignified swan song FRANKENSTEIN AND THE MONSTER FROM HELL 1973.".

I've seen 5 Hammer productions so far concerning the topic of baron Frankenstein  this one not included and they were all much better. In fact some of them belong to my ALLTIME favorite horror movies. This version directed by Jimmy Sangster is inferior and ten times as boring as all the others. The fact that the legendary Peter Cushing doesn't star as Victor Frankenstein didn't help the film very much neither...I have to be fair and admit that the movie has a few good moments and several positive aspects. In fact the whole second half is ENJOYABLE but it never reaches the usual Hammer level and it seems to take hours before something happens. I still can't believe I sat through till that moment. Several times I came close to pressing the 'ejectbutton' though. The biggest difference  and failure  between this version and the true classics is the character of Victor Frankenstein. The baron is portrayed as an egocentric and precocious basterd who doesn't care about anything or anybody. I got the idea that he doesn't even cared about science...he just wants to create life in favor to increase his own status and to help him get rid of people who stand in his way. He doesn't even dig up the bodies to experiment upon himself !! He talks with a very annoying tone of voice and he's too rich in my opinion. That's never good...Normally I like arrogant characters but this one had something missing...Maybe it was the performance by the rather unknown actor Ralph Bates. He also played Dr. Jeckyll once in a Hammer production but I didn't see that one. The ONE thing I didn't understand about him was He's being worshiped by two of the most beautiful women alive and he totally doesn't care. A man's lifework is important but still...a bit of lovin' is always pleasant no ? Especially the actress named Kate O'Mara  she plays Alys the housekeeper is gorgeous ! I think she was the main reason why I couldn't force myself to press the 'ejectbutton'. I assure you she's a very beautiful woman. When the monster is  finally  created it looks pretty dumb. He looks like a popular football player  except for the head  and he eats pigeons !! This movie was shot only one year after Boris Karloff's death and he ALREADY had to turn over in his grave!! Otherwise there's nothing to worry for him...he'll always be the one and only Monster of FrankensteinOn a more positive note I really the abrupt ending to Horror of Frankenstein. The last 15 minutes are really good and the whole last setting in Victor's attic is a powerful scene. If only Sangster had been able to create this atmosphere during the whole movie !Precious rewindmoment Baron Frankenstein is having supper with Prof. Heiss who's trying to make conversation with him. While Heiss is talking the only thing Frankenstein can think is Heiss' brain which he needs to finish his creation. Satisfying scene in an overall disappointing movie...".

Based around the famous characters created by Mary Shelley the screenplay is cowritten by Sangster with Jeremy Burnham. It stars Ralph Bates Kate O'Mara Veronica Carlson Dennis Price Graham James  David Prowse.After a dastardly deed sees him inherit the family estate Victor Frankenstein continues with his anatomy experiments...Originally released as part of a double bill with Scars Of Dracula The Horror Of Frankenstein saw Hammer Studios take a different approach with the titular monster. Gone was Peter Cushing who in a publicity shoot was seen handing over the reins to the next generation and in came a more comedic and talky take that takes in the permissive society and the British Welfare State! Sangster's movie should be viewed as a comedy with horror elements it's clear from the outset that the makers here have tongue firmly in cheek. What else can you derive from a film that has a dismembered hand flicking the V's? Or a casual observation that Kate O'Mara has gained weight in the breast department? I kid you not and it is damn funny.The most interesting thing about the film is the young Frankenstein himself perfectly essayed as being a dandy egotist by Bates. He is in fact the villain of the piece. Here is a man who kills innocents with single minded glee just so he can create life deliciously bonkers really. The sexiness comes from O'Mara and Carlson who seem to have entered a who has got the biggest cleavage contest while Dennis Price of Ealing fame is wonderfully colourful as a grave robber happy to let his wife dig the graves! Yes it's a wacky movie alright. Even the monster played by future Darth Vader David Prowse seems to be in on the joke. Throw him a doggy chew and he'll do anything for you. I think the creature was more irked about having to wear a diaper more than anything else.Sets and costuming are still of a high standard but this is a different Hammer Frankenstein. Fun and even a little devilish in its writing it's not however one for the scare purists. 610".

When he announces that he wants to bring a human creature David Prowse back to life his feelings about it are resurfaced even stronger than before. When the experiments are completed and they successfully raise the manmade creature from the dead it gets loose and commences a reign of murder and terror forcing him to decide if it is best if he killed the monster.The Good News This was a really decent and enjoyable entry. As this is a later film in the Hammer collection this one can finally let loose with gore and nudity and both here are in full abundance. There are ample deaths in this movie both by Victor and the monster including having a person immersed in acid another is electrocuted several are poisoned and another one has a rifle explode in his face. There is even more blood and gore from the deceased as a dead person is decapitated one has his limbs dismembered and others have other body parts hacked off and sewn together into the creature with massive amounts of bloodloss in the process. Even the monster had a violent kill hacking a man with an ax several times. Not exactly the greatest amount of variety in the deaths but this one has bloodier results. Even the several sex scenes are an improvement in earlier films as the sexuality of the scenes is now fully capable of being shown in detail. Several women are shown nude but the best has to be Kate as she is shown in several situations and is really nice to view. The castle is also a really nice setpiece with the long dark corridors the large Gothic interiors are pretty creepy and impressive upon first viewing and the laboratory setpieces are all quite fun. They add immensely to its creepiness and lends a bit more of the original Gothic tones in the original novel. Even the graverobbing scenes are quite creepy and fit in quite well with the tone of the film. There's also plenty to enjoy about it's scenes in the lab as they go about their experiments which are all done rather well. With the progression from animals to people being quite natural it feels quite disturbing as well with the amount of time spent around the cadavers which are grossly disfigured and markedup complete with the surgeries on them to put it all together being quite nauseating at times. The last big plus is that the last half of the film is somewhat more entertaining and enjoyable with the inclusion of several rather fun scenes. The monster's rampages through the woods are nice and suspenseful the attacks are brutal and much more making it a rather enjoyable series of scenes. These here are the film's good points.The Bad News There wasn't a whole lot really wrong with this one. The depiction of Victor as a womanizing lying thief is pretty much the main fault within the movie. It didn't feel like it was in good taste to do so as he was perhaps more villainous than the monster. It didn't serve the movie that well with them doing so as there isn't a payoff for the whole scenario and it simply makes the film a cheat as he doesn't get his comeuppance at all. Also the monster design looks terrible and it's not very imposing. The creature is a pretty threateninglooking person but the makeup was a disaster simply applying scars on the body at various places to look as if he was in fact put together fairly quickly. Maybe a large FX budget could've supplies a more grotesquelooking creature. It really drags the scenes of it down somewhat considerably. These though are the film's few flaws.The Final Verdict It's not the best in the series but this is still a very entertaining entry that all fans of Hammer films and the series will enjoy. Laterera Hammer fans are encouraged to give this one a shot as well as those who enjoy the genre's output at the time though those looking for other factors are encouraged to heed caution.Today's Rating R Nudity Graphic Violence Adult Language and several short sex scenes".

	schema:reviewBody "Das singende klingende Bumchen or The Singing Ringing Tree is an East German live action film from 1957 so this one will have its 60th anniversary next year. The director is Francesco Stefani and he also cowrote this film together with Anne Geelhaar. Of course the original is by the Brothers Grimm. And there we also have the fairy tale connection already. If you know a bit about East German GDR filmmaking then you will know that most of the country's films that are still known today are either political movies usually about World War II or fairy tales and this is one of the latter. The film only runs for approximately 70 minutes which is relatively short for a full feature film but actually some of the other GDR's fairy tale films have an equally low duration. It is in color like the other fairy tale films too and I really like it. The other genre I mentioned produced many blackandwhite films in years way after 1957 and this is what hurts them a lot. It is no coincidence that the only Oscarnominated GDR film is a film about politics but an exception because it is also in color.But back to this one here. I don't think the short runtime hurts it at all but helps it staying focused. Yes there were moments when the film becomes a bit too absurd especially in the second half but it's all bearable as fairy tale films frequently go over the top and they get away with it most of the time because of all the fantasy surrounding the action. The title of my review is a reference to the fairly simple recipe. We have a hero who is good from start to finish even a bit dumb early on a female protagonist who has to grow in character throughout the film a main antagonist a dwarf this time who is evil from start to finish and gets defeated at the very end and finally some minor characters like the King who add very little as it is really not about them. Yes it is a bit generic in terms of the missing shades of the characters but I still felt that this film was a success. It certainly looks a lot newer than 1957. The acting is as good as the direction and script but what really stands out is the visual side in terms of set decorations art directions and most of all costumes. The effects may look a bit goofy by today's standards but they are pretty charming given the year of production. If there is one thing the GDR was really better than the FRG not only in terms of filmmaking then it is fairy tale films. This one here is a success and I recommend the watch.".

	schema:headline " A memory of something strange";
	schema:reviewBody "I remember back in the early 90's I was watching the TV clip based game show 'Telly Addicts'. It was never a good programme but on this night something interesting happened. Suddenly from out of nowhere they showed a strange clip. It was a weird looking fantasy scene with a bear a girl and a dwarf. Immediately I had a flashback to something I had long forgotten  The Singing Ringing Tree! It was a very strange feeling to be reminded of something that I hadn't thought about for twenty years. Then it came back to me. Sort of. I recalled from the mists of my childhood watching a strange fantasy serial involving an evil dwarf and two other people who I couldn't quite picture. It must have made some kind of impression because I had subconsciously never forgotten it.Since then I discovered that the show had affected many other people in a similar way. They had all seen it when little kids and had similar memories. The common thread seemed to be that they found the evil dwarf terrifying. In all honesty I don't remember the feeling of being scared but I certainly never forgot that dwarf. The show seems to have been serialized and shown in the UK first in the early 60's and then again in the mid 70's it was the latter that I experienced as a preschool tot. One thing I can be sure of was I really liked this as a little kid.Fastforward to the present day and I finally decided to rewatch The Singing Ringing Tree again. They say you should never go back ladies and gentlemen. Should I have gone back? Well yes and no. On the one hand the experience of watching this weird East German fairy tale as an adult could never match the impact it had as three or four year old little child. And the considerable mystic quality of the distant and vague memory of it is something that is very specific and impossible to replicate. So in watching it again to a certain extent I broke the weird spell it had cast on me as it never could be quite as bizarrely enchanting to me now as the enigmatic memory of it always was. Having said all this this is an excellent fantasy film and a true oneoff. It really does have an odd East European ambiance and its look and colour scheme are both fantastic. There's no question that this is a superior production of a fairy tale. The dwarf does make for a somewhat unforgettable villain. I loved the way he lurks undetected within the scene.

	onyx:emotionText "I remember back in the early 90's I was watching the TV clip based game show 'Telly Addicts'. It was never a good programme but on this night something interesting happened. Suddenly from out of nowhere they showed a strange clip. It was a weird looking fantasy scene with a bear a girl and a dwarf. Immediately I had a flashback to something I had long forgotten  The Singing Ringing Tree! It was a very strange feeling to be reminded of something that I hadn't thought about for twenty years. Then it came back to me. Sort of. I recalled from the mists of my childhood watching a strange fantasy serial involving an evil dwarf and two other people who I couldn't quite picture. It must have made some kind of impression because I had subconsciously never forgotten it.Since then I discovered that the show had affected many other people in a similar way. They had all seen it when little kids and had similar memories. The common thread seemed to be that they found the evil dwarf terrifying. In all honesty I don't remember the feeling of being scared but I certainly never forgot that dwarf. The show seems to have been serialized and shown in the UK first in the early 60's and then again in the mid 70's it was the latter that I experienced as a preschool tot. One thing I can be sure of was I really liked this as a little kid.Fastforward to the present day and I finally decided to rewatch The Singing Ringing Tree again. They say you should never go back ladies and gentlemen. Should I have gone back? Well yes and no. On the one hand the experience of watching this weird East German fairy tale as an adult could never match the impact it had as three or four year old little child. And the considerable mystic quality of the distant and vague memory of it is something that is very specific and impossible to replicate. So in watching it again to a certain extent I broke the weird spell it had cast on me as it never could be quite as bizarrely enchanting to me now as the enigmatic memory of it always was. Having said all this this is an excellent fantasy film and a true oneoff. It really does have an odd East European ambiance and its look and colour scheme are both fantastic. There's no question that this is a superior production of a fairy tale. The dwarf does make for a somewhat unforgettable villain. I loved the way he lurks undetected within the scene. He is seen hiding in holes in the ground inside rockfaces within giant shells or just malevolently looking on from atop a hill. The effects work while crude are somewhat memorable and beautiful. The freezing of the waterfall and the fiery flames at the end spring to mind as examples of this. They add to the overall otherworldly aesthetic. Add to this a strange horse a giant fish a beautiful princess a cursed bear and a magical tree and you have the makings of something undoubtedly remarkable.While I may not have experienced the same kind of magic in returning to the realm of The Singing Ringing Tree as an adult I'm still pleased I did.

The deadearnest dialog's a howler Claudelle played by pretty 60s starlet Diane McBain tempts her date a young and handsome Chad Everett away from their high school dance and into the woods where she exhorts him to love me! but he jilts her later on and she cracks up screaming at her mother But I loved him mama and I let him love me! Looking to get even she now loves anything in pants telling one local yokel who sneaks up to her bedroom window looking for a date that he can have one if he promises her something Tell me I'm pretty all over. The one man she won't have however is the overbearing oaf Claude Akins her bitter ambitious mama Constance Ford channelling Kim Stanley foists on her. He's the richest man in the county and nuts about her but when Claudelle blows him off her mother dresses up in her daughter's duds and hides in the shadows going off with the sexminded simpleton herself. Claudelle's reckless abandon eventually turns the town consisting of little more than a general store upside down and it can only end one way...Arthur Kennedy as the wayward wench's longsuffering pa tried to give the trashy tragedy some much needed class but it's a curious dinosaur a throwback to an earlier time. The sordid subject matter was definitely for adults only but it was handled with a Production Code sensibility that was moreorless obsolete after PSYCHO began breaking all kinds of barriers the year before. Warner Brothers' hesitation waltz around the lassie's lurid ways was not unlike the one Paramount was still doing a few years later in A HOUSE IS NOT A HOME and SYLVIA. The last starred Carroll Baker and was yet another unsuccessful A attempt to turn its Blist leading lady into a sex symbol star. By the end of the 60s Baby Doll Baker found a niche in Eurotrash and Diane McBain went on to make MARYJANE a marijuana movie starring Fabian Forte. Thank god. As for CLAUDELLE INGLISH ya gotta love her catch it if you can!".

Looking to get even she now loves anything in pants telling one local yokel who sneaks up to her bedroom window looking for a date that he can have one if he promises her something Tell me I'm pretty all over. The one man she won't have however is the overbearing oaf Claude Akins her bitter ambitious mama Constance Ford channelling Kim Stanley foists on her. He's the richest man in the county and nuts about her but when Claudelle blows him off her mother dresses up in her daughter's duds and hides in the shadows going off with the sexminded simpleton herself. Claudelle's reckless abandon eventually turns the town consisting of little more than a general store upside down and it can only end one way...Arthur Kennedy as the wayward wench's longsuffering pa tried to give the trashy tragedy some much needed class but it's a curious dinosaur a throwback to an earlier time. The sordid subject matter was definitely for adults only but it was handled with a Production Code sensibility that was moreorless obsolete after PSYCHO began breaking all kinds of barriers the year before. Warner Brothers' hesitation waltz around the lassie's lurid ways was not unlike the one Paramount was still doing a few years later in A HOUSE IS NOT A HOME and SYLVIA. The last starred Carroll Baker and was yet another unsuccessful A attempt to turn its Blist leading lady into a sex symbol star. By the end of the 60s Baby Doll Baker found a niche in Eurotrash and Diane McBain went on to make MARYJANE a marijuana movie starring Fabian Forte. Thank god. As for CLAUDELLE INGLISH ya gotta love her catch it if you can!";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie premiered this evening on Turner Classic Movies and was well worth watching. The film is a very wellacted and intense emotional drama about a high school girl who is navigating the confusing territory of transforming from a girl into a woman and having her first experience with love and betrayal. Claudelle is a beautiful and innocent 17 year old girl about to graduate from high school when she is wooed by and falls in love for the first time with a handsome and seemingly sincere local boy. She trustingly gives her heart and soul and body to the young man she loves shortly before he must leave to serve in the army. Her lover Linn Chad Everett is assigned to a military base far from home but he promises to marry Claudelle as soon as he is done with his 2 year stretch in the service and he asks her to wait for him. Claudelle is deeply in love and promises to wait for Linn. She eagerly awaits her lover's letters every day until she receives one in which he tells her that he has become involved with another young woman and is going to marry his new girl  not Claudelle. Claudelle is absolutely devastated and heartbroken. Her mother a woman who is bitter from a life of hard work and unrealized dreams of her own is unequipped and too narcissistic to help her daughter deal with the pain of betrayal and her first broken heart. Claudelle wants to get even with the lover who spurned her just as she begins to realize the power of her own beauty and sexuality . . . and the hold which she seems to so easily have over just about every man in town  young and old. But the pain of being betrayed and spurned is so raw that Claudelle fails to realize that she is inflicting far more pain on herself than on any of the men who she she becomes involved with  least of all her first lover Linn. Claudelle's father George Kennedy is a decent and loving man but is unable to help his daughter deal with the raw pain of her broken heart and her selfdestructive behavior  until the end of the movie. Unfortunately but all too typical of the mores of the time in which the story takes place the plot is resolved by a need to kill off the slutty wanton woman because of the havoc she wreaks on the lives of the many weak and delusional men who want her but cannot have her  and who cannot control their own emotions. Why is it that the promiscuous woman always has to die in these movies? Think about Elizabeth Taylor in Butterfield 8 Kim Novak and Bette Davis in Of Human Bondage Why can't the men just learn to deal with their own emotions without resorting to violence? In fairness one sincere young man loses his life when he fights to defend Claudelle's honor but mostly his own ego and manhood. And I was really thinking and believing that Claudelle and her loving and protective father could pack up and move to a new town and get a fresh start. But oh no. The wanton beautiful and sexual woman always must die! Is it maybe because of all those stories were written by men? Is it because a woman who enjoys and trades on the power of her own beauty and sexuality is just too threatening to the patriarchy and must be punished? What is it? Happily this motif begins to change with the advent of the sexual revolution in the mid to late 1960's. I was so happy when I again saw the The Sanpiper recently and observed that Elizabeth Taylor's character didn't have to end up dead  even though she and Richard Burton thoroughly enjoyed an illicit extramarital affair. Amen! LOL!".

It took a concept that is inconceivable to most people living in a boat underwater with people trying to blow you up and brought it up close and personal.  The resulting suspense and excitement for this type of film is always extremely entertaining and this film delivers nicely.Tom Clancy's thrilling novel converts well to the big screen.  Clancy is a master of making improbable tales of international intrigue seem plausible. This story of a Soviet sub commander who is trying to defect to the U.S. adds a unique twist to the suspense normally associated with submarine films.John McTiernan who is building an enormous reputation in the actionadventure genre did a fabulous job as director.  This film focused less on the submarine and its crew than its cousin 'Das Boot' and more on the international intrigue angle.  McTiernan is very effective in keeping up the pace and giving the viewer riveting suspense as smart torpedos chase subs through the murky deep.As always Sean Connery was powerful as the defecting captain determined not to allow this first strike weapon to start a nuclear holocaust.  Connery gave his character both a conscience and a ruthless commitment stopping at nothing to reach his goal.Alec Baldwin turns in one of his better performances as Jack Ryan.  Unlike Harrison Ford who made Ryan into an action hero in other Tom Clancy adaptations Baldwin seemed better cast as the CIA nerd who was thrust into a field situation without any real experience.  In this way I felt he was a better representation of the character as Clancy originally wrote him.This is a highly entertaining and engrossing film that will keep most action and suspense viewers on the edge of their seats.  I rated it a 910.".

To be fair the vast majority of action movies don't have the benefit of Tom Clancy's greatest novel granted 'Sum of All Fears' was a very very close second for me. High tension and realistic emphasis on that last word depictions of modern warfare make for an excellent story.Nonetheless there are a few key qualities that shouldn't go unnoticed to today's directors. First again is the basis of a good plot that actually captures your attention makes you think and puts you on the edge of your seat. Second is the high caliber of actors James Earl Jones Alec Baldwin I'm a Harrison Ford fan but I still think Baldwin was far better for the role and  last but certainly not least  Sean Connery. I'm sure this wasn't cheap but when you look at the product produced by three of the best professional actors it's worth every penny. Third is the great music nothing too over the top but wellorchestrated and featuring a great set of pieces by a Russian men's choir hard to go wrong!. Lastly the great use of special effects from which George Lucas himself could use a clue or two it smoothly supports and doesn't take the place of or interfere with the development of the plot.This is my 2 favorite movie of alltime but you don't have to take my word for it.

	schema:reviewBody "Tom Clancy is a gearhead whose books I find nearly impossible to get into. So it's a surprise to find one of his novels adapted on screen is not only good but as enjoyable and riveting as is The Hunt For Red October.Sean Connery plays a Soviet sub skipper Marko Ramius who at the height of the Cold War is put at the helm of his navy's most advanced creation the Red October a nuclearmissile carrier with a propulsion system that enables it to elude sonar. After he puts out to sea Ramius has a letter delivered to a senior Soviet official that sends the U.S.S.R. into panic mode. The U.S. wonders why. Has Ramius gone nuts? Will the U.S. be able to stop him before he has the ability to park his missiles along the Eastern Seaboard? Or is CIA analyst Jack Ryan Alec Baldwin correct in suggesting another reason for Ramius's aberrant behavior?Some have speculated this story is not completely fictional. Watching this film it's easy to understand why. The Hunt For Red October on screen moves with uncommon verity for a spy yarn. With a zest for detail and the human equation director John McTiernan examines the inner workings not only of the Red October but of the subs ships and helicopters chasing it as well as the corridors of power where the fate of the Red October and perhaps the world must be decided. You get the feeling at times you are not just watching an ace popcorn thriller but sitting in on some undocumented bit of history.The movie's chief strengths are its moody lighting its unrelenting pace and especially its deep bench of acting talent. Connery suggests a note of uncertainty to Ramius that keeps the audience on its toes. For the longest time we don't know what he's up to. Baldwin plays Ryan in a very realistic way that establishes his basically gentle bookish nature but underscores the depths of his heroism as he pursues an increasingly dangerous path no one else believes in. Scott Glenn is terrific as a crusty U.S. sub commander while Stellan Skarsgard glowers effectively inbetween cigarette puffs as a cagey Soviet. Richard Jordan in one of his last roles steals every scene he's in as the National Security Adviser.There's a nice bit of business between Ryan and Jordan's Jeffrey Pelt where Ryan sticks his neck out and Pelt pounces telling the analyst that if he believes Ramius is defecting he should go out there and try to collect him. Pelt's no humanitarian understand he just wants to keep his options open Listen I'm a politician which means I'm a cheat and a liar and when I'm not kissing babies I'm stealing their lollipops. That's the best thing about the movie. Even as it ups the ante on what's at stake and feeds you with outlandish moments of humor and drama the motivations of the characters and their reactions to increasingly hypertense situations are kept grounded in reality.The ending comes off a bit pat and the behavior of Capt. Ramius and his officers seems at times questionable but the film doesn't slip in any discernible way unless you're Russian and notice Connery's Lithuanian brogue. In fact it's a rare technothriller that not only holds up with repeat viewings but manages to be even more exciting the more one understands what is going on.McTiernan is making a guy film here but he does a nice job providing some brain food too. Notice how the transition on having the Soviet characters speak Russian to English turns on the word Armageddon or the clever interplay between Ramius and his questioning crew. There's a lot going on here and it makes the film worth treasuring.".

This movie is amazingly accurate on many levels granted there are goofs here and there...but nothing that a nonsubmarine sailor would be likely to catch. I actually had the pleasure of serving onboard two of the subs featured in this movie the second one was the USS Blueback SS 581 which was the last diesel submarine in our navy. The scene where the submarine flies out of the water is actually the Blueback during an emergency surface a little scary the first time I did it but incredibly fun every other time I did it. This movie brings back so many memories and I hope that everyone enjoyed it as much as I have.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Hunt for Red October is taken off of militaryexpert Tom Clancy's gripping novel. Tom Clancy has a knack for the innerpsyche of our fears. He doesn't openly thrill us but rather opens our minds to the potential hazards in the US government. Most governmentmilitary thrillers skim the surface and gather us a few good things to make us go Whoo but Tom Clancy's books make us fall over in amazement. The man has an incredible knowledge of the government and its subsidaries and his novels show this.His film adaptations normally make good. All four are at least good and one of them The Hunt for Red October is taut tense and powerfully moving. The plot of the film is fictional but it is right out of the headlines.It is about a submarine a Russian and an American. It sounds like the setup for a barjoke but it's not. The Russian man is named Ramius Sean Connery who along with his crew takes a Soviet submarine out to the North Atlantic ocean. The sub is the bestofthebest with an allnew propolsion system it's faster than other submarines and uses advanced techniques to literally disappear off radar.After a few days out at sea the submarine vanishes off radar and the Russians frantic tell the American government that Ramius has taken the sub to America's mainland to launch a missile attack. However CIA Analyst Jack Ryan Alec Baldwin thinks otherwise. He believes Ramius is defecting to the States along with his crew. Further he believes the Russians don't want to admit this for fear of losing their best submarine.The film is directed by John McTiernan who brought us Predator Die Hard The Thomas Crown Affair remake and Die Hard with a Vengeance. All of the preceding films are very good most of them great and The Hunt for Red October qualifies as very good.Sean Connery gives a commanding performance as the leading character Ramius. His secondhandman is played by Sam Neil faking a Russian accent very badly. But Neil is lovable in his role despite having the worst Russian accent ever. Tim Curry joins along for the ride on the misfortuned sub as well and Alec Baldwin gives his best performance as Jack Ryan.As much as I don't like to admit it Harrison Ford isn't the ideal Jack Ryan for me. He differs too much from the character in the novel. Neither Ben Affleck nor Alec Baldwin take the cake either. But if you look past the book persona you will enjoy the performances in all the films much more.I don't tend to like military thrillers most of the time. Most likely because they are put together sloppily on the whole. But The Hunt for Red October isn't sloppy careless nor boring. It's thrilling exciting and entertaining.But the book is better.45 stars John Ulmer".

However CIA analysist Jack Ryan suspects Ramius may really be defecting and sets out to help him. An underwater game of cat and mouse ensues.The first of the Jack Ryan' films is almost the best.  Not only do we do without Ford's rather dull and workmanlike performances but also has a good story and sense of time.  The story is solid  it isn't flashy but it delivers well.  The only time it seems weak is when it goes away from the action to try and give a character background eg Ryan with his family etc then it is cheesy and forced.  However when it is with the action it manages to be tense without being really exciting.  The story never plods but at times it does move slow however this is well played as tension and makes it more enjoyable.However the film's main asset is simply put  Connery.  Despite playing a Russian with a Scottish accent Connery is magnificent and dominates the screen no matter who he shares it with.  He manages to make us care more about him than any of the American characters.  Baldwin is good he wasn't a star at this point but he makes a better Ryan than Ford did.  The rest of the cast is deep in quality  in both big roles and small roles.  Sam Neill James Earl Jones Joss Ackland Richard Jordan Tim Curry Courtney Vance Stellan Skarsgrd Jeffrey Jones etc even a small role for McTiernan's dad.  The deep cast helps add a touch of class to proceedings.Overall this isn't a fantastic thriller however it is classy and very solid in all departments.  It may lack a certain spark but it is solidly entertaining throughout.".

The story is also what makes this an excellent political thriller making this movie perfectly watchable for both the action movie lovers and those of political thrillers. Of all the Tom Clancy novel movies this is my personal favorite and best so far.The cast consists out of some big names. Connery is great as Russian submarine captain who talks Russian with a Scotish accent. Alec Baldwin is a wonderful Jack Ryan. Other actors that stood out to me were Sam Neill Tim Curry Stellan Skarsgrd Jeffrey Jones and Scott Glenn. Only too bad about the Beaumont character that was just annoying and unnecessary.The phenomenal cinematography was done by Jan de Bont. The likewise phenomenal music was composed by Basil Poledouris who's name I can't still spell right without having to look it up. Poledouris truly is a criminally underrated composer and with this movie he once again delivers a true masterpiece.It's the combination of all these great things that make The Hunt for Red October a brilliant and tad underrated movie that is perfectly watchable for a wide range of people.910httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

He loves to gush about the superiority of the American military establishment and its high technology.  This movie puts a more sympathetic face on the Russians and the commoner's point of view. Sean Connery plays a very likable Russian Submarine Commander.  Of course Sean Connery is always going to steal the show in any movie.  He's kind of like the John Wayne of the last twenty five years.  But the supporting actors are also engaging as well.  Scott Glenn Fred Thompson and James Earl Jones all do very well at commanding our attention.  These actors always give strong interesting and dynamic performances. With all the high technology and military hardware in this movie it is interesting to note how a simple seamanan enlisted man at that! solves the great technical puzzle in this movie.  All the officers admirals computers aircraft carriers nuclear submarines and what have you are clearly stumped.  But Jonesy with simple reasoning and a keen intuition solves the riddle that is the Red October.  Yes he uses a computer to help him but most importantly he uses his mind! The strength of this movie is that with all the gadgetry and high technology the human element is not lost but is always on top.  Plus it does not degrade into proAmerican propaganda.  Because of this I think that people who know nothing about the military or who don't even like war movies will find this movie enjoyable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't get me wrong this is actually a very good movie. And this is coming from a 16 year old schoolgirl! It is fast paced not too long and while the story is a bit confusing sometimes it is one of the few movies that maintains our attention all the way through. Director John McTiernon ensures that the tension rarely slips and is fairly faithful to the novel which needs a great deal of understanding especially in the descriptions of the submarines. Though some of the characters especially Dr Petrov have a more significant role in the book. Speaking of the character many said that 43year old Tim Curry of Clue fame looked young and that it was insane casting. He was only in 15 minutes of the movie but he is so important and I was impressed by the depth of Curry's performance it's different to any other role he's played and how the character turned out in general. As well as the submarine and the odd visuals the music was phenomenal as well as the look of the film and the sound with a conveniently Russian feel to it. It was also very musical with what was going on. The acting is what holds the film together with a charismatic performance from Sean Conneryin one of his best postBond roles and a career best from Alec Baldwin. Sam Neill also gives a moving performance as well as the everexcellent James Earl Jones who is in my sister's favourite film the Lion King. I recommend this movie highly if you're a fan of Tom Clancy. I'm not but I enjoyed it because I like films that are tense and I like a lot of the actors in the film. 8.510. Bethany Cox".

Sam Neill also gives a moving performance as well as the everexcellent James Earl Jones who is in my sister's favourite film the Lion King. I recommend this movie highly if you're a fan of Tom Clancy. I'm not but I enjoyed it because I like films that are tense and I like a lot of the actors in the film. 8.510. Bethany Cox";

When the Americans are given photographs of it they are extremely curious as to why is it so special. Jack Ryan Alec Baldwin a CIA analyst consults with a friend who deduces that it's equipped with a new engine that can make it run virtually silent and with such a device they can position themselves on the outskirts of any coastal city and launch their missiles and not give their target any warning. Marko Ramius Sean Connery the sub's captain kills their political officer after they open their orders which basically has them conducting routine maneuvers but he kills him and burns their orders and replaces it. He then tells the crew that they are going to test their new engine by positioning themselves by New York and run missile drills. Ryan is then called by his boss to attend a briefing that concerns Red October. It is at this briefing that they discover that Ramius sent a letter to high ranking Soviet official who after reading the letter went to meet with the Soviet Premier and it was shortly after that meeting that the Soviet navy was deployed to find Red October and sink it. Everyone assumes that Ramius has turned rogue but Ryan who once did research on Ramius assumes that he might be trying to defect. While everyone dismisses him the National Security Adviser tells Ryan to go out there and find out for sure if he is right cause once Ramius is in position to fire his missiles they have take him out. Ryan reluctantly goes and is not use to fieldwork is having a hard time coping with the sea. At the same time someone in the Red October crew knows that Ramius has deviated from his assignment and is doing what he can to stop him! Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery do a great job together in this movie! This movie got Oscar Award for Best Effects and Sound Effects Editing. I think this movie should of won an Oscar award for best picture and have Sean Connery for best actor and Alec Baldwin for supporting actor. I highly recommend this movie!BOTTOM LINE FANTASTIC!".

Plus if you knew some real history you'd know that something like this happened in 1975 only with a ship and the captain wound up being shot by a firing squad. The guy wishing to live in Montana is simply ridiculous. Next we get the numerous technical problems like there is no way a sub could do a turn in several seconds. Have you any idea how big these things are? It would take several seconds just to start its propellers rolling. I won't even get into the caterpillar drive's ridiculousness. Lets just say that even if it did exist it would not be any quieter then a propeller. Finally for a movie that seems to aim for accuracy the Russian pronunciations in it are simply horrible. I know it might not matter much to most of you but they should have at least tried to make it believable. This could go on forever but I'll spare you.

Somehow all the key figures are flawless geniuses Ramius who knows how to perfectly deliver his submarine into American hands Ryan the academic who used to dislike flying but somehow manages to survive a helicopter flight then drops into the ice cold water of the Atlantic helps navigating a submarine with no experience whatsoever and finally wins a gunfight with a Soviet saboteur Mancuso commanding the USS Dallas with admirable ease and taking the unlikely ideas of Ryan as well as those of his sonarman seriously and finally Jones the sonarman who happens to have the best ears of the Western Hemisphere. All five of them are brilliant and do not make a single mistake.

The yarn is interesting though based on fictitious deeds. There are suspense thriller and action but the scenario is mostly into submarines . Runtime film is overlong  the flick is slow moving but is interesting . Amount of minutes are superfluous it has half hour of excess however the movie is quite agreeable . Extraordinary nailbiting scenes specially when there happens the final battle on some amazing images. Sean Connery performance as sub admiral is excellent he hands perfectly the role  Ford has gotten the best character as obstinate captain trying to defect to the West on his ship. Sam Neill acting as the secondincommand is first rate. And of course Alec Balwin is good as agent who must figure out the true motives for approaching the U.S.  this character results to be one of the his best films .

And it belongs to modern subgenre about atomic submarines as Red Crimson with Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman and K19  the Widowmaker with Liam Neeson and Harrison Ford. Interesting screenplay plenty of twists and thrills by Larry Ferguson . Spectacular musical score fitting to action and suspense by the maestro Jerry Golsmith. Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Jan de Bont . This handsome picture is lavishly produced and masterfully directed by John McTiernan . He's an action expert director with hits such as  Predator Die Hard  Warrior 13 Basic and Last days of Eden  again with Sean Connery  and some flops  such as Nomads  Thomas Crown and Rollerball. Rating  Above average the flick will appeal to Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin fans .".

It can only be used it's only purpose is as an offensive weapon.Which troubles her captain Sean Connery who with his officers decides to take it to the USA and defect. You might ask why Connery is command of the vessel. He's not Russian he's Lithuanian and very simply he's the best they've got a kind of Soviet Hyman Rickover.But Clancy had the foresight to see the breakup of the Soviet Union with its various nationalities forming real Republics. The book was written beforehand but the movie came out just when this was happening.The action proceeds on two levels a cat and mouse diplomatic game involving the Russians through their ambassador Joss Ackland disseminating a lot of disinformation about Sean Connery. The second level is the military one with Admirals James Earl Jones and Fred Dalton Thompson trying to divine Connery's intentions and Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan offering an alternative view. Later on Baldwin is transported on a rough sea to an American submarine captained by Scott Glenn whom he also has to sell. Baldwin is truer to Tom Clancy's conception of Jack Ryan who he creates as a policy wonk for the Central Intelligence Agency. It's a different Jack Ryan than Harrison Ford's or later Ben Affleck.Action fans will love the final confrontation with American and Soviet submarines and the outcome and the face that's put on that outcome.".

The book was written beforehand but the movie came out just when this was happening.The action proceeds on two levels a cat and mouse diplomatic game involving the Russians through their ambassador Joss Ackland disseminating a lot of disinformation about Sean Connery. The second level is the military one with Admirals James Earl Jones and Fred Dalton Thompson trying to divine Connery's intentions and Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan offering an alternative view. Later on Baldwin is transported on a rough sea to an American submarine captained by Scott Glenn whom he also has to sell. Baldwin is truer to Tom Clancy's conception of Jack Ryan who he creates as a policy wonk for the Central Intelligence Agency. It's a different Jack Ryan than Harrison Ford's or later Ben Affleck.Action fans will love the final confrontation with American and Soviet submarines and the outcome and the face that's put on that outcome.";

I found the movie uninteresting until the end say the last 30 minutes even then it was just another wartype movie with the usual setup. My main problem though was with the uboat style dialogue Pull the main thrusts! The main thrusts are jammed sir! Go weapons hot! Bullseye! etc.. I don't think military people in real life doing their job really sound like little kids playing a video game with really cockysounding intonation. These men would have been scared to death but you couldn't tell that by their voices. Mundane tasks should be accompanied by matteroffact intonation and dangerous tasks should show nervousness and tension. I guess it's mostly a movie for warmovie aficionados.".

It's all dialoguerich and location sets and natural composition. I thought the casting was perfect the characters were organic and realistic other than Dr. Ellington the personal therapist who was supposed to be a caricature rather than a true character in the film. This gave it a subtly surreal dynamic which I thought was a nice touch.The script was great IMO. I generally like good character sketches though so I suppose I could see people who are not interested in the same being less than thrilled with it. But I like the themes that Art brings to the story. They are typical and simple themes like love direction family friends work sadness happiness. The characters are wholly irreverent and hilariously unique. For a very small film this script is nicely fleshed out.The direction production and editing were great! I didn't catch any mistakes. They had a thorough cinematographer too. I thought the lighting was pleasing and the sound was mixededited nicely.And yes. Rob Pattinson's performance is stellar. For being a selfproclaimed untrained actor he's got such a wonderful and daring onscreen presence. Art is pathetic...so freakin' pathetic. And Pattinson embodies him with such precise depth. His comedic delivery his physical timing his vocal performance I swear it's all flawless. He really reaches inside himself to find that space where depression and anxiety live and he dives into the process of putting himself back together again. You really root for the guy pathetic as he is. As Pattinson's fame swells exponentially in the coming years this one will become a sleeper testament to his acting chopsteeny bopper vampire love stories be damned.".

	schema:reviewBody "When the lights dimmed in the Canal Place Cinema I didn't know exactly what to expect. Within mere moments I'd forgotten that I was in the heart of New Orleans and found myself completely enthralled with the opening words a curious and heartbreaking monologue by the film's main character Art. By the time his face entered the frame there was no trace of Robert Pattinson there was simply Art awkward and tender wholly befuddled by the biting world he attempted to navigate.There is something so uniquely true to life about this film. It explored the murky themes of family bonds and the alltoooften lacks thereof the lonely defeat of indecision and that maddening dance of knowing exactly who you want to be but finding yourself completely eluded by how to be that person. Of course just like life even in the darkest of mind states there is laughter and those who stand by your side. Those who perhaps see that you are farther along than you'd have yourself believe.What inspired me most was the theme of perseverance in the face of echoing fiascoes. And the beautiful depiction of the gritty truth that sometimes you must strip yourself down and let go of the familiar in order to clear the debris from your path. I've seen no better representation of this reality facet than that which takes place when Art finally decides to seize control of his personal veracity and his place here on Earth.I've often described this movie as perfect an audacious description that I do not bestow lightly. The soulful direction of Oliver Irving serves as a magnifying glass over the raw and genuine performances of the superbly selected cast. Each actor brings hisher best to the table and seem to share with each other the exact notion of what the story is all about breathing irrefutable life into this polished gem of an indie film.The dynamic between Art Ronny and Nikki was so natural and wellexecuted that I quite honestly forgot they were merely fictional friends in a film. Their adlibbed endeavors were so flawless that a missed beat did not exist and undoubtedly added to the authenticity of their quirky endearing friendships.Johnny White had me rolling in the aisles as the quickwitted flatdwelling nitroushuffing Ronny. The best thing about his portrayal was the fact that he brought the funny in a big way without his character realizing just how amusing he was. Not to take away from his dramatic ability however for one of the most surprisingly downhearted elements of the film was his to bear.Mike Pearce who described himself as the epitome of the nonactor shined as Nikki the flamboyant gogetter who loved the ladies and brought some much needed lightheartedness to the trio of lovable misfits. I'm very much inclined to respectfully disagree with his humble selfassessment and look forward to seeing him on the big screen in the future.Robert Pattinson's performance was above and beyond anything I could have imagined and I went into this movie with high expectations for this role. Through him Art came to life in a way that I've never experienced in a film and for 85 glorious minutes I shared his dolor his elation his anxiety and his laughter as though I was watching the story of someone I'd known my whole life. His approach to Art's graceless good intentions was one of exceptional skill that you seldom find in a relatively inexperienced actor.Simply put he is brilliant a knowledge that doesn't really hit you until the credits start rolling when you remember that it was in fact Pattinson and not solely Art that you'd been watching and fervently routing for during the last hour and a half.To bottom line it this movie is a downright hilarious journey through the dark struggles of a misshapen diamond in the rough. It left this moviegoer breathless deep in thought and comforted by the true fact that sometimes we all need a little help and the best person for the job is ultimately yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "How To Be is an independent film written and directed by Oliver Irving. Humor and anguish are expertly integrated into the story of Art Freeman played exquisitely by Robert Pattinson a twentysomething lovable loser who feels that his life is less than it should be. The movie follows Art along a path of discovery and maturity both for himself and his lifelong friend the agoraphobic Ronny a superb performance by Johnny White. Art spends his time working at a local grocery store and volunteering in an attempt to make something of his life although his true passion is his songwriting and performing. When his girlfriend Jessica Alisa Arnah dumps him he is forced to move back into his parents' house a situation that is made more uncomfortable by his mother's Rebecca Pidgeon reaction that it was simply a matter of time. Art's selfloathing leads him to the selfhelp section of a bookstore. It is there that he finds his glimmer of hope when he discovers the book It's Not Your Fault by Dr. Ellington another great performance by Powell Jones. Not only does Art read the book religiously but he spends his inheritance to bring the author to his home to personally help him through his life. As expected comedy ensues. But along with the hilarity there is an ample amount of melancholy. Art's parents are not the nurturing loving parents that every child needs. He is a constant disappointment to them and they make no qualms about telling him this. His seemingly unfeeling mother nearly collapses while trying to prevent him from hugging her! They offer him absolutely no support in his dream of becoming a musician. Oliver Irving's creative mix of eclectic characters provides the audience with a wide variety of humor. The story is captivating and the acting is accomplished. It is altogether a brilliant film worthy of the honors it has received. And from this reviewer's standpoint if one wants to put an entire theater of women into a frenzyhave Robert Pattinson say the line I have an erection. Well done Oliver!!".

The movie follows Art along a path of discovery and maturity both for himself and his lifelong friend the agoraphobic Ronny a superb performance by Johnny White. Art spends his time working at a local grocery store and volunteering in an attempt to make something of his life although his true passion is his songwriting and performing. When his girlfriend Jessica Alisa Arnah dumps him he is forced to move back into his parents' house a situation that is made more uncomfortable by his mother's Rebecca Pidgeon reaction that it was simply a matter of time. Art's selfloathing leads him to the selfhelp section of a bookstore. It is there that he finds his glimmer of hope when he discovers the book It's Not Your Fault by Dr. Ellington another great performance by Powell Jones. Not only does Art read the book religiously but he spends his inheritance to bring the author to his home to personally help him through his life. As expected comedy ensues. But along with the hilarity there is an ample amount of melancholy. Art's parents are not the nurturing loving parents that every child needs. He is a constant disappointment to them and they make no qualms about telling him this. His seemingly unfeeling mother nearly collapses while trying to prevent him from hugging her! They offer him absolutely no support in his dream of becoming a musician. Oliver Irving's creative mix of eclectic characters provides the audience with a wide variety of humor. The story is captivating and the acting is accomplished. It is altogether a brilliant film worthy of the honors it has received. And from this reviewer's standpoint if one wants to put an entire theater of women into a frenzyhave Robert Pattinson say the line I have an erection. Well done Oliver!!";

I'm pretty sure he could have starred at a wall for 2 hours and still got 10 stars from a lot of people reviewing.The whole thing is very amateurish you can tell it's a festival kind of movie and in this case it isn't a good thing. The comic timing is terrible which makes it really hard to laugh at anything it was more cringeworthy  although again in a cinema full of Pattinson fans he merely had to make the slightest gesture and the place was filled with roars of laughter  I was left just looking around in disbelief!Good enough concept but an absolute fail on the execution side. I very much doubt this is going to find a distributor as they see exactly what I see  And with the same lack of bias i.e. not being in love with the lead actor!".

I had no expectations just a free night to see what else this guy could do.The movie did not disappoint. The story line and direction was great and I actually found myself feeling sorry for Art. Poor Art is somewhat of an insecure gullible goofy guy who just wants to be validated. His mother calls him an oxymoron. He reaches out to his friends who couldn't care less about his feelings.His friends Nikki Mike Pearce and Ronny Johnny White are just as pathetic as he is. I thought Mike Pearce's character was a great complement to Art. His break dancing and skateboarding techniques cracked me up.The movie was filled with quick one line zingers that will make you laugh out loud. Though I must say the people in the theatre were crazed for Rob Pattinson. From the onset one single moveword from Rob and the theatre was howling with laughter. I thought I was a fan but when he had a line or even a simple shifting of his eyes people were so vocal. It was a bit distracting. So it is probably best the film is going to OnDemand so you can really appreciate the story line and all the other actorscharacters in the movie.Oliver Irving  great job on the writing direction casting improv's. I will be looking for your future movies!".

At some points Art is such a downer which is brought on by his own doing that I found it hard to 'put' myself through the rest of the movie.

I mean it's essentially the same as what you see in a lot of ridiculous characterdriven comedies where the characters themselves are totally unaware of just how funny they're being. The humor is just very dead pan and I think some people watch the film expecting something more sophisticated or thoughtful. Sure it's more profound than Napoleon Dynamite but the idea of simultaneously gawking at and rooting for such a bizarre and socially impotent character is basically the same in both films. This is really among my favorite movies just because it captures that strange moment of selfloathing selfobsession that lots of people go through right around the time of the quarter life crisis.".

He brings to life all of Art's insecurities and anxieties  I felt all of that. I wanted to grab him shake him and scream at him to get over it already. This wasn't a lighthearted movie that you sit back and relax with  be prepared to feel a wide range of emotions. I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys character pieces.".

As a huge PattinsonCullen fan that speaks volumes for his acting talent. Pattinson is far more than a pretty face. He brings to life all of Art's insecurities and anxieties  I felt all of that. I wanted to grab him shake him and scream at him to get over it already. This wasn't a lighthearted movie that you sit back and relax with  be prepared to feel a wide range of emotions. I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys character pieces.";

It was such a disappointment in my opinion and sure Robert Pattinson doesn't need to play the good looking guy all the time but he doesn't need to play such a nerd and kinda dumb character either. This movie was super slow and mostly with bad humor as well plus the rest of the cast was so awful too i mean i really expected more here.".

In fact this and Snow White are two of my earliest film memories and Joan Crawford is STILL creepier than the Evil Queen in Snow White. Joan actually has fun as a nasty scenestealer neighbor who wants the married man for herself. William Castle I'm a big fan of his made many effective cheapo thrillers Dr. Sardonicus Homicidal  Thirteen Ghosts to name a few. In fact John Goodamn does a nice job playing a version of Castle in the underrated Joe Dante film Matine.

In fact John Goodamn does a nice job playing a version of Castle in the underrated Joe Dante film Matine. But check out this little teenage scarefest and whatever you do  don't prank call someone right after they've killed a mate  they're not in the mood!!";

Anchor Bay Entertainment released the movie on DVD and VHS back in 1999. The picture quality is sensational. Also included are two fun '' Teaser Trailers'' one featuring Castle himself. Though the DVD is not ''anmorphic'' it is in Widescreen with no scratches or blemishes anywhere.It must have been taken from the original Universal negative.The onechannel soundtrack is equally strong though a good DVD system will allow you to upgrade to twochannel''Simulated Stereo'' which sounds even better. The Trailers are as well preserved as the film itself. Sadly it's long out of print and goes for big  on Amazon and EBAY. The 1988 Television remake is terrible. Avoid it and stick with the original!".

Everyone knows the plot which involves two teenage girls who spend an evening making prank phone calls and through the miracle of plot contrivance stumble into the path of a psychotic man who has just committed murder.  I don't know if any of the other viewers felt the same way but I really think the movie's violence is a bit shocking for its day.  The first murder is an ironic ripoff of Psycho with the person in the shower committing the murder instead of being slashed and I was surprised at how graphic it really is.  Also I don't know whether this was really the filmmakers' intention or not but they have captured the excitement of a teenage adventure and carried it effortlessly into a suspenseful conclusion.  Ironically the only thing in the movie that feels wrong is the subplot involving Crawford.  It was obviously inserted to give the movie a star and to pad out the running time.".

	schema:reviewBody "I Saw What You Did has teenagers Libby and Kit spending a night home alone along with Libby's younger sister Tess. What do three young girls do for fun on a Friday night in 1965? Make prank phone calls of course! But Libby and Kit's idea of innocent fun turns dangerous when they ring a psychopath who has just murdered his wife.I admittedly am not a fan of William Castle's earliest work as much as I don't want to say it I find his earlier ghost films House on Haunted Hill and 13 Ghosts remarkably dull but here Castle seems to have struck my fancy. I Saw What You Did is a straightforward suspense film that relies on crafty writing in order to really hold our attention but the script pulls it off. The causal reactions that put Libby and Kit into such grave danger are extremely clever and that is perhaps the film's greatest strength the writing is inventive and smart. In terms of action there is not a lot that happens over the course of the film but it still manages to engage all the same and running at 82 minutes it packs its punch well.The film's blackandwhite photography is gorgeous and drenches everything atmosphere and its famous uxoricide scene cribs Hitchcock's Psycho but is arguably more brutal it marks a pivotal point in the film as well that will have the audience shifting in their seat even the film's hokey score is discredited by that scene alone. As lightweight as the film feels for much of its duration the first murder is there to remind us that it's really not.The two leading young girls are remarkably likable in their roles and Joan Crawford infamously pulls off the role of the psychopath's sultry mistress nextdoor. While Crawford is often credited for hamming things up in her later career I found her performance here to be actually quite incredible and terrifying her interrogation of Libby when the girls arrive at the madman's house was absolutely hairraising in fact I'd go so far as to say she's scarier in that moment than John Ireland is throughout the entire film.Overall I Saw What You Did is noteworthy as a thriller but also as a cultural relic of a bygone era of rotary dials and a world where prank calls could lead to murderous madmen peeking in your windows. It's a clever and suspenseful film that is tame by today's standards but the maliciousness of its first murder scene does keep it floating above total kitsch. It's fun short and sweet and Joan Crawford somehow manages to be at her scariest in a role that could have easily been very boring in the hands of another actress. It's a shame that it hasn't been rereleased on DVD or Bluray for new generations to have availability to the original Anchor Bay disc went out of print years ago and is inexplicably among the rarest horror DVDs out there. 910.".

She acts like a marvelous actress on a binge caught unawares.  Her part is miniscule but she gives it her offkilter all.  John Ireland is here 10 years after being stung by Joan in Queen Bee which everyone has already mentioned.  That film was infinitely scarier than this one with Joan  stopping just short of eating babies.  Ooh she was a bad one.  In this film she's a bad one of a different sortbad as in not good.Kit and Libby are the two silly acting teenagers that decide prank phone calls are a lovely way to spend an evening.  They have several routines but I don't remember hearing Is your refrigerator running?  Yes.  Then you better go catch it.  I guess they decided against using the classics.  They go from mocking people Is this John Hamburger? to girlfriendaccidentallycallswife skits Is insert name there?  Oh this is his wife?!?.  When their creativity runs out after about two phone calls they decide to use a planned lineI saw what you did and I know you are.  Well William Castle asks what if the person you called actually did something and he thinks you saw him?  Interesting ideapresumably taken from the book on which this film is based.  Turns out they ring up John Ireland who has just committed a felony and he thinks he had witnesses.  Libby is the one that falls for him I think and she just gets all hot and bothered.  She decides that she has to see a man that has a sexy voice like that why he must be just divine.  She really fell hardI felt sorry for her.  She said his voice was something like him running his fingers up and down her spine.  What has this girl been reading?  She gets so frustrated Freud's type of frustrated I imagine that she goes over to his house just to peek in the window.  She gets all dressed up to do this does her hair and puts on makeup and the other girl Kit? is understandably confused.  Libby is stomping on the flowers when she meets Amy the drunken sexcrazed incredibly angry and pathetic neighbor.At this point things pick up considerably.  We've got the rantin' and ravin' of Joan the stammering and completely terrified girl and John Sexy Voice Ireland.  All our characters have reported for duty and the plot has emerged.  Everything is ready to go.  I think this is where the film reaches its own little pinnacle of greatness.  Joan confronts John  didja know there was also a John Crawford back then? with the a bunch of incorrect information but it's just enough to get him riled.  From this point on everyone's in trouble and who can save them now?All in all a very enjoyable film although I don't think it's too terribly frightening.  Joan's hair is scary as I think someone else mentioned but that's about it.  It's what one would expect from William Castle.  Laughs in a Halloween costume.".

But in between the beginning and the end the movie drags a bitand some of it is due to the fact that the two teenagers who star in the film just don't have enough magnetism to sustain the film. Plus although I hate to admit it they were both such brats I was kind of hoping they WOULD be killed! The other lowpoint of the film is the crappy beach partytype music at the beginning and end. It was totally inappropriate for the mood of the film but I assume it was used to appeal to the younger audiencewhile probably alienating older viewers or people in the 21st century that view the DVD. Not a bad little film but hardly great or memorable.".

I don't think they did any other mainstream features after this one. Patricia Breslin and Leif Erickson who had each appeared in earlier Castle efforts are not bad. John Ireland really is creepy and good as the stalking killer. His scene where he stabs his wife in the shower though inspired by Psycho no doubt is quite effective. The little girl Tess is a nuisance.Some really good creepy moments throughout and one can't deny the fun of the subject matter Two teenagers getting the wits scared out of them after making prank phone calls. The music by Van Alexander makes this seem like a 60s sitcom so in that respect it doesn't really set the mood but it's not a total disturbance. Definitely one of the better Castle films.

The older girl invites her friend over for dinner and the three of them eventually resort to prank calling random people from the phone book to entertain themselves. Unfortunately for them they make the mistake of calling a man who's just committed murder and jokingly tell him I know what you did and I know who you are. The man naturally assumes the voice on the line is serious and there is a witness out there who saw him disposing of his girlfriend's body. A variety of twists and intertwining characters eventually put the guilty man in the same room as our innocent kids.The plot relies heavily on coincidence to stitch everything together and a major plot point hinges on an extremely stupid decision by our protagonists but in spite of it all it still manages to build a lot of tension towards it's climax which although brief is handled very effectively. It also helps that this secluded home of there's is surrounded by forestry and continually deepening shadows as the night wares on with fog that's barely visible outside the moonlight making for a very creepy and cool atmosphere. The acting is pretty good too even our teenage heroes seem to exercise some decent chops all things considered. Good fun and good thrills.".

I picked up this movie because it was a Castle film although I thought because of its juvenile nature that I wouldn't enjoy it. But we showed this during one of our family movie nights and everyone loved it! Even my daughter who hates scary movies. This is a fun fun movie with some humor some frights and cool music.

	schema:reviewBody "Things get dicey for two teenage girls after they play what was supposed to be a harmless prank in 'I Saw What You Did'. Kit and Libby are spending the night babysitting Libby's younger sister Tess at their deserted mansion on a farm. The three of them decide to play prank phone calls on random people. It's all fun at first until they decide to call Steve Marak and say the line I saw what you did and I know who you are!. What they don't know is that Steve just murdered his wife! So of course when Steve hears this over the phone he suspects that the caller is onto him. This begins a fun game of cat and mouse in which Steve must deal with his nagging lover Amy Joan Crawford and get to the mysterious caller in order to shut her up... not knowing the caller is simply a teenage girl playing a game. I really love this film one of my favourite's by William Castle. It runs at a bit of a slower pace than my all time favourite Castle movie Strait Jacket but has enough going for it to keep my attention. I'd say a con to this was that Joan Crawford was not utilized enough but her character Amy was really secondary to the movie  and it worked. Amy was a supporting character and although Crawford put in a good performance 'I Saw What You Did' is more about the teenagers and the psychotic murderer out to keep them quiet.'I Saw What you Did' was likely the first horror movie to introduce the helpless babysitter versus killer storyline which of course 'Halloween' used brilliantly in '78. The overall acting was good especially from the main characters Libby Kit and little Tess! You feel for all three of them and worry for their safety against Steve. Only con to it is that the ending felt a bit rushed. I highly recommend this one if you can find it it's pretty hard to get on DVD or even VHS.810".

It's too bad what with the premise behind I Saw What You Did that it didn't come out as good as it could have been. The movie itself isn't the best example of what Castle was the music....is awful. As like my big problem with Scream 2besides it's ScoobyDoo like endingthe music in I Saw What You Did seems to be too out of sorts. It's very up tempo and jazzy but doesn't help to create any thrill or excitement. It's disappointing because this one has SO MUCH potential to scare prankcrazy kids out of their wits. The music REALLY destroys any kind of scare and ends up making it feel like cheap exploitation. The perk to this film is the end clincher as Castle seems to be great at it isn't exactly jawdropping...but i guarantee you won't say I SAW THAT COMING.....".

	schema:reviewBody "This 1965 offering directed by the famed horrorschlock director William Castle on one level is quite fascinating. The idea of two teens making creepy prank calls to unsuspecting victims is rife with possibilities. The film starts out with our two heroines paging through a phone book. A food stain lands on the name of their next victim a middle aged man named Steve Marak. The prank call begins with their standard line I saw what you did and I know who you are. This time there's a switchyou see Marak has just finished murdering his wife in a particularly brutal fashion. Needless to say he doesn't see this message as a harmless prank. He demands to see them thinking he can either shut them up permanently or bribe them to stay silent. The girls intrigued by his sexy voice sneak off in their parent's car to see him. After a good start the film begins to show its flaws. Joan Crawford top billed as Steve's girlfriend is actually on screen only a few minutes. The only really big name in the cast she chomps up the scenery mercilessly all the while wearing some ridiculous piece of jewelry which distracts us from just about everything except for her ridiculous performance. The two little pranksters are played by virtual unknowns who remained unknown thereafter for no unknown reasons. The acting honors here go to John Ireland as Steve. As the wife killer and victim of the girl's tricks his is the only believable performance in the film. This is unfortunate for better acting could have made a real difference for the interest and tone of the film. Overall a better cast excepting Ireland and a much better script could have lifted this from just another routine horror melodrama to a fascinating study of voyeurism and the role this plays in these young girls' lives. The prank call angle is the most interesting angle in what is otherwise a routine melodrama centering on infidelity and murder. Five out of ten for some good atmosphere an interesting idea and Ireland's performance.".

Due to financial difficulties the film apparently got lost but part of the original material was recovered in 1998 and was finally released in the year 2000. The original soundtrack remained lost so Basquiat's voice had to be dubbed.It's an interesting timecapsule of PostPunk NewWave New York with a sometimes fascinating compilation of interesting vignettes from the scene but as a movie it's less rewarding. The story is practically nonexistent and there is no acting really as everybody play themselves. There's much resemblance to the experimental films Andy Warhol made about the New York art scene. It's a typical example of a fiction film with a very lose story line combined with mostly reallife characters from the period like Deborah Harry Fab Five Freddy the music of Kid Creole and the Coconuts Tuxemodoon The Plastics DNA The Lounge Lizards and Basquiat himself with his own band Gray. A long segment in the film is reserved for a live performance of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. If you're a fan it's great fun.In the end a mixed bag a film mainly of interest for fans of Basquiat and the music of the era.

The film was directed by Edo Bertoglio has only directed one other film 'Face Addict'like 'Beat Movie'dealt with the New York uptowndowntown art scene . The fact that over the yearsthe soundtrack became lost to time only made matters worse. In the late 1990'showever the original 16mm negative was found sans soundtracka new soundtrack was made up using a brand new soundtrackincluding a replacement voice over dub for Basquiatwho had died in 1988and the film was finally given a limited art house release in 2000under the new title'Downtown 81'. Not the best film depicting the 1980'sbut certainly not the worst. Not ratedbut contains some rude language.".

Secondly there was no obvious attempt to synchronize any of the audio in fact it is quite apparent that most of the dialogue was recorded later with no attempt to match the film.

	schema:reviewBody "New York Beat Movie or Downtown 81 is one of those unclassifiable oddball movies that just comes out from the underground but makes a little too much sense to be grouped in the classic underground movie definition like Andy Warhol. This is more akin to the Jim Jarmusch film Permanent Vacation where we follow a character in this case a notsothinlydisguised version of JeanMichel Basquiat as he walks around the lower east side circa 1980 and gets into some mishaps and miniadventures usually with a musical beat. It's not entirely fiction not entirely documentary not entirely concert. It's more like a punknewwave fever dream with Debby Harry as a guardian angel and some bands that will be obscure except for the buffs of the music era save for a couple of exceptions.If there is any story it's very light. It's like we're getting a view into how Basquiat goes about his day and night and has to contend with getting kicked out of his apartment his band equipment being ripped off by just ONE guy! and as he tries to track down a woman who he thinks is out of this world who says she'll take care of him for life. Fat chance. It's like a kind of travelogue through the dirt and grime the beat boxes and graffiti artists the weird WTF bands like DNA it's not good music but it is interesting in an avantgarde doingwhatwelike way like lesser Television and some of the bigger bands like Kid Creole and James and the Blacks. It's a trip man.Some of the setbacks to the film are technical and not entirely the fault of the filmmakers. Considering much of the film was thought lost until it was edited back together in 1999 it does flow well. It's the soundtrack that is very hit or miss. Saul Williams does a decent job conveying the quiet thoughtful but forceful spirit of JeanMichel particularly in the semipoetic narration but the other voicework is spotty and unconvincing. Only the music selections help carry through the flaws such as that reggae song as Basquiat walks around at night or when he wanders into a small studio and dances to 'Rapture'. It definitely has moments where you'll bop your head and tap your feet and some of the art work and Samo's graffiti is captivating.It's less than great but maybe that was the idea to start. It's more about getting the time and place the mood of an artist or a musician out on the fringes and just getting by than telling a story. That should be fine for the audience it's intended. Others proceed with some caution.".

The Tiger is at least twenty years older than those he beds. Spotlight substitute teacher Betty Smith Angie Dickinson rubbing her boobs against those students who ignite her libido ultimately deflowering one of Coach Tiger's star players Ponce de Leon Harper John David Carson not unlike the name Fonzie from TV's Happy Days causing him to be metamorphosed from a shy timid teen into the playboy of the western world.Guess who's in charge of the investigation into all the murders on and around campus? None other than Kojak Telly Savalas portraying Captain Sam Surcher with a thing for his cigarette in training for his later lollipop placebo. He is assisted in his search for the killer by Keenan Wynn as Chief John Poldaski more a hindrance than a help. The straitlaced prudish Mr. Proffer Roddy McDowall is in charge of the high school where mass slaughter is littering the campus with dead bodies. He naturally would like for it to stop. To emphasize the theme Joy Bang has a bit part as Rita.Those behind the camera are just as surprising. Selfproclaimed libertine director Roger Vadim fresh from Barberella starring his brotherinlaw's sister Jane Fonda makes sure the camera shots include as much cleavage and exposed skin as permitted in those halcyon days of 1971. Though based on a novel Trekky Gene Roddenberry wrote the salacious script even beaming up Scotty James Doohan for the role of Follo. Roddenberry served as producer as well. Trivia question Name the one movie scored by the darlings of the establishment The Osmonds? Right Pretty Maids All In A Row. Actually their version of Chilly Winds is not bad.My wife and I saw this flick when it was first released in 1971 and found nothing outrageous about it. We watched it a second time recently and were surprised at how shocking it has become. Either the times have changed drastically or we have changed drastically pobably both since the days of the Flower Children. What is politically incorrect today was accepted by the viewers in that bygone era. The viewer will note that though the theme and philosophy seem deviant by today's standards there is almost no vulgar language used in the film. That cultural barrier had not yet been breached by Hollywood.Obviously intended as black comedy at the time Pretty Maids All In A Row is certainly no Dr. Strangelove nor was it meant to be. However the viewer labels this film it is guaranteed to entertain and arouse the basic instincts. Enjoy it even if you must call it a guilty pleasure.".

The straitlaced prudish Mr. Proffer Roddy McDowall is in charge of the high school where mass slaughter is littering the campus with dead bodies. He naturally would like for it to stop. To emphasize the theme Joy Bang has a bit part as Rita.Those behind the camera are just as surprising. Selfproclaimed libertine director Roger Vadim fresh from Barberella starring his brotherinlaw's sister Jane Fonda makes sure the camera shots include as much cleavage and exposed skin as permitted in those halcyon days of 1971. Though based on a novel Trekky Gene Roddenberry wrote the salacious script even beaming up Scotty James Doohan for the role of Follo. Roddenberry served as producer as well. Trivia question Name the one movie scored by the darlings of the establishment The Osmonds? Right Pretty Maids All In A Row. Actually their version of Chilly Winds is not bad.My wife and I saw this flick when it was first released in 1971 and found nothing outrageous about it. We watched it a second time recently and were surprised at how shocking it has become. Either the times have changed drastically or we have changed drastically pobably both since the days of the Flower Children. What is politically incorrect today was accepted by the viewers in that bygone era. The viewer will note that though the theme and philosophy seem deviant by today's standards there is almost no vulgar language used in the film. That cultural barrier had not yet been breached by Hollywood.Obviously intended as black comedy at the time Pretty Maids All In A Row is certainly no Dr. Strangelove nor was it meant to be. However the viewer labels this film it is guaranteed to entertain and arouse the basic instincts. Enjoy it even if you must call it a guilty pleasure.";

Not only that but take a look behind the camerathis movie teams up the French New Wave director who discovered Brigit Bardot with the creator of Star Trek! I always suspected that the strange appeal of the latter program for it's very sexually repressed fans was due to the fact that all the girls human or alien all wore miniskirts up to their tailboneswell the Trekkies ought to take a gander at this big screen Rodenberry effort. Damnit Captain that skirt just can't ride up anymore! They can't take it! They're going to blow!OK maybe I shouldn't enjoy a film that spends so much time looking up the skirts of teenage girls or showing them in nude clinches with Rock Hudson who plays a VERY progressive guidance counselor and popular football coach or lying face down dead with a note pinned to the back of their underwear. But only in the early 1970's could a film this completely irresponsible be made let alone attract such an allstar cast. Not only that but this film is historically significant in that it is the missing link between all the later teen sex comedies where an awkward male virgin here given the perfect name Ponce de Leonloses his virginity to an older woman and the teen slasher films where slutty teenage girls pay for their promiscuity with their lives. Of course this is horribly sexist and hypocritical but it has clearly been a pattern in teenoriented comedies and horror movies over the last thirty years. This movie at least seems to be aware of it's own absurd contradictions. This is not only one of the rare sex comedies that is actually both funny and sexy but it also adds a strong dose of black comedy into the mix. And the whole thing works wonderfully. Highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " No Hollywood Film Has Broken So Many Taboos";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the most politically incorrect films of all time Pretty Maids All In a Row is easily Roger Vadim's most audacious film. Scripted by Gene Roddenberry it focuses on the strange happenings taking place at a California high school. To better understand this film you need to know more about Roger Vadim. He was by all accounts a unrepentant womanizer. He wrote not just one but two books concerning his love affairs with Brigitte Bardot Catherine Deneuve Annette Atroyberg and Jane Fonda. The filmmaker practically invented the modern day sex film in 1956 with And God Ceated Woman. In 2005 Jane Fonda went public with allegations claiming that Vadim forced her to have threesomes with other women. Director Roger Vadim obviously loved women. The way the camera takes in the female form in this film shows that this guy truly enjoyed this cast of beautiful high school girls who are dropping out of school in the most unfortunate manner they are being murdered.The first body is found by student Ponce. He discovers the nude body in the boy's washroom.After discovering the body we are introduced to the detective assigned to the case as well as an amoral guidance counselor named Tiger played by Rock Hudson who also happens to be sleeping with his students in his office. The investigation goes and we discover that the murdered girls happened to be sleeping with Tiger.Despite of all the heat pressure placed on him Tiger doesn't seem worried that he'll get caught. He continues coaching the football team eventually setting Ponce up with a sexy new teacher Angie Dickinson and of course carrying on affairs with the students. In his autobiography Vadim recalled the casting of the students in Pretty Maids All in a Row ...I had auditioned over two hundred boys and about the same number of girls. Most of the girls who applied in the roles of high school alumni were aspiring actresses though some were local students who merely found the whole thing amusing. For a man recovering from love sickness Jane Fonda had just divorced Vadim this succession of young teenage and college age beauties was intoxicating. Vadim specifically ordered the wardrobe department to dress the girls in micro skirts and tight fitting shirts. Notably a good portion of them aren't wearing bras. Vadim films these young ladies many of which appear to be underage in a method that is so unapologetically sexual that you'll soon understand why this film will likely never appear on DVD. With pedophilia being such a hot topic in today's society no film company wants to risk being accused of exploiting minors by releasing this on DVD. With its nonstop leering shots of teenage body parts and seemingly giddy portrayal of sexual relationships between adults and children does Pretty Maids All in A Row seem like a celebration of pedophilia? Uh the correct term is 'ebephophilia' which means 'love of adolescents'. I guess it's a matter of opinion. When I first viewed this film as a teen the director's constant zooming in on the breasts and buttocks of female high school students was a bit shocking but had a point to it. I mean high school is a particularly sexualized place being that many students are entering in relationships for the first times in their lives. Then I read a movie review about how Pretty Maids All in A Row may have been the most widespread femalekiddieporn film ever seen. The slow misty shots of the braless pubescent girls in their micro skirts were far too prevalent to be incidental. When I saw this movie again this time in my late 20s I had no problem understanding the reviewer's point of view. For example the opening scene of this movie consists of a closeup of a pair of butts belonging to two female classmates of Ponce. These two who look barely 18 show up randomly during this movie and every scene they are in the camera is fixated so closely on their mini skirts that it's laughable. I can find no reason for so pointlessly including these two girls in the movie other than for the director to showcase their gorgeous bodies with series of gratuitous shots of their crotches and rears. It seems all quite juvenille. Still I don't think anyone should not see this film just because director Vadim can't go two minutes without fetishizing a sea of young female bodies. To better understand all the blatant voyeurism directed towards these girls remember that this is an American movie made with a European mentality. The European school of filmmaking seems to approach the entire feminine image in a different sense than the Americans do the female body is perceived to be a work of art in itself that it is graceful elegant beautiful and sensual an aesthetic object with erotic power. Presenting it in the proper manner makes one marvel instead of blushing and turning awaythat seems to be the attitude this director takes and it causes the frequent nudity in the film to be not so much dirty obscene and debaucherous as being instead a presentation of a thing of beauty. The acting in Pretty Maids is firstrate. The cast is by far the film's strongest asset. These are all truly courageous performers and the acting is so good it's scary. The standouts are probably Rock Hudson and John David Carson. Not surprisingly Telly Savalas as a Kojakstyle detective steals every scene he is in. Angie Dickinson is great but I was distracted by her aesthetic qualities. Pretty Maids is a good movie that has quite a few shocking moments. It's quite implausible and uneven but I recommend seeing it. It's one of those movies where you just HAVE to see it you know? Not because it's some great masterpiece of cinema but because there's a lot there to talk about. Check it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a funny movie folks.Don't be put off by some of the other reviews written here as they completely missed the point.This is a black comedyfarce folks. Though seemingly played 'straight' as it were it in fact has its tongue firmly in cheek.The plot revolves around a string of murders mostly young comely lasses at a California high school.It appears all too hip Rock Hudson playing a groovy guidance counselor and football coach has been having romantic dalliances with a lot of the student bodys...Meanwhile he's helping his protg John David Carson an awkward high school senior lose his virginity with sexy substitute teacher Angie Dickinson.When the bodies start piling up perennial police detective Telly Savalas comes into the picture.Roddy McDowall gets thrown in for comic relief as a nervous high school principal along with Susan Tolksy as his even more nervous assistant. You'll remember Miss Tolksy as the comic relief in the late 60s TV Series Here Come The Brides as Biddie Cloom.Finally Keenan Wynn gets thrown into the mix as a bumbling local Chief of Police who gets more than he bargained for when he tries to solve the identity of the murderer himself.Legendary ladies man five time married Roger Vadim directs this sexually charged flick. You'll recall that Vadim was married to both Brigitte Bardot  Jane Fonda and had a love child with none other than Catherine Deneuve.You'll never see a high school again filled with as many thin beautiful coeds as Mr. Vadim presents in this movie all sporting the shortest of mini skirts that is while they're still IN their clothes. Lots of 'Playboyesque' nudity runs throughout the film without it becoming graphic or embarrassing. Angie Dickinson looking in top form even shows a little skin! This flick has cult classic written all over it and would be a great movie to remake.Just remember NOT to take it seriously folks. Of course the idea of students and teachers so casually engaging in sexual escapades is something you would not want in real life. That goes without saying.But again this is an adult farce with lots of black comedy. When the first victim is found dead principal Roddy McDowall can only comment on what a great cheerleader she was so it's obvious pretty much from the getgo that we're in an altered state of reality here.Though not a comedy classic it's a fun sexy movie that doesn't take itself seriously and moves right along at a brisk 91 minutes.Even more fun to watch with a group of friends.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a funny movie folks.Don't be put off by some of the other reviews written here as they completely missed the point.This is a black comedyfarce folks. Though seemingly played 'straight' as it were it in fact has its tongue firmly in cheek.The plot revolves around a string of murders mostly young comely lasses at a California high school.It appears all too hip Rock Hudson playing a groovy guidance counselor and football coach has been having romantic dalliances with a lot of the student bodys...Meanwhile he's helping his protg John David Carson an awkward high school senior lose his virginity with sexy substitute teacher Angie Dickinson.When the bodies start piling up perennial police detective Telly Savalas comes into the picture.Roddy McDowall gets thrown in for comic relief as a nervous high school principal along with Susan Tolksy as his even more nervous assistant. You'll remember Miss Tolksy as the comic relief in the late 60s TV Series Here Come The Brides as Biddie Cloom.Finally Keenan Wynn gets thrown into the mix as a bumbling local Chief of Police who gets more than he bargained for when he tries to solve the identity of the murderer himself.Legendary ladies man five time married Roger Vadim directs this sexually charged flick. You'll recall that Vadim was married to both Brigitte Bardot  Jane Fonda and had a love child with none other than Catherine Deneuve.You'll never see a high school again filled with as many thin beautiful coeds as Mr. Vadim presents in this movie all sporting the shortest of mini skirts that is while they're still IN their clothes. Lots of 'Playboyesque' nudity runs throughout the film without it becoming graphic or embarrassing. Angie Dickinson looking in top form even shows a little skin! This flick has cult classic written all over it and would be a great movie to remake.Just remember NOT to take it seriously folks. Of course the idea of students and teachers so casually engaging in sexual escapades is something you would not want in real life. That goes without saying.But again this is an adult farce with lots of black comedy. When the first victim is found dead principal Roddy McDowall can only comment on what a great cheerleader she was so it's obvious pretty much from the getgo that we're in an altered state of reality here.Though not a comedy classic it's a fun sexy movie that doesn't take itself seriously and moves right along at a brisk 91 minutes.Even more fun to watch with a group of friends.";

The cast has a lot of fun including Rock Hudson and the most heterosexual high school counselor in the universe believe it and Angie Dickenson as the sexiest teacher this side of my sophomore English teacher Miss Lynn Segal at San Gabriel High Angie has a stiffieinducing seduction scene that'll ring most guy's bells like Quasimodo sure as hell never could. In a wonderfully clueless comic role is Keenan Wynn. He's great. And a preKojak Telly Savalas is the coolest police homicide detective in the history of cinema. High school chicks dig him. John David Carson is ideal as Ponce the shy quiet timid virgin student who doesn't necessarily end up that way. Every girl he sees drives him crazy  and it's easy to see why. These babes are total! Joanna Cameron Aimee Eccles June Fairchild Barbara Leigh as Rock's jawdropping wife and the other Pretty Maids will bring eyesight to the blind. Wow! I could go on but why? If you like it you like it. If not try Von Stroheim or Bergman. I prefer Vadim. Pretty Maids All In A Row entrertained me then and it entertained me one night in August 2006.".

	schema:headline " 70's Free Love Thinking Taken To The Max";
	schema:reviewBody "This combination black comedysexploitationthriller from director Roger Vadim is undoubtedly the most provocative American movie to come out of the 70's. It starts off with Ponce our male protagonist watching as girls pass by. We are given a shot that clues us into the tone of the entire film. Vadim films two teenage girls walking from behind and then brazenly zooms in on their behinds. I was a bit shocked to see Vadim open his movie with such a blatant butt shot. That was until I recalled that this same director opened up his 1956 film And God Created Woman with a closeup shot of Brigitte Bardot's bare behind. It's undeniably sexy but some will see it as sexualizing children as these two girls in their miniskirts look awfully young. But I credit the director for nailing what it feels be like to be a male high school student surrounded by beautiful female peers through the use of brilliant POV.We then shift to an outside shot of a high school. We're given a few scenes of the students going about their daily activities. All the female students are impossibly beautiful here dressed in miniskirts high heels and low cut shirts. We are then introduced to Tiger played by Rock Hudson in one of his most offbeat roles. He plays a coachcounselor at a Southern Californian High School. Even though he is a married man he has no qualms having sex with various female students. Meanwhile a killer is leaving corpses of female students along various parts of the school. An investigation begins and Tiger is the prime suspect. In the meantime one of his students Ponce is having a tough time finding a girlfriend. Tiger is willing to give the young man some help. He enlists the help of Miss Smith played by Angie Dickinson to help Ponce along and we are talking about a VERY adult education. Pretty Maids was a mega flop on first release and it permanently damaged Vadim's career. But today it has the earmarks of a classic mostly due to three brilliant performances. First off Rock Hudson in perhaps his last great picture. Just like he was in every other picture before Pretty Maids he's the man girls want and the man boys want to be but here it's darker and more cynical version of himself than he ever let people see on the screen. John David Carson is fascinating as Ponce. He goes from awkward school boy to confident man in a series of believable sequences. It's a difficult role to play but he makes it look easy. Angie Dickinson has never been better. Angie is sexy throughout the movie playing a naive young teacher seemingly unaware of how sexy she is.The premise of this Pretty Maids is free love for all which includes teachers having sex with their students! It's shocking to look back and see how strange America was during this time of free love as the concept of this movie would be completely taboo now. American is far more puritanical today especially when it comes to the issue of teens and sex. I think the reason it still hasn't found a home on DVD is because the film takes a libertine view of adolescent sexuality far more than any other American film has. America has a hard time with this and this film could turn a lot more heads now than perhaps it did in the more permissive 70's. The basic plot premise is shocking but what REALLY grabs your attention are the literally hundreds of leering shots of female butts breasts crotches legs or a combo of the 4 all belonging to the various female high school appearing in this film. Just about every female actress playing the part of a student is sexualized in this movie. Outside of a Tinto Brass movie I can't recall any other film that lovingly showcased the female posterior by filming it in closeup again and again. As outrageous as the numerous shots of rear ends are they can't hold a candle to all the up skirt peeks director Vadim shows us. We are given scene after scene of girls in impossibly sort miniskirts bending over crossing their legs standing on elevated surfaces or just walking up the steps. Vadim finds it mandatory to show us a flash of their panties every time. Pretty Maids must have set some sort of record for pantie shots than any movie in history. Did girls in the early 70's really dress like THIS? I can't help but wonder where were there parents during the making of the film? As a man who would like to have a child someday and hopefully a little girl it's odd seeing Vadim's camera practically rams itself up the miniskirt of a young girl going through puberty. If you're a father of a teenage girl and you're reading this review you might feel guilty for enjoying the content of this movie. But you really shouldn't be. However I can't emphasize this enough The girls who appear in this film are NOT the type portrayed in movies that deal with H.S. You know 20 something actresses cast as H.S. students. The actresses playing the young girls in this movie are actually that young girls. Some will find the nonstop leering shots of girls who appear to be in the 1519 age range to cross the line of good taste. I found them VERY necessary considering they were meant to show how Ponce not to mention director Vadim views high school aged girls.I suppose a film that deals this frankly with adolescent sexuality this could be made today but only as an unreleased independent film ala Ken Park. In the 70s however this script was able to attract a whole plethora of respected actors and actresses. You'll ask yourself the whole time how a movie like this could be made in the first place! See it now.".

All the girls in this high school are centerfold wannabes disrobing and literally throwing themselves into the arms of married football stud Rock Hudson.

Hudson essentially pimps out substitute teacher Angie Dickenson to his young virginal protg while she makes her own fierce attempts at getting into Hudson's drawers. Whew! I realize this was the 70s when free love reigned but maybe the original novel gave better psychological background for all this casual bedhopping. I won't even get into the whole murder mystery angle of the story but the appearance of a serial killer in school is treated with the same shrug of indifference by the characters as their fixation on sex.

	schema:reviewBody "Pretty Maids All in a Row is based on a novel by Francis Pollini and has all the makings of a cult film. We've got a cast peppered with cult stars a story involving a sex killer and some great black humour but somehow it missed the cult film boat. The film is set in a California high school and clearly the writers decided to throw caution to the wind where any political correctness was concerned as Pretty Maids All in a Row delights in showing Rock Hudson's teacher character getting up to allsorts with his young female students. The film basically has two main plot lines. The first of which focuses on a young man named Ponce de Leon Harper. This guy is cut up because he's seventeen and hasn't lost his virginity yet and so turns to his teacher friend Michael McDrew for help. Mr McDrew decides to help Leon by hooking him up with someone only thing is he decides to hook him up with his English teacher Miss Smith! Meanwhile teenage girls are turning up dead with a note attached to their bottoms...The black humour features throughout the film and at times is subtle and at others less subtle for example we never have practise on the day of a murder! but it works really well. The cast is superb with Rock Hudson getting the main plaudits for his central performance. He's every bit the middle aged pervert and he plays the role with relish. John David Carson is less impressive as the young kid but still turns in a good performance. There are also roles for the likes of Telly Savalas Roddy McDowall and Angie Dickinson. The film remains interesting for the duration due to its range of characters and various plot lines. The film actually does handle some interesting themes too the boy losing his virginity being the main one. The sequence in which that happens is really great too! The film doesn't work at all as a mystery  it's completely clear who the murderer is right from the start  but still getting to the conclusion is a lot of fun. Overall I would have to say that this film falls somewhere short of 'great' but it's certainly very good.".

One day naive eternallyhorny student Carson rushes to the men's room to relieve himself and finds the corpse of a young girl lying in the stall with a note attached to her derrire. What ought to kick off a panic and a massive police investigation instead is treated almost as if someone dropped their ice cream in the school cafeteria! As the bodies continue to periodically pile up Hudson doesn't stop himself from canoodling with any curvaceous female student who happens to enter his office. Meanwhile Carson is flirting with substitute teacher Dickinson who thanks to Hudson's prompting believes that he has an impotency problem. Carson tries to hide his erections while Dickinson seems bent on giving him one! The bumbling local sheriff Wynn is overruled by an outranking Savalas who tries to close in on what turns out to be a serial murderer. Finally the killer is revealed though not necessarily stopped. Hudson is surprisingly convincing as the studly coach considering his real life tastes tended to sway more toward the players than the cheerleaders. Though he doesn't get naked per se he appears to have gotten in the mood for the film by going commando in his wash 'n wear dress slacks. Dickinson looks terrific in a series of skimpy skirts and in particular a negligee that shows off her famous gams. The costumer here was Roddenberry's pal from Star Trek so miniskirts and revealing clothes are the order of the day. She even has a seminude scene lying on her bed. Savalas is good as the rather nononsense police captain. In an ironic twist he Hudson and Dickinson would all be playing toprated crimestoppers on iconic TV series within just a few years of this film. Carson in his film debut is appropriately wideeyed and scared in his role. His career would mainly consist of TV guest shots and junk like Empire of the Ants. McDowall shows up in an amusing role as an oblique principal. Other actors better known from their work on Star Trek include Doohan and Campbell as police personnel. Hudson's wife is portrayed by the sultry and attractive Leigh. A bevy of pert young actresses billed as The Pretty Maids take varying amounts of their clothes off. The most widely known and one who stays mostly covered is Cameron who later gained fame as Saturday morning television's Isis. The film is a bit uneven. Sometimes the humor works sometimes not and the plot could use a little tinkering to include things like motivation and method but it's an interesting watch nonetheless. Made in the preAIDS era when love was free and the sexual revolution was underway it's a fascinating time capsule even if it isn't realistic. Crazier than anything is the fact that the MORMAN singing group The Osmonds recorded the opening song! Surely they weren't even permitted to see the finished film.".

Carson is just terrible and that's a problem cause he's the lead! His onenote performance drags the movie down. Dickinson is as good as she can be not very and Hudson tries but seems uncomfortable. McDowell Savalas and Wynn however were good. And it was fun to hear James Doohan speaking in his regular voice and not the Scottish one he uses in Star Trek.All in all a virtually forgotten moviefor good reason.

	schema:reviewBody "I am mildly fond of Pretty Maids All In a Row not because it is chock full of T and A a veritable smrgsbord of ditsy horny girls wearing those wonderful miniskirts from the early seventies but because it's a visually pleasing movie for nonprurient reasons. The review on the main page is more than adequate to give you a cinematic and historical overview of the movie kudos to krorie!. I like the movie because it somehow captures what's best about the California southland. The movie's images its cinematography show the sort of comfortable warmth that I enjoyed when I lived there almost twenty years ago.Sure it's a sex movie and whether or not it's a really stupid one is up to the viewer but the story of Rock Hudson's counselor coach humping the female student body of a California high school is deeply offensive unless you concentrate on whatever hackneyed social commentary Gene Roddenberry was trying to put forth. Wow! Now there's a choice.Stripped down to its knickers PMAIAR is the sort of stupid dirty and watchable movie that inhabited the drivein screens of this country three and a half decades ago.There's enough shock value in this movie to give you a shuddering case of the guffaws Roddenberry and director Roger Vadim must have figured that adults screwing children albeit children who look like they're in their midtwenties was the height of cinematic daring. I remember seeing this flick with a friend who kept saying This has got to be a junior college not a high school! Nope. Sorry.

	onyx:emotionText "I am mildly fond of Pretty Maids All In a Row not because it is chock full of T and A a veritable smrgsbord of ditsy horny girls wearing those wonderful miniskirts from the early seventies but because it's a visually pleasing movie for nonprurient reasons. The review on the main page is more than adequate to give you a cinematic and historical overview of the movie kudos to krorie!. I like the movie because it somehow captures what's best about the California southland. The movie's images its cinematography show the sort of comfortable warmth that I enjoyed when I lived there almost twenty years ago.Sure it's a sex movie and whether or not it's a really stupid one is up to the viewer but the story of Rock Hudson's counselor coach humping the female student body of a California high school is deeply offensive unless you concentrate on whatever hackneyed social commentary Gene Roddenberry was trying to put forth. Wow! Now there's a choice.Stripped down to its knickers PMAIAR is the sort of stupid dirty and watchable movie that inhabited the drivein screens of this country three and a half decades ago.There's enough shock value in this movie to give you a shuddering case of the guffaws Roddenberry and director Roger Vadim must have figured that adults screwing children albeit children who look like they're in their midtwenties was the height of cinematic daring. I remember seeing this flick with a friend who kept saying This has got to be a junior college not a high school! Nope. Sorry. Rock Hudson and Angie Dickinson spend much of the movie doing what would get normal mortals branded pedophile.

	schema:reviewBody "When Vivien Leigh did her version of Anna Karenina for the British cinema she had the advantage of a less stringent censorship in the UK than Greta Garbo had working for MGM in the Thirties. Garbo was hemmed in by restrictions that she had to be a wronged woman seduced and abandoned by her lover and committing suicide to also atone for her sins. Vivien plays a woman who knows precisely what she was doing and yet she chose to flout the male dominated society of 19th Century Russia. Like Garbo she is married to a pill of a husband and when a dashing young cavalry officer shows his attentions to her she falls madly in love.It's pointed out to her at least once in the film that her biggest sin is a lack of discretion. But Vivien and Kieron Moore want the whole world to know what's going on with them. Like William Randolph Hearst and Marion Davies.MGM softened the portrait of Count Vronsky in the Garbo version by making it an eagerness to get back into the military during war that causes the breakup. Here Kieron Moore is far less noble. Not a bad person but a weak one. His mother wants him to make a more advantageous marriage and not to a woman with a bad reputation even though he's the one who gave her the bad reputation.There's also a cop out scene filmed by MGM where Vronsky played by Fredric March expresses remorse over Anna in the end. No such scene exists in this more realistic version.Of course Ralph Richardson as the husband Karenin is just as big a pill as Basil Rathbone was back in 1935. A man quite full of himself in his high level job in the Czar's government he only sees how Anna's betrayal is affecting him. Richardson is almost doing a dress rehearsal for his portrayal of Dr. Sloper in next year's The Heiress.Vivien Leigh was unfairly compared to Greta Garbo back when this came out unfairly I think because there's only one Garbo. Vivien was a frail creature in life and that helped in a lot of her work. Anna was a frail creature herself unable to stand up to the hypocrisy and the pressure of the society around her.In fact Anna Karenina is a story of failure. Two people fall in love one of them trapped in a loveless marriage and attempt to flout society and they lose. Tolstoy sees all that and records it well but offers no solution. Women's liberation was off the radar in old mother Russia.".

	schema:reviewBody "First off let us concede that neither the 1935 Greta Garbo Anna Karenina nor the 1948 Vivian Leigh version comes close to capturing the complexities of Tolstoy's masterpiece. Most significantly Konstantin Levin and Kitty's relationship and more particularly Levin's protracted personal and metaphysical development are dropped entirely both screenplays preferring to treat the story as an adulterous romantic triangle with snowflakes instead of palm trees.That said what we are left with in both films are masterpieces of film craftsmanship where the triple triumphs of cinematography art direction and costume design are the real stars.Which is not in any way to lessen the contributions of the cast who in both instances make the best of what they have to work with.Garbo enchants in many of her individual scenes particularly with Freddy Bartholomew and Maureen O'Sullivan as Kitty. Who can forget her advising Kitty to seize her fleeting youth with its promise of a dream prince to emerge from the blue haze of the mountain top. Equally impressive is her muted aversion to Alexei Karenin Basil Rathbone.But she fails in her depiction of a fatal love for Count Vronsky Frederic March. Garbo with her solemn majestic and singular self possessionher Queen Christina like cerebral detachment is simply too thoughtful too deliberate to in any way convey Tolstoy's impulsive febrile and thoughtless antiheroine.True she had forsaken all for John Gilbert in Christina but that decision was the result of deep and thorough soul searching and explained with the eloquence of Solomon to her courtiers. In Camille she is by profession a lover and so her ultimate renunciation of Armand reveals the true depth of her character. But one cannot conceive of her destroying the lives of others to satisfy a whimsical infatuation.And this is where Miss Leigh's Anna trumps Garbo for Miss Leigh does successfully transmit Anna's neurasthenic and utterly reckless collapse at the feet of the dashing Count. She seems blown by forces much stronger than shea daffodil in a windstorm and light years from Garbo's deep Scandanavian imperturbability. Given the alleged similarities between Miss Leigh and Anna's disposition perhaps this is life imitating art. In any case it is why she makes a truer Anna and why the role serves as a warm up for Blanche Dubois...She is also abetted in her interpretation by the genuinely eerie recurring nightmare sequencewith the Charon like white bearded old man forever dogging her as he chinks away at the ice. An ill omen indeed ! And Miss Leigh conveys the desperation of her impending doom in every gesture and nuance.Then too Keiron Moore despite being an inferior actor to Frederic March is much more dashing and handsome as Vronskya fact which at least in terms of audience sympathy helps explain the attraction.Strangely Mr. March who had been so visually appealing as Dr. Jeckyll just a few years earlier photographs very poorly in the Garbo version and is not helped by a buzz haircut.And as superb as Cedric Gibbons sets and Adrian's costumes are as a backdrop for Garbo we feel Mr.Andrejew's art direction and Cecil Beaton's designs get the nod here as well if only perhaps in their European origin and the deep appropriately moody nineteenth century shadows with which they are lit and photographed.However as visually sumptuous cinematic recreations of a vanished aristocratic worldeach version has much to savor and should be taken in tandem.".

And Miss Leigh conveys the desperation of her impending doom in every gesture and nuance.Then too Keiron Moore despite being an inferior actor to Frederic March is much more dashing and handsome as Vronskya fact which at least in terms of audience sympathy helps explain the attraction.Strangely Mr. March who had been so visually appealing as Dr. Jeckyll just a few years earlier photographs very poorly in the Garbo version and is not helped by a buzz haircut.And as superb as Cedric Gibbons sets and Adrian's costumes are as a backdrop for Garbo we feel Mr.Andrejew's art direction and Cecil Beaton's designs get the nod here as well if only perhaps in their European origin and the deep appropriately moody nineteenth century shadows with which they are lit and photographed.However as visually sumptuous cinematic recreations of a vanished aristocratic worldeach version has much to savor and should be taken in tandem.";

	schema:headline " The best Anna";
	schema:reviewBody "It has always struck me as a pity that whenever film versions of Anna Karenina are discussed it is Greta Garbo's of 1935 that excites critical attention rather than Vivien Leigh's.  I suppose this is inevitable given that Garbo's is the more memorable performance but in all other respects I find Julien Duvivier's 1948 version the finer film.  It was the first one I saw and got to know really well so much so that when I finally caught up with the Clarence Brown film I loathed it by comparison.  It somehow epitomised the worst of MGM by being so studio bound and schmaltzy whereas Duvivier seemed to have made every effort to give his a feeling for 19th century Russian atmosphere.  Andrej Andrejew's art direction had a real period sense of style and the music score by Constant Lambert with its echoes of The Five was a world away from the Herbert Stothart syrup. But by far the biggest plus of the 1948 version is the magisterial performance by Ralph Richardson as Karanin which stands beside his other two great roles of the same period that of Dr Sloper in The Heiress and Baines the butler in The Fallen Idol.  His Karenin is not the arrogant brute of Basil Rathbone's too close to his Murdstone in David Copperfield made in the same year but a deceived husband evoking pity through his inability to be loved.  Even Kieron Moore's rather colourless Vronsky scores over Frederic March's as it suggests the character's innate weakness rather than his romantic dash.  If the Duvivier film has a serious flaw it is the rather prissy upper class delivery of dialogue by the female characters.  Even Vivien Leigh's Anna suffers from this.  I have a theory that the fault may lie in Duvivier as I have noticed repeatedly how directors whose native language is not English fail to control the nuances of speech when directing an English language film.  Antonioni's Blow Up and the dialogue of Harvey Keitel in Angelopoulos's Ulysses Gaze are examples.  Interestingly the version recently shown on the British Carlton Films TV channel restored an additional 15 minutes to the version I had previously known mainly early scenes that established minor characters with greater clarity.  However the most significant restoration was a closing shot held considerably longer thus giving that additional weight to the final tragedy that a really thoughtful director of Duvivier's calibre must have originally intended.".

What we end up sad to say is a firstrate melodrama without the psychological subtleties of the book. But that's the bad news. On the plus side we have the sort of lavish the sky'sthelimit big big bigger budget production that only the Hungarian Alex Korda could have produced a few years after the world war on the sound stages of London sets by the Russian Andreiev costumes by the English Cecil Beaton deepfocus photography and lighting by the French Henri Alekan Belle et Bete and music by the English composer Constant Lambert. Technically this film contains some of the best BW work ever done in Britian. Perhaps the greatest fault of the film is in the style of the acting. Vivian Leigh is a great beauty very aristocratic very British in her reserve but when she falls in love with Vronsky she seems constitutionally incapable of the unbridled passion that Garbo brings to the role. Ralph Richardson however is perfect far superior to Basil Rathbone. Richardson displays all the rigidity of Anna's husband his enormous pride and wounded vanity his total incapacity to understand his wife's heart. Needless to say Kieron Moore as Vronsky tries very hard looks wonderful in costumes but he seems more a WestEnd juvenile than the great aristocrat and officer that Tolstoy depicts. Laurence Olivier would have been a perfect Vronsky. Why Korda chose not to cast him beside his wife is a mystery.".

	schema:headline " Aristocratic life in nineteenth century Europe";
	schema:reviewBody "Tolstoy's great classic runs to about 1000 pages mostly providing a wealth of social commentary on upper class life in Imperial Russia in the nineteenth century. For nonRussian readers today to adequately follow this requires either a significantly longer book or more realistically the mass of explanatory footnotes which some editions provide but few readers ever look at. No film running for about two hours can begin to do justice to such a work the 26 films listed by IMDb mostly concentrate on the tragic love affair and death of Anna herself. Literary critics tend to view the concurrent story of Levin who is thought to be a partly autobiographical creation by Tolstoy himself and Kitty as of least comparable significance but this receives little attention in most of these films. Social commentary largely disappears except where created visually in banquet or ballroom scenes.Readers of the book develop definite images of the important characters so each version of the film generates comments that some characters were perfectly played whilst others were failures. In most cases such comments reflect preconceptions of the viewers and tend to cancel each out. Although readers of the book may be the most prolific critics filmmakers have recognised that the commercial success of their film will depend upon the drama associated with Anna's grand passion rather than any of the other material in the novel.SPOILER AHEAD There are two main threads in the book  Anna and dashing Count Vronsky a suitor of her friend Kitty Scherbatsky unexpectedly fall in love. Anna seeks divorce but her rigid and upright husband will not play. She leaves him as well as her son who still needs her love and support to live with Vronsky but becomes a social outcast who is very lonely. When she fears she is losing Vronsky's love she commits suicide. Meanwhile Kitty's other suitor Levin steps in and marries her he is a somewhat introspective farmer haunted by his past and struggling with his religious convictions she is a wise loving wife who gives him necessary support. A third but slighter thread in the book is the story of Anna's philandering brother Stefan and his wife Dolly. Reduced to these few lines the book sounds like a lurid paperback with paper thin characters this is of course nonsense but indicates the difficulty of doing justice to a major classic novel within the confines of a conventional movie.Among the 26 film versions mentioned above three are particularly significant. The first was directed by Clarence Brown in 1935 with Greta Garbo and Basil Rathbone in the parts of Karenina and Karenin. A U.K. film directed by Julien Duvivier and released in 1948 featured Ralph Richardson and Vivien Leigh as Karenin and his wife. More recently Warner has made a colour version filmed in Moscow and St. Petersburg with Sophia Morceau playing Anna. All these run for a little under two hours. There have also been two miniseries versions originally produced for British TV in 1997 and 2000. these have both been featured on PBS in the U.S.A. and are now available as DVD's. They clearly have more time to show some of the complexity of the original novel but as with the actual book a viewer is unlikely to watch either of them in a single session the 1997 version contains ten 50 minute sections. It would be unfair to compare them with the much shorter bigscreen versions. Most North Americans regard the Greta Garbo version as the definitive one but I have chosen to comment on that of Vivien Leigh because I feel Greta Garbo played Anna as too strong a character so that the unfolding events were a little unbelievable one IMDb User has commented that GG was at her best when Anna was at her weakest. Vivien Leigh's performance shows some vulnerability in Anna's strong facade right from the start and makes the unfolding story more credible. I also feel Ralph Richardson gave a more sympathetic performance as Karinin and is more credible as a husband who is to be pitied because his difficulty in showing love eventually leads to an inability to receive it.Ultimately the main conclusion one must draw after watching either one or multiple versions of this film is that the original novel is too vast and complex to show adequately on the screen. However there is one other conclusion which I feel should be noted. For me the visual appeal of the cinema made this film version very effective in drawing attention to the largely undocumented unity that existed in postNapoleonic Europe through the intermarriage not only of royalty but also of most of the aristocracy. It may not have spread down to ordinary citizens but it was the aristocracy that provided the ruling classes and they tended to be on first name terms with their opposite numbers in most other European countries. This must have had an immense influence on all the political decisions made during this period and the effect of World War I in destroying the influence and power of the historical ruling classes must have resulted in a great deal of fragmentation. Post World War 2 history has involved the recreation of this feeling of European unity but at a much more fundamental and democratic level. I never experienced this impression from reading Tolstoy's novel but it became clear during the film through banquet and ballroom sequences in which the characters who would all have been speaking French were sophisticated cosmopolitan figures clearly wearing the latest in international fashions and deeply concerned about events far from their own country. One may lose a great deal condensing a book into a 2 hour film but it may also provide an opportunity to bring out indirect aspects of the book that are of considerable historic interest.".

	schema:reviewBody "Count Tolstoy's massive novels War and Peace and Anna Karenina are personally quite challenging.Here are breathtakingly crafted literary works in a spiritual context of unconstructive energy.  It's quite easy to become as entranced within these worlds as are many music lovers within the skewed terrain of Wagner's Valhalla and Nibelungens. Tolstoy's words pull in the reader almost hypnotically as he spins his titanic subtle tales of societal mores conflicting with human emotions. Many of his characters are selfabsorbed and vain and his social environments repressive and stolid with false values that tragically dehumanize and destroy. So it's an ultimate challenge to attempt to separate these energetic downers from their dazzling technical counterparts.In the case of Anna after stripping away the polished veneer I find characters trying to cope with their testy emotional choices while being thwarted by inhuman societal standards. Yet Anna is a favorite of filmmakers having been done countless times with the GarboSelznick version the most notable.  Here Vivien Leigh gives a creditable performance of this distraught heroine with Director Julien Duvivier joining Jean Anuith in script adaptation. Ralph Richardson and Kieron Moore are both completely substantial and general production values are attended to with solid professionalism.Alas the enactment seldom tugs heartstrings and in fact a strangely turgid pall seems to hang over the entire production. Condensing a 900page novel down to 2hour running time doesn't help matters.As for Leigh my feeling is that she gravitated too often to fallen woman roles.  While she portrayed them very well they may have failed to bring her the uplift her personality seemed to desperately seek. Hers was pretty much a career of depressingly joyless female characters which perhaps worked not to her personal advantage. That's another matter though Leigh was forever the consummate fine actress and her legacy is one of great artistic achievement.This version of Anna Karenina remains a thoughtful worthy attempt at a nearimpossible task.".

	schema:headline " Worthy but I do prefer Garbo's";
	schema:reviewBody "Greta Garbo's 1935 film is not perfect. As much as I like Fredric March in most filmsprimarily Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde I found him ill suited for Vronsky. However it was visually stunning with a heartrending suicide scene as well as superb performances from Garbo and Basil Rathbone. This 1948 film starring Vivien Leigh this time is worthy but I do prefer Garbo's personally. As with any film adaptation of the book the film does deserve credit for compressing a long book into a just over 130 minute film. While there are scenes that are inevitably not as powerful it does do credibly and perhaps adaptationwise it is a little superior to Garbo's film. However the screenplay while literate and thoughtful in some parts is also rather thin to sustain the story in others. Consequently the film does feel overlong and there are times also where it feels turgid pacingwise. And as much as I hate to say it as handsome as Kieron Moore is I found him as Vronsky miscast he is too dull and the conviction of drama is lost for my liking. There is still much to like though. It is sumptuously filmed with ornate settings and costumes and the score is of poignant delicacy. It is beautifully directed by Julien Duvivier and apart from Moore I thought the cast were fine. It was lovely to see Sally Ann Howes Martita Hunt and Michael Gough and Vivien Leigh as ever gives a dazzlingly beautiful performance in the title role but the acting honours go to Ralph Richardson whose Karenin is authoritative and superbly unbending. In conclusion a worthy film adaptation. 710 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "I admit I am not too fond of romances in general as I find them incredibly silly and unrealistic at times this being not too great of an exception but still an exception.The main reason I watched the movie was because I had been learned briefly about Tolstoy in school and seeing that the movie was based on one of his books I desired to watch it purely out of curiosity.It is possible that the movie as is often the case didn't do the book any justice. The movie begins off in a rather confusing way and takes a while to understand. I couldn't help feeling that some great detail was lacking.Anyway now that I am done with mulling over the details involving the direction and the way the film comes across I'll go to discussing the plot.I know we were supposed to hate Anna's husband Alexei but I felt nothing but pity for him. Here is his wife of several years leaving him for a brash youth based entirely on him being too cold. He did in truth love his wife though he was a little selfrighteous. How could we however blame him? He could not help his personality and if perhaps Anna had been a better judge of character she could have seen that the marriage would end in tragedy.Another reason not to hate Alexei we see a softer side of him when his wife falls ill after giving birth to a stillborn child. Speaking of which why didn't we know she was pregnant before then? I doubt we can blame Tolstoy whose story was doubtless welldetailed as much as we can blame the director and scriptwriter. Oh well at least we actually find out.Count Vronsky like many men of his kind in romance stories I found unbearably annoying most of the time. He followed Anna around like a lovesick puppy. If he had had any love or respect for her at all he would have had the decency to leave her be when she so politely requested him to. Nevertheless he treats her with kindness and warmth despite her attitudes toward him later in the story.Finally we come to our tragic Anna. I for one was fairly shocked when after begging her husband's forgiveness for her initial tirade concerning Count Vronsky that she runs off leaving the son who she begged him not to take away in the divorce that Alexei originally planned to have.One unique problem I always have for stories like these are the distortion of love within them. Count Vronsky didn't love Anna enough to respect her initial requests for friendship instead of romantic love. Anna didn't love Count Vronsky enough to trust him. Anna also did not love her son enough to stay in a perhaps unhappy though stable marriage to stay with him. She ran away from him at the first chance she got to be with Count Vronsky then accuses Alexei of being cruel by forbidding her to see him. Anna understands this later that she traded her son for her lover but as she said It is too late. So who is to blame for Anna's untimely demise? Was it Count Vronsky for snaring her in his web of love? Was it the cruelty of her husband for denying her a divorce even after she left him and we was to originally divorce her anyway after seeing she was taken with Count Vronsky? Was it the fault of the friends and society who shunned her for living in adultery? Or was it Anna's own foolishness? Either way somehow in the end despite all of her mistakes and flaws I felt pity for her. Seeing her body lying on the train tracks in the snowy night filled me with sadness. In the end even though she had sacrificed everything she had for love of another she was too consumed by her own guilt over her life to be able to receive the love from that person in return a mistake that I can sadly relate to.So thus despite the flaws I had to be a little bit more generous to this film that I had originally planned. I would like to also read Tolstoy's book and see how it compares to this version of the movie as I said again a movie often doesn't do a book justice and the saying a picture is worth a thousand words can be sadly flawed.Additionally Vivien Leigh's acting was amazing. I could watch the movie again just to see her performances.".

The earliest are the silent films of 19141918 the more famous being the MGM 1935 film starring Greta Garbo several versions in the 50's 60's and 70's and recent BBC productions from 2000. French director Julien Duvivier's version stars Vivien Leigh forever remembered for portraying Scarlett O'Hara in 1939's Gone With The Wind in the title role British star Ralph Richardson as her dishonored husband Alexei Kieron Moore as Anna's lover Count Vronsky Sally Anne Howes as Kitty and Nial McGinis as Konstantin Levin who despite being a significant character in the Tolstoy novel gets no more than two appearances in the film  the party scene in which he is rejected by Kitty who is drawn to the dashing Vronsky and the latter country scene in which Kitty finally accepts to be his bride. The emphasis of the film is Anna's tragic situation. She has turned her back on her husband by engaging in a passionate affair broken all society rules in doing it so indiscreetly and publicly and suffers the consequences. Her husband staunch Catholic more interested in appearances and society approval as well as business interests won't grant her a divorce and won't grant her the right to see her son. Vivian Leigh from the beginning when she arrives to remedy Stefan and Dolly's marriage paints a tragic incredibly sad and pathetic figure looking morosely out of a frosttainted train window. She lives the role of Anna without chewing up any scenes and delivering the most real Anna prior to the more recent adaptations. Her mental breakdown spurred by insecurities that her lover will leave her and reject her as all society has done is haunting and saddening to watch on screen so that the moment of her death approaches heralded by the ominous figure of a train worker hammering away is climatic enough to provoke horror or sympathy. This being the 40's the Hays Code permits only kissing scenes between the lovers but this film opts to show Anna's gruesome death with no hold bars. Because a faithful transition from novel to film is quite impossible this Hollywood jewel doesn't convey every aspect of the novel especially not the relationship between Kitty and Levin and though long and talky doesn't begin to fully capture the spirit of the book. Nonetheless for me it's the best film version in blackandwhite. The cinematography is so exquisite with its depiction of Imperial Russia and its grand salons palaces train stations opera houses and the costumes by Cecil Beaton so gorgeous that one wishes the film were made in Technicolor instead!! It is faithful to the more intimate parts of the novel not only in the tidbits of Alexei's habit of cracking his knuckles and his treatment of Anna but Anna's black gown at a ball. The characters are full of nuance particularly Anna's high society women's group especially one cynical gossipy Countess who is not afraid to admit she'd enjoy Roman gladiators spilling blood. Ralph Richardson is doing a superior job as Alexei making him appear coldly indifferent to his wife even before she falls for Vronsky and then later portraying him as a selfinterested society man. Unfortunately Kieron Moore does nothing truly wonderful in the part of Vronsky which is a pity because Vronsky and Anna must possess a powerful fiery and consuming sacrificial affair that costs them everything. Unfortunately this film was not received well in its time possibly overshadowed by Greta Garbo's version but it's genuinely moving and highly recommended to English classes who study the novel.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've now watched 6 Anna Kareninas 1935 1947 1961 1985 1997 and 2012 and this is up there as one of the top ones. Vivien Leigh is perfectly cast as Anna Karenina. There's just something about Leigh that suggests strength but also fragility primness but also sensuality. She is totally believable as a sensible woman who would go silly over an affair and believable as a fertile motherly type frequently surrounded by children.The object of the affair is the film's weak link and it's a big one. Keiron Moore as the dashing Count Vronsky seems about as worldly as Anna's little son Sergei. You can sense Vivien Leigh trying to coax him into displaying some sort of dominant passion but Moore is hopelessly lost. His natural accent is Irish I think his English accent sounds hopelessly strangled.Ralph Richardson as Anna's bureaucratic husband Karenin is a bit too strong. He has the dominance that Vronsky should have and he displays his love for Anna too clearly. Anna is partly driven to her affair by Karenin's coldness so it makes the affair less credible. Their relationship is too loving it often seems that there will be a reconciliation as Leigh clearly has more chemistry with him than Moore.Onto the supporting actors now. The KittyLevin story although very pared down is sweet and touching. Yes they miss out all of Levin's philosophy and farming but Sally Ann Howes is adorable as Princess Kitty who gentleman farmer Levin hopelessly loves. It is also neatly tied together with the Anna story when Karenin goes along to their wedding without Anna.The film might seem a little dated but I enjoyed the focus on Karenin. There's a comic scene where Karenin goes along to a solicitors to ask about divorce and the solicitor seems a little voyeuristic. Where do I place it in the six AK films? I'm tempted to put it at number 2 just behind the Garbo one.".

	schema:headline " Viven Leigh shines";
	schema:reviewBody "Rumor had it that Vivien Leigh was not anxious to take on the remake of Anna Karenina partly because she had just recovered from tuberculosis and maybe also because the ghost of Greta Garbo was too real. But she had one film left to do for Alexander Korda and this was it. Anna Karenina released in 1948 stars Leigh as the tragic Anna. The story is based on Tolstoy's novel. Anna meets a handsome colonel Count Vronsky Kieron Moore and falls in love with him. The trouble is she is married to a highlevel Russian bureaucrat Ralph Richardson and has a son. Anna's husband is a selfabsorbed politician type somewhat cold and aloof consumed with his image in Russian politics. He sees marriage as a duty something he says a few times. Anna runs away with Vronksy a horrendous scandal at the time and probably still would be today. It all ends tragically. Comparisons between this film and the 1935 one are inevitable. While both films are respectable I prefer Viven Leigh's performance of Anna. Perhaps it was because Leigh had her own personal demons that she made this part so amazingly real as she would in A Streetcar named Desire three years later. While I admire Garbo I did not think of her as a great actress. Too aloof in some ways to believe she would fall head over heels for Vronsky. Ralph Richardson plays his part with consummate discipline he can only see Anna's betrayal in terms of how it effects him. Kieron Moore is harder to judge. In the first part of the movie he isn't given much to do except show off his good looks. He does however get a few good scenes as the movie progresses and plays Vronksy as a decent man but also a flawed one. If you only know the 1935 version of this film at least be openminded enough to give this remake a chance. For me Viven Leigh was reason enough for me to see it.".

Anna meets a handsome colonel Count Vronsky Kieron Moore and falls in love with him. The trouble is she is married to a highlevel Russian bureaucrat Ralph Richardson and has a son. Anna's husband is a selfabsorbed politician type somewhat cold and aloof consumed with his image in Russian politics. He sees marriage as a duty something he says a few times. Anna runs away with Vronksy a horrendous scandal at the time and probably still would be today. It all ends tragically. Comparisons between this film and the 1935 one are inevitable. While both films are respectable I prefer Viven Leigh's performance of Anna. Perhaps it was because Leigh had her own personal demons that she made this part so amazingly real as she would in A Streetcar named Desire three years later. While I admire Garbo I did not think of her as a great actress. Too aloof in some ways to believe she would fall head over heels for Vronsky. Ralph Richardson plays his part with consummate discipline he can only see Anna's betrayal in terms of how it effects him. Kieron Moore is harder to judge. In the first part of the movie he isn't given much to do except show off his good looks. He does however get a few good scenes as the movie progresses and plays Vronksy as a decent man but also a flawed one. If you only know the 1935 version of this film at least be openminded enough to give this remake a chance. For me Viven Leigh was reason enough for me to see it.";

The best thing about this version for me is Ralph Richardson who gives a magnificent multilayered performance. Definitely the strongest in the movie. In some scenes Vivien Leigh who had been quite ill doesn't always look well. She does a good job but unlike the great Richardson she was not directorproof. Duvivier could have given her a little more guidance. Kieron Moore's Vronsky didn't seem like someone to give up your entire world for but after being in such a controlling marriage his gentler nature might have been just the ticket for Anna.The costumes are glorious as are the other production values.

During the early part of the film we are introduced to a confusing array of characters families titles and relationships that are all but impossible to absorb if one hasn't read the book. But later on when the plot is more clear to the viewer the interest level doesn't rise a great deal. This story of forbidden love and infidelity is curiously passionless and uninvolving. Leigh Richardson and Keiron Moore all perform well enough but not memorably. I found the most captivating actor on screen to be Sally Ann Howes in her brief appearances as Anna's friend Kitty.

The best performance though was Ralph Richardson's. His Alexis Karenin shows an ambitious man who was considered part of the elite and well positioned in Russia's higher echelons of government. He was part of the rich classes who finds himself made a cuckold by his beautiful wife. Alexei could not afford the ridicule the situation was causing him.

Mr. Moore was not quite up the the task of being the man who made Anna renounce to everything to become his lover.The emphasis in this version is Karenin as the cheated husband not on Vronsky as presented on the first one. Thus Ralph Richardson was able to show why he was one of the best actors of England of all times as he clearly demonstrates here. The supporting cast is interesting with a lot of familiar theater actors showing their best in minor roles.

	schema:reviewBody "If you're ever tempted to write a classic novel one that's bound to be bound in buckram with gilt lettering designed to last forever and forced on college literature students you can't go too wrong with this simple plot A beautiful but impetuous woman marries a reliable but somewhat dull man usually older or bitter falls for a dashing and virile younger fellow and the affair ends in catastrophe. I mention in passing only the examples of Madam Bovary Lady Chatterly's Lover and Anna Karenina. Half a dozen others escape me at the moment. See David Lean's Ryan's Daughter or The Eye of the Needle for popular cinematic examples.It's been years since I read the novel so I can't say how closely the movie sticks to the original story. Probably as happens in most cases the essence of the story is extracted by a reduction of the broth. Subplots disappear. Character touches are elided. Back stories are dropped.

Hallucinating to beat the band at the station she throws herself in front of a departing train. But this being an adult movie she's not entirely innocent. She's dealt out some pretty brutal blows to her husband and some of her acquaintances. It's the kind of ambiguity that makes it an interesting tale instead of another afternoon TV drama.Yes.

	onyx:emotionText "If you're ever tempted to write a classic novel one that's bound to be bound in buckram with gilt lettering designed to last forever and forced on college literature students you can't go too wrong with this simple plot A beautiful but impetuous woman marries a reliable but somewhat dull man usually older or bitter falls for a dashing and virile younger fellow and the affair ends in catastrophe. I mention in passing only the examples of Madam Bovary Lady Chatterly's Lover and Anna Karenina. Half a dozen others escape me at the moment. See David Lean's Ryan's Daughter or The Eye of the Needle for popular cinematic examples.It's been years since I read the novel so I can't say how closely the movie sticks to the original story. Probably as happens in most cases the essence of the story is extracted by a reduction of the broth. Subplots disappear. Character touches are elided. Back stories are dropped. Elaborate descriptions of location are eschewed. Any philosophical glosses are avoided like so many venomous snakes.

It is a case of physical attraction gone awry and is Tolstoy's commentary on the bored and vain aristocratic society of Russia of the period which places more import on melodramatic social matters and gossip than on the significant matters of government law and justice.In fact the only character of note involved in any truly important matters is Anna's betrayed husband who constantly battles with his feelings of loss and revenge and does an admirable job of such. Anna and her lover are content to pursue their attraction until it leads to distrust and tragedy. Tolstoy's message is here but not easily discerned and there's plenty of fodder to create what is basically a 'True Romance' novella in film form popular with young women of the time.In this case reading the novel would be suggested and let the weepy sentimentalists have their moment with this routine feature. It is doubtful that many of them will recognize the significant similarities between the aristocrats of precommunist Russia and today's youth who worry about celebrity status yet cannot tell you who lies in Grant's Tomb nor when the War of 1812 took place.".

In the last 56 years in Italy temporary job laws were introduced and had a devastating effect on society especially on younger generations.Finally a movie with heart about temporary workers very well written and directed. You will be taken through the odyssey of Marta a young graduate in philosophy who cannot find any job related to her studies so to keep herself alive she has to take a temporary job as a telephonemarketer.While in the process of descending this inferno she will get in touch with a wide spectrum of persons and situations that will keep you interested in the story.The writerdirector does a very good job in building the story you will really care for all the characters even the two villains who by the end of the movie show their human side.My only remark to the script is when Marta engages in a totally gratuitous sex act that is very clich and the fact that the story does not really tackle with all the problems that a temporary worker has to face in Italy mainly the inability to get any mortgage to buy a house or the mandatory periods of time when the worker is left home without pay and then hired again later through a different mediating agency which is the standard workaround to avoid the rather feeble restrictions imposed by the law.Overall this is a great movie that I recommend it is an universal story about the dehumanization of people that every viewer in the western world will feel connected to.

The film has intent to examine the plight of permanenttemporary workers you know those who are under temporary contracts but have to perform tasks and take on responsibilities just as how a regular staff would but minus the staff perks. I suppose companies take this approach with an eye wary on their bottom line and sees this staffing strategy as something that's cost effective virtually eliminating benefits from the payroll. The film might have been effective with the introduction of unionist Giorgio Valeno Mastandrea who tries to understand the plight and conditions in the fictitious company Multiple manufacturing who knows what product but somehow lost its mission objectives midway because of a complication in matters of the heart thereby relegating its own subplot.This film is about the surreal journey of Marta as she tries her best to seek out a job believing that her academic qualifications would open door. Contrary to her beliefs of course Fate comes into play to introduce her to a single mom Sonia Micaela Romazzotti who works as a telemarketer for Multiple and recruits her into this really strange company with a very wide malefemale division of the sexes and feelgood rara practices such as singing motivational songs at the start of each shift and the receiving of cosmetic encouraging SMSes in the morning everyday.In other words they operate much like a cult group where performers get rewarded with dubious prizes and laggards in the company get shipped out unceremoniously with little dignity. Such is the sweat shop that Marta finds herself in if not for her intellectual ability in internalizing the process in double quick time and innovating in her job so as to perform with moderate inputs. For those who have worked in companies or amongst peers who require you to jump sing shout dance out loud in celebration of your employment or to serve as a mental prep booster before you commence each day this film would definitely ring a bell.And while the narrative might seem all over the place it is precisely how director Paolo Virzi coaxes a coherent and at times zany story out of the multiple events and myriad of characters. There's Daniela Sabrina Ferilli the floor supervisor who's a control freak and harbours the hots for CEO Claudio Massimo Ghini who on the surface is the typical all caring boss with a finger on the company's pulse. Then there's the romantic knot that Marta inadvertently gets herself into and fellow sales partner Lucio 2 Elio Germano who preps himself almost all the time to think that he's the best of the best.Throw in plenty of song and dance selfreflection moments gratuitous sex and nudity changing relationships and you have a film that tries too hard to cover a wide spectrum of ideas but end up missing the bullseye more often than not. The film has its moments but nothing too memorable besides those song and dance numbers that make the Beach Boys and some folk songs hip again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Little prepares Marta a recent graduate student looking for a meaningful job in Rome for her encounter in the Metro with Lara a young girl with glasses that stands next to her and hands her one of those pieces of paper from an ad for a roommate. Imagine her surprise when she goes to find out the room that was being offered in Sonia's apartment. Sonia also happens to be Lara's mother. As the price is negotiated Sonia asks for help with Lara who is about five but with a mind of a much older person.Sonia is instrumental in taking Marta to the place where she works part time as a telemarketer. The company employs a large number of young women whose job is to call unsuspecting households specially women to offer a number of useless products. Marta's job is to convince the person whom she talks to make an appointment for an expert to visit them who will try to sell them all kinds of home worthless improvement products a clear profit for the company.In the process of getting proficient in marketing Marta keeps working on her own work which consists in writing essays about subjects that interest her hoping to sell them to different publications. Daniela is in charge of the women. All the shifts start with a sort of choreography which serve as a sort of pep talk for the group. Marta soon realizes not everything is legitimate in the company. As a way to help her establish a point of contact Marta looks the location of the home of the person she is trying to sell a service by looking it up on line. She makes an impression on an older and lonely woman Signora Franca whose daughter has died not too long ago. This lady keeps calling her back at odd times just to talk.There is an interest to organize the labor by Giorgio a union representative that wants to point out how the women are mistreated and abused. Daniela likes to pretend she is the love interest of Claudio the president of the company when he really has no intention of ever marrying her. In fact one night Daniela shows she might be a lesbian in the closet when she invites Marta to her place with the excuse of a small party but it is only the young woman she is interested in entertaining and perhaps seducing.Paolo Virzi gives this film a quick pace that at times makes the viewer dizzy in a fun way because the action never lets up. Supposedly the original material was a novel by Michela Murgia and Mr. Virzi wrote the adaptation with Francesco Bruni. First of all the film takes a serious look at the world of telemarketing in a satirical way that works well within the story. These pesky women on the other side of the phone call one receive are well trained to sell whatever the companies they represent is peddling. The company in the film is the Italian branch of an American concern with all its catchy ways to motivate their workers. Isabella Ragonese surprises with her take on Marta. In fact she is one of the main reasons for watching the film.

	onyx:emotionText "Little prepares Marta a recent graduate student looking for a meaningful job in Rome for her encounter in the Metro with Lara a young girl with glasses that stands next to her and hands her one of those pieces of paper from an ad for a roommate. Imagine her surprise when she goes to find out the room that was being offered in Sonia's apartment. Sonia also happens to be Lara's mother. As the price is negotiated Sonia asks for help with Lara who is about five but with a mind of a much older person.Sonia is instrumental in taking Marta to the place where she works part time as a telemarketer. The company employs a large number of young women whose job is to call unsuspecting households specially women to offer a number of useless products. Marta's job is to convince the person whom she talks to make an appointment for an expert to visit them who will try to sell them all kinds of home worthless improvement products a clear profit for the company.In the process of getting proficient in marketing Marta keeps working on her own work which consists in writing essays about subjects that interest her hoping to sell them to different publications. Daniela is in charge of the women. All the shifts start with a sort of choreography which serve as a sort of pep talk for the group. Marta soon realizes not everything is legitimate in the company. As a way to help her establish a point of contact Marta looks the location of the home of the person she is trying to sell a service by looking it up on line. She makes an impression on an older and lonely woman Signora Franca whose daughter has died not too long ago. This lady keeps calling her back at odd times just to talk.There is an interest to organize the labor by Giorgio a union representative that wants to point out how the women are mistreated and abused. Daniela likes to pretend she is the love interest of Claudio the president of the company when he really has no intention of ever marrying her. In fact one night Daniela shows she might be a lesbian in the closet when she invites Marta to her place with the excuse of a small party but it is only the young woman she is interested in entertaining and perhaps seducing.Paolo Virzi gives this film a quick pace that at times makes the viewer dizzy in a fun way because the action never lets up. Supposedly the original material was a novel by Michela Murgia and Mr. Virzi wrote the adaptation with Francesco Bruni. First of all the film takes a serious look at the world of telemarketing in a satirical way that works well within the story. These pesky women on the other side of the phone call one receive are well trained to sell whatever the companies they represent is peddling. The company in the film is the Italian branch of an American concern with all its catchy ways to motivate their workers. Isabella Ragonese surprises with her take on Marta. In fact she is one of the main reasons for watching the film. Marta has no experience in what she does but she learns to be the best until she realizes there is something rotten at the core of the company. Sabrina Ferilli makes a wonderful Daniela the bitchy woman that wants more production from the women under her. Micaela Ramazzotti plays Sonia with panache showing her charms with generosity for she is a free spirit. Others in supporting roles are Valerio Mastandrea Elio Germano and Massimo Ghini.

On Earth an investigation team finds the last of the Victorian crew  a now aged Arnold Bedford and he tells them the story of how he and his girlfriend Katherine Callender meet up with an inventor Joseph Cavor in 1899. Cavor has invented Cavorite a paste that will allow anything to deflect gravity and he created a sphere that will actually take them to the moon. Taking Arnold and accidentally taking Katherine they fly to the moon where to their total amazement they discover a beelike insect population who take an unhealthy interest in their Earthly visitors...";

	schema:reviewBody "Someone who had read H. G. Wells' First Men in the Moon and then sat down to watch this adaptation may well be aghast at the opening sequences which deal with a modernday mission to the moon as opposed to the 1899 setting of the novel.  But stay with it and you'll find that the contemporary setting is just a framework to introduce us to the story basically as Wells wrote it a fantasy about a trip to the moon in the Victorian era.So why did the filmmakers choose to frame the story in this flashback format?  Simple.  At the time Wells wrote his novel the very idea of a trip to the moon was fantastical heavierthanair flight hadn't even been invented yet let alone space travel.  But by the time the movie was made in the '60s we were on our way to the moon JFK having stated it as an objective.  While still a gripping exciting idea a trip to the moon was no longer a fantasy but a hardwarebased reality.  In fact the modern spacecraft depicted are very much like what ultimately made the trip in 1969 an orbiting command module and a spiderylegged landing unit not the old saucercraft or deltawinged ships of the '50s.  So while dated these opening scenes aren't foolish.  And the international crew on boardsince it's a mission of the UN not just the USAreflect today's reality of the International Space Station reality has finally caught up with this fiction.So how to make what was becoming a hereandnow reality in 1964 the Gemini missions were beginning paving the way for the Apollo program back into a magical fantasy?  By having the modern explorers discover evidence that their first lunar landing had been predated by a trip in 1899!  One of the voyagers Bedford Edward Judd is found to be still alive and very old at the time of the contemporary mission and his tale is told in flashback a structure much like that of Little Big Man or Titanic.Some other changes are made as well.  The long trip to the moon reads well in the book but if filmed as described the two men float in darkness and silence inside the sphere as the unsecured baggage gradually gravitates to the center of the room it would have made incredibly boring viewing so the scripter adds a few vignettes to lighten the journey.  The riot of plant life that erupts across the lunar surface at sunrise would have elicited hoots from a modern audience and so is eliminated on screen yet the just as unscientific touch of having the men cavort around the surface in diving suits which would have swelled up like balloons in the vacuum of space to say nothing of the men's exposed hands clearly signal that this is after all a fantasy and not true science fiction.  And Cavor's audiences with the Grand Lunar which take place in the book after Bedford has returned to earth are reduced in the movie to a single hearing which happens while Bedford and his girl keep reading are still on the moon rather than just hear it described we see it happen which is of course a much more cinematic handling.While Bedford and Cavor make a stag trip in the novel the movie adds a woman Kate Callender Martha Hyer Bedford's fiancee.  Her inclusion isn't gratuitous by being in places on the moon where Bedford and Cavor aren't she helps the story cover more ground in less time than otherwise would have been the case.  Besides she's the sort of woman whom Wells a feminist and selfdescribed free thinker would have liked she's tough smart brave and doesn't put up with much.  She's the epitome of the new woman of that turnofthecentury era the sort of restless woman who was learning such manly things as how to operate a newfangled typewriting machine so she could get a job in an office.  As an American in Britain she's a bit of a traveler herself she symbolizes Britain's exploratory empirebuilding new worldseeking colonizing impulses indeed upon arrival Cavor claims the moon for Her Majesty and she's the only person involved in the mission who has enough sense to bring a gun.While all the performances are equal to the task especially Lionel Jeffries' comically highstrung Cavor plus a onescene appearance by the impish Miles Malleson as a city clerk this isn't an actors' picture but an effects picture.  And Ray Harryhausen delivers as he always does.  The Grand Lunar in particular is a haunting whispery presence curiously but coolly regarding these human intruders and weighing their fates.  Even the music works Laurie Johnson's score evocative of an awed sense of wonder married to a towering adventure is worthy of Bernard Hermann.You may have guessed this is an old favorite of mine.  I saw it as a child when it was new.  It hasn't aged a day.".

	schema:reviewBody "The heart and spirit of H. G. Wells's novel remains intact in this Ray HarryhausenNathan Juran vehicle.  A 20th century frame story about American led international crew landing on moon and finding an old Union Jack flag and a letter giving rights to the moon to Queen Victoria in 1899 add a brilliant touch to this story about a professor and his two neighbors exploring space and landing on the moon.  The scientific explanation for space travel is absurd as are many other plot contrivances but the story is a fun entertaining romp about what exploration use to be like when man relied less on machines and more on brains.  Director Juran and Harrysausen have created a film with many funny moments beautiful moon landscapes and even some thoughtprovoking questions about human nature and what humans are all about.  Although this is not like any other Harryhausen picture  really only one large cumbersome rather mundane creature Harryhausen really evokes awe as he creates a total vision of what a society might look like underneath the surface of the moon.  The moon is a startling set and impressive.  Laurie JohnsonAvenger's Theme adds her brilliant touch and creates some beautiful music for the film.  But when is all said and done  for me  the brightest star in this galactic romp is Lionel Jeffries as Professor Cavour.  Jeffries lights up every scene he is in.  His ability to use humor in every reflex and word make him a joy to behold. Does he overact?  Perhaps.  But in the same way that Vincent Price did.  He steal his scenes and this picture.  Edward Judd does nicely in his role as does Martha Hyer who is beautiful as well.".

Although this is not like any other Harryhausen picture  really only one large cumbersome rather mundane creature Harryhausen really evokes awe as he creates a total vision of what a society might look like underneath the surface of the moon.  The moon is a startling set and impressive.  Laurie JohnsonAvenger's Theme adds her brilliant touch and creates some beautiful music for the film.  But when is all said and done  for me  the brightest star in this galactic romp is Lionel Jeffries as Professor Cavour.  Jeffries lights up every scene he is in.  His ability to use humor in every reflex and word make him a joy to behold. Does he overact?  Perhaps.  But in the same way that Vincent Price did.  He steal his scenes and this picture.  Edward Judd does nicely in his role as does Martha Hyer who is beautiful as well.";

	schema:headline " An excellent adaptation of Wells";
	schema:reviewBody "WARNING POTENTIAL SPOILERS!!!Of all of the animation genius Ray Harryhausen's films this is my favourite partly because I am a huge H G Wells fan and also because I think the characterisation and acting are better than pretty well any of his other movies. Don't get me wrong Harryhausen is a God... of model animation and sfx. But all too often his films their amazing effects notwithstanding are slightly pedestrian in feel Jason and the Argonauts excepted. Anyway back to First Men in the Moon...As ever with an adaptation liberties have been taken with the source material. In Wells's case this is understandable as in common with many of his novels the narrative structure is slightly odd and not best suited to the cinema. In the case of First Men in the Moon in the novel after Bedford leaves the moon by himself having become separated from Cavor we only learn about Cavor's own adventures through a fragmentary series of long wireless telegraph transmissions he makes from the lunar realm intercepted by a fictitious Dutch radio pioneer Julius Wendigee. Clearly this rather passive device would be difficult to adapt lacking as it does the necessary human engagement. An equally radical departure is the incorporation of a completely new character Kate Bedford's Bostonian fiance. Obviously this was to sell the film in the US. However she is a satisfyingly sparky presence and does not detract from the action.The modern framing device is superbly conceived and executed. One expects nothing less from the scriptwriter the brilliant Nigel Kneale of Quatermass fame and a great Wells fan. The twist in the tale ending is a wonderful inversion of Wells's own conclusion to The War of the Worlds and ends the film on a dark some might say sour note surprising for a Harryhausen production.There are some wonderful performances. Lionel Jeffries might be accused of going way over the top but given the thinlinebetweenmadnessandgenius brilliance of his character Cavor such eccentricity is entirely plausible. And it certainly makes for an enjoyable performance. Cavor's pride when he unveils the Sphere to Bedford Edward Judd is a joy and a lovely counterpoint to his usual nearhysteria in the earlier scenes forgivable one is tempted to say as the character clearly becomes more stressed as the time for departure nears. Edward Judd is a muscular contrast to Cavor an unthinking instinctive man of action to Cavor's dithering intellectual. He also exhibits an unpleasant xenophobia on the moon. Nevertheless in the novel Bedford can be quite violent too so one can blame Wells for the character's shortcomings not Kneale. In fact to digress an interesting point is that in his novels Wells does not romanticize his firstperson narrators. Bedford can be a brute just as the unnamed narrator of The War of the Worlds is by turns cowardly and does not shrink from murder or at best manslaughter to protect himself. In short his characters for all their sketchiness often act realistically. Judd's Bedford is also amusingly spivvish a charming rogue really more an antihero than anything else. His fevered dreams of commercial empire are just as they are in the book. Martha Hyer's Kate has been mentioned and there are some amusing cameos. Miles Malleson is Miles Mallesonish as the registrar as dithery and absentminded as his bishop was in Hammer's Hound of the Baskervilles. Cavor's workmen with their proletarian slackness and petty demarcation of responsibilities owe more to conservative 1960s fears of the growing power of the trades unions than to Wells but provide amusing comic relief. Watch out too for a brief appearance by Peter Finch then a huge star as the bailiff who serves papers on Bedford stepping in as a favour to the director to replace a bitpart player who failed to turn up at the last minute.Of course another dramatic change was to abandon Wells's breathable lunar surface. In the novel during the lunar night the very air freezes to become slush on a barren surface. Come the day and the frozen air melts turns into an atmosphere and giant mushrooms and other weird vegetation flourish briefly. Cinema audiences would laugh heartily. But Wells's sublunar civilization is preserved so the change is not great. In the novel much is made of the structure of the Selenite society. In fact this was the main point of the book Wells being interested in constructing an alien rather antlike civilization  his antigravity paint Cavorite was merely a device a pseudoscientific deus ex machina to get his narrators there without the bother of some massive engineering project such as Verne's space cannon. The novel's bewildering multipicity of Selenite castes is jettisoned in the movie for simplicity there being just workers and managers in the film ruled over as in the book by the bigbrained Grand Lunar. Although necessitated by the tight budget this is rather a shame as although it would be difficult to convey all the nuances of Wells's Selenite society certain images would be marvelous on the screen the small but largelunged heralds with their trumpetlike mouths who precede the Grand Lunar on his procession the immobile Selenite intellectuals whose vast jellylike brains necessitate their transportation in sedanchairs the swift spiderlike messengers the list goes on. The central point though that of adaptation to one's work a kind of grotesque reductio ad absurdum of the Victorian class system is not completely lost in the film being echoed in the workers placed in suspended animation while they are not needed. Cavor's audience before the Grand Lunar while condensing much of his speech in the book nevertheless adheres to the spirit of it especially in terms of his reckless honesty about the warlike tendencies of mankind.In visual terms the film is a delight. The Victorian flavour is evoked beautifully the Sphere itself appearing to be a plausibly converted bathysphere. The modern moon landing is effective lwjoslin of Houston pointing out on this site quite rightly the attempt to realize contemporary NASA design philosophy. The Selenite civilization is superbly presented especially considering the low budget with awesome caverns spectacular lens pits stark palaces carved from the lunar rock. And sparing as Ray's trademark Dynamation creations are being restricted to a caterpillarlike mooncalf of leviathan proportions a few Selenite intellectuals and the shadowy Grand Lunar himself they are no less accomplished for that. The mass of Selenite workers are played somewhat obviously by children in suits but given when the film was made one can hardly complain. And Laurie Johnson's music is magnificent especially the swelling orchestration as Cavor slowly mounts the immense staircase on his way to his audience with the Grand Lunar.Finally I must praise the DVD release. Presented in widescreen with a restored picture and stereo sound it really does the film justice and paralyses the poor VHS recording. Also the one hour documentary extra 'The Harryhausen Chronicles' is a musthave containing wonderful interviews with Ray and extensive footage of his early 16mm experiments. There is also for diehard Wells fans the clip of his 1949 trial film in 16mm of a tentacled Martian emerging from its smoking cylinder that Ray did to sell his abortive War of the Worlds project.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lionel Jeffreys is Dr. Cavor a loony English inventor who takes Edward Judd and Martha Hyer along on a trip to the moon in 1899 in a sphere propelled by his antigravity paste cavorite. The moon at first looks rather like the imaginations of 1964 would picture it  barren mountainous and dark. The image of the distant earth had not yet acquired its stippling of white clouds.It isn't long though before the intrepid trio discover one of those secret civilizations dwelling beneath the surface where they've built a giant oxygenproducing machine that makes the atmosphere breathable. The society seems to be built around a threecaste system  giant caterpillars big furry soldiers and technologically advanced eggheads. Conflict ensues. The trio escape and head back to earth for a happy landing.I nodded out once or twice towards the end because the story wasn't actually gripping in any sense though it was nice to see Ray Harryhausen's special effects. That monster caterpillar was pretty spooky.The problem that fantasists like Wells Verne Edgar Rice Burroughs and H. Ryder Haggard had was that they generally had some illuminating intuitions about how to get from the ordinary to the fabulous but then sometime stumbling while figuring out what to do once they reached the alien corn. Welles' The Time Machine was fine until we wound up with the pale and naive Eloi and the cannibalistic subterranean Morlocks when unless you were clued in to the fact that Welles was trying to predict the future evolutionary status of the working class and the aristocrats it seemed a little confusing and arbitrary. The First Men on the Moon has a similar problem. FX aside I kept thinking So what? through the cerulean haze of stage one sleep.Edward Judd formerly of The Day the Earth Caught Fire was okay. And Martha Hyer gives her most animated performance on film which is kind of like watching a digital clock click from one minute to the next. Lionel Jeffreys is more than your usual quirky scientist. Miles Malleson here as the Dymchurch registrar is quirky. Jeffreys is positively manic running around screaming stumbling over things repeating himself  I've got it! I've got it!  when he should be begging for lithium.And the photography is great in many ways images that are crisp and sharp but a fable like this deserves to be bright cheerful and inviting like George Pal's The Time Machine. This fairy tale is dark too dark rendering every background object minatory. I mean a murky hole in the ground filled with terrifying monsters is depressing. Reminds me of my childhood. The subdued lighting is expertly used in the scenes at Cherry Cottage though deep greens with the subtle pink of flowers in the shrubbery. And the rich score is impressive.It's still a lighthearted and appealing movie though. The kids ought to get a big kick out of it too.".

That monster caterpillar was pretty spooky.The problem that fantasists like Wells Verne Edgar Rice Burroughs and H. Ryder Haggard had was that they generally had some illuminating intuitions about how to get from the ordinary to the fabulous but then sometime stumbling while figuring out what to do once they reached the alien corn. Welles' The Time Machine was fine until we wound up with the pale and naive Eloi and the cannibalistic subterranean Morlocks when unless you were clued in to the fact that Welles was trying to predict the future evolutionary status of the working class and the aristocrats it seemed a little confusing and arbitrary. The First Men on the Moon has a similar problem. FX aside I kept thinking So what? through the cerulean haze of stage one sleep.Edward Judd formerly of The Day the Earth Caught Fire was okay. And Martha Hyer gives her most animated performance on film which is kind of like watching a digital clock click from one minute to the next. Lionel Jeffreys is more than your usual quirky scientist. Miles Malleson here as the Dymchurch registrar is quirky. Jeffreys is positively manic running around screaming stumbling over things repeating himself  I've got it! I've got it!  when he should be begging for lithium.And the photography is great in many ways images that are crisp and sharp but a fable like this deserves to be bright cheerful and inviting like George Pal's The Time Machine. This fairy tale is dark too dark rendering every background object minatory. I mean a murky hole in the ground filled with terrifying monsters is depressing. Reminds me of my childhood. The subdued lighting is expertly used in the scenes at Cherry Cottage though deep greens with the subtle pink of flowers in the shrubbery. And the rich score is impressive.It's still a lighthearted and appealing movie though. The kids ought to get a big kick out of it too.";

	schema:reviewBody "Judging by the comments of my fellow IMDb contributers it seems FIRST MEN IN THE MOON is a film that doesn't cheat the memory . If for example you loved this movie as a kid you'll still love it as an adult . I'm afraid I have to disagree with this groundswell of opinion because I too loved this movie as a child but watching it again today I came very close to switching it off on a couple of occasions Why ? Well let's look at the story structure . The opening contains a hook of the first manned flight to the moon where a British union flag is found and it's discovered that Senior citizen Arnold Bedford was in fact part of an expedition who had visited the moon several decades earlier . So far so good but then the film spends almost a whole hour back in Victorian England setting up the characters of Bedford  eccentric inventor Joseph Carvor and Kate Callender . You'll spend most of this running time trying to work out if Carvor is more irritating than Kate in much the same way as historians debate if Stalin was a worse dictator than Hitler . It's not helped by the performances of Jeffries and HyerThings do radically improve when the trio take a long awaited trip to the moon and it's very easy to see why so many people fondly remember this film . You could complain that the selenites are obviously small of stature  Child ?  actors dressed in cloth  some of the sets are unconvincing etc but at least director Nathan Juran has tried  And to a certain degree succeeded  in bringing a sense of wonder to the movie . It should also be pointed out that the special effects are very impressive for their day and still hold up well . Also take note of the eldritch sound effects for some of the scenes set in the selenite base and the chilling voice of the Grand Lunar This is certainly a film of two halves and its glowing reputation is all down to the second half . It's also a film where the effects from Ray Harryhausen are more important than the story structure . It's a film that will almost certainly disappoint fans of the original novel and will equally disappoint fans of cowriter Nigel Kneale whose work here lacks the compelling intelligence of much of his other work".

Jeffries may look eccentric as he usually does in his roles but he's developed nothing less than a totally unique form of propulsion and he knows what he wants to do with it. Nothing less than a trip to the moon.Like Jeanette Macdonald in Maytime or Gloria Stuart in Titanic Judd from the man's point of view tells the story of his lost love Hyer and that unique trip to the moon. As to what happens there and what happens to Jeffries Judd and Hyer you have to see the film for that.Since it's a Ray Harryhausen film you kind of know what to expect and Harryhausen delivers in grand style.

	schema:reviewBody "One year after arranging for the near destruction of the Earth by invaders from Mars 1898 H.G.Wells turned the story around and had humans invade another heavenly body  the moon. THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON written in 1899 created a bit of controversy when it appeared. Jules Verne was still alive and he had some proprietary interests in the Moon as he sent three men two Americans and a Frenchmen to the moon in 1865 FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON and returned them to earth in a sequel in 1870 AROUND THE MOON and  although most people don't recall it  had the Americans and their gun club associates try to use the Columbiad cannon to affect the earth's tilt in THE PURCHASE OF THE NORTH POLE in 1889.Verne's moon cannon and projectile despite some amazing predictions regarding it's physical location and the time to reach the moon four days is now known to be erroneous due to the power of the explosion to reduce the projectile to dust. But it was cutting edge science in 1865 and it was based on everyday physical items of use like guncotton and steel. Verne dismissed his English rival's work asking where M. Wells found his Cavorite. The reply of Wells is not known.Actually Wells does tackle the subject of Cavorite a little towards the last page literally of the novel. Cavor in his final moments of desperation for help from his fellow men tries to send the formula for Cavourite and we learn it is based on hydrogen the lightest of all elements. However Cavor stops the transmission probably cornered by the Selenites with a final message of Uless meaning probably Useless. The film version does expand the story quite well especially in the performances of Lionel Jeffries as Joseph Cavor Edward Judd as Arnold Bedford and Martha Hyer as Kate Callender. Jeffries normally played comic parts like his dimwitted policemen in TWO WAY STRETCH and THE WRONG ARM OF THE LAW. He did do overly excitable dramatic characters like his Marquiss of Queensbury in Peter Finch's film about Oscar Wilde. But Cavor may have been his best acting job as he ends up sacrificing himself to save Judd and Hyer and to somehow restrain the thousands of Selenites who seek mankind's destruction. His act is also one of guilt as his overly chatty admissions about the militarism and destructive activities of human beings brings about the final decisions to destroy man by the Selenite people.Judd's career was mostly in science fiction. He rarely had one of the three leads in a film and he makes the most of it as he blindly goes ahead financing Cavor's antigravity experiments despite warnings of how dangerous they are with the collapsing smokestack of Cavor's chimney as a reminder. He also by not leveling with his girlfriend Hyer gets her tangled up in the trip to the moon and ends up endangering her as well as Jeffries and himself.Ms Hyer's performance is not in the original story as Arlene Dahl's appearance in the film version of JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH is not in that book either. It was thrown in to make the story more scary as there were now three intrepid explorers to the Moon one of whom was female. It really was not needed but it was a good move as Ms Hyer turns out to be a welcome addition to the cast. She has one moment of unintentional comedy. The Selenites are examining their unwanted visitors and we see a screen some type of xray device and a skeleton on the screen a full skeleton. We hear Ms Hyer talking angrily about being violated and she walks out from in back of the screen  her clothes all on. The violation was the xray machine revealing so much her skeleton?.Ray Harryhausen adds to his memorable stable of animated clay figures with his moon cow  a centipede type monster that the space travelers manage to kill. We see the Selenites strip it of it's meat leaving a large skeleton behind.Altogether a superior science fiction film.".

Director Nathan Juran working from a smart and imaginative script by Nigel Kneale and Jan Read treats the story with admirable sincerity maintains a steady pace throughout adds a good deal of pleasantly amusing lighthearted humor and ably crafts a strong sense of genuine awe and wonder. Granted the opening half drags a bit it takes over forty minutes for our engaging protagonists to even get to the moon but fortunately Jeffries' considerable vitality and twinkling screen presence stops things from ever becoming dull. Naturally Ray Harryhausen's stopmotion animation creations are as impressively fluid graceful and enchanting as ever with a giant predatory caterpillar rating as the single most gnarly being. The crisp cinematography by Wilkie Cooper and Harry Gilliam boasts a few snazzy visuals flourishes and offers plenty of neat shots of the desolate lunar landscape. Laurie Johnson provides an extremely classy and flavorsome score which never becomes too overwrought or obtrusive. A really nice and entertaining movie.".

The humor is adequate but the movie doesn't really lift off literally until the moon ship heads for the moon.Upon arrival on the moon the crew meets the inhabitant the antlike Selenites and their fantastic world below the moon's surface. An encounter with a moon calf along with an audience with the Selenite leader are just two of the marvelous effects in this movie.Though not one of the best of Harryhausen's works it is still an enjoyable treat for scifi fans and a family film that stands the test of time.".

But the movie looks good provides Disneystyle entertainment and never outstays it's welcome. It's a good family movie with enough cheese to cover the surface of the moon!".

Wells legendary novelist of The War of the Worlds and Food of the Gods I was already preparing for a vastly entertaining and completely relaxing Sci Fi adventure. What I didn't expect or even secretly hoped for actually was that First Men in the Moon would be THIS much shamelessly brainless fun! Literally from start to finish this overenthusiast British adaptation of Wells' novel is fastpaced comical exhilarating and unpretentious camp fest. Every aspect about this film simply provokes a big fat smile on your face whether it's Lionel Jeffries' overthetop nutty scientist performance Harryhausen's stupendous moon caterpillar creation or just the complete negligence of all the most basic laws of science. TV journals and high school history teachers always taught us that Neil Armstrong was the first man on the moon right? Wrong! Good old Neil wasn't the first one and neither were the randomly nameless astronauts at the beginning of this film who are landing on the moon whilst the entire world is watching. Barely five steps on the surface the astronauts find a Union Jack flag and a note claiming the moon belongs to England's Queen Victoria. Talk about sloppy seconds! The authorities track down Arnold Bedford one of the three pioneer explorers who traveled back and forth to the moon in the year 1899 already! Arnold is a nut job in a retirement home and he warns about the current astronauts being in great danger. The rest of the film is a flashback to the year 1899 narrating in great detail how Arnold and his American fiance Kate Callender became acquainted with the bedazzled but undeniably genius scientist Joseph Cavor. Cavor invented a gooey substance that makes any type of material weightless and rather than investing in groovy anti gravity boots he wants to build a bizarre and shapeless contraption into a rocket ship and fly to the moon. Don't bother questioning the ten million little details they overlook but the cheerful trio arrive on the moon alive  kicking and begin their exploring in deep sea diving suits. To their amazement the inside of the moon has a normal earthly atmosphere and is inhabited by a eerie community of critters. First Men in the Moon is an awesomely entertaining SciFi gem from the early 60's. The concept is absurd and ludicrous but at the same time irresistibly charming. The interstellar landscapes and Harryhausen's creations are quite impressive whereas other set pieces and scenery are almost too cheesy for words. Some of the dialogs are priceless but in good old late 50'searly 60's SciFi tradition the screenplay contains quite a number of confronting questions about human nature and a typically abrupt ending. I loved it and I can only highly recommend it to people with a weakness for oldfashioned SciFi and a healthy dose of humor.".

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Nathan Juran First Men In The Moon is an adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel The First Men in the Moon. Nigel Kneale creator of Quatermass and Jan Read write the screenplay Ray Harryhausen provides the stopmotion effects and the cast is made up of Lionel Jeffries Edward Judd  Martha Hyer. The story sees a UN rocket flight to the Moon land in 1964 thinking it is the first landing in history. However they discover a British Union Flag and a notice written by a Katherine Callender Hyer stating that the Moon has already been claimed in the name of Queen Victoria. This starts off a search by the UN to locate Katherine so as to get to the bottom of the story. They soon find that she has passed away but locate her husband Arnold Bedford Judd in an old people's home. Arnold has over the years been dismissed as being not right for his claims of having once been to the Moon. But now the authorities are very keen to listen to what Arnold has to say. He tells a fantastical story of the time in 1899 when Professor Joseph Cavor Jeffries Katharine and himself went to the Moon and met an alien race known as the Selenites.Nathan Juran's movie opens with a booming piece of music by Laurie Johnson the sort of score opening that promises either end of the world like dramatics or something resembling the onset of War. We then open with astronauts on the Moon finding the Union Flag of Great Britain the tone is set for some H. G. Wells scifi dalliances. Only what follows for the next 45 minutes is a ponderous comedy like piece featuring three over the top Victorian caricatures. It's such as shame that the first two thirds of the movie is so flat given that the last third and the production in general really gathers pace and hits the spot. It's a distracting contrast and one that begs the question on who is responsible for this silly misstep? Still the bonkers plot is fine even if it's some way from Wells' social commentary tinged novel while the actors possibly in preparation for playing second fiddle to Harryhausen's work just about keep it watchable till the pace and drama kicks in.As is the case with most Harryhausen led pictures it's the appearance of his creations and his Dynnamation work that considerably lifts proceedings. Once our dynamic trio land on the Moon the theme considerably changes and we finally get the film that that opening hinted at. Selenite aliens a kind of winged beetle race a giant Caterpillar thingy and the Grand Lunar leader showcase some what is admittedly second tier Harryhausen work. But it's enough to entertain with charm whilst giving the piece a dramatic worth. Best of all tho is the art work on show from John Blezard and his team where terrific sets and the ever gorgeous in her 40s Martha Hyer are enhanced by Wilkie Cooper's excellent colour photography erm in Lunarcolor apparently. One can't help thinking that the craft on show deserves a much better film than we as a whole get. So this is one for nostalgists like me who as a youth looked forward to a Saturday afternoon viewing of something Harryhausen inspired completists of the great man's work and of course for lovers of B movie scifi schlock. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes I know. I've heard all the complaints already. That's not how it happened as if anybody really knows All of those events could not have cooccurred on the same boat in the same trip as if anybody really knows etc. etc. Well here's my answer  it's a movie just a movie. Don't see a movie to learn about what really happened unless the film states very clearly that it is a documentary. Films are like good books supposed to tell you something true about people about things that happen and about life. They're not even when they're placed in the documentary shoebox necessarily about what really happened and how.The Perfect Storm is a heavily fictionalized speculation concerning the experience of the Andrea Gayle and its crew during the 'storm of the century' in the early nineties. George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg head a fine underappreciated cast as regular yankee fishermen their friends and family living in the Massachussetts town of Gloucester pronounced Glosta for those of you from away. Billy Tyne Clooney is a once legendary longline swordfish captain who is down on his luck and needs a big catch to bring himself back into the fold. He and his crew set out to find that catch on exactly the wrong day in exactly the wrong place. The second half of the film is their attempt to get home and also incorporates Coast Guard rescue action scattered all around the Atlantic during the massive storm.Having lived in Maine for years and having gotten myself thoroughly immersed in the ballads of Ruth Moore and the amazing New England Maritime culture I have to admit that I was predisposed to like this film despite all of the issues my fellow reviewers have harped on. And no I haven't read the book nor do I intend to. Still in an attempt to be somewhat objective I gave it an 8 and I'll give it an above average recommendation but I will also say that my inclination was to give it an 9 or a 10.This film mixes New England fishery and sailor lore a few scattered facts about the Andrea Gayle Story and a lot of dramatic license to tell a story about the heroism of the average American and their families. It is also an homage to the the New England fishing industry and its traditions. Though it is easy to mistake the real life heroes the Coast Guard operatives who saved so many lives during that storm for the heroes of the film the crew of the Andrea Gayle and their loved ones are the real heroes here  in their valiant efforts to save themselves their boat and their catch.The performances and the script are strong and the characters very well realized though fictionalized. Wahlberg and Clooney are great. Clooney gives the best performance I have seen him give. Some of the smaller parts deserve special mention  Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio Michael Ironside Diane Lane and John C. Reilly are always very good or better but I was unexpectedly charmed by John Hawkes William Fichtner and Janet Wright.It is impossible to discuss this film without talking about the amazing special effects. To summarize the first time I saw The Perfect Storm I actually had difficulty sleeping because I felt the bed rocking to the rhythm of imaginary waves each time my eyes closed. Had I seen it in a theater I am convinced that I would have considered popping a dramamine. Although at times exaggerated this is the best film recreation of sea storms I have ever seen. Every scene is thoroughly believable and marvelously detailed even down to the weird patchiness of an incoming torrent often called the calm before the storm.Obviously I liked this film. And I will give it a strong recommendation with a couple of caveats. First  if you're not somebody who appreciates New England culture and understands something of the kind of humble heroism Glosta Men and women are expected to have you might not get it completely. Second  if you come to this looking for a story that rings true in the sense of objective history you have come to the wrong place. Otherwise sit back with some popcorn and somebody you love and enjoy the ride.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is inescapable fact that it is very difficult to take reallife events and translate them into an interesting and thrilling movie.  Ron Howard perfected the art with Apollo 13 and now Wolfgang Petersen continues on with The Perfect Storm.   This story of Gloucester MA. fishermen who go out for one last try at a big payoff in a slumping season packs quite a wollup once they get caught up in an event that had never before been recorded  the perfect storm.  From there you have to suspend belief just a bit and drink in the events occurring aboard the Andrea Gail.  It's not tough as the cast delivers them perfectly.George Clooney may have played his signature role as Capt. Billy Tyne skipper of the illfated Andrea Gail on that fateful day in 1991.  Clooney comes off as neither overly glamorous or bigger than life but as a simple common man just trying to break his fishing slump and bring home a big payday for his boss his crew and himself.  When George relaxes and puts himself into a role he is better off and Capt. Tyne is the pinnacle of that for him.Mark Wahlberg comes on board as Bobby Shatford a rookie fisherman who is trying to make a better life for himself and his girlfriend Chris nicely played by Diane Lane.  Bobby is the only character given equal depth to Billy and comes off with the same impression  a good guy who was trying hard to make a better life.  Very nicely done here as well.Supporting cast is good John C. Reilly as Dale Murph Murphy William Fichtner as David Sully Sullivan a late arrival to the Andrea Gail's crew Michael Ironside as the profit first Bob Brown.  All of these stellar characterizations and serve brilliantly to put you into Gloucester of 1991.Wolfgang Petersen has created a gripping film full of chillingly realistic special effects.  He skillfully took Sebastian Junger's novel and tweaked it to fit the confines of the motion picture screen.  Casting and acting by all involved was perfect and you never once feel like anything is overacted or overly dramatic just that you are somehow involved with the fear that had to have been involved on that night.4 12 out of 5".

I can't say I liked this movie  perhaps remembering the terror of that night I lived in a seaside town and the ocean had come over the seawall and was filling up streets 3 and 4 blocks in from the beach makes it difficult for me to watch this movie as entertainment.  In answer to one post here Clooney said that the Boston accent is one of the most difficult and he didn't even want to attempt it  Markie Mark is from Boston so it wasn't a stretch for him.  The special effects are phenomenal of course...I just wish it had a different ending.

Convinced that it is his turn to score the big haul Tyne convinces his crew to go on one last run before the end of the season and heads for the North Atlantic.  He never figured Mother Nature into his plans.I remember reading about the Andrea Gail soon after The Storm of the Century hit the eastern seaboard.  It was only a matter of time before someone tried to bring this story to the big screen.  Thankfully it was Wolfgang Petersen who did so  here he does for fishing what he did for submarine warfare in Das Boot  puts the viewer in the midst of the action and scares the hell out of them.I can say without exaggeration that I have never experienced a movie as stressful as this one the friend I brought to the premiere was literally ill.  The movie starts out slowly and deliberately gradually setting the stage for what is about to come.  Petersen utilizes several subplots to build the suspense initially he focuses on the disappointment of the crew as they repeatedly fail to hit the motherlode.  Masterfully intercut with this are scenes documenting an idyllic sailing trip that turns ugly and the Coast Guard attempts to rescue them.   Consequently the tension like the storm continues to build to a crescendo and never wanes.  The movie also feels real.I have been in twentyfoot seas once in my life and that was more than enough for me it was one of the few times I ever contemplated my own mortality.  Watching this movie brought it all back the waves looked so real that it is often difficult to differentiate between the CGI and the real thing.   Also I could feel the waves as they pounded relentlessly against the boat the theatre I saw this in had a great sound system and was deafened by the shrieking wind.  The experience is for lack of a better word ferocious   I kept everything to disintegrate in the onslaught.  However special effects alone do not adequately convey the appropriate sense of danger.Many of the water scenes were actually shot in heavy seas  they managed to film in the tail end of a hurricane  adding to the realism several members of the crew were regularly feeding the fish.... The actors faced additional dangers  Mark Wahlberg came perilously close to drowning not once but twice and was injured by one of the animatronic creatures.   Anyone expecting Clooney or Wahlberg to be glamorous will be sorely disappointed  they are earthy and scraggly.  But more importantly their performances ring true.  Indeed all of the main characters deliver subtle believable performances.I have never given a strong endorsement with an equally strong caveat  you must see this movie but only if you can handle stress.  And yes I am serious on both counts.".

The actors faced additional dangers  Mark Wahlberg came perilously close to drowning not once but twice and was injured by one of the animatronic creatures.   Anyone expecting Clooney or Wahlberg to be glamorous will be sorely disappointed  they are earthy and scraggly.  But more importantly their performances ring true.  Indeed all of the main characters deliver subtle believable performances.I have never given a strong endorsement with an equally strong caveat  you must see this movie but only if you can handle stress.  And yes I am serious on both counts.";

In this film the people are the captain and crew of the boat. They know their job commercial fishing is difficult and dangerous even in good weather. The weather is rainy. The men need the money.

Few people appreciate how dangerous it is to deliver that fish entre to the table.The storm turns into a hurricane that traps the men plays rough with them and kills them. They struggle to save their own lives. They fail. When they are neck deep in water in a compartment of the overturned boat they face death squarely. They talk briefly and unsentimentally about things they will not be able to do people they will miss. The stark plainness of the acting achieves a powerful emotional effect.At the beginning of the film the viewer meets the crew.

There is no sappy foreshadowing.Director deserves kudos for maintaining tightfisted control of a vehicle that could have been campy or worse.The viewer will learn a lot about meteorology especially about hurricanes. The special effects are indistinguishable from live action.All the actors including George Clooney maintain a stoic engagement with life and they struggle to live with no appeal to our pity until they die.The Perfect Storm is more than a film.

	schema:headline " Perfect Storm Perfect Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on a true story and dedicated to ten thousand Gloucestermen lost at sea since 1623 The Perfect Storm' is a powerful movie that will take you places to which you've never been before.  Director Wolfgang Peterson has deftly crafted an intense rendering of the story of the Andrea Gail a swordfishing boat captained by Billy Tyne that left Gloucester Massachusetts in the fall of 1991 and soon encountered the storm of the century.  After a less than profitable trip out Captain Tyne George Clooney sets out again in October with a crew of five men and heads for deep water and a place know as the Flemish Cap.'  It's a dangerous trek for that time of year but he assures his men that the catch will be worth the risk.  What he could not foresee however nor could any meteorologist was that three major storms would converge to form a single storm the likes of which comes along only once in every one hundred years or so.  Fate steps in further when after their catch is made their ice making machine burns out leaving them without the means of packing and preserving the fish.  They have no choice but to go back in directly through the storm lest the fish spoil in which case all of their work and the risks taken would be for naught.  Tyne lets the crew decide do they turn away and wait out the storm losing everything or do they prove that they're Gloucestermen' and try to make it back. What Peterson did with this film the way he tells the story can be likened to what Melville did with the novel Moby Dick' as it moves along he fleshes out the characters and subtly provides an intimate portrait of what this kind of life is all about.  He pays such meticulous attention to details that by the time you're in the middle of the storm the impact is extraordinary you know what this boat is and how it works you've smelled the fish and the sweat and the sea and worked alongside the crew.   You know these people and what's at stake here.  You know the feel of the fishing lines and the grappling hooks felt that rush of adrenaline that comes when you hook a big one or when a huge wave washes over the deck.  He gives you so much in this film puts you in it so completely that it primes your senses for whatever's to come.  Combine all of this with the best special effects imaginable outstanding performances and a terrific score by John Horner and you're in for the thrill of a lifetime. The charismatic Clooney is exemplary here as Tyne he knows him from the inside out which enables him to convey a real sense of who this man is. And it shows in the way he carries himself the way he walks and talks right down to the look in his eye.  He's tough without any unwarranted theatrics or bravura is selfassured but aware of his own shortcomings as well.  It's a commanding performance with nuance and depth It's all there and Clooney makes it real.  Mark Wahlberg also is outstanding as Bobby Shatford the rookie fisherman who can't stand to be more than two feet away from the woman he loves Christina Diane Lane.  Lane gives a notable performance here too as does John C. Reilly who does an emotional turn as Murph' the veteran fisherman with a young son he loves and who lives with the remorse of past mistakes that cost him his wife. Rounding out the exceptional supporting cast are William Fichtner Sully Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio Linda Allen Payne Alfred John Hawkes Bugsy and Michael Ironside Bobby Brown.  There are thrills and heroics to spare in The Perfect Storm' but it's also inspiring once you've seen the Coast Guard in action for example you'll never take them for granted again.  What makes this such a great movie though is that it's about real people doing their jobs and going about living their lives like we all do. It's an instance of ordinary people getting caught up in extraordinary circumstances and Peterson has made them accessible ones with whom anyone in the audience will be able to identify.  This is an emotionally charged unforgettable film you'll experience things from the comfort of your seat in the theater or on the couch that most people will never get close to in real life.  And therein lies the true magic of the cinema.  This is one movie you absolutely do not want to miss. 1010.".

The movie on a whole succeeds where a lot of films this year have  it's gripping.  The whole scenario of the storm the crew the boat and the relationships are so scarily captivating it's unreal.  However if you don't know the ending or what goes on in the film i won't say anything but be warned!  This film has scarred my mind.  The performances from all actors are so good i was depressed for about 3 days afterwards!  That is the only weakness however. It's a great film a really worth watching.  I would also recommend the book to anyone who hasn't read it  A bloody good read although even that has it's depressing moments.  810  worth purchasing because it could effectively become a classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "I will admit right off The Perfect Storm was the first VHS I ever bought BEFORE I owned a VCR. AND  I was already past 65 when this happened! Indeed I am ancient although I think like a teenager. I was shopping in Ralph's market and saw the VHS on a stand. I had seen the movie in the theater I didn't hesitate to buy it and then went right out to a store and bought a VCR. Almost everyone who commented on this movie saw it in a theater.I digress I suppose not too many people have seen the ocean when it gets to be as furious like in The Perfect Storm. I am a native of the Gulf Coast my friends and I couldn't wait till the hurricane season started because we'd flock to the beach for swimming......such deep water ! That was before the weather went crazy and the hurricanes have become such monsters. So I have a little more insight about what a perfect storm could be like  I would also like to say you can't get me on the ocean nowadays  this movie vividly demonstrates you can't mess with Mother nature some folk admitted that. You saw in this film that no matter how large a ship is the water is stronger and certainly unpredictable. That first ship you saw was a tanker about as big as a footballfield  the second maybe bigger......loaded with containers. If you haven't been to a port to witness how large these ships are then you certainly have no business trying to critique a movie about the ocean. A lot of people mentioned The Titanic  it was a small ship compared to today's The Queen Mary is permanently docked at Long Beach and you'd be surprised how small IT is. The QM2 recently docked alongside of it 2006 which made it look like a skiff. Not yet but eventually one of the super cruiseships will sink Poseidon Adventure and the world will be shown you take your life in your own hands by venturing out onto the oceans. Remember The Andrea Doria?Now think about people who sail on those boats from the East Coast just about every day to fish for a living. If you think the North Atlantic is bad the ships that fish in the North Pacific close to Alaska are immense. Yet they are constantly sinking the pay is so high for the men who work on these ships they feel they'll do one season of fishing and make enough money to get on their feet  and they're right.I suppose those who were so terribly disappointed in the cast of The Perfect Storm were expecting some heavy acting maybe people in eveningclothing highly emotionally sensational lines. Guess What! The actorsactresses in this film were perfect because they ARE working not having a party. The folk left at home are terrified because they know the danger of sailing on the seas. What ordinary people don't realize is we've killed all the fishinggrounds along our country's coasts and the ships DO have to sail halfway to the next continent to make a catch. So the next time you eat a tasty crableg from Alaska just keep in mind that someone was scared to death catching it.The Perfect Storm story setup was extremely believable. The fishermen who work on the boats are not always compatible and they do not always get along except when emergencies surface. The beating the Andrea Gail took as soon as the storm began was very believable.If you'd read more of the trivia section you'd know that some of the scenes were shot ON THE FRINGES of hurricane Floyd  all of it wasn't done in that huge tank. The circular motion of winds in a hurricane DO make for huge waves that collide into one another not long lines of high water. Again if you haven't actually witnessed a hurricane don't write like you're an expert  sitting in a theater doesn't give you expertise to do this. Sorry you spent your 8.00 to see the movie but it was your decision  no one guaranteed you were going to like the movie.......So folk you need to give this movie a break. Yes The Coast Guard does make actual rescues in the ocean consider how many they've rescued between Florida and Cuba and Haiti. The scene in The Perfect Storm was brilliant. And George Clooney and Wahlberg were perfect for their roles because they were portraying NORMAL people. Wolfgang Peterson did a great job with William Wittliff's script. I also saw Das Boot when it was first released but I didn't faint when I learned Peterson had directed them both. In fact there were parts of Das Boot I didn't enjoy like guys puking on themselves  but that's the way sailors are huh? I now have The Boat and enjoy is thoroughly.I loved Murph and Mastrantonio's character  also Sully. I just got the DVD for this movie and watched it earlier tonight. It's got my 10 because it never fails to frighten me. Whatever Oscars it won they were deserved. Folk who know nothing about the ocean and the risks people who sail it daily they should definitely watch this movie....then give thanks and respect to those who WORK it daily....and gave their lives.....we're on dry land. Bravo! for The Perfect Storm....92806  I watched the special features tonight to those who made comments about 'throwing a little water on them should really watch them. Most of those scenes were shot on a fantastic stage with a huge tank of water with machines that make the boats pitch etc. So all of the cast who were on the Andrea Gail were in great danger not just one time but for the duration of the filming. Bravo to all !".

	schema:headline " Effects are good but overall it's a storm in a teacup";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1991 the crew of fishing boat the Andrea Gail' sets sail into the Atlantic in search of fish.  However they find themselves stuck with a storm front barring their way back to home.  They push on regardless into one of the biggest storms ever recorded  a combination of three separate fronts coming together.This film had it's UK premier just  a mile from my front door in Birmingham's biggest cinema complex Clooney came over for it himself don't know how much he liked being able to see junction 6 of the M6 from where he landed! So at the time I did kinda want to see this film but never got round to it.  I have just seen it on video and feel that I've put the film at a disadvantage because the best thing about it the special effects don't work as well on a 21 inch screen as on a cinema screen.The plot is based on a true story but from my understanding is pretty fictionalised given the outcome.  That's not a problem however as it isn't a solemn tribute to these men  just a record of the storm itself.  The fact that it's focus is the storm IS the problem.  For the first hour we catch fish fight on the board bond with family etc and generally try to build these fishermen into characters and not fodder like a disaster movie.  This is painfully slow and didn't work for me  I was interested in the men but it seemed to me that the film wasn't.  The first half wasn't spend getting to know the crew rather it just felt guilty to rush into action  this isn't an action movie after all it is a TRUE story!  Therefore I felt that the film thought it owed the characters something.The second half is actually pretty good but it's all due to the seamless effects and some good direction.  The waves look real and even on my TV I got into the tension and fear of the storm.  However the film leaves the fishing boat for most of the tensest scenes and joins the rescue efforts in other areas  the Andrea Gail is actually used surprisingly little in the second half considering the focus of the first half.  My one problem with the effects is the same one I had with mission Impossible  we've already seen the money shot in the trailers and adverts etc.  Here the money shot is the huge wave itself  and I felt robbed that I'd seen that on the poster and on the TV.The heavyweight cast are all solid actors  from the stars to the support names.  However they can't compete with the effects.  I mean Bob Gunton is a good actor when he is given the chance but here he is only ever seen in the midst of a rolling boat or in the sea!  Clooney and Walberg are both good and it's good that they did something a little different from a traditional action movie.  The rest of the crew are also all good in the first half  what do you expect from names like Fichtner Reilly Payne and Hawkes.  But again in the second half they are simply thrown around on a massive soundstage.  The one thing I must praise is that they meet the end of the film with dignity and noone goes after a hammy exit.  The women are left with the worst roles  all they can do is look weepy and stare out to sea. Mastrantonio gets to sail a boat but that's about it for her.  Karen Allen and Diane Lane are both wasted and landlubber Michael Ironside turns up just long enough to sneer and collect his cheque.Overall the first hour drags a little despite the strong cast making up the crew of the Andrea Gail.  The second half is good but only because the effects are so powerful that you'll get caught up in the storm yourself. However when it was all over I was left wondering what I'd just seen  it looks like it's a true story and a drama but really it is just another summer effects movie except this one is a little less fun that the others. At the end of the day despite it's odd strong point I found this to be a perfect storm in a teacup.".

The fog's just lifting you throw off your bow line you throw off your sternyou head out to South Chanel past Rocky Neck...Ten Pound Island past Niles Pond where I skated as a kidand you blow your air horn and throw a wave to the lighthouse keepers kid on Thatcher's Island  then the birds show up black backs and herring gulls big dump ducks  the sun hits you head North open up to 12 you're steaming now the guys are busy you're in charge  you know what? You're a god damn sword boat captain is there anything better in the world? Ordinarily I would write a review that is fair minded and as honest as I can call it something that hopefully would interest the readers either side of the fence. But here with The Perfect Storm I just want to write why I love this particular picture and what a most divisive picture it has turned out to be. I'm aware of the complaints about the movie even the ones from the family of the real Captain Billy Tyne played by Alpha Male regular George Clooney but as an entertaining spectacle with huge slices of emotional fortitude The Perfect Storm will forever be hitting my spots. The character build up is just wonderful people with things to prove fractured and blossoming romances loyalties on the line grudges carried over from previous encounters the lives of sea fishermen fully formed in the films first quarter. Then there is a sequence as George Clooney says the monologue that I have opened this review with beautifully recited but it's the emotion in Linda Greenlaw's face Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as she watches and listens to him speak it just wonderful. Then the boys go out to see heading off into dangerous waters to hopefully make a killing in the fish market tensions run high accidents happen heroes are born and rivalries quickly overturned but the boys must go further if they are to corner the market the Grand Banks are evil at this time of year. A three pronged hostile weather front is heading their way they are as Linda tells Billy on the radio heading into the belly of the monster and what a monster it is. Here the makers excel director Wolfgang Petersen his cinematographer John Seale and his SE maestro John Frazier do literally put me right there in a amongst the waves and derringdo bravado. Then it's the final couple of reels the emotional mangler even a spiritual coda that is hated by so many can't make me dislike the film any less and I'll wager right here and now that as funeral eulogies go few if any have been delivered with as much heartbreaking emotion as the one read by Mastrantonio here. All of which is backed by a truly involving score by James Horner shades of Braveheart's emotional swirls in there. It's a personal opinion you know but The Perfect Storm is a magnificent film that I enjoy three times a year every year and nobody will ever be able to take that away from me. There's no goodbyes Christina only love damn straight! 910".

Twister had ok fx but a horrible script. Volcano was boring. Dante's Peak was ok but inaccurate. Armageddon was also way too unbelievable and inaccurate and wouldn't happen the way it did but it was still funny. I guess the only other disaster flick that's pretty equal to 'Storm' is Deep Impact on some occasions.But enough about other movies. This one is based on a true story as we're told. So like most other Americans I was not aware of the facts that surround this film and didn't know what to expect at the end. Without spoiling too much I'll say I was very surprised but also very relieved that it was believable. Check out The Perfect Storm best disaster movie ever.".

The acting was wooden and onedimensional from everyone involved.  The music was laughably overblown.

Seb didn't even contemplate that happening because the idea of it was ludicrous.  No fisherman on earth would try that maneuver in any storm ever.

There have been only 3 movies I have went to see that were so terrible that I got up and left the theater without making it to the end. I saw it on opening night. When we left I said stop I want to count heads. There were only 7 people left in a sold out show!! The next day I was so shocked at the comments and reviews that I went with a second group of people and tried to watch it again hoping perhaps I just had an off day. It was worse the 2nd time. I have never seen such poor film work ever. Soon into the movie I assumed the film was matted widescreen because I saw many scenes with the characters foreheads cut off at about the hairline. I was stunned when one of the big waves hit the boat and knocked the main boom over. I thought I was watching an old 60's Godzilla movie. And then as the perfect triwave storm begins pounding the boat the scene moves to the inside of the ship. The crew is anxiously deciding what to do. They are SLOWLY LEANING from side to side. And behind them outside of the main windows are these 40 or 50 foot waves slamming down just feet from the ship. Nothing on the tables are moving etc. etc. This is not to mention that the scenes were too chaotic to really see what was going on. They also were shot in deep brownish hues that were far from natural. That's not even getting to the fact that there is never an attempt to develop any of the characters. And the acting was B movie horrific. When both my groups left after about an hour or more I made the comment that I hope this boat crashes and takes everything with it especially the film reels at the theater. I then recanted and said I don't even care what happens to anybody in this movie. If you want to see a good movie on the perfect storm watch the White Squall or Wind. Don't even waste your money on renting the video. I love George Clooney but not here. I also want to note that I was hoping that at a 2nd theater the movie at would at least display a proper aspect ratio. Maybe the first show had overscanned the projection so as to cut off the tops and bottoms of scenes. I was wrong. It was just as terribly displayed there. It is either being played back in 35 MM matted to give us the 235 to 1 appearance of 65 or 70MM. Or it is just a terrible Camera man's eye for the scope of the viewer. Boy I am sorry I am so negative but this movie was that bad. I have heard many other comments from people who completely agree with me. Simply one of the worse movies we've seen. And I like almost all movies in some way or another. Except The Perfect Storm!".

Cinematography was excellent and everyone was wearing white clothing I don't know why probably to highlight everyone but it did look good on them. The second half was really emotional and I felt really sorry for both girls who wanted to marry Shahid Kapoor and the ending was good because everyone were fair to each other. The movie was directed by Priyadarshan who is the best comedy director after David Dhawan and Chup Chup Ke is his best film as far as I've seen them.

But then during holi of 2007 I got a chance to watch the movie when it was being shown in local cable channel in Patna. This is a typical original Priyadarshan movie.Shahid Kapoor takes a lot of loans from different peoples in order to settle in some business. He is unable to repay the loan.

Kareena  Having missed role of a lifetime in Black I expected her to fight back with stunning performance as a mute girl. Expectations reduces joy ah!  I am a wise man now.BTW  the love track between the two appears forcefit. Is it missing onscreen chemistry?Sunil Shetty  Makes entry just a couple of seconds before interval and is his usual self. Neha Dhupia  Wonder how Priyadarshan convinced this glam doll to play second fiddle? Bait Gets to sing the songs since Kareena is mute. Nevertheless meatier and better performance than Kareena. Paresh Rawal seems undisputed king of comedy and his chemistry with Rajpal Yadav is great. Offlate the latter is being accused of substituting Johnny Lever. With Chup Chup Ke Rajpal Yadav should silence his critics how long? my guess is as good as yours!. Other Priyan regulars don't leave any lasting impression which include Om Puri and Asrani. Shakti Kapoor's lovetrack gets axed on the editing table. Anupam Kher as usual does his part well as a principled father.A couple of songs in the movie are good  thanks to the latest craze Himesh Reshammiya. The downside  a la Hum Aapke Hain Koun!! The promo song ShabEFiraq should have been incorporated in the end titles. Offlate the critics are have invented positive statements like leave your mind at home and enjoy the comedy which actually means mindless comedy. Chup Chup Ke luckily escapes this category and scores above Phir Hera Pheri.The comedy track is in right proportion and blends seamlessly with the backbone of the story. Finally what was Sushma Reddy thinking when she signed the dotted line?".

Well let's see what changed shall we? Pretty much the only thing that changed was the cast. Actors in the Bollywood version was so horrible it's incredible. In fact the only person who acted well in the movie was Kareena Kapoor. Shahid simply did not do a good enough job adapting to the character. Not to an extend that is expected of him who's otherwise a brilliant actor.Not even the comedians were able to pull of the brilliant Comic breaks that was scripted for them. Bollywood has evolved into an industry people seek to join for it's glamour and nothing but the glam and money. These days it only has a handful of good actors.

	schema:reviewBody "The good news is that Kareena Kapoor doesn't talk in this film The bad news is that everyone else does the problem is that they don't just talk but shout scream shriek screech and yell. Chup Chup Ke continues Priyadarshan's stint with loud comedies. The good news is that this Priyadarshani film has a story to narrate unlike Garam Masala. The bad news is that this time again the story is a Hindi adaptation of a Malayalam film named Punjabi House unlike Malamaal Weekly that was his only original Hindi attempt However the story is interesting enough. Jeetu Shahid Kapoor is drenched in debts that he is unable to payback. So he attempts suicide by jumping in the sea only to be caught in the net of fisherman Bandya Rajpal Yadav. Bandya's master Gundya Paresh Rawal in turn has taken heavy loans from Prabhat Singh Chauhan Om Puri. As a loan security Gundya keeps Jeetu as a deposit at Chauhan's house who fakes to be a mute and deaf guy. Chauhan's niece Shruti Kareena Kapoor who is actually mute falls for Jeetu. Confusion seeps in the story when Jeetu's exfianc Pooja Sushma Reddy comes into picture. The good news is that Priyadarshan's brand of humor is not as bland or slapstick as David Dhawan's recent films. The bad news is that it's not as credible or tongueincheek as a Hrishikesh Mukherjee or a Basu Chatterjee film either. The movie starts with a bang getting straight to the point. The director doesn't waste time in establishment of the characters. Right from the first scene the story of the film keeps moving ahead thereby keeping your interest alive. Priyadarshan doesn't experiment with the treatment of humor though going on with his trademark style of comedy. The characters play out loud and to the gallery. Another problem with the Priyadarshan brand of comedy is that he stretches the humor in a scene a bit too much and doesn't know where to stop thereby making it repetitive and monotonous at times. However thanks to some wellwritten scenes and Neeraj Vora's dependable funny oneliners that range from the witty to the corny ones the film does succeed in making you laugh. One more bone of contention is that the genre of the film is not just focused at being a comedy. That lasts for the first two hours after which the genre shifts towards drama. After a good dose of laughter in the first half you don't feel like changing moods with the subsequent on screen emotional outbursts. And while Priyadarshan handles the comic portions of the film in a largerthanlife manner his treatment of emotions is very much natural. Not many might remember Priyadarshan as the director of touching emotional films like Gardish Virasat and Sazae Kala Paani much before he molded himself as a comedy specialist. Conversely how one wishes it were just the opposite in this film i.e. the comedy to be more natural while one could overlook the heavier side with some passable artificial emotions. The fluctuating genres very much remind of Priyadarshan's Hulchul that too turned intense in the last one hour. Moreover the family setting and characterizations of Suniel Shetty and Kareena Kapoor seems to be directly derived from Hulchul. Priyadarshan has a standard team of actors like Paresh Rawal Rajpal Yadav Om Puri Asrani Manoj Joshi and Suniel Shetty with whom he extracts fine work. Paresh Rawal is getting repetitive though you love to see him repeat the act. From being a serious actor Om Puri has already made a transition into the comedy arena with lan. Rajpal Yadav yet again goes over the top but somehow in this film this actor steals the show amongst others thanks to the best scenes and lines that he gets. His timing and expressions add to the effect.Like his team of actors Priyadarshan also has a standard team of technicians in his film like cinematographer Tirru and art director Sabu Cyril. Sabu repeats the typical pillarsinthegarden set design for the song sequences. The white color in costume designs is consistently maintained throughout the film to impart a pure look to the frames. The good news is that Himesh Reshammiya composes the music of this film. The bad news for some is that he even sings some of the tracks here. Amongst other actors Shahid is quite efficient. Kareena looks gorgeous and since she doesn't have to mouth a single line in the entire film not even in a dream sequence you are saved by her otherwise overexpressive dialogue delivery skills. In fact Neha Dhupia gets more scope and she makes the best use of it. Sushma Reddy is restricted only to some 45 scenes. Suniel Shetty is getting typecast in these kinds of roles playing the aggressive and protective brother. Soon he might become a substitute for Jackie Shroff. Overall Chup Chup Ke isn't as silent as the title suggests. However despite it's loose or loud ends it still manages to be a good family entertainer.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have loved Hera Pheri Hungama and Hulchul by Priyadarshan because they had the humor that could make me laugh a lot. The jokes in these three movies weren't repetitive and the movie didn't dull down any moment. When I saw Chup Chup Ke with my parents I kept laughing just because my father was howling in laughter and I fond the movie funny. But when I saw the movie alone again I did not find it funny at all.Paresh Rawal got too repetitive in his manners and behavior. Shahid was an epitome of over acting. He looked weird rather than humorous playing deaf and dumb. Rajpal Yadav kept playing his usual role as a side kick who is made to do a lot of silly acts. I liked Kareena's acting as it was natural and thank god she did not talk throughout the movie. While the Gujarati family which had Om Puri and a couple of hundreds of people really addled my mind. I don't think we have wrestlers in Gujarat who keep fighting. Its normally done in the North. And instead of playing Garbo the family celebrates singing Hindi songs and dancing as if they are Punjabis. I mean in the beginning most of the members of the family are shown as if they do not know any Hindi and in the second part all are shown singing in Hindi.The second half of the movie was terribly dragging as members of the family kept weeping all the time. The film had too many characters and so it became a complete mess.Overall it is a bad movie. So I give it a 4 out of 10.".

When I saw Chup Chup Ke with my parents I kept laughing just because my father was howling in laughter and I fond the movie funny. But when I saw the movie alone again I did not find it funny at all.Paresh Rawal got too repetitive in his manners and behavior. Shahid was an epitome of over acting. He looked weird rather than humorous playing deaf and dumb. Rajpal Yadav kept playing his usual role as a side kick who is made to do a lot of silly acts. I liked Kareena's acting as it was natural and thank god she did not talk throughout the movie. While the Gujarati family which had Om Puri and a couple of hundreds of people really addled my mind. I don't think we have wrestlers in Gujarat who keep fighting. Its normally done in the North. And instead of playing Garbo the family celebrates singing Hindi songs and dancing as if they are Punjabis. I mean in the beginning most of the members of the family are shown as if they do not know any Hindi and in the second part all are shown singing in Hindi.The second half of the movie was terribly dragging as members of the family kept weeping all the time. The film had too many characters and so it became a complete mess.Overall it is a bad movie. So I give it a 4 out of 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "Story line The hero is in love with Girl A. He meets her 'chupchup ke'  hidingly....because the money lenders are after his life.The hero is under heavy debts he drowns and is picked up by a poor boat owner  who uses his boat for fishing. Anyway  the hero lands up in the house of a rich man. The rich family keeps the hero as their servant and since he was somewhat deaf and mute but actually he was fine  just pretending to be deaf and mute so that he does not have to go back to his own locality where the money lenders will all jump on him!they gave him small odd jobs to perform.In the same rich and affluent family there is a girl played by sexsiren Kareena  who was actually just mute not deaf. So her cousin finds that a new domestic male helper has joined who is also mute! The love story starts! Wow! What an idea sirji!! Whoever has written this utter crap story! OK there is a twist in the tale too  no rich and affluent male was ready to marry Kareena because of her handicap! So all the family members were looking for a suitable groom ...and were unable to find one! Like..... Are you kidding me!? Such a rich female ..plus beautiful and fair too  who will get a huge dowry with her  Indian families with sons will fall at her feet and lick it for the rest of their lives! There are many such educated but not very well off families in India who would do anything for getting a bride from a rich family...watch Saavdhan India episodes if you have doubts! Anyways she falls in love with the guy who was hired as a domestic helper in the family. Later the beans got spilled and the Girl A  with whom the hero was actually in love comes to now that he was alive. When she confronts him it was already too late  he had accepted rich and mute kareena  who was obviously much prettier than the Girl A..and was about to marry her! I mean why wouldn't he  he would be able to live happily ever after as a rich man and will even get rid of the money lenders! Girl A was dropped as a dead fly from the milk! End of story Conclusion I have often heard that there are families rich and affluent  having huge palatial houses...make the servants render sexual services too! Like fatso wives...whose equally ugly and fatso husbands pickup call girls from the streets for a 'quicky'  or even visit brothels or  if a wee bit more rich  then they book a hotel room and sleep with the females engaged in escort services.Probably this is the reason why kareena's cousin introduces her to the newly acquired helper...at least she could taste...love..making?...since no one was marrying her? Btw. The fact that the females of the house sleep with the servants drivers gatekeepers..etc. is known to the males of the family  it is a 'you are OK i am OK' relationship  the males eff around outside the famels eff around inside...since they are cultured and ethical and traditional  they eff indoors and not hire gigolos! Problem happens when dull headed males watch such films  if they reach some such house as domestic helpers  where females are sleeping around and game...then things are under control...but if such dumb fools reach a decent righteous household and try to act fresh the film after all showed the possibility of the daughter marrying the helper...so such concepts raise expectations as well huh then hell breaks loose!...the helper gets beaten by the men of the family first and then by the cops and ultimately he gets the criminal label for the rest of his life!".

	schema:reviewBody "My goodness! This film would have received a poorer rating for me if not for the fact that Kareena Kapoor doesn't talk in the film as well as the fact that you can enjoy the first hour and a half without sight nor sound of her. God bless the director  writer for that alone.Okay with that said here's the plot in a nutshell Shahid Kapoor plays Jeetu a happy golucky dude whom we meet down on his luck as all the people he is indebted to have now come to collect. His problem? He doesn't have the money to pay up. Nevertheless he is witty. He devices a plan to gather all of his collectors into a meeting by the sea where he not only reveals to them that he cannot pay up but also that he is about to commit suicide. Unfazed most of the collectors encourage him to jump into the sea and that in fact if he does so and drowns they would forget about the money he owes them. So Jeetu jumps into the sea. The collectors go back to the village to report what has happened and a massive search goes into effect to recover his body which is never found. Jeetu's family gather by the beach watching the search efforts and they all take turns reflecting on the sad turn of events and what happened the last time they saw him. Jeetu's fiance Pooja played by Sushma Reddy even decides after this to become a widow for life.Meanwhile miles away in a remote village in Gujarat Jeetu's body surfaces in a fisherman's net and in a hilarious skit is taken to hospital by BandyaRajpal Yadav whom found him and Gundya Paresh Rawal his boss. While Jeetu is unconscious Bandya finds a letter amongst his things and mistakes it for money Jeetu owns not knowing that it's actually money that Jeetu owes to people. Jeetu awakes to find both men plotting on how to squeeze him for cash and decides to play deaf and dumb to them. Note Shahid Kapoor plays this in such a stereotypically bad way it's painful.Bandya a man in debt on his own now takes Jeetu under his wing but soon gets in trouble with one of his own debt collectors Prabhat Singh Chauhan played by OM Puri. After another bout of very funny skits somehow Bandya  Jeetu end up being servants in Chauhan's house to pay off Gundya's debt and there Jeetu meets a truly mute girl named Shrutiplayed by his real life love Kareena Kapoor with whom sparks fly. I don't know whether it's because Miss Kapoor was mute in the role but Neha Dhupia who plays Meenakshi manages to outshine her on the acting front. Blink and you'll miss Anupam Kher  Amita Nangia every time they show them briefly as Jeetu's grieving parents. Manoj Joshi play's Pooja's father. Music by Himesh Reshamiya of which only two songs are stellar. 'Dil Vich Lagya'  the henna ceremony song I can't remember the title of that song but it's really catchy and the video's beautiful. On the DVD there's a video for one deleted song which features Shahid  Kareena Kapoor. It takes place after Jeetu's suicide scene Jeetu jumps int the sea and emerges in a mermaidlike lair where Kareena's is Dancing Queen. It looks great but wouldn't have fit into the film's storyline so they smartly deleted it from the film's final cut. Oh! before I forget Suniel Shetty is in there too though you wouldn't know from the promos I didn't even notice him in the promo for 'Dil Vich Lagya' and he's a big part of the song. He plays Shruti's possessive older brother Mangal Singh Chauhan. Here's hoping Shahid Kapoor collected the fattest salary for this film for all the overtime tight slaps he received throughout the film. LOL!".

	schema:reviewBody "My two favorite Spike Lee movies are Clockers and He Got Game and they share similarities both are about  guys trying to keep integrity amidst characters whose primary motives are to persuade him to leave the path.He Got Game gets the edge because I love basketball and because I'm a sucker for well done fatherson conflicts. The basketball parts of this movie are absolutely brilliantly shot. Most sports movies share two commonalities completely ridiculous storylines and actors who throw like sissies. He Got Game avoids both.Okay some parts of the story are hoky but allowable. But what makes this movie work similar to Clockers is that you get sucked into a main character whose nobility is tested at every turn. Will Jesus Shuttlesworth make it through the maze or fall prey to it? And will he be able to recognize that his father is not just one more flesh peddler? It makes for good drama. But above that the basketball scenes just completely rock. They're examples of absolutely masterful cinematography and editing. In fact the movie has some of the best montage sequences every put on film. Seriously.Denzel is excellent in this movie. He plays a Jeckyll and Hyde and plays both sides well. This conflicted character was very easy to root for. I can identify. NBA perennial AllStar Ray Allen while more than a little stiff at times holds his own as a nonactor in a dramatic role.He Got Game is a flawed piece of work parts drag it's not without its hokiness and the subplot with Denzel and Jojovovich didn't quite fit. But the essential storylines work and play true you believe in a conflict between father and son and you root for a high school basketball player who requires the wisdom of an adult to avoid the flesh peddlers. Kudos to Spike for not trying to hit us over the had with his message but letting it unravel naturally.".

	onyx:emotionText "My two favorite Spike Lee movies are Clockers and He Got Game and they share similarities both are about  guys trying to keep integrity amidst characters whose primary motives are to persuade him to leave the path.He Got Game gets the edge because I love basketball and because I'm a sucker for well done fatherson conflicts. The basketball parts of this movie are absolutely brilliantly shot. Most sports movies share two commonalities completely ridiculous storylines and actors who throw like sissies. He Got Game avoids both.Okay some parts of the story are hoky but allowable.

	schema:reviewBody "Denzel Washington has one of his greatest charcaters in Jake Shuttlesworth in this compelling film by Spike Lee. Jake is a man serving a life sentence for the accidental murder of his wife during a domestic dispute. The dispute centered around Jake's aggressive coaching of his young son Jesus who he is obsessed with turning into a basketball star. As the film opens we learn that Jesus effectively played by Ray Allen has indeed become a high school basketball star and is being now aggressively pursued by University teams and commercial agents. In a somewhat fanciful yet unfortunately believable plot device the Governor promises Jake early release from prison if he can convince his son to go to Big State.  Much of this film is amazingly well executed my only regret comes around some of the gender politics of the film many of the female characters are underdeveloped andor cartoonishly stereotyped. This is particularly unfortunate because the film has so much to say about the intersections of patriarchyeconomic injusticeracism that I wish Spike Lee could have been a little more consistent with his development of the women characters one notable exception is a brilliantly realized performance by Milla Javovich as a prostitute that rooms next to Jake. This said the film is still an important accomplishment and should be seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spike Lee's He Got Game is a beautifully shot and wellexecuted exploration of the role that the sport of basketball plays in the relationship between a father and his estranged son. At the outset having not seen very many other Spike Lee movies I didn't really know what to expect or what to compare this film to. However I was pleasantly surprised at the overall quality of the plot and the cinematography that composed this film. Furthermore I really liked the definitive sense of Spike's style that was quite apparent throughout.Told through flashbacks that reveal the plot throughout the course of the movie He Got Game is about Jake Shuttlesworth Denzel Washington and his basketballstar son Jesus Ray Allen. Jake is in jail under mysterious circumstances yet can get out of jail if he is able to convince Jesus to choose to play basketball at a specific school namely the state governor's alma mater. Released for a week in order to complete the daunting task he hounded by probation officers and does a lot of things that he couldn't do in jail such as have a light dalliance with Milla Jovovich's slightlyunnecessary prostitute character Dakota Burns. Denzel as usual excellently handles his role as the intense father and is utterly believable in both his emotionladen and his violent angry scenes.Ray Allen's portrayal of Jesus is also an interesting and wellplayed usage of the strong dichotomy of masculinity in the sport of basketball. He very clearly shows the purer and more tender side of his character through his love for his younger sister whom he lives with and takes care of. Yet he is torn between that and the glittering viceinfested world that his ability at basketball brings him ever closer to. At times he does even succumb to the cloying ploys of others and there is a particularly raunchy scene as evidence of this. Allen carefully and quietly allows the audience to see the conflicts between sensitivity and machoism that exist in his life as a result of basketball.Probably one of the more interesting ways in which this film is set up is through the use of comparative shots that allow the similarities of Jake and Jesus's actions to show. Jesus tries so hard to distance himself from his father yet the shots and the camera framing show just how alike they both really are. I also particularly enjoyed the use of color and contrasts that appeared throughout. For instance when Jesus and his errant girlfriend LaLa Rosario Dawson are talking at the end of the film both their faces vividly reflect a shade of jealous green from the amusement park lights.Overall this film is a very good spin on the basketball sports movie yet with no huge stadiums or big games to win the championship like what usually constitutes a basketball movie. Instead the two main characters go through much selfanalysis and introspective maturing something that is quite rare for sportsplaying men in film to do. I liked the strong use of color and the wellframed shots and especially enjoyed Denzel Washington's brooding performance. A classic mustsee movie for anyone interested in cinematography or film.".

Directed by Spike Lee this movie takes an in depth look at exactly how many variables are involved when being the MVP and how a man can grow up and assess these circumstances.Ray Allen plays a character who's name is Jesus Shuttlesworth. At a young age his father pressed him dramatically to be the best he could be. However by mistake kills Jesus's mother and is sent to prison. The troubled child eventually grows up to become one for the best players in the nation. Now the drama builds up. When the decision to go pro or join a college team is just around the corner Jesus's father played by Denzel Washington is let out of jail to convert his son to a specific school or else the father is returned to jail it leaves Jesus with a daunting task. The reconcile between the father and son is what eventually allows Jesus to become a real man and face his problems.The idea that a boy cannot live without his father plays a defined role in this movie. Jesus grows up with the responsibilities of taking care of his sister who is several years younger than he is. While it appears that Jesus has all of the support in the world Spike Lee does a terrific job of accentuating how they are really leeches. All the people want are money fame and fortune which is all possible through Jesus. The reason the father plays such a key role is because although he needs Jesus's help he isn't interested in that. He really loves his son.Although Spike Lee did some amazing work with this movie especially with the inner city sequences as well as the use of colors and poetry to his advantage for getting his ideas across to the audience several scenes were unneeded which seemed overly explicit. Although these are truly issues that can ruin a famous person they seemed almost too graphic to be seen by a general audience. What Spike does so well is keeping the real connections with the street and enabling the audience to see exactly what the character is going through by using several techniques. Colors in the movie such as red green and black symbolize power pain and respect between different characters. While Jesus hates his name his father named him that through a basketball player that was how he put it the truth. This movie proves that in real life you can benefit more by forgiving and not forgetting.Overall I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a unique intellectual film that will make you think about your present situation as well as allowing you to know the difficulties that come with fame.".

Spike Lee manages to create a film that while deep in the world of basketball still can appeal to a nonsports fan. Unlike the 2006 USA Team this movie is destined for gold!

	schema:headline " Flawed but always interesting";
	schema:reviewBody "Jesus Shuttlesworth is the number one hope for college basketball and has offers from colleges and sports agents ringing nonstop.  His father is in jail for the manslaughter of his wife but is allowed out by the Governor for 4 days with a promise of further leniency if he can convince his son to go to Big State University.  However Jesus has never forgiven him and this pressure on top of everything else is the last thing he needs.I'm never too sure what I'm going to take away from this film each time I watch it as it does tend to try and cover a lot of ground.  Is the film about fatherson relationship?  Is it about the commercialisation of school sports?  Or pressure on young athletes?  It's hard to be sure and I'm not sure that Lee is totally sure either.  As such it often leaves me searching for an adequate way to summarise what I just watched.  Regardless I do feel that the film manages to cover a lot of bases well.  The stuff about the sports system is well worked without ramming down your throat  the exaggeration or is it? of the characters and scenarios is good and makes for good satire of sorts.The central relationship between Jake and Jesus is also worked well through several key scenes throughout the film.  It leaves questions open during the film and at the end but I guess there aren't always answers for everything and that's the way it is.  The dynamic between the two is good though and it makes for an interesting plot  even though it does often feel like a subplot behind the basketball stuff.  Other bits of the film don't fare as well.  The two romantic strands are not as good as they should be  certainly Jake's scenes with Dakota are less than inspiring.The cast are all pretty good.  Allen does OK but occasionally looks out of his depth with the talented cast.  The array of basketball players and associates all add colour whether as themselves or playing characters. Washington carries the majority of the film and shows his ability in a difficult role  he became the heart of the film for me even though I'm sure the intention was for that to be Jesus.  Dawson plays well despite being eye candy for the majority she does have better scenes near the end of the film.  The support cast have a few Lee regulars including an amusing Turturro a convincing Palagonia and a blink and you'll miss her Jennifer Esposito.Overall this is not a perfect film as it overstretches itself a little and doesn't manage to deal with everything as well as it could have done. Ironically the overstretching is also a plus point as every time I watch it it gives me something else to concentrate on.  Not Lee's finest work but a good film about his other passion with plenty of other stuff thrown in behind it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Jesus Shuttlesworth is the number one hope for college basketball and has offers from colleges and sports agents ringing nonstop.  His father is in jail for the manslaughter of his wife but is allowed out by the Governor for 4 days with a promise of further leniency if he can convince his son to go to Big State University.  However Jesus has never forgiven him and this pressure on top of everything else is the last thing he needs.I'm never too sure what I'm going to take away from this film each time I watch it as it does tend to try and cover a lot of ground.  Is the film about fatherson relationship?  Is it about the commercialisation of school sports?  Or pressure on young athletes?  It's hard to be sure and I'm not sure that Lee is totally sure either.  As such it often leaves me searching for an adequate way to summarise what I just watched.  Regardless I do feel that the film manages to cover a lot of bases well.  The stuff about the sports system is well worked without ramming down your throat  the exaggeration or is it? of the characters and scenarios is good and makes for good satire of sorts.The central relationship between Jake and Jesus is also worked well through several key scenes throughout the film.  It leaves questions open during the film and at the end but I guess there aren't always answers for everything and that's the way it is.  The dynamic between the two is good though and it makes for an interesting plot  even though it does often feel like a subplot behind the basketball stuff.  Other bits of the film don't fare as well.  The two romantic strands are not as good as they should be  certainly Jake's scenes with Dakota are less than inspiring.The cast are all pretty good.  Allen does OK but occasionally looks out of his depth with the talented cast.  The array of basketball players and associates all add colour whether as themselves or playing characters. Washington carries the majority of the film and shows his ability in a difficult role  he became the heart of the film for me even though I'm sure the intention was for that to be Jesus.  Dawson plays well despite being eye candy for the majority she does have better scenes near the end of the film.  The support cast have a few Lee regulars including an amusing Turturro a convincing Palagonia and a blink and you'll miss her Jennifer Esposito.Overall this is not a perfect film as it overstretches itself a little and doesn't manage to deal with everything as well as it could have done.

Definitely worth watching thoughany Spike Lee film usually is. But I'm annoyed at Lee he's too good a director to insert the MTVstyle shots in this film.

	schema:headline " Fouled Out Pretty Quickly.";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Spike Lee's ode to basketball is one of those frustrating experiences that appears to be a possible slam dunk but ultimately ends up fouling out mainly because of an uneven story and a nearly invisible tone. Denzel Washington is serving a prison sentence for killing his wife in a domestic dispute. While away his son has grown to become high school basketball standout Ray Allen a reallife NBA player. Governor Ned Beatty promises to shorten Washington's sentence if he can convince Allen to attend Beatty's alma mater. He has one week to accomplish his goal. Naturally Allen is outraged by seeing his father again and creates a shell to keep Washington out of his life. At first this seems like a good thing but what if all of Allen's socalled friends coaches relatives girls agents and fans are the true antagonists here and Washington is the flawed hero? Lee is never sure what he wants to do here. The movie plays out like a chaotic basketball game with lots of action and memorable action but in the end you do not want either team to win. Washington and Allen's relationship takes up some airtime but so do others that leave almost as fast as they appear. The corruption in collegiate athletics and within sports agencies is also given an interesting glimpse but alas those topics are not explored completely. He Got Game looked like it would match the brilliance of William Friedkin's Blue Chips a flawed but important movie but just does not seem to have the coaching necessary. Washington is impressive and handles the material as well as he can. Allen is a complete revelation. Anfernee Hardaway had stolen the show from Nick Nolte in Blue Chips and Allen pretty much does the same thing in this one. Ray Allen seems to have unlimited potential in front of the camera and his gift could be developed more fully after his playing career ends. I have said for years that Ray Allen should be the best player in the NBA but he has ultimately disappointed me throughout his professional career. Allen is not the problem here though. Lee's sporadic direction and a meandering script end up sending He Got Game to the locker room way too soon. 2.5 out of 5 stars.".

On the plus side the boy who played young Jesus Shuttlesworth was very similar to Allen... also a terrible actor.  Denzel Washington is once again amazingly convincing in his role this time as a mostly ignorant father with some intriguing wisdom who was sent to prison for accidentally killing his own wife that scene is ridiculous unless his wife had a completely separate unnoticed brain tumor that coincidentally hemorrhaged just as Denzel pushed her a whole two feet into the stove.  Other pluses in the movie are an amazing scene involving an agent who talks a great game and Laker Rick Fox a much more natural actor than Allen who makes a cameo in an amusing scene as a black college baller who likes his chocolate white.  The scenes between Denzel Washington and Milla Jovovich are very nicely done especially the work by Denzel although it seems odd that a bum who killed his wife and a cheap tramp shacked up in a sleazy hotel would be two of the most attractive people on the planet.  Unfortunately the movie's handful of great scenes are buried by areas of illconceived situations and dialogue blaring music that is poorly chosen and a vintage SpikeLeetotallywacked ending.".

God isn't exactly present throughout the picture surely the sex scenes and 'bad' language don't make it very holy for many audiences but Lee's tale however contrived to fit around the premise of a convict Denzel Washington being released for a week to try and lockdown his estranged son into a college the governor wants strikes a chord almost in spite of its limitations. It's about forgiveness on a base level about resisting temptations on all fronts about reconciliation and about not becoming holier than thou. In a strange way having the character named Jesus deflects the whole point Jake Jesus's father named him for a former NBA player nicknamed Jesus a sweet irony unto itself.What's most surprising for me is that within the set boundaries of the contrivances both in the grand piece of the premise and in little occurrences like Jake being situated right next door to a beat up prostitute Spike Lee has created a work of fiery passion and care and detail. It's a good script first and foremost as just a morality tale played out as realistically as imaginable or as realistically in a Joint of his and then elevated through his steadfast direction and the performances. No accident then that basketball is both the main focus of the trials and tribulations of the characters of Jake and Jesus in the story AND Spike Lee's main joy aside from filmmaking. It goes without saying there are still pieces of social commentary throughout not least of which from a character named 'Big Time' who rolls around Coney Island pontificating about life on the streets or more obviously by the traps of fame and fortune in probasketball in colleges. It's how Lee works in the real personal issues of the more intimate scenes and not the ones you think are intimate not sex scenes save for a brief one between Jovovich and Washington that makes it work.So amid the highflying camera shots and subliminal editing and specific usage of colors and filters as metaphors and the slowmotion shots of the basketball flying through the air as if out in space and lost in time with taking aside Lee's firm strengths here as a filmmaker the acting shines out better than expected. In his one real performance he's appeared in one other film that may or may not have been smaller Ray Allen plays Jesus without pretension and without ever sounding much of a false note. It could come off as weak to some as he occasionally tries to rise up to the challenge of getting to that level of his fellow actors emotionally. Some may say that which is fine. But with the scenes he had with the likes of Denzel Washington he held his own wonderfully with his older quasicounterpart delivering another great turn in a Lee picture. While it also goes without saying the two of them are stuck in a manipulative uplifting ending with the ball flying over one wall into the court they're actors made for this kind of story and characters they also play a mean game of ball to boot in a pleasantly uncharacteristic oneonone climax game.He Got Game has its clichs its sentimental bits and its characters brought over from other sportsrelated dramas. It's also wiser than other crude Hollywood product it's got sharper and nearly quintessential Spike Lee dialog and it even features a perfect semblance of rousing score from Aaron Copeland and very cool songs from Public Enemy. And if it delivers a message that isn't too hackneyed under the circumstances that's fine too and with everything against it via its premise Lee's made one of his better pictures good even if you're not big into the sport. 8.510".

Three things subtracted from what would otherwise be a real work of art 1 The large amount of graphic sexual content really wasn't necessary. 2 The point of character Jesus Shuttlesworth's first name was really not clear yet it was ceaselessly trumpeted and highlighted it was a distracting muddy concept. 3 The ending was extremely disappointing and bizarre.Up until the very last few minutes I was entirely taken in by this film. The ending however left me feeling somewhat ripped off. Still I found myself thinking about the movie for hours afterwards and even lying awake at night trying to come up with the ending that I would like to have seen.I wasn't sure what Aaron Copeland's music had to do with the urban black setting of the story and I wished that there was a lot more of Public Enemy.".

The story is plausible enough and beautifully filmed although I can't help but wonder if the temptations that face a rising basketball star are quite as vicious as pictured here. Three things subtracted from what would otherwise be a real work of art 1 The large amount of graphic sexual content really wasn't necessary. 2 The point of character Jesus Shuttlesworth's first name was really not clear yet it was ceaselessly trumpeted and highlighted it was a distracting muddy concept. 3 The ending was extremely disappointing and bizarre.Up until the very last few minutes I was entirely taken in by this film. The ending however left me feeling somewhat ripped off. Still I found myself thinking about the movie for hours afterwards and even lying awake at night trying to come up with the ending that I would like to have seen.I wasn't sure what Aaron Copeland's music had to do with the urban black setting of the story and I wished that there was a lot more of Public Enemy.";

If I wanna see gratuitous sex in a film I'll rent a porno... and won't be afraid to admit it.  I'll really do it.  It ain't that I mind sex and violence in major feature films.  It's just insulting to me when Hollywood gives us sex and violence in flicks and they have NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY.This film could have been a LOT better without the insulting sexual situations.  Like I said watching other people doin' it ain't the worst thing in the world.  The problem with this film is that there was a sexual situation that actually occurred in the story and was essential to the plot... BUT WASN'T EVEN SHOWN!!!  In fact most of the sex that WAS shown featured people who weren't even characters in the story!  They were figures in a senseless montage of sex and violence narrated by an obscure acquaintance of the main character.With that aside the story was actually interesting as it usually is up to the middle of Spike Lee's flicks.  As usual however Spike had to throw his little personal favorite artsy filming techniques in it and suture his patented ridiculous ending to the film.  To be fair if you like sports flicks this one is a necessary evil because of what occurs in the story. If you like sex in movies for no reason you'll like this one too.  After all the stupid sex scenes were as steamy as the MPAA will allow in an Rrated flick.  If you're a dramalover or a serious film watcher this ain't a necessary flick.".

	schema:reviewBody "After directing Malcolm X Spike Lee along with John Singleton 'Boyz N the Hood' became arguably the most popular and respected African American filmmaker of his time. Lee's wife however didn't like the fact that her husband's last original screenplay was nearly a decade ago and was vocal about it. Lee then decided to go back to do what originally launched him into the filmmaking world writing and directing his own material. And although 'Malcolm X' an adaptation was the biggest success of Lee's career his rekindled desire to bring his own fully original story to the screen was the spark that led to 'He Got Game'.The film opens with an almost fiveminute montage of people playing basketball shooting dunking pivoting blocking and what have you. Spike Lee a huge Knicks fan believes it's worth to spend five minutes of screen time with nothing but the basketball and the music composed of several orchestral pieces by Aaron Coplan 'Raging Bull'. The montage ends with Jesus Shuttlesworth 'Ray Allen' in the basketball court shooting the ball followed by Jake Shuttleworth 'Denzel Washington' his father in Attica's Correctional Facility shooting the ball as well and one can already feel that the only connection if any between that father and his son is basketball. Following that intro Spike Lee begins to utilize the old fashioned threeact structure to begin his story.The warden calls Jake to his office and we get to know about Jake's past and who he is through the warden's interview with him. The warden finally lays it out on the table and tells Jake what's what. The governor wants Jake to convince his son Jesus who is the number 1 basketball prospect in the country to play for Big State University in exchange for a reduced sentence. Jake agrees and becomes wired by the two parole officers who will keep in touch with him. He got three days before he's sent back to Attica.Jake starts by meeting Mary his little daughter first as that in his mind would make it easier for him to contact his son. When his son enters the house he doesn't look his father in the eyes and scolds his sister for allowing a stranger in. Throughout the film the father during his numerous and brief encounters with his son tries to convince Jesus to go to Big State but with no success. Their past is so dark that no light could break through.In the best sequence of the film during the last night of Jake's parole he plays a defining basketball game in his final hours as a free man. If he wins Jesus goes to Big State. If Jesus wins Jake goes back to Attica. The stakes are high and as Jake plays and scores some points he begins to let go and shifts from wanting a reduced sentence to wanting forgiveness from Jesus pun intended and his murdered wife. He accepts his fate. He chooses the worse in hope of gaining the better later on. Only when they were separated again did he and his son connect more than they ever did.To call 'He Got Game' bad would be an understatement and to call it good would be euphemistic. The film pushes some buttons in the human nature and emotions but you never feel a solid film. Overlong at parts and extremely short at others the film tries to find its rhythm during its twohour running time and doesn't quite get it right but with all its flaws it came out watchable if intriguing at parts.".
