	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure if my summary line constitutes an oxymoron but anyway anyone who has watched director LU Chuan's brilliant debut Kekexili 2004 knows that he is uncompromising when it comes to the artistic style of his work. Arguably the most dramatic epic in Chinese ancient history is the titanic struggle between LIU Bang and XIANG Yu which many consider to have started at the Feast at Hong Gate which arguably again is the most famous single dramatic event in Chinese ancient history. This story has seen almost countless screen presentations in the Chinese language cinema. Quite predictably all these attempts wound up in lush entertaining packages from unabashedly melodramatic to somewhat more tasteful work. Yet nobody has done what Lu did.Anchored in LIU at his deathbed having enjoyed his hardwon kingdom but not without a few regrets albeit he probably still did it his way the story unfolds in snapshots of short flashback scenes juxtaposing in an almost chaotic way between characters and events. For instance the famous Feast at Hong Gate keeps coming back from time to time but each time with added perspective. The expected treacheries betrayals ruthless cruelties are all there in this to borrow a critic so aptly borrowed himself game of thrones. However LU adds another dimension all of his own close to the end. Allegorical in no uncertain terms he spares no pain in telling the story of how people in power falsify history. It is almost a miracle that this segment survives uncensored.The cast is uniformly brilliant. The three topbilled are superstars from the three most prominent Chinese ethnic communities. LIU Ye Mainland China portrays the founder of the Han Dynasty who might have even been an ancient ancestor of his from a score of centuries ago. Cast somewhat against type is Daniel Wu Hong Kong who portrays a most macho hero in history you can name XIANG Yu. The third of this tripod is Taiwan's CHANG Chen who plays the brilliant general and strategist HAN Xin whose fate is tragically interwoven with the other two's. QIN Lan is as chilling a dark queen as you can get making Lady Macbeth look like Cinderella. ZHANG Liang historically just as important and some would say more so as HAN is given a cool observer's role in this film ably portrayed by QI Dao. SHA Yi has his moment toward the end as XIAO He another of the emperor's key advisors who finds himself plunging into a bottomless pit of lies.The last supper will likely disappoint some who are looking for conventional entertainment. Those with the appetite for an exceptional piece of filmmaking will be vastly entertained albeit not in the conventional way.".

	schema:reviewBody "A friend of mine suggested me this movie. So like what most of us do I checked out the ratings and reviews in IMDb and Rottentomatoes. I must say I was not encouraged by what I read. But critics did accept that the movie had stunning visuals and gorgeous landscapes. So I spent two hours of my precious time to watch it then another two hours to watch it again and I have no regrets. The flashbacks and flash forwards from the movie were still on my mind days after. The story line is sometimes not linear but it is easy to understand. The movie begins with the dying Han Emperor Liu Bang being haunted in his dreams by his two mortal enemies Han Xia and Xiang Yu. In a series of flashback the Liu Bang recollects the memories of how he turned from a ordinary villager to a soldier and to an Emperor. As the movie progress you will find that Liu Bang is a very complicated person and might not find him likable at all for his many shortcomings. Some critics pointed this out and argued that the central characterLiu Bang is despicable and hence erodes the movie. But I found it otherwise.The movie will take you to the heart of the three main characters Liu Bang Han Xia and Xiang Yu. You will see if you understand why they do and what they do are out of very basic human emotions and instincts i.e lovefear ambition prideglory and jealousy. These feelings are very clearly displayed by the characters in the movie. That it could have been any of them who would be king had the circumstances been different or the decisions they had made been different. And also that fate of a person is sometimes sealed no matter what. This is why I really love the movie though I may or may not like who wins in the end.I think what the criticswestern don't understand is the enigmatic character of Xiang Yu whose role and part they feel is a foolish and trivial one. I believe the movie actually tries to show him as a noble wise and a tempered king. Normally display of humility and kindness is viewed as weakness in the west and this may be the reason why critics cannot find a place for Xiang Yu in the plot. So yes this is not your regular sword clashing slashing movie. But this movie is and Epic of it's own kind.I recommend it strongly.".

The story line is based on a piece of history in the period of around 200 BC toward the end of the Qing Dynasty. It is a story of allies turned mortal enemies trust mistrust and the deadly outcome when a woman here a queen got involved in the King's decisions.There are no epic battles and brutal action here although there are a couple of scenes of torture and execution. The plot and pace are both slow. So I can see why many people will not like it. But if you have the patience this is a visually impressive film that told a complex story. DVD is the best medium as you can pause backtrack or watch it for a 2nd or 3rd time to fully understand the plot.".

He is known as a cuckoo a sniper on a suicide mission. Set in an area rarely seen Lapland The Cuckoo Kukushka directed by Aleksandre Rogozhkin is a touching Russian comedy about the failure to communicate. Its seamless mixture of earthy humor antiwar sentiment and otherworldly Lapp mysticism is enhanced by strong performances especially from AnniKristina Juuso who portrays a spunky but radiant young Reindeer farmer who has not seen a man in four years since her husband went to war and left her widowed.Using his ingenuity and every resource at his command Veiko manages to free himself after a protracted struggle that takes up a good halfhour of the film. Meanwhile a few miles away a Russian captain Ivan Viktor Bychkov escapes while being taken by Soviet military police to be courtmartialed for antiSoviet sentiments. Circumstances bring all three together at a log outpost where Anni AnniKristina Juuso lives alone sleeping in wooden tepees with log doorflaps. She gives them shelter and nurses them back to health but no one understands the other's language the dialogue is in Finnish Russian and Saami the language of Lapland. This leads to many confusing situations such as when Ivan tells them to get lost and they mistakenly think he is telling them that his name is Gerlost. Ivan wants to kill Veiko who tries to tell him that all he wants is peace invoking the names of Tolstoy War and Peace and Hemingway A Farewell to Arms.In this Tower of Babel the three can only reach each other through tone of voice hand gestures and body language but Anni has no trouble convincing the men that she has an aching below the tummy. Though Veiko is mistakenly thought to be a fascist since he still wears a German uniform the three gradually form a bond based on mutual need and a common humanity. The Cuckoo is a gorgeously photographed and emotionally resonant film that is more than an antiwar fable it is a film of transcendent beauty that directly touches the soul.".

	schema:reviewBody "A perennial subcategory of war films is the smallcast story of two enemies who encounter each other when isolated from their respective units and become mutually dependent.  Hatred should be but isn't always subsumed to a common quest for survival.  In 2001 No Man's Land showed the excruciatingly painful relationship of two adversaries trapped between lines during the BosniaHerzogovenia debacle.  There was little humor in that film.A surprisingly refreshing approach to the forced relationship between enemy soldiers comes to the screen in director Alexsandr Rogozhkin's Kukushka Cuckoo.  This fine Russian film is some welcome evidence of a resurgence in that country's filmmaking industry with regard to quality. And it hasn't come too soon.A Finnish soldier Veikko is chained by his unit to a boulder and left with a sniper rifle food water ammunition and no means of escape.  No reason is given for this unusual assignment which he resents viewing it as rather suicidal. At that time in World War II Finland was an ally of Germany and the Finns were holding down considerable Soviet forces in their native land. Veikko wears a German uniform decorated with the twin lightning bolts of the SS. Through imaginative use of available resources Veikko is able to extricate himself.Meanwhile back at the Russian front Ivan a captain sets off under guard with a driver and his unit's political officer for an investigation into his alleged antiSoviet notes.  Such investigations ended in those days with either execution or assignment to a trampler battalion unarmed men sent ahead of an assault to set off mines and attract fire.  They were not insurable..  Ivan knows what's to happen to him but luckily friendly fire from Russian aircraft kills the driver and commissartype while leaving Ivan seriously wounded.Enter Anni a Laplander swathed in bulky clothes reflecting no hint of sexuality.  She rescues the unconscious Ivan and takes him to her pad.  This is preNokia Finland at its indigenous best.  As she takes care of the wounded officer the Finn shows up.There are three languages in this movie Russian Finnish and the Lap dialect.  The characters can't communciate verbally but they talk constantly no meaning perceivable through the spoken word. Veikko formerly a student is predictably stereotypically disgusted with war.  Ivan snarls with hatred for Germans and their allies a very realistic portrayal.Much of what goes on among the three is comic especially when Anni not having seen or heard from her husband in four years and unlikely ever to again expresses her now unbounded randiness first in words and then... In the process she starts looking less like a Laplander on a subsistence existence and more like a gal likely to be distracted by a call on her cell phone.The evolving relationship of the three is realistic although the young Finn is allowed to mouth one too many antiwar sentiments for my taste.  This is a story about a bizarre chance encounter not All Quiet on the Finnish Front.Rogozhkin's direction is original but he owes for one scene some debt I believe to Ingmar Bergman.  See the film and you'll figure out which one I'm talking about.Cuckoo benefits enormously from the absence of music.  The subtitles convey the dialogue but hearing the three languages without an overlay of music makes the story far more powerful.The scenery is magnificent.The ending is unsurprising but nonetheless affecting.810.".

There are also three languages and because of each character interprets each other in the manner they want to hear there are actually nine pragmatical meanings for each speech. This messing up with things creates comical situations and I think that Russian viewers are able to pick up more amusing details than the other nationalities.The characters become very much a stereotypic representations of what they are perhaps even a too much but that way they are anyway more interesting than in barren realism.

	schema:headline " FinnishRussian synergy creates an international hit";
	schema:reviewBody "Russia's film industry is in a drought of international distribution but the World War IIera drama KUKUSHKACUCKOO seems set to break away from that rut. The film by St. Petersburgbased director Alexander Rogozhkin has been picked up by Sony Pictures Classics for limited distribution through American arthouse theaters. Rogozhkin has achieved a level of recognition on the world festival circuit with his previous works the comedy OSOBENNOSTI NATSIONALNOY OKHOTY PECULIARTIES OF THE NATIONAL HUNT and the Chechenwar drama BLOKPOST CHECKPOINT.PECULIARTIES OF THE NATIONAL HUNT produced at Lenfilm Studios in 1994 during a low point in the studio's general track record was a box office success in Russia and spawned something of a franchise with two sequels spinoffs and even a brand of vodka named after Kuzmich the tireless boozing outdoorsman played by Viktor Bychkov. The plot of the original film involved a young Finnish man played by Ville Haapasalo coming to Russia to experience a real Russian hunt only to fall in with Kuzmich and his motley group of friends who seem more interested in drinking than hunting.Work on the film OSOBENNOSTI NATSIONALNOY RYBALKI PECULIARTIES OF NATIONAL FISHING cemented the friendship between Bychkov and Haapasalo who went from relative obscurity to becoming household names in their respective countries with subsequent work on other films and TV commercials.Haapasalo a Finnish graduate of the St. Petersburg Theater Arts Academy also acts on stage in Finland and is working on new translations of classic Russian drama into Finnish. Having appeared together in a stage adaption of Fyodor Dostoevsky's Diary of a Madman Haapasalo and Bychkov asked Rogozhkin to write a stage play for three people something in which they could appear together. Rogozhkin accepted the challenge and the screenplay for KUKUSHKA was the result.They asked me to write a play but I didn't see a play recalled Rogozhkin at a press conference before the film's release. I saw the story I was writing as a film and once I had the ending down I knew I had the film.A former history student Rogozhkin was intrigued by the Continuation War a protraction of the RussoFinnish Winter War and part of the greater WWII conflict. The ceasefire with the Soviet Union began officially Sept. 4 1944 although forces on both sides continued firing until the next morning. This is when the film's story begins.Unaware of the conflict's end one Soviet Army officer and one Finnish soldier are imprisoned in the wilderness for different unexplained reasons. They escape through a mix of effort and circumstance and end up in the hut of a lonely but spirited Saami woman who does not take sides but takes care of  and comes to love  them both. Rogozhkin wanted to go beyond the story of three people converging in the hinterlands of war to create a situation where three people speak three different languages but come to understand one another in other ways.After some consultation with Haapasalo and others Rogozhkin decided that the third person in the film would be a Saami woman the correct term for the people more commonly known as the Lapp. The Saami language is part of the FinnoUgric group but is very different from Finnish. Traditionally the Saami hunted wild reindeer though they have adapted to herd semidomesticated reindeer. The film offers a glimpse into Saami life through the microcosm of the life of Anni a young widow living on the Karelian coast. Anni is played by AnniChristina Juuso a Saami who dealt with language barriers on the film's set. She does not speak Russian and depended upon Haapasalo for translation.Haapasalo plays Veiko a Finnish sniper  making the film's title a play on words since kukushka or cuckoo is also Russian military slang for sniper. Chained to a rock by SS officers and clothed in an SS uniform that would condemn him to death if discovered by Russian patrols Veiko spends a good portion of the film trying to extricate himself.For the role Haapasalo wore authentic Finnish army underclothes of the period some of which belonged to his grandfather. I changed after working on this film Haapasalo said. I began to see my grandfather in another light. I won't watch this film  I don't watch any of my films. But from what I know of it I think the film will stand multiple viewings. It may take seeing it more than once to fully understand it.Bychkov's portrayal of Captain Kartuzov is a real departure from his Kuzmich character. Bychkov put on some weight for the role and his demeanor is solemn and conscientious markedly different from his happygolucky Kuzmich. The seriousness of the role broke his typecasting a little bit Some people who had addressed me informally before started calling me by my first name and patronymic after seeing the film Bychkov said. KUKUSHKA premiered at the Moscow Film Festival in June 2002 where it won Silver St. George awards for Best Director and Best Actor Haapasalo. The film has also been received favorably in Finland and Haapasalo has received a Patriot of Finland Award from a Finnish veterans' association in Lahti.The film has a lot riding on the BychkovHaapasalo rapport but Rogozhkin is confident These are two actors with very different psychophysical aspects he admitted. But they do have a peculiar chemistry.And Bychkov says Juuso's contribution was no less important Despite the fact that Ville had to translate for her at every turn she understood the story  with her heart.".

Except for the very beginning in which it is not known exactly why Veikko is being chained to his rock unless you read the description of the film or watch the commentary in the DVD's special features the story catches your mind and heart immediately three unlikely people meet and live together in harmony despite being unable to understand the native languages each speaks. Though there are some humorous moments and some comic twists generally this story is one of accommodation and cooperation. The Finnish soldier the Russian officer and the Sami woman all manage to make a life for themselves through the hardships inflicted by World War II and in the end nothing but the love and friendship shines out from their sometimes unwilling and often difficult partnership. The plot is best left to individual discovery by the viewer rather than recounted here. Suffice it to say that this film will touch you in ways other films of grander scale could not.

The movie is set at the end of World War II and begins with a prisoner of war being left and chained to a rock with very little in the amount of rations left for him.  For about an hour the viewers are treated to watching the prisoner meticulously putting together and executing a plan to remove the chains and be free.  At the same time we are introduced to a woman who is seen burying the dead in a wartorn area but keeping what is usable.  One soldier wakes up while she's doing the burying and she basically takes him in and nurses him back to life.  These are the three central characters in the rest of the film.  They are thrown together by chance at a the woman's hut with nothing in the way of  modern conveniences.'  The viewer gets to watch these characters try' to interact with some humorous exchanges with the intent of helping each other survive.  While watching you can't help but wonder how the exchanges would have been different if the characters would have stopped talking and used more sign language and object identification to explain themselves but I guess the movie wouldn't have lasted very long and wouldn't have been as interesting.  And at least this movie was definetly interesting' and very thought provoking.  This is yet another entry from another country that cares more about the story and the characters then special effects  action.  Hooray for the filmmakers for giving us this gem!!".

A young Lapp widow rescues a Russian soldier near death out in the wastelands...and then gives comfort to a Finnish soldier who had been chained like Prometheus to a rock by fellow soldiers.  All three manage to live together in the woman's tiny hut without understanding a word of each other's language.  Largely thanks to the woman's generosity and kindness the men survive and get along.  It's a lovely example of the feminine principle at work at its best. The images of the stark landscape have a beauty all their own. I couldn't help wondering how we the audience would fare in OUR understanding without the aid of subtitles!  I highly recommend this movie...superbly performed by the actors and skillfully directed by Alexander Rogozhkin.".

The Hell this is the Other concluded Sartre.In Kukushka nobody of the three characters understands a word from what the other two have to say yet they DO speak all the time. All the three the Finn the Saami and the Russian are well aware of the presence of the other two but do not have to submit themselves to any common pattern of judgment. The other two are like objects which fit the world of the third in the way she would like them to. Thus the lack of verbal communication even if it caused some almost fatal misunderstandings in the long term offered the three characters with a kind of bliss not one of them had ever expected. In short this is a story about the beauty of life which is essentially impossible to share with others because it is purely contemplative.".

These weren't clear until well into the story though this being the only thing did not detract anything from the story. The funniest thing about Kukushka is that the three main characters had no idea what the other was saying. Not one spoken thing was understood between them. However love and kindness for each other overcame all the political differences they shared. I really enjoyed this film. Being American and only knowing a few words of Finnish only the English subtitles were a necessity. It was funny how all three could not communicate with each other yet still worked and lived together . Ivan trying to kill Veikko half the time out of military duty and for jealousy over Anni while Veikko trying to explain he was finished fighting in the war was a bit sad. Just like the cover says three totally different people not able to talk to each other work together and eventually become friends inspite of themselves.My vote Two thumbs upas Siskel and Ebert used to say.".

As far as I'm concerned one attempt to kill me is quite enough the Finn by contrast laughs off three different attempts. That is idealism taken to an absurd dimension.The three characters all speak a different language but since I don't know Finnish Russian or Saami I couldn't tell when they were communicating and when they weren't. The subtitles could have more clearly indicated this fact.All that aside the acting was good the Saami girl was quite compelling in her calling the dead scenes. All in all a good film about something most people know nothing about set in a strange and wonderful location.".

The interplay between the three protagonists is sharp and there is no small sense of accomplishment for the Englishspeaking viewer with no knowledge of Russian Finnish or Sami to realize that they consistently understand the situation better than any of the characters. The linguistic challenges are amusing and at times heartbreaking. Although a few of the plot elements strain credibility Kukushka is enjoyable to watch and this unconventional take on the love triangle theme had me on the edge of my seat throughout the film. The Finnish actor Haapasalo who Rogozhkin also worked with on the National Hunting series displays his acting range as well as his ability to mesh with Juuso and Bychkov another National Hunting veteran who are also excellent. The action sequences look professional the cinematography is sublime and the story is intriguing but it is the ensemble acting that makes this film worthy of multiple viewings.".

If it had been condensed to perhaps a 100 minute film then I think it could of achieved the splendour that some sequences hint at. As it is tho there is still much to enjoy and nobody should be under the allusion that this film isn't funny because it is but just how long can you stretch the joke Mr Wilder?.I think the chief thing that sticks out is just how did Wilder get such an overtly sexual farce past the censors? He pushes the boundary more than usual with this one and I honestly would be surprised if he himself wasn't surprised to get away with so much cheeky sexual shenanigans. The sets are fabulous from Alexandre Trauner and Andre Previn's score is perfect and in tune with the Parisian heart of the film but the lead actors here are oddly not firing on all cylinders.Jack Lemmon's hopeless romantic Nestor is the core humour character. A character who becomes jealous of himself! His transformation into an English fop is hilarious at first but on and on and on it goes till the joke becomes a heavy weight on the film's shoulders. Lemmon is fine he's just the victim of over ambition from Wilder. Shirley MacLaine is the title character and it doesn't quite come off sure she gives it gusto and she looks fabulous as always but the role cried out for a more cosmopolitan actress and this again comes down to Wilder losing site of things with this particular project.It's a safe recommend for Lemmon fans but for Wilder worshippers such as me the problems are evident in spite the film being his highest grossing film of the decade.

	schema:reviewBody "Irma la Douce is a gem one of Billy Wilders best films. Banned from TV for many years by network censors it began as a Broadway play and ran from Sep 29 1960 to Dec 31 1961 playing at both the Plymouth Theatre and the Alvin Theatre in New York. It quickly won the attention of Hollywood and in 1963 debuted as a film starring Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine. It is a love story the story of a policeman turned reformer who falls madly in love with a beautiful young prostitute. The IBDB captures its essence best Irma La Douce is not only French it is intensely Parisian French. Set in an area tourists seek but so seldom find its musical idiom its moral atmosphere its plot and its argot are part of Paris not even all Parisians know a part of Paris where the underworld is known as the milieu. A tart is a poule a pimp is a mec and money is grisbi. If you remember Sam Seborn's affair with a prostitute in the first season of West Wing you have the advantage. Mix with this belief in the underlying goodness of a person with the enchanting music and backdrop of Paris and you will find yourself pulling for Nester Lemmon in his quest to win Irma's hand. Marilyn Monroe was originally scheduled to play Irma but died before the film work began. As a credit to Wilder's casting Shirley MacLaine's performance earned her an Oscar nomination for best actress. The film's cinematography received its own Oscar nomination and the music took Hollywood by storm. It's stunning Parisian melody written by Marguerite Monnot and arranged for film by Andre Previn won the Oscar for best music and remains one of the finest musical scores ever.And within the cheerful comedy of the plot the story's philosopher shines bright as the mentor for Lester who struggles to overcome the muk of daily life. Being none other than the bar tender and owner of the Chez Moustache the bar and stage center for much of the film Moustache lends his shoulder to Lester and instructs him in the realities of life life accepts no conscientious objector and must be approached as if it were a war where only the strong survive. In other words face the world as it is not as you were told it was.Watch this film on DVD and get the wide screen version if you can. If you find yourself critical of the film remember that this is late 50's early 60's America. It came out during the cold war in a period where TV was still in its 'Andy of Mayberry' days. Movies were heavily censored and even the media was under intense scrutiny for what topics matters it discussed. Irma La Douce was buried from play and only lately rediscovered by VHS  DVD fans. Transport yourself back to the Milieu and enjoy you may just learn something about life!".

As a credit to Wilder's casting Shirley MacLaine's performance earned her an Oscar nomination for best actress. The film's cinematography received its own Oscar nomination and the music took Hollywood by storm. It's stunning Parisian melody written by Marguerite Monnot and arranged for film by Andre Previn won the Oscar for best music and remains one of the finest musical scores ever.And within the cheerful comedy of the plot the story's philosopher shines bright as the mentor for Lester who struggles to overcome the muk of daily life. Being none other than the bar tender and owner of the Chez Moustache the bar and stage center for much of the film Moustache lends his shoulder to Lester and instructs him in the realities of life life accepts no conscientious objector and must be approached as if it were a war where only the strong survive. In other words face the world as it is not as you were told it was.Watch this film on DVD and get the wide screen version if you can. If you find yourself critical of the film remember that this is late 50's early 60's America. It came out during the cold war in a period where TV was still in its 'Andy of Mayberry' days. Movies were heavily censored and even the media was under intense scrutiny for what topics matters it discussed. Irma La Douce was buried from play and only lately rediscovered by VHS  DVD fans. Transport yourself back to the Milieu and enjoy you may just learn something about life!";

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw Irma La Douce as much as I liked it I was puzzled by the fact that Billy Wilder had chosen to do this hit musical without any songs in it. Very much like Fanny from a few years ago which also had a French setting and came to the screen without its score. The Broadway cast album was a staple in my house and I certainly enjoyed the songs that Keith Mitchell and Elizabeth Seal and the rest of the cast did on Broadway.What made it more puzzling was the presence of Bruce Yarnell in the movie cast the possessor of a really nice baritone voice he played opposite Ethel Merman in the Lincoln Center revival of Annie Get Your Gun. That together with the fact Shirley MacLaine first made her mark in musical roles in fact she had starred in the screen version of CanCan the two years before.Well according to the recent biography of Billy Wilder by Ed Sikov in fact this film started out as a musical. Somewhere there is some footage of MacLaine Yarnell possibly even Jack Lemmon and Lou Jacobi doing some musical numbers lying in a vault somewhere. Wilder said he thought the numbers slowed the pace of the story and midpoint in the film he just scrapped what he had shot and didn't bother with the rest.Personally I wish he had kept the numbers in maybe it would have made Irma La Douce run too long. Who knows maybe we'll get to see them some day.Shirley MacLaine got an Oscar nomination for her performance in the title role. She's a good natured working girl who has the misfortune to get busted by the one cop in Paris who is not winking at prostitution on his first day on his new beat. That would be Jack Lemmon who for his honest law enforcement gets himself fired.That far from ends it as Lemmon falls for MacLaine and like he did in The Apartment sees himself as her savior. The rest of the film is the ridiculous lengths Lemmon goes to save MacLaine from her life of sin and debauchery. His one confidante is Lou Jacobi who plays Moustache the owner of a local bistro where the girls and their mecsthat's French for pimp hang out. His role was originally intended for Charles Laughton.Billy Wilder has a well deserved reputation as a cynical observer of humankind and had some run ins with several Hollywood greats. But he became an unabashed admirer of Charles Laughton after working with him on Witness for the Prosecution. The tenderest part of that Wilder biography tells about how Wilder kept visiting Laughton up to the end discussing the part with both of them knowing it was never to be. Yet I wish Laughton had lived to do the part. It would really have been special.Bruce Yarnell's part is that of MacLaine's mec. His career too was tragically cut short by a plane crash that he was killed in later in the decade. Terrific voice nice screen and stage presence what a terrible thing to happen.Though I would have liked to have seen the musical I can't fault Billy Wilder's production of Irma La Douce. The fact that this came to the screen at all was further demonstration of the Code finally being lifted from the backs of the creative. Maybe we will see a full blown musical adaptation of Irma La Douce some day. But that's another story.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is Billy Wilder's rewriting of Alexandre Breffort's French musical farce.  In 1960 David Merrick brought an English version of the piece to the United States.  This Brechtian play concerned penniless law student Nestor le Fripe and his jealous love for his prostitute girl friend Irma. He disguises himself as Monsieur Oscar and becomes her only client.  When he becomes jealous of Oscar he pretends to murder the fake client.  He is assisted in this scheme by Bob a bartender who also serves as a narrator of sorts.Wilder keeps the basic idea of the play but turns le Fripe now Nestor Patou into a policeman who falls for Irma.  Bob becomes known as Moustache and Monnot's songs are used only for background music.  In the leading roles Jack Lemmon Shirley MacLaine Lou Jacobi Hershel Bernardi and Bruce Yarnell are as French as French fries.  Wilder injects the farce with his usual cynical romanticism.  The shame is that all of the leading players had musical comedy backgrounds and could have put across the musical numbers with style. Wilder did not have to use all 14 musical numbers but 2 or 3 would have made the point.  There is no reason why Jacobi could not have opened the film with Valse Milieu.  The Disdonc number is almost performed by Shirley MacLaine in the film why wasn't it done?  Jack Lemmon could have crooned Our Language of Love to Shirley in the early bedroom scene.  Maybe Wilder felt that the music would take the bite out the his film.  It would have but it would have made the film warmer.  Thank goodness Wilder decided to include some silly slapstick to lighten the piece a bit.When I first saw this film I was disappointed in it but after a few more viewings it stands up well against Wilder's other cynicalromantic comedies of this era.  And it is the only one in color!".

	schema:headline " Not up to Wilder's best";
	schema:reviewBody "Lou Jacobi's performance is by far the best thing about this movie  but that's another story.The fact that this movie is based on a musical is fascinating. For some reason Wilder jettisoned the music but retained the flavor of the musical. The sets and the supporting characters seem exactly like they are in a musical  especially the brute who is MacLaine's first pimp supplanted by Lemmon. He seems like a baritone about to break into song at any moment  especially when he bellows to Irma from the street. The scenes in the bar all seem like outtakes from Guys and Dolls! The ambiance of the film is very peculiar.For a Billy Wilder film it seems very slow. Plenty of lines are thrown away and fail to hit their mark such as MacLaine's line Oh you won't get cold when she takes Lemmon into her apartment for the first time which is delivered flatly without any saucy double entendre. At other times the dialog seems to kind of drag  very unWilderlike. To me the scene when Lemmon removes his clothes while MacLaine smokes in bed doesn't strike either a sexy or a poignant tone. MacLaine's hunchedover posture is NOT a sexy pose. And Lemmon's covering the windows with newspaper demonstrates his naivet and bashfulness but his preoccupation with it kind of robs the scene of poignancy. It just kind of plods and there is very little dialog to help it move along. Wilder also seems to rely on much more slapstick as opposed to just plain sight gags in this movie.MacLaine is acting in a kind of light drama while Lemmon is acting in a farce. To me the two never really mesh so the movie never hits its intended mark. It is a pity that Marilyn Monroe Wilder's first choice for Irma was not available. She would have been a far better comic foil than MacLaine  just check out Some Like It Hot to bear me out.MacLaine has moments when she seems rather wistful. Otherwise she seems pretty much like a weary and worldweary working girl. She doesn't deliver enough wistfulness to be charming nor enough weariness to inspire pathos. I was left feeling pretty ambivalent about her character she's neither comical nor sympathetic. Based on such an ambivalent central character the film itself never jells for me. It can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a comedy or a light poignant drama. It doesn't balance the comic and the poignant elements very well.As an actor Jack Lemmon is very hitormiss with me. He often seems more manic than comic. That is how he strikes me in Irma la Douce. His one note caricature of the British Lord wears pretty thin. In fact that is also the big plot hole in this film. He takes to pimping because he cannot find work. Once he starts working like a slave there is no need for the Lord X ruse anymore. Of course that artifice is really the entire movie. So the whole contrivance seems like the emperor's new clothes to me.The assumed life Lemmon's Lord X constructs out of classic British literature is all good fun but by maintaining the focus on Lemmon's delivery rather than have MacLaine react in some appreciable way for the camera all of that shtick is pretty wasted to me. All the while Lemmon is rambling on about Gunga Din or whatever MacLaine responds verbally but just keeps on playing solitaire. Wasted opportunity for some good comic reactions in both dialog and facial expressions! Because this film moves slowly and lacks snappy dialog delivery it seems more contrived than comical. For a contrivance that works watch Some Like It Hot or a great little gem like One Two Three.".

So the whole contrivance seems like the emperor's new clothes to me.The assumed life Lemmon's Lord X constructs out of classic British literature is all good fun but by maintaining the focus on Lemmon's delivery rather than have MacLaine react in some appreciable way for the camera all of that shtick is pretty wasted to me. All the while Lemmon is rambling on about Gunga Din or whatever MacLaine responds verbally but just keeps on playing solitaire. Wasted opportunity for some good comic reactions in both dialog and facial expressions! Because this film moves slowly and lacks snappy dialog delivery it seems more contrived than comical. For a contrivance that works watch Some Like It Hot or a great little gem like One Two Three.";

The answer was One Two Three then Irma La Douce with a re teaming of Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine  both films were rather bullied by critics although the latter would score a boxoffice hit. But to compare The Apartment with Irma is in itself absurd  inevitably it's less gripping biting and moving. Yet as it tells such a different story which develops in a rather unexpected light it did work out for me at least more than this disastrous other mixture of pepper and sugar The Emperor's Waltz.Set in Paris' hot spot of Les Halles in the 60's but it does look much older at times narrated by uncredited Louis Jourdan who else could muse don't you believe it with such smooth ?  here's the love story of a sexy independentminded prostitute and a naive happygolucky cop. Fired from the corrupt police force because of his honesty Nestor becomes Irma's pimp and lover. But his jealousy drives him to dress up as a British Lord to secure all of his business partner's attentions. What follows is a bunch of misunderstandings and ultimately a lavish church wedding with prostitutes as bridesmaids and a very pregnant bride. Well believe it or not.Yet the fantasy is saved by its own dizzy charm and there's plenty of it  a good combination of screwball comedy light drama and witty dialogs only Wilder and Diamond could write so good the characters say them several times. The real problem is the length. No Parisian farce should exceed two hours and this one would have deserved a quicker start. Irma's tearjerking phony stories while the main credits still roll could have been cut with no harm  and the same goes for the general slowness in the development with too many too long sequences. One of these musicals without music Irma still get an Oscar for Andre Previn's beautiful score. Its atmospheric themes composed by Marguerite Monnot for the original operetta make for a very pleasant listening specially the intimate Language of Love and the only dance number done with disarming skill and energy by the two leads. Settings too have that singling out quality from the poetic Casanova street designed by Alexander Trauner complete with old shop signs to Irma's homey studio and the real things  sunny Parisian bridges where poor Jack Lemmon had to swim out. Honestly the whole thing looks better than Midnight in Paris.An other determinate point is the humanity depicted by behind the kookiness of characters and situations. They are crazy and unbelievable for sure but in a lovable way. I could not care a bit for the boheme bunch of CanCan a film much similar to this one at least it has MacLaine as a light dancer but this one won me over. Comic does drag a bit but there are moments genuinely hilarious  the jail escape Lemmon's British imitation The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain...I've seen every English movie in town and about every time mysterious bartender Moustache is around a character not so unlike le matre de jeu from La Ronde. And indeed the lightness in the folly brings back the spirits of Max Ophuls or Luigi Pirandello as well as some good old' slapstick.Apart from the pleasure of having Jack and Shirley together again it's actually quite nice to see them as a real couple up to strange adventures but also conventional banter kisses and fights. Both of the characters are eccentrics and first very puzzled at each other but they're willing to get along and one can easily buy their quirky romance. Lemmon gives a wonderful spontaneity to Nestor that constantly saves him from caricature. Honest to a fault madly jealous and overenthusiastic you actually care for the guy when he gets punched by Irma's pimp or cries with exhaustion after the girl mistakes his moonlighting for infidelity. And his flamboyance as middleaged Lord X chuckling and impotent lets his natural versatility shine. He'll get another great double part in The Great Race. As for MacLaine in a part previously meant for Marilyn Monroe she's pleasantly at ease and injects her own touch to the clich of the sweet prostitute with green stockings. Stoic and casual Irma wants security stability and respect  she's a serious businesswoman of the underworld that never seems overconcerned about anything. But like every Wilder heroin she has also a good deal of cute innocence You don't anything about men because you've been with too many Nestor tells her near the end of the story. A lot has been said about the filthy racy mood  sure there are plenty not so subtle double entendres and some very plain lines but with a general feeling of live and let live behind. Irma's stimulation of Lord X's blocked imagination are a wink to Some Like It Hot. And there's a graceful little scene when Nestor and Irma are about to make love for the first time. While she's willing and practical he gets shy and asks her to put her night mask while he undresses. After a fade you find the mask on a sleeping peaceful Nestor. The ending does not make much sense  nor does the reappearance of Lord X with all the clothes found months before by the cops but who cares ? Like Moustache masterfully played by Lou Jacobi claims that's another story. A story of hate love passion and death. All those things that make life worth living.".

	schema:headline " I've always liked this";
	schema:reviewBody "This film was actually my introduction to Stewart Granger an actor I've never really seen too much in other films I just read the Wikipedia biography of him today at least 40 years after I first saw this film!.While I've never actually seen all of this movie from the beginning while growing up it came on enough times on television that I eventually saw at least 90 of it if not more  more than enough to go beyond the basic plot though I've never seen it straight through. It is not a masterpiece but it is certainly less annoying that most of Hollywood's films regarding the dark continent throughout Hollywood's long history which were and are almost all ridden with clichs' about it and her people and which has rarely until recently say as in LeCarre's The Constant Gardener come close to transcending a completely naive Eurocentric mentality unless it is going very self consciously in the other direction straining to be ridiculously in awe of the natives straining all credibility. Instead Granger neither depicts a man who live up to one's worst expectations of the white hunter nor is in a role where he must be as brave or good as Tarzan  but is instead quite easy to love and respect even if he's a bit grizzled and rough around the edges. Hardly a heroic character in this he is nonetheless far more believable  cut down to a much more acceptable size than the usual stereotypical white European protagonist whether good or evil.I personally think he does quite well in this role and have always liked above all Granger's natural acting despite being schooled on the stage  where there's always a need to exaggerate somewhat just to be noticed  before transitioning to film. I also always liked the basic theme in this movie which is that he  an old and experienced hand at wild game hunting  meets a superficial playboy while on an African Safari who despite his obnoxious  and rather hilarious pretensions  nonetheless is quite likable in his childishness and thus ends up maturing toward the end of the film.One of the charms of this old movie is that this was filmed before Africa and the world for the matter  had really started going completely and utterly to seed as it has since yet was made after Hollywood had begun to finally mature a little  at least enough to go beyond its former stereotypes. Those stereotypes were mainly two 1 the old Tarzan  Jane stereotypes with their endless battles with greedy white men in pith helmets and khaki clothes. Though very endearing these films were just too simplistic beyond childhood. On the other extreme Hollywood films often depicted Africa as a completely savage place with only jungle bunnies as her inhabitants though of course this was never explicitly stated being too obviously racist for liberal tinsel town versus the alwaysmore enlightened Euros. Rather the relationships in this film are more realistic and natural than what you might expect.Yes the scenery is beautiful but not overdone. Most movies of Africa overdo the scenery bit. It is that Hollywood penchant for self conscious overglorification of quite natural surroundings which instead of evoking appreciation instead is often very annoying as in look at this! and look at that! and isn't this exotic! or isn't that lush and beautiful! It is nice when filmmakers don't treat their audiences all like five year old kids or go overboard showing what is left of our overexploited earth. Most films of Africa that depict its beauty remind me of Robert Pirsig's comment in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance about how Yellowstone got on his nerves. He explains how it was because it was just too obviously like a framed picture on the wall saying look at me. That is . . . nature separated from the rest of the society rather than integrated into it tree lined streets for example or large sturdy arbors with lush festooned vines over boxstore parking lots for example. There's nothing wrong with parks of course including Yellowstone but let's also have more appreciation of nature in the rest of society rather than this endless pretense . . . Likewise the Africans are depicted quite naturally embodied especially in the actor playing Granger's helperguide. He is neither depicted as an exceptional survivor of the aftermath of colonial rule nor as some sort of pathetic victim of white man's greed  even though he meets a tragic end but simply as a professional or semi professional hunter's guide and who could just as well been white though he certainly is not an oreo cookie either black on the outside white on the inside. In other words this was post Tarzan post King Kong and post much else thank god!I realize I might appear as overdoing to praise a bit for indeed this isn't as I said some lost priceless masterpiece that will floor you but it is unique. And it is the understated nature of this film that I like. It wasn't trying to be anything more than what it was. And even if Stewart Granger himself wasn't particularly proud of it I still like it and always will.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film was actually my introduction to Stewart Granger an actor I've never really seen too much in other films I just read the Wikipedia biography of him today at least 40 years after I first saw this film!.While I've never actually seen all of this movie from the beginning while growing up it came on enough times on television that I eventually saw at least 90 of it if not more  more than enough to go beyond the basic plot though I've never seen it straight through. It is not a masterpiece but it is certainly less annoying that most of Hollywood's films regarding the dark continent throughout Hollywood's long history which were and are almost all ridden with clichs' about it and her people and which has rarely until recently say as in LeCarre's The Constant Gardener come close to transcending a completely naive Eurocentric mentality unless it is going very self consciously in the other direction straining to be ridiculously in awe of the natives straining all credibility. Instead Granger neither depicts a man who live up to one's worst expectations of the white hunter nor is in a role where he must be as brave or good as Tarzan  but is instead quite easy to love and respect even if he's a bit grizzled and rough around the edges.

The idea dates back to at least 1980 PROM NIGHT and more recently formed the basis for I SAW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. But writerdirector An Byungki evidently familiar with Italian gialli maintains interest by giving the plot a quite convoluted structure plus several bizarre twists and turns as the film progresses. The influence of Dario Argento is specially noticeable. Mr. An also invests the story with enough ambiguity that until the last scene we're not sure whether the vengeful ghost seen by the characters is for real or simply a projection of their guilt.The young cast generally furnish convincing and underplayed performances. Particularly noteworthy are Kim Kyuri as a psychology major and Ha Jiwon as the film's enigmatic nemesis. The picture's mood of unease is greatly enhanced by imaginative lighting smoothly gliding camerawork sharp editing and a varied but never intrusive score. KAWEE successfully continues South Korea's recent emergence as a new force in the psychological horror film subgenre.Westerners can catch this movie on VCD or DVD under the titles NIGHTMARE and HORROR GAME MOVIE. It's highly recommended.".

And this very effective thriller does that. I can see certain superficial similarities between 'Nightmare' and the much hyped Japanese horror film 'Ringu' but the approach is quite different and I think this is the better of the two movies. The story concerns a group of school friends hiding a secret from the past which comes back to haunt them.  Standard horror fare true but 'Nightmare' makes this familiar material worth watching just the same. And having a few very cute Korean girls among the cast certainly does it no harm!

Or could it be the young ambitious lawyer who has everything to lose? What secret are the friends hiding about Eunju's death?This film is not as slick and sharp as Phone but it's not bad either. Fans of the movie Ghost Story may appreciate this Asian take on the tale as Nightmare has essentially the same plot. There are some great visuals here particularly with the ghost of Eunju and the performances are all very good. There's even a little gore here for splatter fans. The movie may move a little slowly for people who prefer their horror fast bloody and constantly scary but it has an interesting story to tell and will be appreciated by fans of Ringu JuOn and the aforementioned Phone.".

Hyejin recalls when she introduced her new friend Eunju to their former close college friends Shehoon Jun Jeong who used to tape every moments with his camera Hyunjoon Jitae Yu who was a promising baseball player before damaging his knee Jungwook JunSang Yu who has become a prominent lawyer and Jung Miryoung Hyeyeong Jo who works in advertisement on television.

Director Byeongki Ahn uses a remarkable cinematography and angles of camera to disclose a plot where the viewer is never sure whether a revengeful fiend or an insane character is killing Hyejin's friend and if Sunae has guilty complex or is really being chased by the ghost of Kyungah until the very last scene. The cast has great performances the actresses are extremely gorgeous and Jiwon Ha is one of the most beautiful actresses I have ever seen. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Not Available".

HyejinGyuri Kimwas an unfortunate eyewitness to Kyungah's death from the street and finds that one of her friends SeonaeJeongyun Choihas returned from her stay in America. It's been two years since Kyungah's demise and Hyejin is still burdened by troubling nightmares regarding her friend. Seonae claims that Kyungah follows her everywhere tormenting her. Soon a new friend enters Hyejin's life a mysterious young woman named Eunju..but is this new relationship real or imagined because Eunju eerily resembles Kyungah. As her friends are found dead by grisly means Hyejin must question whether or not Seonae is the culprit or perhaps Kyungah herself. A major subplot concerns a hotshot lawyer and his lover both part of the group being slaughtered one at a time. What Hyejin doesn't know is that her friends hide a horrifying secret which might explain the gruesome events transpiring.Despite being visually arrestingI thought the camerawork was dazzling and the use of light effective this film still utilizes the basic ghostly revenge supernatural slasher subplot. And the ghostly haunts resemble the Asian horror hits populating the marketplace at the time such as RINGU  JUONTHE GRUDGE. Still there are enough unpleasant images and some nasty violence to keep one offguard. There's an overhead shot of a victim lying in her bathtub bleeding as the shower rains upon her and one graphic attack on one male victim in a phone booth after his eye is gouged out. I thought Nightmare felt very reminiscent to I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER regarding how a secret kept within a small group leads to their being murdered. Slasher fans might just enjoy this one but I don't think director Byeongki Ahn's film stands out from the pack of Asian horror flicks streaming today. Though saying that I do believe his visual eye is beneficial to the horror genre as is cinematographer Seokhyeon Lee..they craft a good looking product here even if the material feels rather deja vu.".

The story is stupid mix two parts Ringu with one part Prom Night a sprinkle of I Know what you did Last Summer and add a tiny dash of Single White Female  now blend until completely nonsensical. There is nothing new to this plot and revisiting the clichs I've grown so fond of wasn't even entertaining this time. This movie jumps to and from the past too much and once I made sense of it all I realized it still didn't make much sense. Characters go from sane to psycho killer in the blink of an eye. Speaking of characters they are all your stereotypical favorites  the greedy selfish lawyer the egocentric actress the hasbeen baseball star the video voyeur the bitter girl the spooky quiet chick the 'nicerthannice' nice girl a freakin' black cat... and I didn't care about any of them. Perhaps a better writer could have made the movie work there were some decent scenes in it but overall this movie was a mess. I should also mention a certain 'video tape' that would have been IMPOSSIBLE to shoot. This movie isn't the worst Asian horror has to offer by far but it is still pretty bad. If you just want to see some creepy images in the dark or just want to laugh out loud at some over the top acting or just want to yell you're stupid! at a movie screen or just want to have another Asian horror flick up your sleeve when someone asks you how many you've seen  this movie is for you.

However after that it's quickly downhill for this flick.To be kind I will start with the things I like about Gawi. On the plus side the visuals are gaudy and the movie looks great for it's type. For those who like their horror movies gory there are a few nicely executed no pun intended murder scenes. We also get a few good suspense sequencessetpieces.However there are quite a few drawbacks also...First of all and my major complaint about this movie is that the plot skips and jumps forwards and backwards in time with an alarming intensity. Usually that's not a problem for me but here where the students look exactly the same no matter what age they are I was confused on more than one occasion.The performances are okay I guess a little hard to tell when you don't know the language but seem a little stiff.

After this we move into the future and we follow a group of former school friends who hide a terrible secret but suddenly they start getting picked off one by one in many grisly ways. Through flashbacks we learn of this awful suicide of a shy girl who was trying to be one of the group but she was shut out by them because they dug up her past and found out some weird occurrences. So is she back from the grave seeking revenge? Oh what a great and always spooky story! Well that's what I hoping I could say. And 'hoping' was as good as it got. This is an forgettable soso supernatural horror flick that I actually watched before but I went in thinking it was my first viewing. So to my surprise it hit me when I started picking up on certain things but like I said it's quite a forgettable mix that it felt like a first viewing again. Nightmare' is just another type of it's field that adds a 'few' changes to the gruel. Oh please give me something that's a bit more fresh. It doesn't have to be entirely original but this is one formulaic and at times quite tired Jhorror flick. Even though it strings along the usual ghost story involving you guessed right an evil looking vengeful chick spirit.But in spite of my negativity of it being the same old same old story and jolts. This one kind of entertains when its being grisly and popping in some creepy visuals. The deaths are vividly displayed with bite and some originality. While the gloomy atmosphere alienates the audience with it's murky lighting. The first scene involving the spirit terrorising one of the girls is one bloodcurdling experience but really when it's not trying to shock you. I found it rather coma inducing and I thought about getting some shuteye. That might be harsh but it just didn't go anywhere of any interest between those shock moments. You could say that because the supposed mystery is really not much of one the unsure story is just simply flat and the characters are a selfcentred bunch that you don't really care what happens to them. The disjointed story should have focused more on the spirit than that of these bland characters who have one unconvincing group relationship. It just overplayed its cards by becoming overly muddled and taking too long to get going that when it comes to the climax it's just plain ludicrous. The film's haunting ending is a high point though.The film looks fine although it could have done without the snazzy quick fire editing and the music score was a bit overbearing in playing up the mood. The performances tread a fine line but Gyuri Kim is strong in the lead role.It's nothing new and it shamelessly steals ideas but if you can look past that it delivers some nasty thrills. Although I found the handling of it rather lethargic despite the odd effective chills. A standard effort all round I guess but still it's equally missable.".

There is not one but TWO longhaired vengeful female ghosts gory deaths reminiscent of every other slasher in the world an ending clearly jacked from every other sequelpromising slasher.

	schema:reviewBody "Nightmare is a much better than expected supernatural slasher with many good points.SPOILERSReturning home to Korea Sunae Choi Jeongyun catches up with sister Hyejin Kim GyuRI about their old friends Jungwook Yu JunSang SeHon Jun Jeong Hyunjoon Yu Jitae and Miryeong Jo Hyeyeong who she hasn't seen in awhile. Learning that she fears their deceased friend Kyungah Ha Jiwon and thinks she has been following her they all reveal similar stories about their experiences around her and upon thinking back not even a friendship with EunJun Ha Jiwon made them stop thinking that way. When it finally gets revealed that her ghost has been behind the series of strange events that have plagued them for the timebeing and has taken to killing them off oneatatime forcing them to find a way to stop the ghost's deadly rampage.The Good News There was a lot of good stuff to this one. One of the best features is the fact that the film gets much more violent than would be expected through some great kills that are more brutal than expected. There's a pencil stabbed into a head a head rammed through a series of windows that eventually start to get embedded in the skull a particularly brutal slit throat being repeatedly struck in the face with a baseball bat an impaling with a multipronged metal pole through the stomach and more which is quite nice to see that it doesn't shy away from the usual bloodandgore trappings of the genre. We also get more carnage here from the film's two backstory segments both of which are incredible in their own right but also serve to add more gore. The first which shows the briefalbeitimpressive exorcism of the natives comes complete with the tribal drumming and ceremonial rituals that make it exciting and that it ends with a bang due to the crashsite showing the wounded and dismembered victims with the sole survivor horribly bleeding themselves walking out of the wreckage with an impressive visual while the secondone shot through a videocamera manages to clarify all the questions up until then winds it together with a great fight and an effective wrapup that feels realistic and logical about the situation and manages to feel really good as well making it a good winner. It even has a couple really nice action scenes as well the most important being the incredibly fun rooftop brawl in the rain at the end which is a lot of fun and has a lot of great moments throughout who'sincontrol changes constantly and it feels really welldone and effectively ends it with the proper result. The ghost as usual looks really good and has a lot going for it during it's moments getting some really creepy moments out of the usual scenes and holding some key scenes together rather nicely. The last plus here is the film's best part it's high quantity of ghost encounters present. There's a ton of them in here nearly all of which are enjoyable or at the very least somewhat creepy. From the ghost floating at the bottom of the swimming pool with their hair drifting in the current to the hand rising from out of the video camera and the several chases through the school's hallway the encounters here were really welldone and effectively made for a nice atmosphere. Even the two fantastic house scenes where it appears during a raging thunderstorm and uses the shadows to sneak up on it's victim or too where it only shows itself to one of them while others are there and don't see it coming after them it's full of impressive scenes that work really well here. These are the film's good points.The Bad News There wasn't a whole lot of problems with this one. One of the main flaws is the film's really bad scarestokills ration. The ghost is given a lot of screentime in this providing a lot of opportunities for some kills but the fact there isn't as much compared to the scares is a little distressing. Granted being around a lot shows off the power and fear requirements quite nicely but it still would've been nice to be able to have the areas a little more even in terms of actually being onscreen to kill rather than to scare great as those scenes are. The only other main area of problem here is the film's rather curious decision to use the firsthalf of the film as a flashback sequence that explains the whole relationship with everyone. This isn't all that wellexposed coming across as something that could've been told effectively in a more subdued way that manages to get the same points across without taking as long to spell everything out as it does. That's the main problem with it being that since it decides to focus on the relationship quirks of the friends while telling a flashback a point not revealed until the end of the sequence before going into either scenes that the individual telling wouldn't have known about or into another flashback within it just feels as though the entire setup could've come off a little differently than what is shown while still telling the same story and hitting the same points. These here are the film's flaws.The Final Verdict With a lot of good stuff and only a few minor flaws to it there wasn't much really holding this one back in the genre. Give this one a shot if you're into the ghostly revenge genre or a huge of fan of Asian horror while those who aren't really into these films should heed caution.Rated URR Graphic Violence Graphic Language and Brief Nudity".

Even the two fantastic house scenes where it appears during a raging thunderstorm and uses the shadows to sneak up on it's victim or too where it only shows itself to one of them while others are there and don't see it coming after them it's full of impressive scenes that work really well here. These are the film's good points.The Bad News There wasn't a whole lot of problems with this one. One of the main flaws is the film's really bad scarestokills ration. The ghost is given a lot of screentime in this providing a lot of opportunities for some kills but the fact there isn't as much compared to the scares is a little distressing. Granted being around a lot shows off the power and fear requirements quite nicely but it still would've been nice to be able to have the areas a little more even in terms of actually being onscreen to kill rather than to scare great as those scenes are. The only other main area of problem here is the film's rather curious decision to use the firsthalf of the film as a flashback sequence that explains the whole relationship with everyone. This isn't all that wellexposed coming across as something that could've been told effectively in a more subdued way that manages to get the same points across without taking as long to spell everything out as it does. That's the main problem with it being that since it decides to focus on the relationship quirks of the friends while telling a flashback a point not revealed until the end of the sequence before going into either scenes that the individual telling wouldn't have known about or into another flashback within it just feels as though the entire setup could've come off a little differently than what is shown while still telling the same story and hitting the same points. These here are the film's flaws.The Final Verdict With a lot of good stuff and only a few minor flaws to it there wasn't much really holding this one back in the genre. Give this one a shot if you're into the ghostly revenge genre or a huge of fan of Asian horror while those who aren't really into these films should heed caution.Rated URR Graphic Violence Graphic Language and Brief Nudity";

	schema:reviewBody "Buying this movie was a blind buy...I knew a little about the flick but something about the film had me interested in it so I bought. I hoped it would be as good as the other Asian horror flicks I have been watching lately and boy...was this film great. I really liked this film a lot I loved the way it was directed I loved the original take on a played out concept and I loved the acting. Great acting all around except for some ham acting from a certain actor towards the end. Only a true talented director with a vision can take elements from a genre that your all too familiar with and totally blows your head with it. Korean director ByeongKi Ahn really came through with talent and true insight in a genre that's so easily ripped off...he shows new takes on slasher moments and gives the film a real edge that most post scream movies don't have. Now let's start off with the most important...the script. I really liked the script for this film. It was smartoriginal in it's take of the movie's plot and pretty great story telling. Right from the get go this film had me watching and I was never bored. I love how the film started one way then slowly started changing on me without me even noticing it. I loved how since this film is about that Jhorror genrebut it's actually KHorror because it's Korean but slowly it becomes more complex and moves away from the Jhorror movies we have all come to know. Smart lad this ByeongKi Ahn is...much talented. I loved the characters in this film. They were all wonderfully played by actors who looked young and had the chops to pull it off. And the girlswow...I have never seen so many hot looking girls in one film. I meanthey were hot...I couldn't take my eyes off of them and they also knew how to act. Simply wonderful. I liked how this movie short of had that Scream type of vibe with the whole teen thing but I also liked how they didn't try to rip it off either. This movie is smarter than Scream I think Scream was a fan boys fantasy...this film is just that...a film. They took something that everyone here in the states has ripped off to the point of deathScream mainly and did something smart by mixing it into the booming Jhorror genre and making something totally cool and clever. I also liked how there were no evil people just misguided and human characters. The characters never did anything to make me gooh I know why they did that...it was just so that the character to serve the story In this movie it's the other way around...the characters are the story and the movie was about them and something they had done. No this isn't like the ripped off crap that was I know what you did last summerwhich was ripped off from the flawed 80's flick Prom Night. No I know what you did last summer and Prom Night wish they could be as good as Nightmare. From the beginning we're never told what the characters didsomething that Prom Night really messed up on by telling us too early and then trying to us care about those same characters who did something really bad No this movie allows us to know these people as characters and then they tell us what happened.Great show. Now for some of the beefs. The third act was kicking I mean I loved it. Most other Jhorror movies would have done the third act in the same way but this film doesn't and I loved them for that. But my only beef with that is the acting from the bad guy I mean come on...the dude spend most of the movie being calm and level headed and then at the end he goes all loco. Wow how the hell that happen? Another beef is with the last pace of the film. First off let me say I loved fast pace it really helped me get interested in this film and never allowed me to get bored. But at moments it seemed like it went a little to fast paced to the point where I didn't know what I was watching. I was left goingwhat? How that happen? At times I found myself lost. But it's all good...the film had a few beefs but it still rocked hard. Now back to my favorite thing about the film...the directing. Man ByeongKi Ahn kicked all kinds of tail with this bad boy. Man I was really impressed with all the style and talent he showed without being all look at me I'm so talented because I'm using all this style No homeboy handled his stuff good. He rocked the acting he handled the drama the unfolding story and the horror. Manboy knows his stuff and brought so much to this cool flick. Great show.".

Orphan is one of those flicks that while benefiting from a decent studio push simply didn't impart any compelling reason to check it out based on the trailer which is too bad because this is actually one tight little thriller.Directed by Spain's Jaume ColletSerra House of Wax it tells the story of Esther Isabelle Fuhrman a 9year old Russian orphan who is adopted by Kate and John Coleman Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard  a decision motivated in part by the stillborn birth of their third child.An oddball from the start Esther at first charms the Colemans with her personality artistic flair and independence however it's apparent that there's more going on with Esther than meets the eye. She quickly forms a bond with Max Aryana Engineer the couple's deaf daughter by learning sign language but is resented by their son Daniel Jimmy Bennett who views her with contempt. All of which forms a basis for familial tension further compounded by the skeletons of Kate's history of alcoholism and John's past infidelity.Telling a surprisingly layered story that strays into uncomfortable territory given how it deals with children in peril the shiniest gem in this entertaining nugget is that of Isabelle Fuhrman upon whose performance the movie succeeds or fails. While acting is uniformly top notch throughout Fuhrman spectacularly establishes herself as one of the most remarkable young talents currently working in cinema and that's a statement not to be taken lightly. This 12yearold who had only one prior film credit on her resume simply blazes her way across the screen in a performance that ranges from sweet to seductive to psychotic. This is her movie and she makes the most of it and if she doesn't mature into one of Hollywood's premier stars I'll be most surprised.Orphan won't win any awards despite Fuhrman's impressive performance and might well get passed over by many based on the trailer all of which is too bad because this is one stray that movie audiences would do well to adopt.".

It's brilliantly cast  Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard are topnotch as usual but what really stood out where the natural performances director Jaume Collet Serra was able to get from the child actors. Usually child actors are painful to watch but 12 yearold Isabelle Fuhrman gives a terrifying chilling performance that is worthy of praise. Aryana Engineer in her screen debut as the deaf little sister Max is adorable and almost steals the show in every scene. The stylish cinematography editing and sound are fantastic as well. I saw Orphan at a packed advance screening and the audience had a blast. ColletSerra knows how to pull the strings and engage the audience as they were screaming and laughing at all the right moments. There are plenty of fun and playful tensionrelieving scenes and several cathartic moments when the audience erupted into cheers. When the credits rolled the audience even applauded. The second showing I went to was just as receptive  the audience went nuts. They were collectively screaming cheering yelling at the screen cringing applauding and enthusiastically welcoming the comic relief. One guy commented afterwards I never get scared by movies but that was the scariest movie I've ever seen. Audience participation for both screenings I went to were very high. The film improves upon second viewing with the knowledge of the twist. I was able to focus more on details and clues and the anticipation of my favorite scenes made for a much more rewarding experience. It's even more chilling and cathartic the second time around.It's far from perfect though  there are way too many predictable jumpfalse scares with the soundtrack blaring to try to startle the viewer. The last part of the movie becomes a slasher flick replete with clichs and a oneliner. There is a talky scene where Esther reveals herself to her adoptive mother that is totally unneeded as well as a crucial line regarding Danny the older son which really should've been cut. It's also a bit long at 2 hours  for an exploitative B movie this is unusual although time is devoted to character development. Esther is multidimensional and even sympathetic at times  I would love to see a prequel based on her character.Orphan is definitely not for kids  aside from the antiadoption angle there is plenty of dangerous imitable behavior. The violence committed by and toward children is shocking realistic and brutal. This is a ballsy film that throws kids into horrific ordeals.It may be a B movie but it's a damn good one that knows its audience. The basic idea is nothing new except for the unexpected twist but you knew that from the trailer and synopsis. If you were still interested or if you're a horror fan that is able to look past some clichs and logical jumps in exchange for horrific chills you'll have a fun time. The phenomenal child performances alone are enough to recommend Orphan.".

Personally I found this film very entertaining suspenseful and the plot cleverly written. Without getting into too much detail and ruining it for everyone else this movie is in a category in which the story could become true in the future. Isabel Furhman did a great job starring as an orphan adopted by a couple who was looking to fill a void in the family due to an earlier tragedy. Her ability to manipulate her siblings as well as her adoptive father thoroughly frustrates the mother. As the movie progresses her manipulative abilities become more apparent and deadly. This is a mustsee movie and I said money well spent.".

Having said that however I personally didn't find it too amazing either.The first two things that came to mind with this film were1.The very last line is clearly stolen from the Ring 2 and the situation in which it appears is also way too similarIn factthe whole evil girl with questionable history thing has been done in an all too similar fashion enough times by now..2.It is in fact almost an almost identical story line to The good son with the attempted husband stealingwife bumping off antics of The Hand That Rocks The Cradle and the token creepy screwed up girl with no apparent history and zany mother from RingThe RingorJuonThe Grudge series.I decided that maybe it was a bit harsh to overly judge the movie purely based on these factsso I decided to forget that I had seen this all before and look at it for it's own merit and individuality. But it still sadly left me cold in the end. The characters seemed to stumble their way through the entire movie switching personalities ever five minutes to suit the scene. Hints such as the cheating husband seem to have a point but then prove red herringsdropped from the plot line as soon as they are mentioned leaving several unanswered questions that would have been usefully wrapped up by the end if not before.There comes a revelation that the mother is apparently a recovering recovered alcoholic but the scene where she has it out with the therapist seems a bit too harshly played from the husband's point of view.He goes from being this exceptionally loving husband having had a few niggles with his wifeto suddenly pulling an emotional 360 and completely turning on her...Which brings me to my next pointThe father then allows himself to get totally steaming while Left in the care of his two other children and almost seduced by Esther who is suddenly wearing a flirty grown up outfit and shed loads of makeup.I also cannot get how on earth these parents could not see what this girl actually was doing wrong. They clearly huge signs and the distress being cause to their children but still ignored it and allowed them to be left alone with her.The mother who does actually start to suspect Esther is shall we say not right from near enough the word go still fumbles along blindly watching it all unfold up to a point. Let's look at this closer 1.They didn't even think to fully wait for her history before adopting her. not to mention an alcoholic who had been in jail for neglect being allowed to adopt anyway so easily..?2.Esther was extremely violent and dangeroushad been in a mental institutewhere staff were fully aware of her Secret. She then killed her adopted families and yet she somehownot mentioned got out and managed to get into an orphanage with no other known history and be re adopted. And finallyyesit's thedramatic twist.I Kind of guessed just from basic reviews saying it would be an obvious oneand confirmed it within less than 15 minutes into the movie itself to be honest! And going back to the whole over looking thing She was examined by a DOCTOR. Who did not expect she was not a 9 year old child?? She looks anything but 9 without all her getup on! There were some redeeming qualities howeversuch as great acting by Isabelle Fuhrman who plays Estherquite a challenging role for someone so young and she pulls of the accent very well too.There are also some jumpy and slightly unnerving bits  I won't spoil any more! all of which left me quite on edge. The paintings were quite creepy and cleverly done too.But overall I was fairly disappointed by the whole affair it could have been played out so much better.".

This couple should and would have been refused as potential candidates for adoption.

What happens in the end well I almost felt it was welldeserved.Another problem with the characterizations is that these two adults were so obviously NOT ideal parent material. How many parents could look their child in the eyes and say are you sure that no one did anything bad to you? and NOT recognize the look of sheer terror in that child's face?There are people who WILL be very queasy and uncomfortable towards the end of this film.

Though the movie was 2hr long it was a clever move by the director to inject some meaningful comedy into the movie so as to maintain the attention of the audience. An interesting point to note is that audience laughed quite a bit for almost 60 of the movie and then were shocked as the plot took twists and turns. This combination of humor along with shock is what makes this movie a brilliant thriller.All in all the movie was successful in grabbing my attention believing in such offbeat concepts and lastly giving the worth of my money. Hope you all go watch this terrific movie and feel the heat inside the AirConditioned Theaters. My rating for this movie 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Orphan was a movie that truly did surprised me. I mean I came into this movie honestly not having any idea which direction it would take me I mean sure it looked good but then again the 30 second previews made it seem a bit mediocre. When the movie went off I was very pleased by what I had seen. The things I love most about Orphan is how they present and introduce these characters so well. The minute I saw the main couple I couldn't help but take a liking to them and Esther who very easily steals the show is incredibly likable. As a matter of fact the thing I do love a lot about the film is how they take their time in the story I loved how for the first half or so you see Esther adapting to her new surroundings and I became extremely indulged into this. I also think they balanced out the character of Esther well. I mean this performance and character could have easily been portrayed as this overthetop annoying nonintimidating and nonbelievable character but not once do you ever feel that. Also it is very entertaining and you're hooked from the moment you see this little girl Esther. It was also clever at times to where you feel a sense of danger as far as the story goes because it's literally like anything can happen. Even if does begin to make you mad for whatever reason you still can't help but keep watching and wondering. At times it may feel predictable but they've already presented these characters so well that you can't but feel that maybe you haven't predicted it. I will say I wished Orphan HAD paced itself a little better I mean they don't immediately jump into the story but when they do it feels rushed and as if they fear the audience won't care about the characters when it's not true. Also towards the end the characters start to lose liking so much so that I couldn't help but look at these charactersin particular the mom and dad and say Who are you and why are you being such an unlikable stereotype! As a result of the characters acting stupid and stereotypical at this point in the film it just became predictable to an extent where you knew what was going to happen. Last you know I don't know how I felt about the twist it was done well enough to where it would fit the storyline but I feel it defeats the shocking brutal and thrilling nature of the film. Anyways overall Orphan is one of the better thrillers you'll probably see this year and even if you're not too big on these kind of films I still recommend Orphan".

	schema:reviewBody "Orphan is sometimes regarded as a horror film but in my view it is an example of that subgenre of the thriller which I have come to regard as the  from Hell movie a type of film which enjoyed great popularity in the late eighties and early nineties following the success of Fatal Attraction. The basic premise of such films is that the life of the protagonist is turned upsidedown by the arrival of a stranger who initially seems friendly but who quickly turns out to be dangerous generally a murderer or psychopath. In most films this stranger is an adult but this film brings us the adoptedchildfromHell. The expression from Hell incidentally is not to be taken literally Orphan might start out like an unacknowledged remake of The Omen but the child's evil is explained by a plot twist which has nothing to do with Satan or the supernatural.Like a number of recent American films this one was actually shot in Canada presumably for financial reasons but owing to the average American cinemagoer's lack of interest in anything that happens north of the fortyninth parallel the filmmakers were forced to pretend through the use of Connecticut licence plates that the action is taking place in New England. After their third child is stillborn John and Kate Coleman adopt Esther a 9yearold Russian girl from the local orphanage. Unfortunately for them Esther turns out to be a badly behaved little girl one whose bad behaviour goes far beyond the normal bounds of childish mischief. By the time the film is over she will have killed several people and attempted to kill several others. The film has been criticised for a lack of realism and it certainly seems strange that John and Kate are permitted to adopt a child in the first place given their obviously unsuitable background. Kate is recovering from alcoholism and we learn that she was at fault in an incident when her own daughter Maxine nearly drowned in the garden pond. It also seems strange how slow John is to accept that there is anything wrong with the behaviour of his adopted daughter Kate grows suspicious at a much earlier stage. I was interested by the suggestion of another reviewer that John's reluctance could be explained by the fact that he is at a subconscious level at least sexually attracted to Esther but idea this was for obvious reasons something the filmmakers were unable to pursue. The idea that an otherwise respectable husband and father might harbour latent paedophile tendencies is something audiences would find extremely disturbing. The final twist I won't say what it is has also struck many as implausible but at least it is a twist which if one can accept it helps to make sense of what has gone before. Too many films these days especially thrillers end in a surprise twist which makes everything which has preceded it seem like nonsense.The film does have its good points. The 12yearold Isabelle Fuhrman is excellent as Esther in some ways wise beyond her years yet also strange emotionless and creepy. Incidentally most of the best villains in .. from Hell movies are female such as Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction Rebecca de Mornay in The Hand That Rocks the Cradle or Jennifer Jason Leigh in Single White Female. There are films of this type with male villains Pacific Heights Bad Influence Domestic Disturbance but they tend to be less memorable. Another good performance comes from another childactress eightyearold Aryana Engineer as the deafmute Maxine both girls in fact stand out more than any of the adults.The film is also suitably atmospheric being shot against a snowbound winter landscape even if it does make it seem as though winter in Connecticut lasts all year. At least it makes a change from all those films Housesitter and The Cider House Rules being recent examples which suggest that the New England climate consists of twelve months of permanent autumn. My own criticism of the film would be of some of the social attitudes revealed in it. The Cold War may be over but there is still a tendency in America and to some extent in Britain and Western Europe as well to regard Eastern Europe with suspicion. Anywhere east of the former Iron Curtain is regarded as a strange mysterious land whose inhabitants pose some vague threat to the West whether by stealing our jobs dragging us into their internecine tribal quarrels or by exporting their criminal elements to us. The film taps into these fears it is significant that the menacing Esther claims to be Russian and is actually from Estonia a part of the map which as far as most Westerners are concerned might still have here be dragons marked on it. The film also taps into some of our anxieties about adoption specifically middleclass fears that adopted children especially if originally from workingclass stock are likely to be contaminated by bad blood or inherited criminal propensities. Even if they do not actually suffer from any such genetic taint there is always a fear that such children will never be able to bond with their adopted parents in the same way as they would with their biological parents. Overall Orphan is a reasonably wellmade film a tense and gripping if occasionally implausible thriller with a couple of good acting performances. The prejudices it reveals however are worrying. 610".

No true therapist who has had any real training and she was in fact a doctor! would treat their client as she treated Kate. All in all the movie was not terrible but I've seen it a thousand times.

	schema:reviewBody "In motion pictures it's a widespread belief that children are the embodiment of pure evil. Perhaps not all kids are the spawn of Satan but horror filmmakers realise that evil disguised behind the eyes of a seemingly innocent child is an effective way of amplifying the scare factor. Into this genre now steps 2009's Orphan. Instead of being an overly effective suspense piece however this is a predominantly boring meandering film which suffers from repetition and poor scripting. If the creepy kid horror genre is in need of resuscitation this subpar affair will not provide it.The plot in a nutshell concerns Kate Farmiga and John Sarsgaard. They're married with two kids but Kate's recent miscarriage has put a strain on their relationship that's already burdened by John's infidelity and Kate's battle with alcoholic tendencies. Seeking to introduce a new child into their family the couple decide to adopt. During a visit to the local orphanage John connects with a strange yet astonishingly intelligent 9yearold Russian girl named Esther Fuhrman. As you may or may not have guessed Esther is no ordinary child and seems to have been specially ordered from the Eastern European School of Creepy Kids. She distinguishes herself from those around her not only because she's mature beyond her years but because she also appears trapped in a 19th Century timewarp with her fondness for Victorian doll dresses and ribbons. For her introductory scenes Esther of course appears beguiling and innocent. Once she's adopted by John and Kate the film then sets out to defy our preconceptions of how eerie and horrifying this little girl can be. And good heavens is she creepy.If it means anything  and in dealing with the consistently awful creepy kid subgenre it likely does  Orphan is not the worst of its kind. It's atmospheric enough and contains a number of generally unsettling sequences not to mention there's a solid attempt to delve into the characters' lives so that they comes across as more than bloodspurting automatons. Yet in spite of these strengths the film remains a ridiculous bythenumbers horror show. Spanish director Jaume Collet Serra poorly orchestrates so many clichd boo! moments designed to make the audience jump such as mirror reveals on top of faux scares in which a viewer believes they're about to jump but  surprise!  nothing's there. The repetition is irritating and laughable. These moments are hardly effective too since the music with its rising disharmonies and sudden crashes suggests there's a scare on the way. Orphan is also predictable from a narrative standpoint. It's easy to guess Esther's next move well before she makes it. And for the climax the filmmakers call upon the most embarrassing genre convention imaginable giving superhuman abilities to a weak character. At least the final showdown is relatively entertaining. Highly predictable yet still satisfying nonetheless.In addition to all this the characters tend to act in whatever way serves the plot best. For example it makes no sense for Kate and John to adopt Esther when she's clearly out of synch with the rest of the family. Furthermore Kate is sometimes a raging alcoholic but at other times an overly caring mother. Infidelity issues are raised in the first half but they hardly surface again. At times John is a trusting loving husband and father but at other times he's both ignorant and disloyal. Not to mention these characters are so stupid. What parents never see their child undress? What parents allow their child to skip dental appointments and basically live in solitude in a mansionlike home? Why would noone question Esther's ribbon accessories or her anti social behaviour? Furthermore John sets a new standard for Horror Movie Dumbass  he's bizarrely enamoured with this Russian girl even when she rats him out for flirting with their neighbour! and ignores his wife's desperate warnings. All of this is coupled with a major violation of Roger Ebert's main tenets for an unsuccessful narrative if the main plotpoint could be easily resolved  in this case a mandatory medical examination should've been conducted by a staterun child protective services agency prior to approving the adoption  everything falls apart.Credit where credit is due  in the acting department things aren't too shabby at all. Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard share solid chemistry which makes their relationship believable. Isabelle Fuhrman is a terrific find she's cute and charming which makes her behaviour far more unsettling. The convincing Russian accent adds to her unnerving presence as well. For a horror movie of this type to boast such terrific performances is nothing short of a miracle. Yet if one sets aside the solid acting the interesting final plot twist a few effective set pieces and the fact it still works on a pretty basic level Orphan remains a generic clichridden suspense film that strains credulity to breaking break. If you're in the midst of a strained marriage and are considering adopting a Soviet child you may find this to be a terrific horror outing. As for everyone else...nah it ain't worth the effort to get through these two distinctly mediocre hours.".

First it creates a good atmosphere and causes the viewer emotions of sympathy for the good guys and fear and anger for the bad guy. Second it contains a clever twist that could not be foreseen although some guesses will come close. Then there's the bad things. This film is full of every clich in the book. Every character you have ever seen in a similar film in the past is present. The one person who suspects the truth but whose skeletons in the closet make them noncredible. The person who is completely ignorant to the truth and thinks the other is crazy. The one who knows the truth but is swayed into not telling anything. And the one who decides to expose the truth and pays for it. And the villain who is evil for the sake of being evil and does evil things because they are so very evil. If one removes the sentiment of dejavu that this film casts on its viewers what is left is a film that maintains a certain degree of interest but has nothing to offer that has not been done before and better. Granted the acting is credible the cinematography is good and the ending is satisfying. However there are just so many clichs in this film that halfway through any experienced viewer of the genre will have figured the rest of the film out with the exception of the one clever twist.".

It's also worth mentioning the secrecy built over Esther backgrounds which is finally revealed in the end. It's so well constructed and performed that you get hooked throughout the whole movie without even noticing that it's a strategy put into use by the director. Now the dignified work delivered by the cast. It's so opposite to the farfetched acting of other movies. Actually I wasn't expecting much from the actors since there were no renowned names listed but they lived up to my expectations. Isabelle who was only 12 when the movie was shot was one of the biggest findings in my opinion she just managed to play very convincingly an arduous and demanding role of a mentallydisordered girl. So if you are already done with horror movies based on a thin plot and that don't go deep into the inner feelings of human beings try Orphan I assure you are going to like it.".

The foolishness of the adult characters. The slide into genre formula and finally the unsatisfying twist.The CopOutThe idea of a child trying to steal away an adult male from his wife is an interesting one. The Hand That Rocks The Cradle 1992 could well have been an influence on this movie but the role reversal from a psycho nanny to an adopted child has resulted in scaring the filmmakers away from exploring more 'controversial' issues.In fact the 'child' does successfully evict the wife from the marital bed and the Father is a willingly accomplice. Here is the moment were the film could have elevated itself into something more challenging for the audience but consciously failed to do so.Could the Fathers sexual desire for his adopted daughter have been a reason why he supports her almost unconditionally against his own wife? The question is posed but left unexplored. If the Father had in fact had sexual relations with his new daughter he would have been easier to manipulate and the 'twist' would have in some ways excused his 'transgression'.Sex is still a Hollywood taboo and especially underaged sex. Stanley Kubrick tried to explore this subject back in 1962 with Lolita but he was ahead of his time and the film suffered from imposed restrictions and censorship. While murder and torture have continued to become more and more graphic the exploration of sexual drives as a narrative force have remained largely untapped. The last movie to show sex as part of the narrative arch was David Cronenberg's A History Of Violence from 2005. Judging from the response to that movie it was only the explicit sexual acts and not the graphic violence that upset the 'American' audience. It feels that the core premise of Orphan that a sexually predatory child tries to usurp the role of wife by any means necessary was exorcised because of political correctness. The father could not be seen to desire his new daughter or act upon that desire yet his actions compound some guilt.With Orphan the slasherpsycho formula limits the exploration of more profound themes and the 'twist' is an apology for the child's murderous behaviour. If the filmmakers never wanted to explore the theme of sex between an adult and a minor then why make it a contributing factor to the resulting bloody violence?".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't know much about this film before seeing it but the writeup did intrigue me slightly so I thought I'd give it a go. It's a little too long for my liking but quite well made if a little clich in places. I guess I should have done a little more research but then again I have uncovered the odd 'gem' this way in the past. But I digress let's have a look at what Orphan is all about.Kate and John Coleman have just lost their baby a daughter they were going to call Jessica. She was dead at birth. Needing something to fill the void they decide to adopt. By the way they already have two children a boy Daniel and a girl Max who is partially deaf and uses sign language to communicate. The family are comfortably off and live in a big house in the countryside. Visiting an orphanage John meets a nine year old girl called Esther. She is originally from Russia and is delightful. He convinces Kate that she's the one and they bring her home a few weeks later. Unfortunately Esther is not what she seems and the Coleman's are in for a very bumpy ride as she sets about her plan for them. I'm not going to say any more on the plot I believe that should be enough to intrigue you.Although it was very well made I did have a bit of a problem sympathising with the Coleman's. It seems they have everything going for them in terms of lifestyle job financial security etc. but somehow that isn't enough for them. It's not as if their characters come over as particularly nurturing either Kate a recovering alcoholic and John has been known to have a roving eye in the past. But if you can get past all that there's a pretty creepy story behind it all.Decent performances all round particularly from Vera Farmiga as Kate Peter Sarsgaard as John and especially from Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther she was particularly creepy. Also worth a mention were CCH Pounder as Sister Abigail Jimmy Bennett as Daniel and Aryana Engineer as Max.Putting aside my incomprehension of the reasons for the Coleman's wanting to adopt I did find the film quite disturbing. Esther particularly so the way she manipulates situations and how she's always listening in is quite unnerving. As I said at the beginning it is a little clich in places and it is way too long but over all quite a sinister tale glad I watched it in daylight!. Finally a mention for the guys who do the opening and closing credits very cleverly done IMO nice work. I guess over all it's recommended but only just.My Score 6.110".

But if you can get past all that there's a pretty creepy story behind it all.Decent performances all round particularly from Vera Farmiga as Kate Peter Sarsgaard as John and especially from Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther she was particularly creepy. Also worth a mention were CCH Pounder as Sister Abigail Jimmy Bennett as Daniel and Aryana Engineer as Max.Putting aside my incomprehension of the reasons for the Coleman's wanting to adopt I did find the film quite disturbing. Esther particularly so the way she manipulates situations and how she's always listening in is quite unnerving. As I said at the beginning it is a little clich in places and it is way too long but over all quite a sinister tale glad I watched it in daylight!. Finally a mention for the guys who do the opening and closing credits very cleverly done IMO nice work. I guess over all it's recommended but only just.My Score 6.110";

Then they adopt Esther Isabelle Fuhrman. All we know is that there's something wrong with Esther.Esther greatly disrupts the family's life  with a lot of violence and psychosis. Don't forget this is a horror film. Although that is easy to forget because the plot is driven by characters  perhaps a first for this genre? The characters are integral to a story that was so well researched that it's actually legit.

There is also some typical early seventies social commentary on pollution and Nino Manfredi shows he plays a nice guy really well.

Doc along with the bounty hunter Slade Carroll Luis Dvila arrive in a town where Doc is mistaken for sheriff Kitchener  as taking his identity Doc becomes the city Marshall and Slade as deputy . Along the way  they face off tramplers and a famous Mexican outlaw called Pablo Reyes Fernando Sancho . Doc MacGregor is actually a surgeon and at the end he heals a sympathetic boy Loris Loddi . Doc and Slade suffer doublecrosses  attacks  betrayal by a corrupt Mayor Umberto Raho as well as a lot of twists and turns until a final assault on the town . This L'uomo Dalla Pistola D'Oro  also titled Doc Hands of Steel  or Man with the Golden Pistol or The Man Who Came to Kill or El Pistolero De Oro results to be a soso tortillaPasta Western in which two drifters arrive in a little town to resolve conflicts among nasty robbers and corrupt authority . All in all  this film is predominantly a Spanish film rather than an Italian one . It's a two country coproduction but is clearly dominated by the Spanish contingent and the traditional leanings of the Spanish producers of the time have their stamp on the entire proceedings . The Spanish westerns of this era were far more likely to try and emulate their American source material than cultivate a distinctive style of their own the way the Italians were doing but their product  though if you like westerns remains lightly watchable  but also it turns out to be middling . Mediocre Butifarra Western realized in traditional style with a screenplay written by Giovanni Simonelli  Jos Antonio De La Loma and Alfonso Balczar himself  including boring dialogue  silly situations  plot twists and turns . ItalianSpanish coproduction filmed in Catalunya  full of familiar faces  action  exaggerated characters  crossfire and lots of shots and fights . The film packs thrills  shootouts  brawls  and results to be entertaining but very mediocre . It's a middlebudget film with ordinary actors  technicians  decent production values and average results . There is plenty of action in the movie  guaranteeing some shoot'em up or stunts every few minutes . It's an exciting western with breathtaking showdown between protagonists  Carl Mohner and Luis Davila  against their enemies  adding some thrilling scenes at the ending . It stars Carl Mhner 19212005 who performed other Westerns as 30 Winchesters for El Diablo or Gold Train  but also acted in thrillers and dramas as Babysitter It takes a thief The last bridge Cave of the living dead Sink the Bismark and his greatest hit was Rififi . Costars Luis Davila who takes on a band of crooks  unethical Mayor  his gang . Davila starred during the sixties and seventies several action films as well as Chorizo or Paella Western such as Relevo para pistolero Dynamite Jim  Viva Carrancho Tumba para Forajido and Pancho Villa  some of them directed by Alfonso Balcazar . The cast and support cast are passable . Furthermore  there appears ordinary secondaries of SpaghettiPaella Western  as SpanishItalian players  Gloria Milland as a beautiful widow  scar Pellicer  Umberto Raho and the little boy Loris Loddi . And  of course the great Fernando Sancho in his usual role as a Mexican outlaw  as he is terrific  he subsequently would play similar roles in other Spaghettis . Atmospheric cinematography by Mario Capriotti in Scope and Eastmancolor . Being regularly photographed and necessary a fine remastering because the filmcopy is washedout . The picture mostly filmed in atmospheric scenarios on location in Fraga  Huesca  similar to Almeria  and a Western village located in Spugles De Llobregat  it resulted to be the locations where were shot lots of Westerns produced and directed by Catalan people as Alfonso Balcazar  J.J.

After the disappointment of Christopher Columbus's noble attempt we finally have a definitive version of the musical to remember it by. This is it. This is the one.All I could think through laughter and tears was How much money did they spend to make that Hollywood version when all they needed to do was THIS? Set up a camera crew in the Nederlander theater and capture the show as it was intended to be seen.Roger never sings from atop a butte here. I'm sure there will be a selection of fans who were never able to see the show on Broadway or on tour who first loved the Columbus film and it's soundtrack it's a great soundtrack after all and won't understand this Filmed on Broadway version without the context of being there. But if you've never seen either version I suggest starting here. And for those of us who have seen it live once or many times here it is in a time capsule.I appreciate the closeups. In the movie theater today I wanted the crew to pull back a bit and show us the entire stage and staging more often. That's my only gripe and why I rate it a 9 out of 10. Then I think about it on the small screen in your living room and how tiny the stage would look at that size and understand. This version is meant to take the experience home.The bricks of the wall at the back of the stage up where Mimi comes out to play? You can see their texture. I imagined the hands of every girl who played Mimi caressing their surfaces and thought We've never seen that before not so close. The overlapping chorus of Angel buying Collins his coat Roger introducing Mimi to Mark and Joanne talking to Maureen on the phone has never been clearer thanks to the camera cuts. The closeup of Angel as she's leaving the stage in death was beautiful.The best testament to how well this transported me came afterward. My girlfriend and I walked out of the local cineplex fully immersed in Manhattan. It was jarring to see the trees of the suburbs and not the towers noise people and cabs of the Theatre District. I drove away expecting the City's traffic maybe a bridge but we suddenly found ourselves in our hometown. So sad. I was hoping to stop at Grimaldi's.".

It was a great idea to do the movie and an even better idea to release the final Broadway show on DVD. It is making it possible for those of us who only learned of Rent late in the game or for those of us who were too young when it came out or for those of us who don't live in or visit New York to see this amazing piece of theatre. The cast did a great job and Jonathan's beautifully written story will live on in this performance. This story is the heartwarming tale of eight friends with various issues including some main ones of living in poverty and the HIVAIDS epidemic. The music is incredible and it's not all showtunes but rather it is a combination of various styles including rock gospel and pop. It makes a statement and it warms your heart. It takes a couple watches of Rent to fully understand the story but once you do you're captured in its magic for life.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a word beautiful. Now I must admit I'm biased given that I've seen RENT on Broadway eight times and can pretty much recite it in my sleep but by any standards I think this film is pretty amazing. I came into the whole RENT world fairly late first falling in love with the 2005 movie and then after seeing the show realizing how truly horrible the 2005 movie was. RENT filmed live on Broadway seemed to me like a 'haha in your face' to Chris Columbus. The perfect simplicity of this movie overshadowed Columbus' mangled depressing version that was just all wrong.Although I still missed the thrill of seeing the show live of applauding along with the rest of the theatre when Mimi begins 'Out Tonight' or when Angel enters for 'Today 4 U' this movie is pretty much the best you can get without actually seeing the show on Broadway. You see things you might miss live the faded 'Only the good die young' emblazoned on the back of Roger's jacket or the look of peaceful satisfaction that crosses Angel's face when Mark finally refers to her as 'she.' All in all the solos and duets were amazingly done and gave you a whole new perspective on the show. The one thing I wished the movie had focused more on was the ensemble numbers. For big numbers like 'La Vie Boheme' or 'Christmas Bells' seeing everyone doing everything at once is kind of the point. When the camera zoomed in on individuals during these scenes they lost a bit of their impact for me. However having seen those numbers live previously it was nothing that bothered me too much. Overall though it was fabulous. As long as RENT is closed and I can't see it at the Nederlander I'm perfectly happy with watching this version at home.".

This movie was the final performance captured on film.I think it's unavoidable that I would draw comparisons between this cast and the casts of the touring troupe I watched in Singapore and the original cast whose album I've played over and over. And also unavoidable that I would think this cast doesn't quite compare simply because it's a much more spiritual experience to watch Rent live and because I'm so familiar with the original cast recording.Most of the cast I was fine with but I thought Renee Goldsberry who played Mimi was a bit too feral and not vulnerable enough and Justin Johnston who played Angel wasn't feminine enough. There was also a bit too much energy in the air which is understandable since it was the last performance but while it worked for the faster numbers it made the emotional scenes a bit too dramatic.But I quibble the actors perform well and the director knows the production intimately enough to have the cameras capture all the right angles to best highlight each scene. And this is Rent  I went through the same emotional rollercoaster as when I first watched it. And while this isn't quite the same as watching it live it comes pretty darn close.

I have high standards that are maybe a little too high for my favorite musical. After seeing the watereddown gleeish movie version in high schoolI could go on and seeing a bad traveling version I almost gave up on Rent. Five years later I come across what I've always wanted a recording of the stage show! I went in with my doubts but I think this is probably the next best thing to seeing the Original cast. Hell I knew I wanted to buy it ten minutes in. It's a shame they didn't make this for the last original cast show but i digress. It brings forward the true feeling of Rentsomething the film didn't do. Not to mention you get to hear ALL the music and see the story Jon Larson wrote. The actors aren't perfect at all times I feel some seem like their copying their character voices from the OBC. and some lack the power and or soul for their role but this is really nip picky of me because you can tell they LOVE the show. As Rentheads do I'll say my favorites I really like Mark Moreean and Collins! I felt Meme seemed a little to tamed didn't have the full edge of mimi. Roger and Angel were OK but I didn't think their voices were up to belt this stuff like it should be. Joanna the same Joanna from the movie was even MORE awesome then she was in the film. I finally feel like I can watch Rent again without all that Hollywood watered down hairspray covered cheese wiz Rent deserved better!. Viva La vie Boheme!!!!!!!".

Unable to go to the police he helps her cover it up. However later the police suspect foul play and Kyle and his partner are put on the case.  As they investigate more evidence begins to point to Kyle and it appears that Rachel has not been totally honest with him.Proof that good noir still exists.  This film never saw the inside of an UK cinema  it went straight to video on release.  However the plot is a good tangled web of murder mystery and deceit.  It manages to be twisty despite the fact that this sort of thing has been done many times before.  The plot unfolds late and very quickly managing to be believable and gripping.The main reason for this is a great performance from Ed Harris.  The feeling of him being sucking into something is written all over his face  and the way he goes from cop in control of all the details into a hunted animal is really good.  Stowe is also really good and the support cast also has quality  whether it be Charles Dance or a young looking Del Toro.Overall this may not break box office records but as a thriller it is twisty contains plenty of good lines and has a great lead performance from Harris.".

The reality however is that the plot departs from the conventional Double Indemnity template and ultimately leads to a twist which is both original and unexpected. There's a great deal to enjoy in this story of passion treachery and murder including a superb performance by Ed Harris some beautiful visual moments and even some great blues music by the excellent Anson Funderburgh and The Rockets.Kyle Bodine Ed Harris is an ace detective who's extremely adept at examining murder scenes deducing how the crime was committed and then identifying clues about the nature of the perpetrator. He's a decent man who's well respected by his colleagues but he's also lonely and sometimes arrogant. His powers of observation are normally exceptionally strong but he doesn't see what's coming when he meets and then gets seduced by the beautiful and mysterious Rachel Munro Madeleine Stowe.Rachel is married to a rich banker called Rupert Charles Dance who's a serial adulterer and wife beater. During a particularly heated confrontation with her husband Rachel shoots and kills him in self defence and then persuades Kyle to assist her in disposing of the body and covering up the evidence of what has happened. Kyle carries out these tasks with his usual efficiency but problems arise when the body is discovered and his rookie partner Lamar Dickey Benicio del Toro discovers some clues which lead to the finger of suspicion being pointed at Kyle.Ed Harris looks perfectly comfortable in his portrayal of Kyle's unassuming demeanour and is totally believable as he becomes passionate about Rachel and then increasingly desperate as he tries to prove his innocence. Madeleine Stowe shows the despondency which has overtaken Rachel as a consequence of suffering years of abuse in a loveless marriage but at other times it seems that her depression has made her unresponsive and difficult to read. This type of inscrutability is a classic trait of the femme fatale but Rachel doesn't fall unequivocally into that category as she is clearly a more sympathetic character than the conventional noir archetype.Charles Dance is good at conveying just how violent and despicable Rupert is but his attempt at a southern accent is lamentable. Benicio del Toro gives an interesting performance as a detective who initially shows a number of significant deficiencies in his range of abilities but then later in the story surprisingly seems to acquire a much better grasp of the skills needed to investigate a homicide.The visual style of this movie with its beautiful settings and wonderful shots of the lake at night contributes strongly to the overall mood and is a great credit to the work of cinematographer Willy Kurant.".

This actor is one of the best working in movies today and even if it's not a good picture Mr. Harris can be counted to give an excellent performance. His detective offers a good character study of a professional man that makes a fatal judgment when he gets involved with Rachel.Madeleine Stowe is a beautiful woman. In this movie she plays Rachel with conviction her scenes with Ed Harris shows clearly she can hold her own against anyone. Benicio Del Toro's Lamar as Lamar offers an interesting performance something we expect from him as a matter of course. Charles Dance as the rich husband who likes to fool around is only seen too short.This is a movie to watch when the weather is bad outside. It will please anyone who doesn't expect too much.".

Catching title but has absolutely nothing to do with the story.SPOILERS  Ed Harris is a bythebook detective a homicide investigator. Early on we know he will be sucked into a plot by Madeline Stowe to get rid of her husband we learn near the end she stands to gain 12million so we spend most of the film trying to figure out her tricks. We see early that her husband is having an affair. We finally find out that Harris's sidekick played by Benicio DelToro is in on the plot. He switches guns fires bullets into the sand to get slugs plants Harris' bullets to make him look guilty.There are a few inventive items. After Stowe shoots her husband in self defense and she asks Harris to help conceal the incident by getting rid of his body in a lake he throws her 9mm gun onto the top of a big rig truck so it will end up some where distant and not be found. DelToro figures out which lake the body is in by noting the odometer reading and finding a lake half that distance away. But the shootout at the end didn't seem to fit but was I guess a convenient way to bring closure to the characters. However since Stowe shoots DelToro as she watches Harris die are we to suppose she was sent to jail for a long time?  Probably not she could afford a good lawyer and probably get probation based on mental anguish.Not a waste of time but Ed Harris must do some incredibly stupid things in the name of love to get this movie to come to its intended conclusion.

And besides stupid moves are often the case in films where a femme fatale has some poor guy blinded by love and lust. Often an otherwise intelligent law abiding man throws it all away for the love of an attractive woman in trouble. The movie was visually impressive at times and the ending will stick with you.

By the end of the film he looks about ten years older than he did at the beginning. His romance with Rachel is totally convincing  just the way he looks at her says it all. All in all an interesting film which didn't deserve to sink without trace.";

China Moon's script appears to have been attempted after a cursory browsing of Noir for Dummies. Yes there's snappy patter...unfortunately it's all trite donetodeath snappy patter. There's virtually not one line I couldn't predict. When Harris and Stowe first meet the exchange is wooden and you can sense the actors struggling futilely to make something original out of it.Ed Harris gives everyone his smoldering 500yard stare but it's nothing he hasn't offered before in much better films. Stowe and he don't seem to connect on virtually any level but with a script this bad there's nothing to draw sparks from. Benecio DelToro looks bored out of his mind Pruitt Taylor Vince is completely wasted. This movie could have benefited from a more unknown fresher cast. Sending these vets into this junior high knockoff production is a little like hiring Larry Olivier to star in your kid's school pageant.Virtually nothing in the plot comes as a surprise. You find yourself thinking surely it's not this simple only to be woefully disappointed. The hookline here  Sooner or later they all f up  is so stale and stupid it's cringeworthy. And the lame attempt at a tragic ending makes it more than mockworthy....you have to have substantial investment in characters for a tragedy of this scale to really pay off.

	schema:reviewBody "China Moon is a sleeker noir with confidence. Its elements of noir are not forced upon you in the forefront making it the most optimal way to execute noirs whereas the technique is not stealing away from the show. The relationship between Detective Kyle Bodine and Rachel Munro is the main focus of the movie. In China Moon Detective Bodine has his life in relative order until he's caught up in a steamy love affair with the provocative Rachel Munro which soon takes a turn for the worse when one night Rachel shoots and kills her violent husband. Kyle helps Rachel hide the body assisting her cover up the crime. They wish to get away with it but Bodine's partner Lamar Dickey is more clever than one might suspect and he's closing in on the case. Very strong actors Madeleine Stowe and Ed Harris make this movie with very strong performances. Ed Harris is allaround great as Kyle Bodine. Harris is about one of the fifteen best male actors of alltime which is good enough for second best in this film. Madeleine Stowe is infinitely desirable as Munro. Stowe communicates effectively poignant emotions acting so effortlessly and smooth. Madeleine's definitely one of my most favorite actresses. She's to die for. Benicio Del Toro is Dickey and unassuming as a good cop just doing his job. Del Toro plays third wheel in China Moon with just as an extraordinarily acting ability as Stowe and Harris. Harris and Stowe share great chemistry although they do not appear compatible more a forbidden passion attraction which is more suitably appropriate for the film. China Moon is a seductive suspense romantic thriller. It's not an action movie. The story unravels terrifically. China Moon is an easy viewing easily attachable. I recommend getting lost in China Moon for more than an hour an hour and thirty nine minutes if you've got the time.".

On his first shift Larry soon realizes that everything at the museum is not as it seems as the statues begin to come to life after the sun sets. The Museum transforms into complete chaos with the inexperienced Larry in charge as he learns that an old Egyptian stone that came to the Museum in 1950 brings these statues to life until dawn. When Larry brings his son to spend a night with him the three old guards break into the Museum to try to steal the magical stone. Larry organizes all the historic characters to help him stop the criminals and save the museum.";

	schema:reviewBody "What a cast! Ben Stiller Owen Wilson Robin Williams Dick VanDyke Mickey Roney Bill Cobbs...I'm not a Stiller fan but in this one he was really great he steps out of his usual shtick to really anchor this movie. For once he doesn't seem to be trying too hard and avoids overdoing it.This is one of Robin Williams' better modern roles he's toned down but still quintessentially Williams. It was nice to see him in a role that he can both take seriously and have some fun with it.Owen Wilson is still awesome basically reprising his Shanghai Noon character but with a cute rather unexpected twist.Dick Van Dyke Mickey Rooney and Bill Cobbs are classic they haven't lost a step. Rooney is still the little bantam rooster with the attitude! Van Dyke clearly anchors the trio. Cobbs wasn't given much to work with for his character but his quality shines through.

From Rexie's puppydog antics to the war between Old West Cowboys and Roman Centurians there is something around every corner.The only stinker in this film is the kid. He's totally underutilized for the storyline they could have improved the storyline by either leaving the kid out of the movie entirely or by giving him something to do. The pseudoloveinterest too should have either been played up or left out.This is an entirely enjoyable family film.

	onyx:emotionText "What a cast! Ben Stiller Owen Wilson Robin Williams Dick VanDyke Mickey Roney Bill Cobbs...I'm not a Stiller fan but in this one he was really great he steps out of his usual shtick to really anchor this movie. For once he doesn't seem to be trying too hard and avoids overdoing it.This is one of Robin Williams' better modern roles he's toned down but still quintessentially Williams. It was nice to see him in a role that he can both take seriously and have some fun with it.Owen Wilson is still awesome basically reprising his Shanghai Noon character but with a cute rather unexpected twist.Dick Van Dyke Mickey Rooney and Bill Cobbs are classic they haven't lost a step. Rooney is still the little bantam rooster with the attitude! Van Dyke clearly anchors the trio. Cobbs wasn't given much to work with for his character but his quality shines through.

It's funny it's fast and wastes no time with kicking it into high gear. Great special effects especially the TRex.

	schema:headline " Great idea for a comedy but they forgot the funny parts.";
	schema:reviewBody "In Night At the Museum Ben Stiller plays his usual role as a goodhearted schlemiel thrust into a humiliating situation that he ultimately emerges from with a small measure of heroic dignity. In this instance his character Larry Daley is an out of work weekend Dad who is about to be evicted from his apartment once again and thus lose the last shred of admiration his ten year old son has for him. To keep both the apartment and the son's affections he accepts a job as night watchman at a New York City Natural History Museum where an Egyptian tablet has for some decades administered a powerful magic spell that causes history literally to come alive. Each evening the museum's wax and bone denizens human and animal alike become animate leave their various encasements and displays wander the museum's corridors and raise havoc with museum property each other and of course Larry. The human cast of characters prominently includes Teddy Roosevelt Robin Williams Sacajawea  Mizuo Peck Attila the Hun Patrick Gallagher a miniature cowboy Owen Wilson and an equally diminutive Octavius Caesar Steve Coogan while the animal crew is headed by a capuchin monkey a tyrannosaurus skeleton and a pride of lions. As we ultimately learn Larry Stiller has been selected for the job because he seems like a perfect stoogefallguy for the nefarious plans of three outgoing night watchmen Dick Van Dyke Mickey Rooney Bill Cobbs he is ostensibly replacing. Night at the Museum is based on a clever farcical concept that  one might think  would serve as a perfect vehicle for Stiller's comic persona. Unfortunately something damaging intervened in the concept's translation to an actual film namely a screenplay that is short on laughs and long on predictability and sap. Too many scenes in Night at the Museum fall humorlessly flat for instance Larry's confrontations with the museum's pompous but inarticulate curator. Others like the Oprah style pop psychological healing of Attila the Hun's inner child are almost embarrassingly bad. The scenes with diorama miniature cowboys headed by Owen Wilson and miniature Roman army led by Steve Coogan's Octavius are mildly amusing thanks to the efforts of the actors and neat special effects but again suffer from an underwritten and unimaginative script. The scenes involving Sacajawea are completely pointless other than the riff on the pronunciation of the last syllables of her name waya or weeya? By the third repetition of the joke it has been thoroughly emptied of the scant humor it contained on the first go round. And what can one say of Robin Williams' turn as Teddy Roosevelt other than that it made one fondly recall the much funnier Teddy that stole scenes in the classic Arsenic and Old Lace? Except for one brief scene where Williams is allowed to release his inventive comic genius into a parody of African Click language he is kept completely in check and thus wasted exhorting the Stiller character to rise to the heroic occasion repeating Shakespearean chestnuts about having greatness thrust upon one and mooning afterstalking Sacajawea with unrequited love.Yes Night at the Museum does evoke a few chuckles  most examples of which were included in the film's ubiquitous trailers  but it contains surprisingly little physical humor and utterly lacks wit unless one finds a scene between Stiller and the capuchin monkey concocted solely to justify the punch line stop slapping the monkey the height of cleverness. Most members of the audience I saw the film with didn't think so or they were too young or too old to get the joke. Which raises another issue with the film  what was the intended age group of its principal audience? Codgers who might delight in the bit parts of Hollywood legends? Boppers who might identify with the museum docent who upon meeting Sacajawea supposedly the subject of her 900 page doctoral dissertation is reduced to preverbal you rock!' groupie talk. Kids needing a history lesson or amused by urine gags? No doubt the intent was all of the above. Unfortunately that aim  as with much of today's Hollywood fare  ends up reaching none of the above very satisfyingly.Falling into the Codgers demographic myself the chief pleasures of Night at the Museum for me were the brief opening scene played between Stiller and reallife mother Anne Meara and the amazingly energetic performances of octogenarian Dick Van Dyke and near nonagenarian Mickey Rooney looking and acting better than he has in what? fifty years? I should also add some complimentary words for the film's visual delights highlighted by some stunning displays of forced perspective as well as the imaginative animation of a puppyish tyrannosaurus skeleton that enjoys playing fetch with one of its own colossal bones. All in all though Night at the Museum was a major disappointment.".

Night at the Museum is based on a clever farcical concept that  one might think  would serve as a perfect vehicle for Stiller's comic persona. Unfortunately something damaging intervened in the concept's translation to an actual film namely a screenplay that is short on laughs and long on predictability and sap. Too many scenes in Night at the Museum fall humorlessly flat for instance Larry's confrontations with the museum's pompous but inarticulate curator. Others like the Oprah style pop psychological healing of Attila the Hun's inner child are almost embarrassingly bad. The scenes with diorama miniature cowboys headed by Owen Wilson and miniature Roman army led by Steve Coogan's Octavius are mildly amusing thanks to the efforts of the actors and neat special effects but again suffer from an underwritten and unimaginative script. The scenes involving Sacajawea are completely pointless other than the riff on the pronunciation of the last syllables of her name waya or weeya? By the third repetition of the joke it has been thoroughly emptied of the scant humor it contained on the first go round. And what can one say of Robin Williams' turn as Teddy Roosevelt other than that it made one fondly recall the much funnier Teddy that stole scenes in the classic Arsenic and Old Lace? Except for one brief scene where Williams is allowed to release his inventive comic genius into a parody of African Click language he is kept completely in check and thus wasted exhorting the Stiller character to rise to the heroic occasion repeating Shakespearean chestnuts about having greatness thrust upon one and mooning afterstalking Sacajawea with unrequited love.Yes Night at the Museum does evoke a few chuckles  most examples of which were included in the film's ubiquitous trailers  but it contains surprisingly little physical humor and utterly lacks wit unless one finds a scene between Stiller and the capuchin monkey concocted solely to justify the punch line stop slapping the monkey the height of cleverness. Most members of the audience I saw the film with didn't think so or they were too young or too old to get the joke. Which raises another issue with the film  what was the intended age group of its principal audience? Codgers who might delight in the bit parts of Hollywood legends? Boppers who might identify with the museum docent who upon meeting Sacajawea supposedly the subject of her 900 page doctoral dissertation is reduced to preverbal you rock!' groupie talk. Kids needing a history lesson or amused by urine gags? No doubt the intent was all of the above. Unfortunately that aim  as with much of today's Hollywood fare  ends up reaching none of the above very satisfyingly.Falling into the Codgers demographic myself the chief pleasures of Night at the Museum for me were the brief opening scene played between Stiller and reallife mother Anne Meara and the amazingly energetic performances of octogenarian Dick Van Dyke and near nonagenarian Mickey Rooney looking and acting better than he has in what? fifty years? I should also add some complimentary words for the film's visual delights highlighted by some stunning displays of forced perspective as well as the imaginative animation of a puppyish tyrannosaurus skeleton that enjoys playing fetch with one of its own colossal bones. All in all though Night at the Museum was a major disappointment.";

	schema:reviewBody "When Larry Daley  Ben Stiller  takes on a job as a night guard at the Museum of Natural History he begins to understand why there were few applicants for the position.After sundown every stuffed animal every skeleton every prehistoric animal every diorama wakens into life and all hell lets loose.Ben Stiller does a sterling performance as the distraught guard. His character performance holds the highlypaced scenes together. He is on the screen the whole time. We get to know him well. We cannot help but feel sorry for the poor fellow who is ready to chuck in the job after the first night.Where there's a will there's a way. Larry fights back on his second night mainly in respect for his family especially his son who seems to be the driving force a little upstart of a kid.A golden plaque from an Egyptian tomb seems to hold the key to controlling the antagonism between the various exhibits. When this gets stolen by the three day guards a nasty lot the museum becomes a battlefield.Computerized movement seems to be the order of the day with more films resorting to this form of action. Too much of it tends to become boring. If you want something lighthearted farcical and with no brain power required this film is for you.Someone says that the Museum of Natural History is where history comes to life. Believe me this is an under statement.".

	onyx:emotionText "When Larry Daley  Ben Stiller  takes on a job as a night guard at the Museum of Natural History he begins to understand why there were few applicants for the position.After sundown every stuffed animal every skeleton every prehistoric animal every diorama wakens into life and all hell lets loose.Ben Stiller does a sterling performance as the distraught guard. His character performance holds the highlypaced scenes together. He is on the screen the whole time. We get to know him well. We cannot help but feel sorry for the poor fellow who is ready to chuck in the job after the first night.Where there's a will there's a way. Larry fights back on his second night mainly in respect for his family especially his son who seems to be the driving force a little upstart of a kid.A golden plaque from an Egyptian tomb seems to hold the key to controlling the antagonism between the various exhibits. When this gets stolen by the three day guards a nasty lot the museum becomes a battlefield.Computerized movement seems to be the order of the day with more films resorting to this form of action. Too much of it tends to become boring. If you want something lighthearted farcical and with no brain power required this film is for you.Someone says that the Museum of Natural History is where history comes to life. Believe me this is an under statement.";

	schema:headline " Too much Stiller not enough anybody else";
	schema:reviewBody "I went to see Night at the Museum not hoping for a masterpiece but expecting to be entertained. Alas I had my hopes set too high.One would think that in a film with Steve Coogan Ricky Gervais Mickey Rooney Dick Van Dyke Robin Williams and Owen Wilson would be filled to the brim with great comedic performances. But there is only one actor with any significant screen time who is allowed to let loose with his performance and that is Ben Stiller an unfunny guy whose reputation is built on the backs of funny costars such as Cameron Diaz Andy Dick Janeane Garafalo and his father Jerry Stiller.The premise of the filmtaken from a children's book by Milan Trencis that Ben Stiller is a divorced dad who takes a job as the new night watchman at the New York Museum of Natural History in order to prove to his son that he isn't an unemployable loser. Due to an ancient Egyptian talisman on display at the museum all the exhibits come to life after closing time and he must make sure they don't make a mess or leave the museum before dawn. Unfortunately for him he's not very good at either of these duties. Unfortunately for me as a viewer I was subjected to nearly two hours of his awful mugging and wooden oneliners.In the 1990's Robin Williams specialized in these types of films e.g. Mrs. Doubtfire Jumanji and managed to elicit guffaws from the dry preachy material. But now that he's too old to play the father of a kid who's not even in middle school yet he is relegated to being Stiller's fatherly adviser as Teddy Roosevelt which he plays without his trademark comic genius.Instead we have Ben Stiller in the lead. And although he is not listed as producer director or screenwriter one gets the sense that Stiller was the guy in charge during the making of the movie. He is in almost every scene and most of the shots in this film are closeups of his face. And the casting of Anne MearaStiller's motheras an employment counselor would probably not have taken place if Stiller were merely the lead actor on this project.I realize the preceding paragraphs make the movie sound worse than it really is. There are good things about it. I will give the filmmakers credit that this filmalthough appropriate for kidsis not strictly a children's movie. The camerawork is uniformly great. The CGI special effectswhile not LOTRqualityare better than those of many other effectsbased films i.e. The Chronicles of Narnia the second Star Wars trilogy. And I did chuckle at Owen Wilson as Jed the miniature cowboy. Unfortunately the visual goodies take a back seat to Stiller's performance and a plot with more holes than Swiss cheese. And Wilson's role was much too small no pun intended.In recent years we have seen lots of films such as Toy Story The Rookie and Elf that prove that you can make a film for kids without dumbing things down. Night at the Museum is not one of those films. Instead it is a dull silly ego trip for an untalented actor who can only dream about being as funny as the people he works with. 6 out of 10.".

Did the producers owe the writers a favor? Was this nepotism run amok? Were the writers really professionals or did they hijack a third grade writing assignment? Are actors like Ben Stiller and Robin Williams doing so badly that they couldn't pass up on this script? Did I remember to take the trash out? How long did it take that dust to form on top of the TV?We watched this film after learning earlier in the day that Owen Wilson tried to commit suicide. Well hold the presses everyone. I think we have a motive.If this is suppose to be a fun comedy you would have better success making me laugh by tearing my skin off with rusty pliers and throwing me at a cactus.Great family film? My kids sat through the entire movie without even a smile. When it was over they left the room without a comment. And that is the kind of movie this is. Some movies hit and miss. Some just miss. Some are so far below missing they leave you speechless. That's Night at the Museum.Somebody took an okay albeit unoriginal idea  museum display items coming to life after hours  and turned it into a horrible unoriginal idea. And evidently that horrible unoriginal idea was supposed to be good enough. Sure they tried adding more to it by injecting the subplot involving divorced dad Stiller competing with his new stepdad for the affections of his son. They not only stole this idea from 647 billion other films including Liar Liar and The Santa Clause but then did a hack halfderriere job of it.Ordinarily I would give a point or two for the CG but the special effects and action sequences are incredibly uncreative and dull. And in many places cheesylooking.Stupidest bit in the movie Robin Williams as the Teddy Roosevelt character confesses to Stiller that he is just a mannequin and therefore doesn't have the character qualities that Roosevelt had to help Stiller out of his dilemmas. However in direct contradiction to this the Sacajawea mannequin somehow possesses all the knowledge and character qualities of the real Sacajawea. So much so in fact that she is able to help the frustrated docent fill in the blanks in her doctoral thesis about Sacajawea's role as guide for Lewis and Clark.In decent movies that is the kind of contradiction that has you wonder Am I missing something? In this movie it is just another stupid part of a film that is consistently stupid throughout.I could say more but it is depressing just to think about this lack of effort. If you ever needed proof that Hollywood doesn't have a clue when it comes to making quality family films here you go.After only about twenty minutes in I knew this film had an excellent chance of bumping one out of my personal Top Ten Worst Movies of All Time list. By the end of the film it was a done deal.".

It seemed a mixture of few films moulded into a new scenario.It for me had hints of Jumanjianimals soldiers etcwithout any dark shades or complex storyline and hints of Liar Liar  in terms of father trying to meet the expectation of his son by being around.Basic premise is that Stiller takes up a job offer as a night watchman at a museum. So he can be close to his son Nicky. A museum's exhibition comes to life at night due to an Egyptian tablet and they must live together in peace which is negotiated by the night watchman.Three night watchmen one which was a pleasant Dick Van Dyke and another Mickey Rooney  who for me was slightly irritating  although younger kids might think he is funny! They announce their retirement and leave Stiller with instructions on how to look after the museum and its contents.Owen Wilson has quite big part in the film and his main interaction is with Steve Coogan. Although wouldn't say Owen was anything special. Stiller's main chemistry is with the monkey called Dexter  which for me was the highlight.Robin Williams plays a part of Theodore Roosevelt and provides Stiller with sound advice about his life as well being gallant although has a weakness for Sacajawea  a native north American trekker.Ricky Gervais plays the museum director with ease and his character main contribution is he says something without completing what he means..assumes youthe other characterknow what he means.There weren't any laugh out loud funny scenes or was there the usual toilet humour you see in Ben Stiller movies...be it being a family film. Recommend it once at the cinema..but maybe not visiting twice. Good holiday fun though.".

Now that I have managed to formulate an opinion I can proceed with writing this review. That being said my expectations for A Night at the Museum were hardly great. Indeed my friend and I only saw it because we had much to our chagrin arrived too early to see the criticallyacclaimed Borat or Casino Royale. We decided to see it because of the presence of the usually steady Ben Stiller. Despite his star billing I expected A Night at the Museum to be standard family fare not bad just predictable and formulaic. My expectations were fulfilled. There were bad scenes mostly involving Stiller and his son which introduced overpowering cringeinducing sentiment. The plot is also uninspired revolving around a stereotypical loser with a downtrodden son and marital difficulties. wait on  is this a reprise of the appalling Jingle All The Way? The saddest part is that my friend and I managed to telegraph key areas of the plot and also many of the various subplots. The rap music which was dubbed over the credits was also out of place with the rest of the movie. Not only can I see the presence of the rap music potentially turning off parents from seeing the movie but the rapc also left a bad taste in my mouth.The acting is a mixed bag certainly not the worst I've seen in a familyoriented movie but hardly consistent. For instance while Ben Stiller is his usual steady self he manages to deliver few funny lines due to various limitations in the script. He is also forced to engage in some slapstick which contradicts his usually wry understated sense of humour as seen on Meet the Parents  the monkey scene is not only predictable but it is probably the worst scene in the movie. The son Jake Cherry does not have to do a great deal other than mug for the camera. Mickey Rooney is saddled with the most poorlywritten character in the film resulting in him spitting out a plethora of lame buzzwords Butterscotch?!. However Owen Wilson and Steve Coogan as the cowboy and Roman general respectively inject some life into the proceedings being responsible for most of the amusing parts for example their individual stoushes. Robin Williams for once decides not to revert to slapstick attempting to play his character in a more understated fashion. And you know what? He isn't annoying! In fact I didn't realise it was him until later. Dick van Dyke while not particularly funny uses his oftlikable personality to hold the movie together. Ricky Geravis also plays the stereotypical pedantic whimsical boss to perfection.It became evident to me that A Night at the Museum is very much a movie of moments. Fortunately these moments usually came at just the right time just when my interest in the film was flagging and my eyes were being diverted towards my watch. For instance I couldn't help but laugh at the Sacajawea tracking scene. I have already discussed the stoushes between the cowboy and the Roman general so I will discuss the most interesting part of the movie  the only part of the plot which displays any real innovation. It was always going to be interesting watching how Stiller would go about overcoming his problems in the museum and he came up with some entertaining and leftfield solutions for doing so! For instance there was the fire extinguisher which he used on the cavemen  alongside others. I've also seen less amusing endings to family movies  as silly as the disco scene was.Ultimately I find A Night at the Museum slightly difficult to rate. It is certainly a passable movie with its fair share of welltimed and enjoyable moments however this is offset by the overbearing sentiment the predictability of the plot and to a lesser extent the credits and the less desirable acting performances in the film. All things considered this is far less banal and moneygrubbing than the more insipid family fare such as ScoobyDoo or Garfield. This is saying nothing though. I guess I will have to tie my review up with a rating so I will give A Night at the Museum 2.55 stars perhaps a little higher for those in the target genre".

A bumbling security guard at the Museum of Natural History accidentally lets loose an ancient curse that causes the animals and insects on display to come to life and wreak havoc ...is not accurate. The security guard did not cause the exhibits to come to life... it was happening before he took the job nor was it an accident. Insects? ...maybe I missed that part as I didn't see so much as a fly.My husband and I are older patrons of the movie theatres and we thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end.

A bumbling security guard at the Museum of Natural History accidentally lets loose an ancient curse that causes the animals and insects on display to come to life and wreak havoc ...is not accurate. The security guard did not cause the exhibits to come to life... it was happening before he took the job nor was it an accident. Insects? ...maybe I missed that part as I didn't see so much as a fly.My husband and I are older patrons of the movie theatres and we thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end.

	schema:headline " Lover's Vow deserved a fulllength movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Tales from the Darkside The Movie is a delightful collection of three horror stories. While the first two in the film are good the third and last story in the collection Lover's Vow is nothing less than superb. Lover's Vow would have quite appropriately been made into a fulllength film. It would have been wonderful to have seen this as one installment in a series of Tales from the Darkside films.Lover's Vow is a love story borne out of the womb of darkness itself. Carola Rae Dawn Chong is beautiful and seductive and her overwhelming maternal energy and beauty nicely compliments the persona exuded by Preston James Remar with his obvious yearning for security and stability.The buildup to the quite tragic ending is lovely. Penniless New York artist Preston is confronted with a living horror. He witnesses the death of a friend at the hands of a gargoyle. The gargoyle spares Preston's life in exchange for keeping his knowledge of its existence a secret. He can tell no one what he saw and heard. On the way home he meets beautiful Carola and he beckons her to come with him fearing that the creature may be lingering about.But unknown to Preston he has just taken the monster with him. This fact is in no way made apparent to the viewer Preston exudes his compassion and blankets a seemingly innocent woman. Immediately attracted to one other they consummate their blossoming passion in a truly wonderful love scene. A bluish light engulfing them coupled with lovely music they kiss and caress. Knowing how tragically the story ends the scene becomes all the more beautiful.Toward the end Carola and Preston are engaged in discussion about their future. Preston suggests a myriad of possibilities he ultimately just wants the one woman that he loves to be happy. There is nothing you can give me that I don't already have... she says. His answer Yes there is. He then divulges his secret to her while handing her a handmade statue of the gargoyle he'd seen. Carola slowly grasps it and begins to pace away. Clutching the statue and weeping she turns and says in anger and pain You promised you'd never tell!Carola's humanity is lost the broken vow becomes the key to death's door for both him and their love. In a macabre scene Carola begins to transmogrify into a gargoyle their children do like wise.Preston beckons her to change back and midstride between humanity and nonhuman monstrosity Carola states I can't. Hearing the heartwrenching sounds of his children in pain from the change he asks her to halt this horrifying procession. The gargoyle states It's too late you betrayed your vow. The gargoyle embraces Preston and when she does so he says Carola I loved you his voice seeming to hiss the word love. Uttering that she had loved him too she kills him. Resting his body gently on the floor she weeps in pain.With her children in tow Carola flies into the night. She becomes a frozen statue atop an old building clutching her children to wait for the moment when the cycle of love and death must reiterate itself.I cannot stress enough what a wonderful job the filmmakers did with this particular story. If you are a horror fan and would like to see some fine horror stories not laden with cheap lowbudget CGI I'd rather see lowbudget puppetry then at least rent it if only to watch Lover's Vow. Horror and romance are entwined in a very delicate story about simple humanity the yearning for love and love's sometimes allconsuming pain.".

	schema:headline " Very entertaining Horror Anthology";
	schema:reviewBody "In director John Harrison's adaptation from the 80s TV series four horror stories are told one of them as a wraparound story with different results although the movie leaves the audience with a feeling of pure worthy entertainment.The wraparound story stars exBlondie singer Deborah Harry as Betty the typical next door woman the only difference is that she hides her cannibalistic habits a a secret. Matthew Lawrence is Timmy a kid who was kidnapped by Betty in order to be her dinner tonight. Timmy begins to tell her stories from the Tales from the Darkside book in order to gain time while he plans his escape. The stories Timmy tells are the other three stories in the movie.First one Lot 249 stars Steve Buscemi as Bellingham a misfit in a yuppie university. Bullied by Andy Christian Slater Lee Robert Sedgwick and Susan Julianne Moore he works as assistant in the Museum. When he receives Lot 249 troubles will begin as he revives an ancient mummy to do his will.Second one stars William Hickey and David Johansen in a tale of a devilish cat that seems to haunt Hickey's character. Johansen plays a professional assassin hired to kill the feline.In last one writer Michael McDowell develops a love story loosely based on a Japanese tale. James Remar stars as Preston a failed artist who is having the worst day of his life as he watches his best friend being brutally killed by a mysterious beast who makes him promise that he won't tell anyone about it everything looks worse until he meets Carola Rae Dawn Chong and his life changes for good. What would happen if he reveal the secret of the monster? The four stories have very good performances particularly those of Buscemi and Hickey. The downside is that while the three main stories present a very adult horror style with very gory scenes brief nudity and foul language the wraparound story looks tame and more similar to kid's horror like Goosebumps. That doesn't mean that it's a bad tale is just that it seems out of place in the film but still the movie is good enough to keep the attention of the viewer.Very good movie that it's almost forgotten today. The very good acting and the good SFX although outdated for today's standards create a very rewarding movie that surely will give entertainment. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the top horrorstory anthology movies out there albeit that isn't saying much.  Will scare the pants off you if watched late at night by your lonesome.  Stories are cleverly placed from least terrifying first to most terrifying at the end.  Acting leaves much to be desired however with the first story containing the most watchable cast Steve Buscemi Christian Slater.  Wraparound story is cliched and predictable but it doesn't really matter.First story is one of the more interesting mummy tales out there with Buscemi playing an outsider in a yuppie university who discovers Lot 249. Lot turns out to be ancient preserved mummy who of course wrecks havoc. Twists at the end are good but not exceptional in any way.Second story is a fantastical tale regarding a vicious cat that never seems to go away.  Old man hires hitman to kill cat.  Tale is entertaining and unnerving but altogether ridiculous as well.  Only for fans of horror really.Third story is gem of anthology.  Concerns a young man who witnesses a gargoyle savagely kill a man in a dark alley.  Man makes vow to never speak of gargoyle to anyone in exchange for his life.  Romantic tale ends in shock and horror.  Likely to give nightmares.Overall this movie is laughable and boring in daytime but can be terrifying at night.  Personally I have a tough time choosing favorite tale each one brings something different to the table.  Horror buffs be sure to check this one out if you haven't already.".

I've seen some other her films like Hairspray or Videodrome and I must say that yet this is the best her role of those movies i've seen. Althau it is quite obvious that she is a better singer than an actress but still I liked her character very much. The only bad thing about it was that she appeared for only ten minutes or maybe less of the film. Anyway there were a lot of other good actors like Steve Buscemi or Christian Slater. All three stories were great especially the third one. Steven Kings fans should also see it because the second one was based on King actualy not one of the best his stories but still OK. I was kinda surprised because I expected that this movie will be dumb and childish but it appeared to be really creepy.".

Not the best king adaption but hey it ain't bad either. A good cast and some nice special effects. The Gargoyle was nasty! Plenty of gore here but used in just enough moderation to be effective. A couple of tense moments some god scares Especially in the story about involving an elusive seemingly immortal cat. and pretty good music. Pretty good movie just nothing really spectacular or lifechanging. My rating for Tales from the Darkside The Movie610.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Betty Debbie Harry a local witch has the newspaper delivery boy Timmy Matthew Lawrence locked up in her house and after giving him all the cookies that he can eat to fatten him up for her and her fellow witches who are coming over later that evening to have him as the main course for dinner. Giving Timmy a book Tales From The Darkside to read as Betty makes the preparations for him to be cooked Timmy tells her if he can read her some stories from the book so it would take his mind off of whats going to happen to him. Betty agrees to listen to Timmy reading the stories from Tales From The Darkside because it's also her favorite book and would make the mundane task of getting everything ready for the meal go a lot faster.Timmy starts with the story about a group of collage students entitled Lot 249. Edward Steve Buscemi gets a parcel Lot 249 delivered to his collage dorm room that has a 3000 year old mummy in it. Edward's fellow students once tried to get him expelled from school by planting a rumor that he stole an Aztec artifact and he knows who they are Susan Julianne Moore and her boyfriend Lee Robert Sedgwick and Edward is planing to use the mummy to get more then even with them for what they did to him. Finding a secret scroll hidden inside the mummy Edward interprets and recites whats on that scroll to bring the mummy back to life who ends up killing both students. Susan's brother Andy Christian Slater finds out about Edward's actions and after he knocks out and ties up Edward to a chair he dismembers the mummy with an electric carving knife. But instead of killing Edward for what he did to his sister and his best friend Andy runs Edward out of the campus. Andy feeling that he took care of Edward and his mummy for good didn't realize that the mummy wasn't the only thing that Edward brought back to life. The next story Cat From Hell that Timmy reads is about a rich old man Drogan William Hickey who hires a top Mafia hitman Halston David Johansen. Drogan gives him 50000.00 up front and will give him another 50000.00 after he can prove that he killed a black cat that has been terrorizing the old man and that killed his two sisters and butler and is now targeting him for elimination. Halston at first thinks that Drogan is nuts but soon sees that this seemingly harmless kitty cat is an indestructible and ferocious monster that's far more dangerous then any of the scores of gangsters that he hit during his long and successful criminal career. The cat came to avenge what Drogan's Pharmaceutical empire did to develop a very expensive and successful drug called TriDormaPhenobarbinCompound G. The drug is for people with heart trouble like Drogan as well as a legal stimulant like the drugs sold on the street by the mob for whom Halston works for. Drogan took the lives of 5000 cat's over four years to perfect that drug. This mysterious cat was somehow sent to make Drogan and his family pay for what they did in regard to all those cat's that were experimented and killed to make Drogan and Co. very rich because of it. In the end the little kitty not only took care of hitman Halston but the scared and guiltridden employer Drogan as well in a really gut wrenching and stomach churning final. The last story that Timmy reads Lover's Vow is about a struggling artiest Preston James Remar who one night in a dark alley sees his friend Gage Mark Margolis savagely killed by some demon. The demon makes Preston promise never to tell about what happened and anything that he saw that night for the rest of his life of else. Later that evening Preston meets a strange and mysterious woman Carola Rea Dawn Chong who he falls in love with and marries. Later Preston's artistic luck begins to change with his art work starts to get noticed by the public with him becoming a rich and very successful artiest. On the tenth anniversary of him meeting Carola Preston feels that he has to tell her this secret that he kept from her all these years and that by him not telling her that he thinks that he was somehow not being truthful with her. It turns out by him doing that Preston finds out that sometimes the truth is not the wises and healthiest thing to tell even to someone that you love and feel should know about it. With that Timmy both out of time and stories and everything ready for him to become the main course for dinner for Betty and her witches friends there's suddenly and unsuspectingly a slip in the plot and what's for dinner that evening turns out not to be what Betty was preparing. Very good anthology of the TV show Tales From The Darkside that turns out to be much better the you would have expected on the big screen.".

I really liked the Cat from Hell story...I found the old man creepy and the hitman very amusing...his tough guy monologues had me giggling uncontrollably at times and the cat was a deliciously evil yet nonchalant little character although I must say I was scratching my head a bit when it crawls INSIDE the guy through his MOUTH...bizarre.The whole movie is a bit on the silly side but fun nonetheless. In Lot 249 it was great to see Christian Slater Julianne Moore and Steve Buscemi before they were big stars. It was even better to see Julianne Moore stuffed with flowers by a mummy performing his own macabre poetic justice on people who ticked off the geek who brought him to life with an ancient scroll! Great stuff! Cat from Hell...go the kitty! That hitman was a loser and the old croney in the wheel chair was a catkiller! Ha! Serves you right you bstards! Lover's Vow...hey it's Ajax from The Warriors and Rae Dawn Chong who not only has a cool name but starred opposite Arnie in Commando a few years before this playing the lovers...what an original and deliciously horrific little tale this one is...I won't spoil it except to say...never realised how cute Rae actually is...anyway...The wraparound story is pretty cool despite Debbie Harry's abysmal acting abilities...she had an okay voice what possessed her to start acting...? Anyway...she does alright I spose looking a little like Michelle Pfieffer but Timmy steals the show in this one.All in all as far as horror anthologies go Creepshow is heaps better but this is a fun Saturday night scarefest and would be good to watch with Creepshow or Creepshow 2.".

	schema:reviewBody "Understand what you ask? Why this movie to me just does not have the feel of the television series it is named from and does seem to have more of a Creepshow feel to it. None of the three stories seems like it would ever have played on the television show with the introduction story of the little boy being held by the crazy woman probably being the most like it came from the show. The first story seems straight out of the HBO series Tales from the Crypt with the second one having more of the Creepshow feel and the final one almost having more of a Twilight Zone quality to it. The first story has one guy killing people with the help of a mummy not really much to it but it does have the most stars in it as you will recognize quite a few of the people featured in it. The second one is my favorite but not really going to garner to much mention as a hitman is requested by a rather eccentric old man to exterminate a rather strange target. The target in question is that of a cat. The final story is about a man who witnesses a strange killing and is told to keep it a secret his life seems to be going well but he is still haunted by what he saw that evening. This story is really to tame with the exception of the beginning and the end. Then of course the story of the boy and his captor is wrapped up. It has a few ups and is far from awful it just is not that good either as the show had much better stories.".

She's preparing to cook him for her dinner party. He tells her three stories from Tales from the Darkside to hold off the inevitable. In the first tale Andy Christian Slater is a friend to the underhanded arrogant rich college guy Lee. Lee is using Andy's sister Susan Julianne Moore to do his work and steal a scholarship from Edward Bellingham Steve Buscemi. Edward has purchased Lot 249 which is a mummy he's looking to resell. A hidden parchment helps him take revenge. The first part is solid. The horror could be done scarier and more gruesome. It does have Slater going against Buscemi. It's solid work.The second story is less compelling. It's a story told by Timmy about an old guy who tells stories. The best thing about the second story is William Hickey but that's about it. A cat is not scary at least not here and it's flat. It tries to be funny and fails. The third tale is a great short story. As a cinematic endeavor it suffers from a flat middle. James Remar plays an artist who is forced to keep quiet about his encounter with a gargoyle. The gargoyle animatronics is not the best. It looks fake which keeps it from being scary. The surprise twist is great but the story needs more tension in the middle. In total the movie is an up and down affair.".

In this Stephen King work a boy tries to avoid being cooked and eaten by a witch by occupying her with fanciful stories.There were three total stories featuring some well known actors. Some were already established like Rae Dawn Chong and William Hickey. Others I don't believe were as well known at the time such as Christian Slater Steve Buscemi and Jullianne Moore.I thought the three stories were solidly done. I can't remember the order but the order of preference for me was 1. Mummy story 1A. Gargoyle story 3. and a distant third was the cat story.None of the stories were very spooky or scary in fact you could say they were somewhat comical especially the mummy story but they all had an intriguing premise. The three stories all wrapped into the initial story made for a good movie.".

	schema:headline " Enjoyable Horror Anthology";
	schema:reviewBody "Horror anthology movie spunoff from the Tales from the Darkside TV series. It features three stories plus a bookend piece. The first story is Lot 249 about a nerd Steve Buscemi who is cheated out of a scholarship by an evil girl and her boyfriend Julianne Moore Robert Sedgwick . He seeks revenge by using an ancient scroll to send a mummy after them. Christian Slater plays Moore's brother and is an inconsistently written character. Buscemi is enjoyable though and it's nice to see an oldschool mummy.The second story is Cat from Hell about an elderly millionaire Wiliam Hickey who hires a hitman Buster Poindexter to kill a cat. This is the weakest story of the bunch. Hickey and Poindexter are fine but it's kind of obnoxiously dark and I didn't really care what happened to anybody including the cat. The third story is Lover's Vow about an artist James Remar whose life is spared by a gargoyle as long as he never reveals he saw the monster. He falls in love with a woman Rae Dawn Chong and after many years together the temptation to share his secret becomes too great. This story pretty much rips off the Woman of the Snow story from the superior horror anthology film Kwaidan 1964 but is still well done and probably the best story in the movie.The bookend linking story is a takeoff on Hansel  Gretel with a witch Debbie Harry preparing to cook a little boy Matthew Lawrence. To stall for time the boy tells her stories from his favorite book which leads into the three other tales. This is an amusing and enjoyable part of the film though nothing exceptional. Overall it's a surprisingly enjoyable film helped in large part by a good cast. The stories aren't particularly strong but somehow it manages to keep you entertained. The acting directing and special effects are pretty good and make up for the writing as much as they can.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tales From the Darkside The Movie is certainly one of my favorite horror anthology films it's one that's well remembered I really know it by heart having seen it numerous times. It was only natural that I liked it so well since I was a fan of 1982's classic Creepshow and I loved as a kid the Tales from the Darkside TV series along with HBO's Tales from the Crypt so this film was right for my taste as it was one of 1990's most memorable films. Done like a modern day fable with a cute and neat wraparound story that takes a twist the film was very well done with suspense and gore and it's tales and segments featured the work of many veteran acts like Deborah Harry James Remar William Hickey and Rae Dawn Chong. While it showcased the early work of future talents like Christian Slater Julianne Moore and Steve Buscemi.Starting out in the northeast I believe in the outskirts of New York the wraparound begins with a woman named BettyDeborah Harrywho appears good on the outside only inside her and her home lies evil she's a real modern day witch. She's holding captive little boy TimmyMatthew Lawrencewho she plans to eat for a dinner roast! Timmy delays it though by telling his favorite stories from a book and this gets us into the film.First up is Lot 249 based on an old Sir Arthur Conan Doyle tale it involves a university set somewhere in a New England state in which an odd and strange but bright student BellinghamSteve Buscemi in an early role obtains a most unusual and old friend in the form of an ancient mummy. This is what he lives for after he was cheated out of a university prize and all of this mess was brought on by a female student body the cold and snobbish stuck up yet sexy SusanJulianne Moore with some early workshe framed Bellingham for a wrong doing. Never fear revenge is in the works in the form of reading script and rising up an ancient mummy! As it's nice to see poor boy Bellingham have the last laugh as Susan her boyfriend Lee and brother AndyChristian Slater learn the meaning of final exams! Good revenge tale.Second and most disturbing it's gross with blood and gore yet a little far fetched but I guess not if you believe a cat has nine lives! Cat From Hell a short story from the great Stephen King is a tale of a black cat that simply will not die! It features a northern billionaire a pharmacy executive Droganthe wonderful and legendary William Hickeyas a lonely and on his last leg old man who's final days are numbered after the years of torment and harassment he's seen from this black cat. And despite the hired help of a hit man HalstonDavid Johansen the veteran character actorthis cat will not go down no amount of money in the world can take out this cat. Unbelievable cats have more than nine lives.Last and maybe the best tale at least in terms of the moral lesson it teaches is Lover's Vow. Written by the late Michael McDowell it involves the life of a struggling New York city artist and sculptor PrestonJames Remarwho simply cannot make ends meet his agent gives his work the brush. Until one night late outside a bar on the city streets something horrible and strange happens it's very unspeakable something that will change his life yet Preston makes a promise and he lives. Then he meets on the streets a strange and exotic erotic beauty named CarolaRae Dawn Chongthis is the girl of his dreams. For ten years peace and happiness is brought only the past haunts him. Sadly and very hurtful to watch in the end is to see Preston break his promise. In the end his vows life love and family is all taken away so sad. It proves that secrets are better off and to be kept hidden don't tell it and don't break a promise.Then the wraparound ends with a surprise happy twist an ending of a surprise roast the modern day witch has to eat her own medicine. Overall director John Harrison directed a great film one that's a highly memorable classic a horror anthology that I will never forget it's bag of mixed tales were a tasty treat for my taste!".

	schema:reviewBody "If you liked The Twilight Zone The Movie Tales From The Crypt Tales That Witness Madness Trilogy Of Terror and Body Bags you're sure to love this one. This film consists of three horror film segments 1. Lot 249 Based On A.C. Doyle's original short story which is adapted by Michael McDowell.2. Cat From Hell Based on a Stephen King short story and directed by the master of horror George Romero himself.3. Lover's Vow Written by Michael McDowell and based on yukionna a spirit or ykai in Japanese folklore or more specifically Lafcadio Hearns version in Kwaidan Stories and Studies of Strange Things. Full Plot The movie opens with a housewife Deborah Harry planning a dinner party. The main dish is to be Timmy Matthew Lawrence a young paperboy chained up in her pantry. To stall her from stuffing and roasting him the boy tells her three horror stories from the book Tales from the Darkside.Lot 249  In the first segment Michael McDowell adapts Arthur Conan Doyle's short story Lot No. 249. A graduate student Bellingham played by Steve Buscemi reanimates a mummy and uses it to take revenge on a pair of crooked college students Susan played by Julianne Moore and Lee played by Robert Sedgwick who conspired to cheat Bellingham out of a scholarship. Their actions 'framed' him for theft from a museum which results in his expulsion from the college. In vengeance for his master the reanimated corpse kills both in rather gruesome ways. After discovering the cause Susan's brother Andy played by Christian Slater kidnaps Bellingham and burns the parchment and mummy that was the cause of it all. It is later discovered that Andy had burned the incorrect scroll as the reanimated corpses of Susan and Lee close in on Andy in his dorm room controlled by Bellingham.Cat From Hell  In the second tale George A. Romero adapts a Stephen King short story of the same name. It is the story of Drogan a wealthy elderly man who uses a wheelchair played by William Hickey who hires a hitman Halston played by David Johansen for one of the strangest jobs of his career kill a black cat which Drogan believes is murderously evil. Drogan explains that there were three other occupants of his house before the cat arrived his sister Amanda played by Dolores Sutton her friend Carolyn played by Alice Drummond and the family's butler Richard Gage played by Mark Margolis. The cat was adopted by Carolyn and Amanda who ignore Drogan's claim that he can sense that the cat is evil. Drogan claims that one by one the cat killed the other three first it tripped Amanda causing her to fall down a flight of stairs then it clamped on to Carolyn's face until she suffocated and finally after Gage managed to capture the beast and tried to take it to the vet to put it down it scratched his face causing Gage to get into a fatal car crash.Drogan believes that he is being punished because his pharmaceutical company killed 5000 cats while testing a new drug. Halston doesn't believe the story but is more than willing to eliminate the cat since Drogan is offering 100000. Halston soon discovers that the cat is extremely difficult to kill after he tries to kill it several times. Eventually the cat kills the hitman forcing itself down his throat and into his stomach. Drogan returns and finds the hitman's body the cat climbs out of the hitman's mouth and jumps at Drogan which causes him to have a fatal heart attack.Lover's Vow  The third and final segment is written by Michael McDowell and based on yukionna a spirit or ykai in Japanese folklore or more specifically Lafcadio Hearns version in Kwaidan Stories and Studies of Strange Things. In the story a despondent artist named Preston played by James Remar witnesses a gruesome murder by a gargoylelike monster. The monster gets Preston to swear to never speak of what he saw in exchange for a promise to spare his life. After making the promise Preston meets a beautiful woman named Carola played by Rae Dawn Chong. Preston marries Carola the two have kids and Preston has a revival of his art career. But Preston was still tormented by guilt about his silence and started reconsidering the promise he made to the monster.Preston then tells Carola about that night ten years ago when they met after he had witnessed the killing of a man by a monster which he sculpted to show her. After releasing a heartbroken screech Carola reveals herself to be the very same creature he made the promise with lamenting that the promise Preston made to the monster had been broken. As such she reverts to her previous form and their children transform into similar monsters as well. Within the shock and despair of such revelations Preston is killed at 'her' hands and she escapes through a skylight with their children. The final scene shows that the gargoyle and children have turned to stone upon a building ledge staring down at Preston's body in remorse.The Epilogue  As the woman makes preparations to cook Timmy he trips her by throwing some marbles on the floor. The woman slips and falls on her butcher's equipment stabbing herself in the back. Timmy releases himself and pushes her into her own oven. The film ends with Timmy helping himself to a cookie and breaking the fourth wall by asking us Don't you just love happy endings? Verdict Go out and BUY it. This is superb horror. Also DON'T FORGET to buy the 4 season TV series Tales From The Darkside as well.".

The first one dealt with a nerdy student seeking a revenge by raising a mummy from the dead.  It was the best one. Julianne Moore who appears in this story has come a long way.  The second one Cat From Hell was frustrating.  The last one which dealt with a gargoyle that came to life was predictible.  Good for Halloween parties.  2 out of 5.".

Fans of Creepshow and Tales from the Crypt should love this one.First segment you have Christian Slater living a pretty sweet and pretentious life filled with Tennis sets and Cardigans. He stumbles upon Steve Buscemi's mad scientist performance and discovers that the man has a mummy enclosed in his study. The mummy breaks out causes havoc and ultimately dismisses of anyone near it. Pretty creepy story and the ending is pretty eerie and funny at the same time. Loved it.Second segment you have William Hickey being creepy as ever or as always who hires a professional hitman to dispose of his cat after explaining that the cat is a demon feline from hell sent to avenge the cats that his company has tortured via experiments throughout the years. Very visually gripping and pretty terrifying as a premise considering I really despise cats. Seriously they make me hostileThird segment James Remar is cast as a struggling artist who after one night of drinking encounters a murderous creature that instead of killing him makes him swear to never acknowledge of its existence to anyone EVER. He agrees to do so but years and years of guilt over the circumstances of that night he reveals it to his wife with surprising results.This is what Creepshow 3 should've been but unfortunately that title was reserved for a piece of pure crap that was made in 2006. The movie is mildly funny at times but that is to be expected in horror flicks. Acting is pretty good and convincing. The movie's lighting wasn't apparently in the budget because in a lot of night time scenes the atmosphere is pretty dark and grainy but then again that may have been the intention to sell the piece as a serious effort. This one is one to watch alone with some popcorn and the lights on because believe me it'll keep you on edge. A true 90s horror classic.".

	schema:headline " The best classic sport action film from the 80's!";
	schema:reviewBody "Rocky IV 1985 is definitely one of the best Sport action films of the 80's! It is my number one favorite best movie in the Rocky series! I love this movie to death and I don't care what anyone says. It was my first film I saw it as a kid it is my childhood film and I grew up with this movie! Sylvester Stallone did gave us one of his the most best performances of the Rocky character ever! This film along side with Rocky III is very underrated misunderstood bashed and dissed off from fans and it's critics! I love this film to death and it has a special place in my heart. The film has everything that I love in a Rocky film. It is fast paced and Entertained from beginning till end.The film goes very fast is not boring dull or lame it is actually pretty good film is not bad is actually good. The fourth installment of the Rocky series isn't the greatest film like were his predecessors but it is still a good film. People It's not that bad. In fact it's really good. Okay it isn't a classic like the first two movies were and it suffers further by comparison to Rambo First Blood Part II which came out six months before it. But Part IV was still one of the best movies of its year 1985. That fight at the end was EPIC just amazing. As for the music Bill Conti is great but so is Vince Dicola! Vince is a genius on synthesizer music. The fight at the end was a literal clash of the titans level bout and his music fit it so perfectly! Rocky IV remained the highest grossing sports movie for 24 years before it was overtaken by The Blind Side. It is the fourth and most financially successful entry in the Rocky film series.As a kid Rocky IV was always my favorite best movie. It still is alongside with Rocky IIII and Balboa! It is sad that Apollo dies in this movie I hated that but the rest was pretty fast entertaining well faced paced entertained action movie. This is the first movie that place actually took in a different country and not in the US. I love when Rocky Sylvester Stallone fly's to Russia to fight the best undefeated champion Ivan Drago Dolph Lundgren. The training sequences were awesome the fight sequences were entertained and very paced amazing. The soundtracks for this movie were pretty awesome and great. James Brown Living in America was awesome. The fight between Rocky and Drago was set on 25th December Christmas. This is the first Rocky film where the music is not composed by Bill Conti. The Fourth movie was one of the best Sport action movies Directed by Sylvester Stallone he made such a great wonderful performance I love You Sly. Without you there wouldn't be Rocky.I have heard a lot about this film Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed and Dolph Lundgren as Ivan Drago really did not get along and got into an a real fight during filming. Lundgren threw Weathers across the ring before it was broken up. You can even see the scene during a press conference regarding the match hostility is created between Apollo and Drago's respective camps. The fight really went out of hand. Carl Weathers shouted profanities at Lundgren while leaving the ring and announcing that he was calling his agent and quitting the movie. Sylvester Stallone forced and convince those two macho ego actors to comeback and finishing the film. The major problem with this film I have is killing the most best awesome character Apollo Creed. In Rocky sequel almost everyone dies. The killing one of the most favorite characters was one of the worst idea Stallone ever had. In Rocky III Mickey dies in Rocky IV Apollo dies in Rocky Balboa Adrian Dies. Stallone kept killing our favorite characters but he memorized them. The movie wasn't filmed in Russia which that really disappointed me and I think Stallone should have visit Russia and film at least one scene there. I love sound effects and Rocky IV is one of the few sport movies that applies genuine sound effects from actual punches bona fide training methods created by boxing consultants and a bevy of other new special effects. I love everything that it is about this film everything!When east meets west the champion remains standing Rocky Balboaheavyweight champion of the world is the trainer for Apollo Creed in an exhibition match against Ivan Drago a superman boxer from the Soviet Union. When Apollo is killed in the ring by the brutal Drago Balboa blames himself and promises to avenge his friend's death in the ring. That is the basic and simply plot of the most awesome sport action film of the 80's! Rocky IV is a 1985 American sports film written and directed by Sylvester Stallone who also starred in the film. The film costars Dolph Lundgren Burt Young Talia Shire Carl Weathers Tony Burton Brigitte Nielsen and Michael Pataki. That is the basic plot of the awesome sport action film!The rating I am giving a 10 I love this film to death I grew up with it and it is my number1 favorite Rocky Film!".

I love this movie to death and I don't care what anyone says. It was my first film I saw it as a kid it is my childhood film and I grew up with this movie! Sylvester Stallone did gave us one of his the most best performances of the Rocky character ever! This film along side with Rocky III is very underrated misunderstood bashed and dissed off from fans and it's critics! I love this film to death and it has a special place in my heart. The film has everything that I love in a Rocky film. It is fast paced and Entertained from beginning till end.The film goes very fast is not boring dull or lame it is actually pretty good film is not bad is actually good. The fourth installment of the Rocky series isn't the greatest film like were his predecessors but it is still a good film. People It's not that bad. In fact it's really good. Okay it isn't a classic like the first two movies were and it suffers further by comparison to Rambo First Blood Part II which came out six months before it. But Part IV was still one of the best movies of its year 1985. That fight at the end was EPIC just amazing. As for the music Bill Conti is great but so is Vince Dicola! Vince is a genius on synthesizer music. The fight at the end was a literal clash of the titans level bout and his music fit it so perfectly! Rocky IV remained the highest grossing sports movie for 24 years before it was overtaken by The Blind Side. It is the fourth and most financially successful entry in the Rocky film series.As a kid Rocky IV was always my favorite best movie. It still is alongside with Rocky IIII and Balboa! It is sad that Apollo dies in this movie I hated that but the rest was pretty fast entertaining well faced paced entertained action movie. This is the first movie that place actually took in a different country and not in the US. I love when Rocky Sylvester Stallone fly's to Russia to fight the best undefeated champion Ivan Drago Dolph Lundgren. The training sequences were awesome the fight sequences were entertained and very paced amazing. The soundtracks for this movie were pretty awesome and great. James Brown Living in America was awesome. The fight between Rocky and Drago was set on 25th December Christmas. This is the first Rocky film where the music is not composed by Bill Conti. The Fourth movie was one of the best Sport action movies Directed by Sylvester Stallone he made such a great wonderful performance I love You Sly. Without you there wouldn't be Rocky.I have heard a lot about this film Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed and Dolph Lundgren as Ivan Drago really did not get along and got into an a real fight during filming. Lundgren threw Weathers across the ring before it was broken up. You can even see the scene during a press conference regarding the match hostility is created between Apollo and Drago's respective camps. The fight really went out of hand. Carl Weathers shouted profanities at Lundgren while leaving the ring and announcing that he was calling his agent and quitting the movie. Sylvester Stallone forced and convince those two macho ego actors to comeback and finishing the film. The major problem with this film I have is killing the most best awesome character Apollo Creed. In Rocky sequel almost everyone dies. The killing one of the most favorite characters was one of the worst idea Stallone ever had. In Rocky III Mickey dies in Rocky IV Apollo dies in Rocky Balboa Adrian Dies. Stallone kept killing our favorite characters but he memorized them. The movie wasn't filmed in Russia which that really disappointed me and I think Stallone should have visit Russia and film at least one scene there. I love sound effects and Rocky IV is one of the few sport movies that applies genuine sound effects from actual punches bona fide training methods created by boxing consultants and a bevy of other new special effects. I love everything that it is about this film everything!When east meets west the champion remains standing Rocky Balboaheavyweight champion of the world is the trainer for Apollo Creed in an exhibition match against Ivan Drago a superman boxer from the Soviet Union. When Apollo is killed in the ring by the brutal Drago Balboa blames himself and promises to avenge his friend's death in the ring. That is the basic and simply plot of the most awesome sport action film of the 80's! Rocky IV is a 1985 American sports film written and directed by Sylvester Stallone who also starred in the film. The film costars Dolph Lundgren Burt Young Talia Shire Carl Weathers Tony Burton Brigitte Nielsen and Michael Pataki. That is the basic plot of the awesome sport action film!The rating I am giving a 10 I love this film to death I grew up with it and it is my number1 favorite Rocky Film!";

	schema:reviewBody "In 1976 a phenom was born.  By now we are all aware of the story of how Stallone wrote the screenplay for Rocky in three days after watching a fight between an extreme underdog and a highly favoured champ.  Stallone was a nobody back then yet he still stood his ground and didn't sell out to the producers until they promised him the title role.  The rest they say is history.  Well 9 years later after three Rocky films in my opinion comes the best one.  I realize that Rocky was all story and then a climatic boxing match and that is what won the film the Oscar.  And even though I can admit that this film is not as concerned with character developement as it is with training montages and bulging muscles it is by far and away the most entertaining film of the 5.  And that is what I enjoy about the film.  I love that Rocky IV has some of the best training montages ever filmed.  I love that it has the heart of a lion when it shows Rocky scaling a mountain that you know damn well he shouldn't be able to.  And I absolutely love the boxing match at the end of the film.  This was completely choreographed by Stallone and he and Dolph Lundgren boxed for real for about 75 of the match.  Stallone felt that it needed some authenticity so that was the way to do it.  And if you think Robert De Niro is an impressive method actor try this fact on for size.  When filming the boxing match some of the scenes were so real that Stallone was rushed to hospital because his heart was actually pushed up and his ribcage was slightly shattered.  So when you watch that match at the end just know that what you are seeing is not exactly choreography and trick camera work.  They did the best job they could to keep the look of the fight as real as possible.  And I think this is the best boxing match ever filmed with all due respect to Raging Bull. Stallone was in the shape of his life in this year as he filmed Rocky and Rambo back to back and it shows.  I have never seen a more sculpted man in the movies than he was here.  And I think that added to his superman persona.  If you notice in all the Rocky films he grows a little each time. And that also adds to the enjoyment of the film.  Rocky IV is different than Rocky there is no doubt.  And as much as I love the first one it doesn't come close to entertaining me as much as this one does.  Rocky IV starts fast and it ends hard and in between we are blessed with a great soundtrack and a beautiful montage of all the Rocky films to Robert Tepper's There's No Easy Way Out  And it is here that even though some will say that Stallone has substituted real human emotion with an MTV ersatz video I think it works well.  There is nothing about this film that I didn't enjoy and if you forget what the experience of watching this one is like I suggest that you rent it now and take a look at it.  And try to remember what it was like when you first saw this film back in the winter of 85.  I remember I was in Kokomo Indiana visiting family for Christmas.  My mom and I walked into a packed theater and you want to talk about a place erupting like a volcano then this was the place.  When Rocky finally hits Drago to cut him over the eye and Duke yells  he's cut he's cut!   the crowd went into a frenzy.  And you can look no further than that as to why the Rocky films were so popular.  It doesn't matter if you are Canadian American Portuguese Polish or Dutch or whatever Rocky appeals to all of us.  Because all of us have been the underdog at some time in our lives and we love to watch him and perhaps live vicariously through him.  That is the beauty of Rocky.  If Rocky can do it then dammit so can I! When the movie ended on that cold night back in 1985 and people were filtering out to their cars for the drive home I swear I could hear the crowd chanting his name as did the millions..... and millions of the Rock's fans.   Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!".

Despite his lack of dialog I must break you is right up there with Schwarzenegger's I'll be back. He looked amazingly strong  a freak almost  just as the plot intended. Scary. He looked even taller than the 6 inch difference between him and Stallone Lundgren 6'4 Stallone 5'10.I would think that difference in heightreach would make him nigh on impossible to defeat if this were REAL. Of course it is a movie. Dolph is the highlight and was sad to see Apollo's demise but at least it shut him up. The writers must have based Apollo's character on Muhammed Ali surely!

	schema:headline " Rocky IV has the most amazing soundtrack ever!";
	schema:reviewBody "We all know the plot of Rocky IV is awfully thin Soviet boxer comes to USA. Soviet boxer kills Rocky's friend. Rocky goes to Soviet Union to avenge aforementioned friend. End of script. And this movie has very little dialog. Granted. This movie is actually a 90minute music video. Absolutely. And it's full of stereotypes and clichs on the USSR and Russians etc. Logically this movie is total trash and by far the worst Rocky movie.And you know what? Rocky IV is by far my favorite Rocky movie and one of my alltime fave films. I know this defies all reason but I'll tell why.I'm a huge Stallone fan and once again Sly remarkably directed and acted in this fourth installment of the Rocky saga the others actors sincerely and convincingly played their parts as well the editing is impressive too. But the real star of the movie is in fact one you certainly didn't expect. As I said above Rocky IV is a onehourandahalf music video and its real wonder is actually soundtrack author Vince DiCola. As much as I love and respect Bill Conti's work on all other Rocky movies I must say that in my mind DiCola's score on this movie surpassed Conti's and is the true the ultimate Rocky soundtrack. DiCola managed to capture the essence of Rocky i.e. overcoming one's fears fighting against the odds perseverance in the face of adversity etc. I'm referring especially to Training Montage and Heart's on Fire wonderfully sung by John Cafferty more than any other piece of music I've heard in my life Vince DiCola's tunes are incredibly inspiring unbelievably motivating... Just listen to them they'll pump you up like nothing else. Whatever your occupation is physical or intellectual they'll instantly put you on a high and in the right mindset to achieve your goal. DiCola's music is so powerful combined with the impressive editing of the training scenes I would even be tempted to say it has a nearmagical power to motivate you. It's definitely the ultimate inspirational music. And the score in the rest of the film especially War during the final fight is equally terrific. It makes you root for Rocky from the beginning to the end and feel his emotions.Stallone often had remarkable soundtracks for his movies e.g. those by Jerry Goldsmith for the Rambo saga and it's a shame and incomprehensible that DiCola wrote very few film scores same for John Cafferty why isn't he more famous?. I acknowledge that the first time I saw Rocky IV I hated Vince DiCola's music because it was so different from Bill Conti's but after watching the movie again I came to adore it. In 1985 it was a score ahead of its time and more than twenty years later it still is. It hasn't lost an ounce of its power. Is it humanly possible to compose a more motivating soundtrack? Watch and above all listen to Rocky IV from this perspective and you'll understand why there are so many people who love it.".

	onyx:emotionText "We all know the plot of Rocky IV is awfully thin Soviet boxer comes to USA. Soviet boxer kills Rocky's friend. Rocky goes to Soviet Union to avenge aforementioned friend. End of script. And this movie has very little dialog. Granted. This movie is actually a 90minute music video. Absolutely. And it's full of stereotypes and clichs on the USSR and Russians etc. Logically this movie is total trash and by far the worst Rocky movie.And you know what? Rocky IV is by far my favorite Rocky movie and one of my alltime fave films. I know this defies all reason but I'll tell why.I'm a huge Stallone fan and once again Sly remarkably directed and acted in this fourth installment of the Rocky saga the others actors sincerely and convincingly played their parts as well the editing is impressive too. But the real star of the movie is in fact one you certainly didn't expect. As I said above Rocky IV is a onehourandahalf music video and its real wonder is actually soundtrack author Vince DiCola.

And one of the most dramatic scenes to hit cinema was the death of Carl WeathersApollo Creed. The idea of fighting for the death of his friend and for himself is just so inspirational.

As soon as it was released on video I managed to obtain a copy which probably lasted about 6 months. I also purchased the album which contains one of the best montage songs ever No Easy Way Out and still have it to this day! I must have been through at least 10 copies on video  one DVD.Obviously the death of Apollo was heartbreaking to me but Drago just seemed like a monster and I was eagerly awaiting the East Meets West clash in Russia as Rocky avenges his friends death.Such an amazing film and way better than Rocky 5 and in my opinion the other films as well so please check this out  I don't think it's dated well but to those around in the 80's you should definitely watch this film as soon as possible!".

Apollo finally decides to take on that big Russian fighter even though Rocky is telling him this can be dangerous. But Apollo wants to still go at it and Rocky decides to be his ringside coach.So at Las Vegas the prebout festivities include James Brown's rendition of Living in America rigged to intimidate Ivan so much that he secretly swears to kill Apollo in the ring. And so as the exhibition bout starts Ivan gets his death wish pummeling Apollo in Round 1 and then in the middle of Round 2 finishes Apollo off with a killer uppercut that completely finishes him off leaving him bleedingand later on deadin the ring. Rocky could do nothing to stop Ivan's deadly anger and only could watch his friend wasted fatally in blood.Rocky decides to avenge Apollo's death by placing his championship belt on Apollo's grave and leaves it there. All is set for a boxingstyle death match in the USSR on December 25 between Rocky and Ivan where Rocky says no money will be paid. Rocky's wife strongly reproaches Rocky's decision to fight Ivan fearing that he could be facing the same death like what Ivan did to Apollo but Rocky retorts that he has to use his extrovert mentality to overcome Ivan's killer punches. So as Rocky heads to the USSR to a place similar to Siberia he meets up with Apollo's friend starts his training for the fight while Ivan does his own training under his coach and his wife in the country's cold milieu and after a pause in the training Rocky realizes that his wife decided to go to Russia to meet up with him saying I'm with you no matter what. His training continues. The training montage was definitely pretty good. Great camera work and intercutting as Rocky uses oldschool training by things like pulling a sled or throwing heavy stones or breaking parts of trees with an ax while Ivan was focusing on steroids machines with computer readouts and destroying sparring partners with his bonecrushing punches. The fight itself was like a blood sport too. 15 very hard rounds and it seemed like neither fighter would gain an advantage but after the bloody punches were over Rocky became the victor after finally knocking Ivan out in the 15th round. The hostile Russian crowd during the fight realized they could not be that anymore...they respected Rocky's awesome human determination in this nonsanctioned fight.".

It is by far the dumbest movie in the series with a plot that defies credibility and a closing boxing match that would surely prove fatal for both fighters if a contest like it were to take place in real life. What the film has in its favour is a sense of courage in its own absurdity. It's like everybody involved knows that they're working on something ludicrous but they give it their all anyway  the actors the cinematographer the composer the editor and the director all pull in the same direction united in some kind of cheerful conviction that they can make an enjoyable movie from this silliest of premises.Life is good for boxing champion Rocky Balboa Sylvester Stallone. He has a mansion he has money he has incredible public support and he has the allimportant heavyweight champion of the world title. But news is spreading fast that there might be a better boxer on the face of the planet in the shape of Russian goliath Ivan Drago Dolph Lundgren. Drago comes to America for an exhibition match against Apollo Creed Carl Weathers once Rocky's greatest adversary and now Rocky's greatest friend. The match is supposed to be a straightforward contest for Creed giving him a chance to reassert himself as a top fighter but it goes terribly wrong when Drago literally pulverises his opponent and kills him in the ring. Distraught at the death of his buddy Rocky agrees to fight Drago. The venue Moscow. The date December 25th. In the middle of desolate northern Russia Rocky trains for the fight of his life against a nearsuperhuman opponent. Not only is the honour of his dead friend at stake but so is his life. not to mention the hopes of every man woman and child from the free world! It seems kind of wrong for a Rocky movie to go all political on the audience but Rocky IV indirectly does just that. Rocky's closing speech is a cringeworthy plea for tolerance and change amongst the different societies of our world and if I hadn't heard it with my own ears I would scarcely have believed anyone could put such infantile politics on film. The movie is much better when it concentrates on the sport aspects especially the pulsating training sequences. With rapidfire editing and rousing music these parts of the film are quite inspirational and make you want to get out of your chair and put yourself through your paces in a gym as soon as possible! The final fight itself is a pretty exciting sequence but given the fact that the film shows us that Drago has an impossibly strong punchingpower one finds it rather hard to believe that Rocky could still be standing after fifteen seconds let alone fifteen rounds. Rocky IV is totally unrealistic totally simpleminded. and totally entertaining if you look upon it as a guilty pleasure!".

Both Rocky 3 and 4 have a 6.7 here in IMDb i disagree they both should have a better rating at least a 7.1 or 7.3 if you loved all the previous Rocky movies you won't be disappointed Rocky IV is by far the most entertaining one.

Rocky IV is where the franchise becomes even better the first 3 were awesome and this one is by far the most badass a better villain played by Dolph Lundgren a better fight a better movie soundtrack and an even better cast and there is still some drama in it. Both Rocky 3 and 4 have a 6.7 here in IMDb i disagree they both should have a better rating at least a 7.1 or 7.3 if you loved all the previous Rocky movies you won't be disappointed Rocky IV is by far the most entertaining one. Because if i can change you can change everybody can change.";

Rocky travels to the frozen tundra of the USSR to avenge the most tragic death of Creed and I must say that some of the greatest musical montages I have ever seen are shown. Hearts on Fire and Burning Hearts are songs you will never forget from this flick. Rocky sports a beard runs up a mountain and proves that if he can change everyone can change.

DragoLundgrenhas a punch strength of about 2000 PSImeaning his blows are twice harder than Tyson's for example. He manages to hit Rocky in the head about 50 times and Rocky still survives 15 rounds. Not only survives he wins and he even has enough juice to make a poignant speech. What surprises me is the amount of IMDb comments stating well it's not that impossible when you're focused on something you can endure pretty much etc. First three movies in Rocky installment had somewhat credible storyline although final fight with Clubber was fairly exaggerated. Here we have exaggeration multiplied by 50  Drago kills Creed in round 2 and he uses same kind of attack on Rocky he sends him 8 or 9 times on the floor and Rocky fights back for the first time in round 5.Come on by that time he would have been already declared dead and received a Viking funeral.This movie is not all that bad it has an excellent soundtrack and scene in which Rocky drives around reminiscing of his previous fights with No easy way out going in the back is touching but fails miserably in department of plot development and credibility.Creed and Clubber were strong fighters but Rocky still had a decent chance against them that made first three movies so believable. There's no way middleaged midget like Balboa could have defeated someone with superhuman abilities like Drago...But I assume USA needed a patriotic boost in a midst of Cold War and Stallone certainly provided it with Rambo 3 and Rocky 4.".

The way they make Russians look is ridiculous it's so bad that is not good it's so bad you laugh because how bad it is  when the Russians synchronized applause and flags everywhereat a time I thought that I would see my countries flag  Romania with so many flags in there. Further more they shouldn't have killed Apollo I mean in the third movie Mickey died and now another key character dies. After he died I said to myself Damn I should have foreseen that. And Russia really doesn't look like Russiawhere are the Reagan wanted posters?. But really I realize that they could not film in Russia but they could at least try to make it look like it was filmed theresome orthodox churches some people from village should have said something to Rocky in Russian things like this. The last complain I have is that the movie feels like a joke Apollo's entrance to the match Drago's lines like You will loseor something like that. It's so cheesy actually it's to cheesy. All in all Rocky 4 doesn't compare to the masterpiece that was Rocky or even to Rocky 2  3 which were great movies. To much politics. I know it's a propaganda movieyes that's what it is. Look for the definition of propaganda and compare to this movie but it fails even at this. The Rambo series 2  3 and recently John Rambo were also propaganda movies but they were awesomeactually they were so bad they were awesome. Anyway if you want to laugh a bit you can watch this movie but don't have the same expectations you had before watching each of the first 3 Rocky movies.".

Acceptable sequel that works every time and in which beloved Balboa is considering retirement  but he returns when Apollo Creed  Carl Weathers  is beaten by a big  mean Russian during a bout . As Apollo is crushed by an obnoxious  corpulent boxer  that's why Rocky sinks into a depression . To confront the huge boxer  Rocky goes Russia to seek vengeance and hoping win fame  confidence and selfrespect  as he faces off a tough contender performed by Dolph Lundgren . About to be retired from boxing and back from riches to ring  Rocky takes on a new combat . Rocky is homaged as one of the greatest boxing champions in the history  then  The Italian Stallion  the heavy weight champion  returns to take on the ultimate boxing combat  as he comes out from almostretirement for revenge and to combat the strongest  youngest and faster contender  The Russian Drago . While Rocky attempts to prove himself and his family  his wife Talia Shire and brotherinlaw Burt Young . Shortly after  and in Russia the coach Duke Tony Burton decides to train Rocky for the impressive match against the brave and invincible opponent  so Rocky can attempt to win him . Will Balboa knock the Russkie out ? .This agreeable predictable entertainment displays splendidly the 'formula Rocky'  though loses strength in the numerous and subsequent sequels . The movie works in usual manner  fitting appropriately to franchise  even though we know the plot the film works . This soaper on the ring is developed in gentleness  dignity  feelgood style as well as the initial outing . Great training montage and spectacular and climatic final bout . Writerdirectoractor Stallone new entry is surprisingly entertaining and packs good feeling . Here Dolph Lundgren isn't as much fun as some Rocky's former opponents . The Rocky's earlier contenders were the followings  Rocky I and II was Carl Weathers  Rocky III the fastmouthed and cruel boxer Mister T . Usual and nostalgic musical score by Bill Conti along with Vince DiCola and atmospheric cinematography by Bill Butler . The motion picture was lavishly financed by the producers of complete saga  Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler and well directed by Stallone who along John G. Avildsen created the six Rocky saga . Here Stallone overdoes the hyperjingoism and patriotism and relies too heavily on uplifting stock footage from previous Rocky films . However  this Rocky IV won several Golden Raspberries such as  85 worst actor Stallone  worst screenplay  worst director  worst support actor  Dolph Lundgren and worst support actress  Brigitte Nielsen who married Stallone . Rating  Good  being impossible to dislike  the result is deliciously corny agreeable and predictable amusement . Although we've seen it all before  Sylvester manages to make it work one more time and it works every way even better than successive Rockys .It is followed by Rocky V in which Rocky  nicknamed as the Chicken Stallion  lives from records being ostracized  but our hero returns as a coach  as Rocky goes back despite his own cerebral damage through a rematch on the streets  as he fights Tommy 'Machine' GunnTommy Morrison  meanwhile  the champ must adjust to his family's new life on bankruptcy  subsequently Rocky Balboa proving his estranged young son Milo Ventiglimia who still can fight .

	schema:reviewBody "This cinematic masterpiece is the most underappreciated film of our time. Explain to me this how can we as Americans not appreciate the fact that without the contributions of American hero Rocky Balboa in this film the Cold War would still be going on. When Rocky delivers his monologue it is perhaps one of the best speeches known to man. Sure there was that Lincoln fellow in his Address to the Gettysburgians and the Martin Luther King fellow. But as influential as their speeches were none compare to the magnitude and the repercussions that this speech brought about. For all of those individuals who lived in the time of the Cold War they know that life was tough to put it simply. And without this man's bravado and courageousness we'd still be in a time of nuclear proliferation and fear. This man put his body and mind on the line and even came out with severe brain damage as a result. A true patriot he is along with the likes of William Wallace and Tyrone Hill and what they each brought to their countries. Drago was a representation of all that was wrong in the world. Steroids corruption communism and pure hatred. But even he the abominable monstrosity that he was couldn't defeat the Italian Stallion himself. But despite what one man's force can do the power of words is enough to conquer a nation as Rocky did with this monologue.During this fight I've seen a lot of changing in the way you feel about me and in the way I feel about you. In here there were two guys killing each other but I guess that's better than twenty million. I guess what I'm trying to say is that if I can change and you can change everybody can change! The sheer power diction and confidence that he brought upon that Russian crowd conquered the Soviet Union and began the fall of communism. When I saw this film and more importantly the monologue I was feeling perhaps what Moses felt when he saw the Burning Bush on the Mountain of Sinai. A rush of adrenaline passion and invigoration that no one has ever felt before.So I call upon you as Americans to step forth from this day with a new sense of pride and patriotism for there is good in a world smug with so much evil and prejudice. May the power and grace of Rocky's words bless you all as if they've done upon myself.EVERYBODY CAN CHANGE so can you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sylvester Stallone has done his fair share of ridiculous movies but this one takes the cake. The fact that it was shot during the cold war isn't really a valid excuse for the horribly stereotyped Russians. The entire Russian population seems to consist of people totally devoid of emotion with their sole reason for existence being to humiliate Americans. Even the country itself is stereotyped in that 80's American way where every shot inside the Soviet Union has to be in mid winter. Naturally Mister Balboa and his crew arrive there during a snow storm.The fight scenes are as badly cliched as the the rest of the movie. I'm not too interested in boxing but even I know that punches don't sound like that and no one gets hit as heavily and over such a long period of time as Dolph and Sly get during their bout and actually live. Of course the fight follows the our hero gets badly beaten but then rises to beat the baddie and win over the crowd cliche. No excuses for giving away the ending here someone with the IQ of Rambo could see this one coming.Dolph Lundgren is meant to play the robotic Russian fighting machine and as such has to play no emotion except to follow his programmed routine of hate for his enemies. This suits his acting abilities well. He does get one of the best lines in the movie and virtually his only line when he introduces himself to Rocky in the ring with I must break you!The little plot that the movie has is padded out with sequences of bad 80's music that play like music videos. The movie is quite laughable in some places but the constant flag waving does get a bit much so this movie is not even in the so bad it's funny category. On top of that there's Sylvester's speech in the end where he brings out the American inside every Russian that's truly stomach turning.0 out of 10".

The fourth on the other hand does very little to arouse any emotion at all has infantile humour and an ending that brought tears to my eyes. Rocky is so likable because hes a simpleton who quintessentially doesn't give up. This is changed completely in four where Rocky preaches about useless war in the most ridiculous possible way. When the Russian politicians applaud his words of a five year old's wisdom one can only laugh.In my opinion this is worse than many Schwarenegger movies. They have many similarities but Arnold movies don't try to boast a political message they are intended to be mindless and action packed. You can appreciate them because they accomplish exactly what they aim to. This movie may be liked but not in the way it originally intended.Terrible".

	schema:reviewBody "Well...what can I say about this one? To be honest after watching it I was left sitting there dumbly my mouth half agape trying to pick out what I had just seen. I don't think I could give a very good reviewrecommendation for this but I would like to comment on the film. From here there are severe spoilers so read on at your own risk.SymbolismDark Harbor is the brain child of Adam Coleman Howard a meticulous writerdirector with a critical eyes for detail and meaning. Some people feel he puts too much thought into his details. One gentlemen in a DH review said ...the couch was suppose to have symbolism? I didn't get it... Personally I think great attention to details especially the ones no else would notice is one of the most important aspects of being an artist. Another is understanding and accepting the fact that most people will not notice these additions. For needless symbolism I must give Howards props.PlotThe film was interesting in its use of an old plot with a new twist. The cheating lover kills the wifehusband so they can be with the person they love. Very used yet still equally as effective at plucking the strings that make up humankind. The homosexual twist of the plot doesn't really change the meaning just makes the slap the audience gets at the end even hardernot a bad thing in my opinion.SexualitySeveral people have critiqued DH as an attempt to bait proper viewers into an intriguing world just to slam them with an attack on modern society's politics and issues. I think these people are just homophobic. Alan Rickman has also been accused of being gay due to this role. All I have to say for that is this Can you say acting? Try it with me...acting. Acting. Now together acting. Very good. I think it's shallow insecure people who find issues with films that use real life to make a point about real life. I apologize to all the delusional folks out there but there are gay people in this world.NudityHmm... This is one of the reasons I am not sure how I feel about the film. I am not opposed to the use of nudity as symbolism or for shock value as long as its ultimate intention is to make a point not just to see someone waving themselves out in the wind. In this particular instance I can see where the use of the scene would add to the movie. However I think it would have benefited the entire screen usage if it had been done with a slightly larger bit of reflection. There was a hasty derobing followed by a transitional swim to shore and a selfrealizing ascension of the stairs. All of this is well put together and effective. I only think it would have been more of a That was in depth than a He was naked! if Howard had allowed Rickman to think to the camera a little more before he started stripping. Obviously symbolizing his internal transition the scenario left out the crisis making it spontaneous and unrealistic for an interpretation of his emotional change. What we end up with is nude Rickman jumping off a boat followed up by a generously lengthened backend sequence effective and useful if you can get over the He was naked! thought quickly enough. This is defiantly a scene better taken in by an audience who already knows it's going to happen.The PlayersAlan Rickman Rickman does a wonderful job of melding with the other two actors to create a believable film. There are some small problems with his character but I think those are more of a directorial issue. Whether he himself added to them by suggesting these direction incidents I cannot say. There were several points at which he dropped his dull flat American accent for a moment of his usual speech. These happenings only added to the blandness of all American speakings. Though robbed of his usual vocal power Rickman proves that there is more to him than voice as his acting maintains its high standard.Polly Walker Walker shows her own talent in Dark Harbor as she swings from the critical wife to the wronged lover and then back and to several other places along the way. She holds most of the character action together as Rickman and Reedus rarely interact with each other on screen but through her. The only issue I have with her character is the struggling indifference to the acts of the others. Alexis seems to fall out of character a few times going from the seemingly assertive business type to a passive observer most notably in the scenes she shares with the young stranger.Norman Reedus I had never seen Reedus act in anything prior to watching to this film. He did well I think for the part he was supposed to play. The sexy mushrooms scenes were a bit of a stretch but I think Reedus has found a way to make fungus appealing even if only because the viewer associates it with rolling drunkenly in fern saplings with a dark strangera fantastical thought which had until present never entered my mind. There are parts where one must wonder if the part was poorly written for a line or two or if Reedus just wasn't in the mood to work that day but these are relatively easy to overlook as the film is swept along to another angle.OverallOn the whole I think Dark Harbor was an interesting film full of visual usage that I can not say was always effective. But learning from Dave I find crass generalizations are often better left by the wayside when it comes to something as varied as human nature a heavily running theme in this movie. DH is best served on a warm plate so I would suggest checking reviews and venturing a few spoilers unless you are the type who can watch a long jerky film and comfortably say Let's go back for another try it may be different if I watch it again.".

I only think it would have been more of a That was in depth than a He was naked! if Howard had allowed Rickman to think to the camera a little more before he started stripping. Obviously symbolizing his internal transition the scenario left out the crisis making it spontaneous and unrealistic for an interpretation of his emotional change. What we end up with is nude Rickman jumping off a boat followed up by a generously lengthened backend sequence effective and useful if you can get over the He was naked! thought quickly enough. This is defiantly a scene better taken in by an audience who already knows it's going to happen.The PlayersAlan Rickman Rickman does a wonderful job of melding with the other two actors to create a believable film. There are some small problems with his character but I think those are more of a directorial issue. Whether he himself added to them by suggesting these direction incidents I cannot say. There were several points at which he dropped his dull flat American accent for a moment of his usual speech. These happenings only added to the blandness of all American speakings. Though robbed of his usual vocal power Rickman proves that there is more to him than voice as his acting maintains its high standard.Polly Walker Walker shows her own talent in Dark Harbor as she swings from the critical wife to the wronged lover and then back and to several other places along the way. She holds most of the character action together as Rickman and Reedus rarely interact with each other on screen but through her. The only issue I have with her character is the struggling indifference to the acts of the others. Alexis seems to fall out of character a few times going from the seemingly assertive business type to a passive observer most notably in the scenes she shares with the young stranger.Norman Reedus I had never seen Reedus act in anything prior to watching to this film. He did well I think for the part he was supposed to play. The sexy mushrooms scenes were a bit of a stretch but I think Reedus has found a way to make fungus appealing even if only because the viewer associates it with rolling drunkenly in fern saplings with a dark strangera fantastical thought which had until present never entered my mind. There are parts where one must wonder if the part was poorly written for a line or two or if Reedus just wasn't in the mood to work that day but these are relatively easy to overlook as the film is swept along to another angle.OverallOn the whole I think Dark Harbor was an interesting film full of visual usage that I can not say was always effective. But learning from Dave I find crass generalizations are often better left by the wayside when it comes to something as varied as human nature a heavily running theme in this movie. DH is best served on a warm plate so I would suggest checking reviews and venturing a few spoilers unless you are the type who can watch a long jerky film and comfortably say Let's go back for another try it may be different if I watch it again.";

It's funny though because the ridiculousness of the twist ending is one of the main aspects that has made the movie stick in my mind since I saw it like eight years ago. The uniquely paired cast makes it worthwhile as does gorgeous locations and solid cinematography working hand in hand with neat rain speckled sound design to bring us a low key thriller that does the trick. Alan Rickman and Polly Walker play a wealthy couple on their way to a remote getaway at a snazzy forest covered property they own in picturesque Maine. They are about as dysfunctional as couples get bickering petty creatures who can't stand to be in each others presence to the point of constant tension. On their way into a secluded densely forested region they come across an unconscious young man Norman Reedus who vaguely suffers amnesia and appears to be distressed prompting them to take him with them to their abode. From their tension arises to an uncomfortable level as the drifter proves to be both a third wheel and a sinister force of unease to both culminating in an ambient rainy forest finale that stands as the best sequence in the film and a nice bit of work at that. Rickman doesn't usually go for this kind of melodramatic American stuff and it's surprising in a good way to see him flex his genre muscles. Walker who wowed me in HBO's Rome is overlooked and slides into any role with intuition and believability not to mention her luscious physical presence. Reedus an actor now known for his endless work on the increasingly dull and shabby The Walking Dead has countless hidden genre pieces like this in his filmography and his inherently edgy enigmatically off kilter aura makes everyone worthwhile. This one especially so as it's a nicely crafted little dip into a hot and cold mess of a situation that tears the rug from under you in ways you won't see coming.".

	schema:headline " An intriguing smallbudget film worth experiencing";
	schema:reviewBody "Before Norman Reedus became a fanfavorite on the popular television series 'The Walking Dead' he was a smalltime actor gathering a bit of attention through a conjunction of both mainstream and independent films  such notable titles being a small role in the tense thriller '8MM' with Nicolas Cage the John Hughespenned drama 'Reach the Rock' and of course an early role opposite Mira Sorvino in the sci fi thriller 'Mimic.' But in 1998 he starred opposite Alan Rickman and Polly Walker in the rather strange tautlywound independent suspense film 'Dark Harbor' an eerily eccentric tale of forbidden love with only a select few characters inhibiting the screen throughout its duration.The movie follows three characters woven into a sort of psychological array of hidden motives and blind attraction. Norman Reedus stars as a drifter who is picked up by a bickering married couple Rickman and Walker and finds himself getting stuck with the two on a rather isolated property in the southeastern part of Maine. Along the way tension grows and the shaky marriage begins to be questioned further due to the interference of the drifter.The film features a haunting musical score by relatively unknown composer David Mansfield atmospheric locations and a psychological foray into one of the darkest areas of the human mind. The film may not be one to revisit too often due to its dark nature but it's certainly worth experiencing. I for one really respond to the movie's overall feel or atmospheric tone and relish in the director's intent to focus his story against a backdrop of moody and isolated locations for the purpose of extracting of his stars from the rest of the world. The DVD released by Artisan Series in the U.S. and now out of print features a commentary track by director Adam Coleman Howard which is essential listening if one enjoys this type of movie. It dives deep into the oddities on screen and assists in understanding the film's coveted structure. Check this one out especially if you like suspenseful dramas with unconventional themes. The disc can be had for a reasonable price on the secondary market as of this writing and is worth adding to your collection  especially for you Reedus fans clamoring to see him outside his zombiehunting escapades.".

	schema:reviewBody "The middleaged lawyer David Weinberg Alan Rickman has been married for seven years with his very young wife Alexis Chandler Weinberg Polly Walker. They are driving through a lonely road in a rainstorm trying to get the ferry to their private island. However Alexis sees a fainted drifter Norman Reedus on the roadside and they stop their car. Alexis forces David to bring the drifter to the next town they miss their ferry and need to spend the night in a motel. On the next morning they go to their house in the island and David proposes to sail with her but they have an accident in the mist and the boat is stranded near an island. They find the drifter camping on shore and he helps the couple to fix the boat. When they arrive home they invite the man to stay with them. When David leaves the house to play golf Alexis and the drifter spend the time together and he tells that he is a poet but cannot write and shows his poems written by different people. He asks her to write and sign a weird poem about drowning for him. Then they go to the woods and when the drifter is going to eat a mushroom she tells him that it is lethal. However she explains that there are mushrooms that are lethal and others that have aphrodisiac effect. However she does not eat the fruiting body and when they return David wants to take the man to town. But there is a problem with the boat and he needs to return. On the next morning David has an argument with Alexis and fights with the drifter that flees. However Alexis meets him in the woods and she is seduced by him eating the aphrodisiac mushroom. What will happen to them?Dark Harbor is a great thriller even when the viewer watches for the second time. The cast is spectacular and the screenplay and the direction are excellent. The story has elements from Knife in the Water but instead of an open end there is a surprising plot point in the end and a totally unexpected conclusion. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Ilha do Medo Island of the Fear".

There are just three actors and most of the movie takes place in the same house so it is up to the actors and writers to make it work. I knew how it was going to end before watching but not all the details of it so although I would have liked to be surprised I still enjoyed the suspense of the film and seeing how the characters reacted to one another.If you are a fan of any of these actors this is a mustsee as they all had amazing performances. I'm trying to get more people to watch it but since it is hard to find I guess only hard core fans will make the effort.".

Picking up this young stranger Norman Needus who was thought at first to be dead he ends up also getting on the ferry the next morning and sailing for the Weinbergs' island home. Hanging out in the woods and the nearby beach the stranger come in contact with the Weinberg's again in a most unusual way. The Weinbergs planing to sail back to the mainland get trapped in a fog bank and go off course and runs aground on nearby Seal Rock. It's there again they to run into the stranger as if he knew that they would be there. This the stranger get knocked out by David with a log thinking he's trying to rob both him and Alexis.The stranger after recovering from his head wound helps David  Alexis get their boat fixed so they can sail back home. Later cooking up a large and magnificent meal for the couple he's allowed to stay over until the next morning when David is to take him by boat back to the mainland. Up until the time when David leaves both the stranger and Alexis alone and goes to see some friends on the mainland you have no idea where the movie Dark Harbor is taking you.There's something going on between the three David Alexis  the strangerbut it's so weird that you feel that at any moment you would find out that it's a dream or hallucinationlike the dream that Alexis had about David attacking her with an ax earlier in the movie. Dark Harbor goes in and out of sequence as if it were badly edited with a number of scenes that are never explained? Like what just exactly happened to David when he wakes up with a bloody mouth and who gave it to him? Alexis? the stranger? There's also David bloody mouth and all? going off the handle and what seems to be accusing Alexis of driving her father to suicide where she completely loses it and almost runs him through with a set of kitchen knives. All this while the stranger calmly sit at the table watching the entire scene. The stranger himself is attacked by what by now seems to be an insane David only to lose him in the woods with Alexis who it turned out David was leaching off during their seven year marriage throwing him out of her house and island. Finding the stranger in the woods cold and with nowhere to go Alexis seems to accept him back as David's replacement as the man in the house. We then see both she and the stranger munch down some wild mushrooms that grow on the island during a pouring rain. Just when you think the film Dark Harbor is over your hit with theses two scenes catching you off guard as your trying to figure just what happened in the filmthat explains the reason for the strangers present on the island and in both David's  Alxis' lives.Very confusing story but the breathtaking and gorgeous photography of the state of Maine make the movie worth sitting through. The surprise ending isn't really that hard to figure out since the stranger showed his true feeling and colors to Alexis earlier in the film when he did a skit of a 1962 birthday party for JFK at Madison Square Garden. It became obvious at the end of the movie that all that happened between David  Alxis involving the stranger was no accident at all but planned well in advance. It was only in the films final moment that you realized who did all the planning.".

The basic storyline is that a bickering married couple are on their way from holiday when they find themselves in the company of a hitchhiker and a love triangle starts to unfold........ It's a dark thriller with a lot of twists and turns. The acting was okay. I also saw this film because it stars Alan Rickman one of my favourite actors. His American accent was a bit dodgy and sometimes he just give up and goes back to his dry British tone.The wife was poorly acted and the lad was a little bit too weird for my taste. I can see why some people find the script to be very bad because the relationship between the three main characters was not developed enough and there are a few holes in the story. However because I have a strange mind I see the holes as part of the question for asking certain questions adds more mystery to the story.Like a few spoilersa did David really go to the golf session or was it a ruse so the lad could seduce the wife? And was all that part of the final plan?b did the boat really sink near the end of the film? If so was it accidental or deliberate? If not was it all an act so the two men could spend some time together?c when did the two males actually meet? Did they meet earlier or was David picking up the lad their first meeting? The biggest mystery of them all.SPOILERS ENDThe cinematography and music were average but could have been better.However I give this film a 7 and would recommend it to Norman Reedus and Alan Rickman fans especially for the ending!710".

Meanwhile Tante Theresa Brigitte Mira is spreading the word that a notorious Texas gunman is on his way to settle the ongoing blood feuds. So when Carlo arrives he is greeted by a couple of attempts on his life. Not to worry the shotguns in this movie make a lot of noise but there is very little smoke and certainly no bullets. Soon the prettiest pink petticoat in town who goes by the name of Antonella Gerlinde Locker is falling for Carlo and he starts singing love songs into her hair that may or may not explain the title of this film. On the other side of the feud comedy duo Wolfgang Neuss and Wolfgang Muller do a Danny Kaye inspired number of their own and set up a trap for the 'famous gunslinger'. But clever Carlo joins forces with Die Zwei Wolfgangs and promises that if they let him marry Antonella the couple will take Tante Theresa away with them.Our big star proves to have rather a limited repertoire as he sings each of his songs twice. To add a little variation the music editors have some fun speeding up either the music or the pictures but never both at the same time. I suppose this was quite amusing back in '58. When everything is just about resolved Mitzi and the drunken manager remember them? try to stop the wedding. For a moment it looks like Antonella is about to meet the same fate as Appolonia from that other Sicily bound gangster epic but then we remember Carlo has not reprised the song 'Antonella' yet.4 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Der Stern von Santa Clara from 1958 is a romancecrimedramafamily movie starring SwissItalian Vico Torriani. I guess Torriani must have been a huge star back then. At least his character is one in this movie. He plays a famous singer in the USA and returns back to his roots to Italy to relax a bit far away from all the fame. There he gets involved with a decadelasting struggle between two hostile families. And of course Torriani sings for a large part of the film. Unfortunately the songs are equally forgettable as the rest of the film. SingingHumming a song that rhymes avanti with chianti on at least three occasions just does not cut the cake even for the 1950s.The director of this 80minute movie is Werner Jacobs. He worked on the pretty successful Lmmel films as well. There is more than one love interest to Torriani's character so some embarrassing jealousy and cheesy love story scenes are unavoidable. Sometimes this was a truly strange film. The overacting way way too much during several scenes and occasionally reminded of the silent film actors from the 1910s and 1920 but not the gifted ones. Also it does not help that I found Torriani's character never particularly likable with a permanent arrogant smile on his lips even in lifethreatening situations. Now about these this is also one of the biggest flaws of the film. It never decides if it is comedy or drama and that is exactly why the more tense scenes including a staged shooting appear as a complete joke. In one scene he starts joking around with the guys who intended to kill him in cold blood minutes ago and even sings with them yes the notorious chianti song. The love story part was pretty schmaltzy. Admittedly that could be said about most German films from the 1950s. There was one character a young groupie following the central character to Italy who was just included for the sake of it with no real purpose. I guess we should always be remembered what a star the main character was and how millions of women admired him.Sometimes with all the slapstick humor and fake drama this film had it reminded me a bit of The Three Stooges but really not a good version of them. So yeah I do not really recommend watching it unless one of the cast is a great favorite of yours. I myself was delighted to see Brigitte Mira here. But her role was too small and insignificant to save this film from being a failure in the grand picture.".

Unlike most war movies this is infantry combat as seen through the eyes of several members of a platoon as it walks through the Italian countryside in 1943 on its way to seize a German observation post. In all the action sequences you never see anything that the individual soldier German Italian or American depicted on the screen doesn't see. You only see what is happening around him as he sees it. I've seen them all and no other director ever approached war filming this way. And I can tell you personally that this is the way it was in combat. The only errors in the entire movie involved grenades you don't blow bridges with them and you don't pull their pins with your teeththat's the best way I know of pulling out a tooth wo a dentist's helping hand. A landmark movie made during the war and only released after the war ended in 1945 because of the final scenes. Matched only by William Wellman's A Story of GI Joe this is the best film on infantry combat produced from World War II.  Yes yes I've seen Saving Private Ryan.  Except for the shock of the first 20 minutes it's Steven Spielberg's threestar remembrance of his boyhood comic book war stories.".

There are no John Wayne heroics here no superhuman commandos just the poor bloody infantry. They are just a platoon of fairly ordinary men on a mission to march to a farmhouse and occupy it. It is not that Hollywood staple of the mission that could change the course of the war. They lose their lieutenant. They take casualties from planes maybe even their own planes. The sergeant who takes over the lead breaks down. They keep going. They talk  a lot. But what talk it is! It is the talk of soldiers. Commonplace stuff where do you come from what are you going to do after the war do the brass know what they're doing gimme a cigarette. The song that opens and closes the movie makes a point that is perhaps the point of the movie when it links them to soldiers of other places and times.Incidentally it is fun to look at the cast. Most of the major players in this movie were at the beginning of long and successful careers notably Dana Andrews Lloyd Bridges and Norman Lloyd. Just another thought  after seeing Saving Private Ryan I realized that Steven Spielberg has seen A Walk in the Sun at least as many times as I have. My uncle a veteran of Tunisia who went into Salerno as a Ranger hated most war films but not this one. He also told me that his company had a fight with a German armored car very similar to the one with the halftrack in this film.".

I watch it every chance I get.  The cast is excellent with many of the actors becoming more popular in later years. This movie offers excellent insight into what makes people tick. The platoon making its way inland during the invasion of Italy offers insight into what a farmer school teacher etc. considers important in life.  One scene which I believe describes the futility of war is where the farmer determines that the soil is worthless.  The cerebral fellow John Ireland states simply that it is because too many soilders have walked over it for too many years centuries.I especially like how John Ireland writes letters in his head and hopes to write them on paper later.  I also like the part where Lloyd Bridges starts laughing because he suddenly feels like a little kid when planting explosives on a bridge. The confident Sergeant  Dana Andrews  shows fear when about to give the command to launch the attack on the farmhouse.The fast talking dialogue between Richard Conte and his buddy remind me of people we have met.  This is an excellent movie. I believe that most people would appreciate this movie whether or not they watch war movies.  This movie offers a lot of insight into human nature.The movie is practically void of blood and gore and leaves it to the imagination of the viewer such as when the Lieutenant is seriously wounded while on board the landing craft with half of  his face missing.  You can imagine it and don't have to see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I usually hate to name a favorite film in a genre because I always have several I rate equally well but if asked to name one that tops the rest I have to say in the WWII genre this film is it. It is an intelligent and honest film about men in war no heroics no jingoism no evil enemy just regular Joes who are caught up in something big and deadly and would rather be home but are doing their job. There are no clichs no obligatory guy from Brooklyn no high sounding phrases no patriotic slogans just an honest and realistic depiction of strictly ordinary guys caught in war. Lewis Milestone the director obviously understood the combat soldier.I love the dialog the banter among the men of a fighting platoon especially that between Pvts Rivera played by Richard Conte and Friedman played by George Tyne. Coincidentally Dana Andrews one of my favorite actors character is Sgt. Tyne. I wonder what was made of that by actor George Tyne. The cast also includes a young Lloyd Bridges and Huntz Hall in the only roll I can recall seeing him in outside the East Side Kids Bowery Boys films.The novel by Harry Brown from which the film was made was republished a few years ago and the dialog in the film is lifted straight out of it which is part of what makes the film so great. In fact this is one of those rare cases where the movie follows the book faithfully almost to the letter.I was nine years old when this film was released and I well remember the night I first saw it. My parents who have just celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary thought it was a romance film. I didn't want to go but when we arrived at the old Westmore Theater now long gone which was in walking distance of our home and I saw the lobby photos and saw it was a war film I was the one delighted. There was always at least one scene from these films that stayed in my mind over the years and in this one it was the hand of the German soldier with the ring on it hanging out of the wrecked armored vehicle and the assault on the farmhouse.It was just a little walk in the warm Italian sun but it wasn't an easy thing.An excellent film made from an excellent novel with an excellent cast all making an excellent viewing experience.".

Will the enemy open fire right at the beach and kill all of them? Will there be mines? Who is their enemy anyway Germans or Italians? Will they get strafed by enemy aircraft of will 'our boys' control the skies? These are questions that a regular infantryman may ask from himself. They don't know what is waiting for them and they try to guess what the overall situation is. The movie is lots of talking waiting and walking by the Italian countryside. The soldiers must be alert at all times and there may be false alarms too. Action comes suddenly and is also quickly committed.This is another of those war movies that can be called 'realistic'. In many postmodern war movie realism is seen as a synonym of lots of blood and dying soldiers yelling 'mommy' and such. I don't call that realism  these men know exactly how to deal with disturbing things that war contains. They ignore things that they cannot emotionally handle and this must also be the way those things were handled in real war. This may well be seen as a dull movie but it also shows the war as it really was. There is no pathos at all in this movie and that is why many people like it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is beyond criticism. Within its celluloid record there clambers cold history. The tanks are real. The planes are real. The people are real. This was a contemporary war movie to the actual war without the layers of myth laquered by years of failing memory.Unlike recent high budget overthetop productions and the copious blood spattering within this little epic tends to mute the violence into the pathos of the moment of death. That being the death of heroes. And the emphasis appears to hinge on the suddenness the randomness and the tragedy of men dying hard. It is a stark memorial to the courage and sacrifice of the World War II soldier.Amazingly and very much in contrast to most other war films of the period which demonized the enemy this film provides a neutral texture to the foe. Here the German soldiers are but shadows on the cave wall. The stray Italian soldiers appear as comic sidekicks in the maelstrom of a nation at peril from two sides. The enemy appears to escape the moral condemnation that other films embraced. This is war and this is what it is by those who fought it.The film describes the landings of an infantry platoon on the Salerno beaches in Italy. All of a sudden they are left leaderless as two of the senior officers meets a soldier's fate. The beach scene remains a descriptive detail of what a soldiers paradox in modern warfare was. They bring the war but they do not know where it is where they are whether the war will visit them or what lies in front of them. Without the need for special effects the director garnishes the film with the fog of war skillfully.A startling moment is when the third ranking leader a noncom sargeant succumbs to panic and shell shock. It is perhaps the kindest treatment of the condition ever presented cinematically during that period. The rest of the platoon appears to be supportive to the fallen insane sargeant. But the war goes on. They move on.Rallied by a solid sargeant the platoon moves onto its objectives a bridge and a farmhouse at a cost. The objectives are difficult and the angst of leadership and follower play the scene well. And unlike most war movies where heroism goes beyond definition these heroes are all very much afraid.The film has a solid core of young actors of the period. Dana Andrews a very young Lloyd Bridges appear to anchor the cast. The black and white format suits this tiny epic. The cinematography stunts are solid and consistently well done. It is a darkish film very much worth seeing.".

It is perhaps the kindest treatment of the condition ever presented cinematically during that period. The rest of the platoon appears to be supportive to the fallen insane sargeant. But the war goes on. They move on.Rallied by a solid sargeant the platoon moves onto its objectives a bridge and a farmhouse at a cost. The objectives are difficult and the angst of leadership and follower play the scene well. And unlike most war movies where heroism goes beyond definition these heroes are all very much afraid.The film has a solid core of young actors of the period. Dana Andrews a very young Lloyd Bridges appear to anchor the cast. The black and white format suits this tiny epic. The cinematography stunts are solid and consistently well done. It is a darkish film very much worth seeing.";

	schema:reviewBody "In a televised lecture Harry Brown explained to his students how important banter was in any story about the military. He ought to know. A Walk in the Sun is full of banter all of it low brow but keen as well.The dialog is mostly stylized along the lines of say Hemingway or Charles Portis' True Grit although it is not imitative in any way. I wouldn't trust you with a popgun says Friedman to Rivera. You gotta trust me. I'm a machine gunner with a machine gun. And somehow despite the artistic effects as if the lines were in blank verse the dialog rings true to life among a small group of men with a superordinate goal. Dana Andrews' Sgt. Tyne is standing alone at the beach next to the body of his friend a harmless medic. He lights a cigarette says aloud Gee I'm scared slings his weapon and walks off towards the thing that is frightening him. What a concise and very human admission. Gee I'm scared. The artistic effects of the dialog are echoed in the direction by Lewis Milestone full of silhouettes and inserts but they don't distract for a moment from our involvement in the story. In the opening scenes the men are packed into a landing craft approaching the beach at Salerno. They are mostly silent and thoughtful except when muttering brief remarks to one another or to themselves. There are lots of soliloquies in this film. We see hardly any of the scene except for dimly lighted faces. Sometimes during exchanges we don't even see the faces only a glistening helmet. And sometimes the screen is completely black.Milestone has been criticized as being too obvious but I've never understood why. How many other directors would pass up a chance to show us dive bombers attacking troop ships. All we hear are the defensive boomboombooms of the 40 mm. guns and the explosions when a ship is hit. And all we see of the battle is a roiling plume of black smoke rising from behind a dune.It's really an ensemble movie with Dana Andrews the lead figure. We get to know the men pretty well all of them distinguished from one another by their characters not by the use of facile props like mustaches. Sometimes they're pretty funny. During a break one infantryman holds up a leaf and inspects it. He remarks to Huntz Hall's lowbrow that it's a wonderfully designed object. Huntz Hall puts him down and posits dismissively that there's nuthin' so special about a leaf. He's seen lots of leaves.The men are identified only as belonging to a Texas division and the landing seems to be at Salerno. Salerno was a botched landing. The enemy were all prepared because there was virtually no other place for the landings to be made. The beach head was probably saved by air support and naval gunfire.I've kind of emphasized the dreamlike banter that the author of the novel was so fond of yet this is a film with quite a bit of action. The final attack on the farmhouse really IS enough to scare Dana Andrews  or anybody else  and it's staged with Milestone's signature panning shots.Good movie.".

Marshall and Stephen Ambrose have long noted how each soldier has an isolated view of combat with absolutely no idea of what is going on outside of his or her immediate area I wonder who won says Richard Beymer near the end of The Longest Day.This movie stays with that view throughout leaving the generals' the philosophers' and the politicians' views to others. Run walk crawl and dig in. Often smell and hearing are more useful senses than sight in guessing what's going on. Death and emotional breakdown are almost routine part of the job. Younger viewers may note the influences of this movie on so many others and the TV shows that followed from Altman's Combat episodes to Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers. The soldier's view of combat on Omaha Beach in Private Ryan is one example. Compare in both movies the sharp banter between the ethnically diverse foot soldiers as they walk along towards inevitable danger whether farmhouse or antenna installation. I even see the dialog between Vincent Vega and Jules as they carry out their missions as an outgrowth of this movie.I agree with Uncle Frank.".

Only one other Force of Evil comes to mind along those lines but this is even more so. Not for nothing that a song hangs over the proceedings. The movie itself is a long song. Very few films are so rhythmic. For that we can thank not only Milestone but Robert Rossen and the book. Pound for pound it holds up better than any war film ever made because of its poetry. Even the way it starts out is great the hand opening the book then the narrator coming on introducing them name by name at the end saying Here is a song about them. Listen.And you can do just that. Let the movie play like background music and it holds up very well just like that. Quite a movie.".

The touch that allowed Lewis Milestone to make All Quiet on the Western Front one of the finest movies of its genre is also evident here. Things are presented in a straightforward fashion with barely a comment on most of what happens allowing you to have your own honest reactions to events.The story lets you see follow one morning of action in World War II Italy seeing everything as if you were with the platoon that the movie follows. The 'big picture' is missing entirely just as it undoubtedly was for most of the fighting men most of the time. They barely know what will happen next much less what might happen when they reach their objective. Milestone's storytelling skills make this approach work very well maintaining the tension both in the occasional action scenes and in the dialogueheavy sequences.The cast includes many good character actors and the characters are a believable assortment without a lot of stock figures. Dana Andrews does a fine understated job as the sergeant with the most crucial responsibilities and many of the other actors have some good moments as well. Some are likable and some are deliberately annoying none are heroic but all are ready to do their jobs.The operation and some of its tactics are no doubt stylized slightly for cinematic effect but the story works very well. There are of course other World War II movies with more action bigger budgets and more complex stories but the very simplicity of A Walk in the Sun is one of its strengths. For a couple of hours you live and struggle with a group of believable characters and for a while their world is your world. That's a good indication that the movie has succeeded in its objective.".

It had always been one of my favorite movies...the title embedded in my memory. When I had the chance to see it again after so many years I was pleased to discover that it is still a fine film. I'd forgotten most of it except for the classic siege of the farmhouse. I had no idea who the actors were and was pleased to see Sterling Holloway and Lloyd Bridges. If you want bang bang shoot 'em up for 2 hours this is not the film for you but the thoughtless jabber among a bunch of 20 year old guys wondering if they'll survive is a very real picture.".

The movie sticks quite closely to the book with only a few changes.  Some of the dialogue is lifted straight from the pages of the novella.  It is the story of a platoon in WWII trying to capture a farmhouse.  The characters are all strong and what they talk about while in the middle of a war is what grips you.  I highly recommend both the book and the film.".

He thought that the uneasiness displayed by the grunts in this movie was palpable. It was his favorite movie about war as well as mine. Like a lot of good movies it works on a lot of different levels. I believe it to be a nonpareil. I was born the year this movie was made but I didn't see it until sometime in the late 50's on TV. My dad was already a pilot before WW II but since he wore glasses he couldn't be a pilot. He spent the war on the seat of his pants in Dayton Ohio at Wright Patterson. He died in his plane in a crash coming out of Benton Harbor Michigan in 1949. I was 4 at the time of his death. From what my mother told me about him he didn't want to be a romantic flyboy. He wanted to do his part. I often wonder about who my dad was and watching this movie made me long to know all the guys who were over there. Yes there are a lot of errors in this film but the story it tells rings true.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lewis Milestone himself a combat veteran tells the story of war from the infantryman's point of view. Isolated claustrophobic wisecracking fatalistic. Very little discussion of strategy very little 'big picture' very little 'why we fight'. From a grunt's pointofview the story is always the same how do we get from point 'A' to point 'B' do our job and what will be the cost? For the individual soldier or Marine this is what it always boils down to one foot in front of the other protect yourself protect the guy next to you do your job. Milestone knew this. It suffuses All Quiet on the Western Front it permeates Pork Chop Hill. Life in a combat zone can be intense and terrifying but it is mostly tedious and boring. Usually you don't know anything nobody tells you anything maybe because they don't know either. You can only see as far as the next hill the next treeline. The sound of distant gunfire the rumble of bombs or artillery what does it mean who is it everybody looks and wonders but no one knows. Seemingly endless physical labor dirt and heat noise and near silence sometimes only the sound of your own boots the sound of your own digging sudden gunfire a plane a tank a sniper dirt in your food dirt in your mouth walk some more sweat. The hours roll by someone is killed maybe a friend surely someone you know no time for grief move on be happy it wasn't you. The individual only needs to know a little slice of the whole the small unit only needs to know their little corner of the whole a task sometimes a near impossible task time grinds down on the planning other units are on the move other men will depend on you completing this task how to do it? How to survive but still how to do it. Here Milestone has populated a simple story with a predictable mix of archetypes almost daring himself to tell a familiar story in a new and fresh way with shopworn components. He has avoided caricature by allowing the characters to develop slowly to reveal themselves as unique individuals with histories with grievances with hopes always avoiding the danger of slipping into the maudlin the sentimental. The dialogue is earthy and believable even though he had to avoid actual profanity but the delivery is rapid and wise. It feels right. The cast is wellsuited to the story a collection of young rising talent destined for long careers with only Dana Andrews an established 'name'. Some have said it is slow and boring well this ain't Stallone or Schwarzenegger. This ain't an 'action' movie. This is the infantry and in the infantry you walk it is a slow and tedious way to get anywhere but your feet and a dry pair of socks are all you have and there is always a little black cloud sitting on your shoulder.".

I thought the film had some of the overtones of Saving Private Ryan in that it focuses on the men in the fighting unit and eschews the mock heroics that typically characterise the JohnWayneHollywood approach to the war film. The film often comes across as a stage play transferred to film with insightful and thoughtful dialogue and also a number of good monologues. It isn't a slambang action film and because it isn't it appears to capture the nature of infantry warfare warfare generally perhaps as long stretches of boredom punctuated by short intervals of sheer terror. Most impressive is the fact that the film is an ensemble piece as I imagine warfare is although with leaders and followers both. All of the actors come across as interesting and complex characters individuals all. Some of the dialogue is quite funny. Dana Andrews Richard Conte and John Ireland stand out but they in no way hog the film and it was particularly satisfying to see Huntz Hall in a straight role for a change. There are only three drawbacks that I saw in the film. One occurs when the soldiers are crouching behind a wall and an enemy bullet richochets off the stone with the silly twang sound that characterises western movies  lead bullets don't make that kind of noise. Another occurs early in the film when the unit is strafed by a German fighter plane  the plane though looks very much like a P51 Mustang an American aircraft. The final drawback is in the rousing band music at the film's end to my sensibilities that music was utterly out of place and clashed badly with the overall sober and serious tone of the piece.".

He is always one step ahead and the efficient but naive Jenny does not find a way out afraid of losing her bar. Hard to believe that the justice system and her law firm could not find a way out of the situations created by her client. Don Johnson has great performance and the music score is also good. My vote is six.Title Brazil Culpado Como o Pecado Guilty as Sin";

	schema:headline " Ludicrous psychological thriller with a good score and a few good moments";
	schema:reviewBody "There's a big laugh in the middle of this contrived psychological thriller. I won't give it away because it's easily the best moment in the film. It's the scene in a bar with Don Johnson and it sketches in his character more brilliantly than anything before or after. You'll know it when you see it.Well if you see it. If the script had displayed that kind of wit throughout this movie would be a mustsee. As it is there is too little that makes it memorable and too much that makes it hard to suspend disbelief.Rebecca De Mornay plays a flashy criminal defense attorney who does her job with spectacular cunning  even for the most unsavory defendants. But her newest client Don Johnson is not just unsavory. He could be dangerous enough to kill her.The first thing you'll notice is Howard Shore's excellent score during the title sequence. It's silky and sinister and immediately draws you in despite the tackylooking computer graphic that accompanies it. Next the film looks really good. Sidney Lumet  who also gave us Twelve Angry Men The Verdict and many other terrific movies  knows how to direct a good courtroom thriller. And what a courtroom. The photographer Andrzej Bartkowiak makes the most of this spacious greenmarble set.An early scene is promising. Don Johnson glides into De Mornay's office and asks her to take his case brazenly confessing that he's a womanizer and a gigolo  yet innocent of throwing his wife out of a skyscraper window. She refuses at first but Johnson's boyish egotism is too hypnotically fascinating.But later both actors falter. De Mornay makes several bad choices in her performance playing too many scenes like a frightened rabbit. Johnson has a scene in his apartment where he makes a sandwich with a long kitchen knife that he winds up waving in De Mornay's face. His character loses control but so does the actor. Johnson looks and sounds ridiculous.But the main problem is the script from schlockhorror director Larry Cohen. First there's Jack Warden's character a father figure to De Mornay who comes off as purely functional. He's there to do things De Mornay's character cannot and we don't give a damn about him not even when he winds up in danger.Second De Mornay ends up framing her own client an enormously risky endeavor that could easily destroy her career and even send her to prison. Why? Presumably to protect herself and other women from Johnson. But the movie fails to convince us she has no saner options.Third there's the woman who becomes a lastminute witness for the defense. I won't give away too much but her motivation for doing what she does is totally inscrutable.Lastly there's the gruesome climax. It plays ludicrously though De Mornay is allowed one last good moment. Her hysteria at the peak of her ordeal is touchingly real. Otherwise the whole thing feels forced and phony.So does the movie.".

It was a clever tense thriller that wasn't a million miles away from Fatal Attraction with the roles reversed.The two leading roles were brilliant Don Jonson genuinely scary. In short it was certainly a tense thriller that I'd recommend people to see if only once.It isn't the best film ever it came from the writer of Maniac Cop 2  3 but it was neatly handled it WAS directed by Sidney Lumet!.Check it out.";

He for me didn't come off as a suave lady killer he came across as a man that you would like to take out to an alleyway and beat the socks off of em'. It was quite a spectacle the way that David dressed in black and a stocking cap and met the lawyer in the parking garage and beat him and his car phone to bits! That was a solid action  drama piece in the story that seguewayed nicely into the next place...Don has been in quite a few really 'great' roles in which he was the only one that you could see there. It would be a crime to put in a different actor they never would have filled his shoes. But not here. On the out the ending in this was 'pure' Hollywood in bad scripted form.

It was over 10 years ago that I saw it but it still hurts and won't stop lingering in my brain. The last line in the movie really sums up how stupid it is. I won't ruin it for you should you want to tempt fate by viewing this movie. But I garantee you a nghya moment at the end with a few in between. If you have nothing better to do and you like to point and laugh then maybe it might be worth your while.

In this story however it's the interaction between a defence lawyer and her client that provides the most interesting moments as both parties are very successful at what they do as well as being extremely ruthless. They both share a powerful determination to be winners and it's this compulsion that leads them both at different times to take actions which they know to be ill judged and reckless.Jennifer Haines Rebecca DeMornay a young criminal lawyer who's made quick progress to the top of her profession is on a high after winning her latest court case when she's approached by David Greenhill Don Johnson. Greenhill's a suave ladies' man who's been accused of murdering his rich wife by throwing her out of the window of their apartment and he wants Haines to represent him. At first she doesn't want to take the case but gradually she starts to find him interesting and convinces her superiors that she'd enjoy the challenge of defending Greenhill in what is guaranteed to be a high profile trial.Soon after agreeing to defend her new client his behaviour becomes more threatening he starts to get involved in her personal life and also Haines' private investigator Moe Jack Warden begins to uncover some information about Greenhill's past which makes her believe that he is guilty of his wife's murder. Her attempts to drop her client are blocked by a judge and her professional obligations to respect attorneyclient confidentiality prevent her from being able to use what she knows against him. With no legal or orthodox way out of her predicament Haines plants some incriminating evidence in Greenhill's apartment. He immediately guesses that she's responsible and responds by taking some equally unscrupulous action to provide some compelling proof of his innocence.After the trial Haines and Greenhill continue to play their dangerous mind games right up until the movie's violent denouement.At the outset both Haines and Greenhill are very confident people but during their association the psychological battles in which they indulge lead to Haines becoming more and more intimidated especially when she starts to believe that her own life might be in danger.Rebecca DeMornay portrays Jennifer Haines' courtroom swagger and her addiction to the thrill of winning with the same ability she brings to conveying her growing uncertainty and fear as she realises that she's bitten off more than she can chew and is powerless to put things right.Don Johnson clearly revels in his role as the smarmy gigolo who's arrogant and very dangerous. His transparently insincere charm and his psychopathic behaviour make him a despicable villain who is nevertheless amusing to watch. Jack Warden also provides good support as Haines' trusted old friend and adviser.Guilty As Sin isn't highly original or the type of movie that garners great accolades from the critics however for pure entertainment it fits the bill nicely.".

She's hired by the narcissistic Don Johnson to defend him when he's accused of tossing his wealthy wife out a fourteenstory window.The odd thing  almost the ONLY unpredictable feature of the movie  is that she is wary of him from the beginning. She accepts the retainer gets him out on bail and defends him in court with the assistance of the usual flawed investigator. Sometimes the assistant is a drunk  Robert Loggia or Morgan Freeman  and sometimes just well meaning but old and a little out of it. Here it's Jack Warden who played a similar role in Verdict a much better film.This is one hoary suspense device after another. A hand may reach in from off screen at a particularly spooky moment and shock the heroine. It soon becomes clear that Don Johnson is a homicidal maniac and we get scene after scene of people alone at night in deserted urban spaces like empty offices dark hotel corridors and those horrible multilevel parking lots with lots of shadows and distant blue neon.I don't know how Sidney Lumet  a fine director  could wrap his mind around a story like this. I don't know how he could have coped with it except by dozing off in his director's chair. The plot seems to have been ground out by a computer. Any questions about it could have been answered by a Magic Eight Ball.The art director certainly knew what he wanted. The settings are all sterile and the walls festooned with tasteful paintings. There's never any doubt that we're in greenback territory although most of the supporting players speak with Canadian accents. There is nothing shabby about the settings nor should there be.Jack Warden is his reliable self. And Rebecca De Mornay thoroughly glamorized has rarely looked so attractive. I thought she was more appealing as the raggedy freckled rosycheeked stowaway in Runaway Train but that's my perversion. She turns in a decent textured performance too. The same can't be said for Don Johnson. Part of it must be the role as written slimy and repulsive. But part is also Don Johnson who has never convinced me that he's a good actor though he's often cast as some masculine type who carries a cloud of pheromones around with him wherever he goes.This is strictly routine suspense but if that's what you're looking for the film delivers it.".

His name is David Edgar Greenhill and he wants Haines to defend her. She doesn't want to but the court assigns her to the case over her objection. There's something about this guy that's creepy and makes her uneasy.She's right to be uneasy. Greenhill knows all about her life and her boyfriend and basically uses her as a pawn in his own schemes all the while intimating that they're lovers and disrupting her relationship.I'm going out on a limb here and guessing that this movie did not have a big budget and that was part of the problem. It was filmed in Canada and back in 1993 anyway that meant lowbudget. Also while I like Rebecca DeMornay and Don Johnson okay they're not exactly Michelle Pfeiffer and Mel Gibson to name two stars of that era. I think better acting would have helped the movie. Don Johnson was just too much of everything  overly oily overly smooth speaking overly gentlemanly overly charming overly dressed. Supposedly his character is a gigolo. Maybe some women are desperate enough to fall for this guy but anyone who can't see through his act is pathetic.This movie needed a star an attractive man who comes off as very likable naturally without it being put on even someone going against type like John Travolta or Tom Hanks this is the '90s remember and then it might have been more compelling. It isn't an easy role  he has to have a threatening subtext a look in his eyes something with everything about him belying it until the claws really come out.De Mornay on the other hand definitely conveyed her character's tension anxiety and attempt to stay calm as well as a lot of allure.Jack Warden gives good support as an investigator who helps De Mornay.This is a decent story with a few things that stretch reality but like someone said on the board Johnson is so evil you have to watch the whole thing to see if he gets his comeuppance. A worthy attempt if just not quite right.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a Man is the first movie that famous German actor Matthias Schweighfer wrote and directed himself. Of course he also plays the central character a man stuck between two women and constantly trying to master the fine line between masculinity and his not very masculine authentic self. He gets commanded around by everybody somehow and is just not an alpha male. This is also the reason why his girlfriend leaves him and starts seeing the stallion guy who lives in the same house. Schweighfer's character she refers to as a chaotic clumsy pony instead. The film's title song is from German Eurovision Song Contest winner Lena MayerLandrut giving us her version of the famous What a Man.The exgirlfriend is played by Mavie Hrbiger the best friend who turns into a love interest is played by Sibel Kekilli who you may have seen on Game of Thrones these days. Elyas M'Barek is also in the film but is fairly forgettable and plays the same character he always does. Milan Peschel probably the most talented cast member alongside Kekilli is also in this movie but that is pretty much a given as he and Schweighfer have been in so many films together. Initially it seemed Kekilli's character will maybe not be a love interest when she has that hunky French guy at her place but when we find out they split and he has another it is really obvious. And of course Hrbiger's character also wants Schweighfer's back as great masculinity is apparently not the best feature for a relationship.I really like Kekilli but even i have to say the dramatic scenes between her and Schweighfer just did not really wow me. She has done better in Die Fremde a truly brilliant performance. The comedy in What a Man occasionally succeeds but not all the time. This film has definitely some weaknesses. First of all Schweighfer never really impressed me that much as an actor and the whole love confession scene with the pandas small cameo Nora Tschirner later Frederike Kempter and Katharina Schttler with cameos too was pretty cringeworthy I have to say. The script certainly gets worse as the film keeps going. The childhood flashback added nothing for me where people wondered if he was a girl or boy just like the story with the kid who reminded him of his childhood. The final approach to overcoming one's fear of flying in order to prove he is a real man felt fairly insignificant to me. It all seemed so important suddenly and there was only one small reference right at the beginning of the film to that so I would have preferred a different ending.However if you are in for a light comedy to watch with your girlfriendboyfriend this can actually be a decent choice. There's several parts where you will laugh for sure. So also taking into account that Schweighfer has not worked as a writerdirector before that I'd say Recommended.".

	onyx:emotionText "What a Man is the first movie that famous German actor Matthias Schweighfer wrote and directed himself. Of course he also plays the central character a man stuck between two women and constantly trying to master the fine line between masculinity and his not very masculine authentic self. He gets commanded around by everybody somehow and is just not an alpha male. This is also the reason why his girlfriend leaves him and starts seeing the stallion guy who lives in the same house. Schweighfer's character she refers to as a chaotic clumsy pony instead. The film's title song is from German Eurovision Song Contest winner Lena MayerLandrut giving us her version of the famous What a Man.The exgirlfriend is played by Mavie Hrbiger the best friend who turns into a love interest is played by Sibel Kekilli who you may have seen on Game of Thrones these days. Elyas M'Barek is also in the film but is fairly forgettable and plays the same character he always does. Milan Peschel probably the most talented cast member alongside Kekilli is also in this movie but that is pretty much a given as he and Schweighfer have been in so many films together. Initially it seemed Kekilli's character will maybe not be a love interest when she has that hunky French guy at her place but when we find out they split and he has another it is really obvious. And of course Hrbiger's character also wants Schweighfer's back as great masculinity is apparently not the best feature for a relationship.I really like Kekilli but even i have to say the dramatic scenes between her and Schweighfer just did not really wow me. She has done better in Die Fremde a truly brilliant performance. The comedy in What a Man occasionally succeeds but not all the time. This film has definitely some weaknesses. First of all Schweighfer never really impressed me that much as an actor and the whole love confession scene with the pandas small cameo Nora Tschirner later Frederike Kempter and Katharina Schttler with cameos too was pretty cringeworthy I have to say.

It's a very dangerous mission and this film succeeds in portraying the tension and perplexity of the agent codename Lobo  wolf in English and the doubts that the new times to come arouse inside the ETA and in Spain.This is a fastpaced thriller that unlike its American counterparts doesn't tell us who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.

Instead of giving us a readymade solution the film poses questions that linger in our mind. For instance with the coming of democracy wouldn't it be better to give up armed struggle and become an organized party? This generates conflicts inside ETAs leading circles and the agent Lobo is inside this turmoil.Today with the crescent European integration these questions are still valid. Is it necessary to fight for old ideals that have lost its reason of being or wouldn't it be better to adapt to the new times where integration is the password? In a few sketches the agent Lobo the ETA militants the government officials the mood in Spain are drawn in a realistic way and give us a feeling of real persons and events.Rent this film.

At the opening  1975  it describes a man being pursued and hidden from police as well as special forces as GEOS and then it takes place a long flashback . As in the early seventies  during the last stages of Franco's dictatorship  Txema Eduardo Noriega is detained because of his relationship to some terrorists who have just killed a taxi man . The killers are members of the terrorist organization ETA that brutally killed about one thousand people and acting similarly to Sicilian Mafia . The Secret Service  CNI  and their law enforcements Jose Coronado  Santiago Ramos  Jose Luis Garcia Perez  Juan Fernandez attempt to offer him a covenant . At the beginning he's not too interested  but his economical troubles ultimately force him to take amount of money and accept the assignment  as he becomes an infiltrator and adopts the undercover name of Lobo Wolf  but it is rejected by his wife Silvia Abascal . By the way  he becomes an active member of the bunch  making all the right connections until he reaches the top command and acquires the trust of its chiefs Patrick Bruel  Jorge Sanz . In the process  he finds out that the terrorist organization has real internal divisions between those who want to leave the armed fight and become just a political party being led by Asier Jorge Sanz  and those who wish to keep the terrorist activity until they can declare the independence of the Basque country led by Txino Fernando Cayo and Arrieta Chema Muoz . These divisions and fights for power are often resolved bloodily  taking place the Asier murder . Later on  the military and high authority staff Hctor Colome  Manuel Zarzo heads in Madrid become impatient and want to launch an immediate attack on ETA . Ricardo Jose Coronado  the superior officer of the secret service convinces them to wait until Lobo can complete his assignment and enable them to dismantle the terrorist organization . But when the Barcelona police arranges to catch the leaders of the group Arrieta Chema Muoz and Txino Fernando Cayo the military generals  jealous of this success decide they can't wait any more and that they will override the secret service and catch whatever ETA members are in Madrid at that point  dead or alive . And that  includes Lobo who is now abandoned to his own devices to getaway from both sides . El Lobo was used and betrayed by Francoist secret services  and proclaimed a priority target by ETA . However  he knew how to save himself using his own resources and at the end of the operation  Lobo was forced to change his identity .Moving dramathriller with plenty of emotion  suspense  intrigue  delusions  plot twists  politics and real events about Basque Country . Despite being somewhat of a cinematic clich  rarely has a feature been so aptly deserving of its description as a political thriller along with some elements from action genre  social critique  intense drama and bloody terrorism . Based on a true story  according to an interview to screenwriter and producer Melchor Miralles  he said that the real Lobo visited the set one day but nobody knew who really was . He was actually an ETA infiltrator who  in the early 1960s  brought down a quarter of this terrorist organisation including its upper echelons  even today  ETA members departing to execute attacks in Spain receive a spare bullet with Lobos name on it . In the picture is described various historical events as when the terrorists proceed their most daring and shocking crime yet  killing the prime minister Carrero Blanco 1973 or the called French sanctuary where freely planned their operations . It is an entertaining picture in which suspense is well developed from start to finish  though crammed with some erotic scenes between Eduardo Noriega and Melanie Doutey . Nice acting by Eduardo Noriega as a Basque construction worker  whom the secret service sees in him an ideal candidate to infiltrate the terrorist band ETA . Eduardo Noriega had to work hard for several months before the shooting started in order to speak with the strong Basque Country accent required for his character . According to an interview to Mlanie Doutey  she was help by a dialect coach during a month before the shooting  because she could not speak Spanish at the time. The picture is acceptable  but it has conventional pitfalls and results to be overlong  though also contains interesting scenes  suspenseful images and sensitive moments . Anyway  its is compensated with the great performances from main cast  and notorious support cast such as Manuel Zarzo  Juan Fernndez  Roger Pera  Fernando Cayo  Chema Muoz  Jos Luis Garca Prez  Alex O'Dogherty  Saturnino Garcia and Jorge Sanz . Atmospheric musical score by Nstor Calvo who composes a stirring soundtrack . Colorful as well as evocative cinematography by Francesc Gener . The motion picture was professionally directed by Michael Courtois and achieved hit smash at box office  however  a similar film he subsequently realized titled Gal failed and was dismissed both  critics and indifferent reaction for the public . Other pictures dealing with this terrorist organization are the followings  La Fuga De Segovia Dias Contados by Imanol Uribe  La Voz De Su Amo by Emilio Martnez Lazaro  Todos Estamos Invitados by Manuel Gutirrez Aragon and several documentaries directed by Iaki Arteta as Testigo Involuntario  Nicolas Redondo El Infierno Vasco  Trece Entre Mil  and Sin Libertad .".

Mix these above themes and add lots of action sex and you get very well made action thriller pretty far from say The Bourne Identity 2002.".

Mix these above themes and add lots of action sex and you get very well made action thriller pretty far from say The Bourne Identity 2002.";

I did not say feminist'. Using  numerous flashbacks  I counted about a dozen or so  between the present day and what would seem to be the early or midfifties the spectator must remain very alert especially in the first half of the film if he is to piece together the events with any kind of coherence. Three sisters living cosily in Madrid and who rarely see each other are forced to make a journey together to their native Galicia in order to carry out their mother's last wish her ashes are to be scattered around three family homes. Certain characteriological frictions between the three ladies start becoming evident bursting into outright clashes now and again as certain deeds of the past come to light. The roleplaying is pretty good and improves when confrontations occur with their mother Adela in the flashbacks and Ta Rafaela Marta Belaustegui and Julieta Serrano respectively the latter undergoing tremendous makeup so as to play in both time slots. The men form a dark background essential to the story but they are for the most part very much in secondary roles.Alfredo Mayo's photography is good  it could hardly be otherwise in a beautiful Galicia in late summer. Most of the film was shot in all kinds of rural locations scattered around the region. I was able to identify Las Mdulas' which in fact are just outside Galicia barely 3kms! which in Roman times was an important goldmining area. Those strange arenisc rock formations formed by natural wind and water erosion offer a very peculiar spectacle for the visitor there is a little museum there as the village has been turned into a tourist attraction in recent years. I also recognised the landing ferry at Douade on the River Sil. Affording beautiful scenery the gorge runs through abrupt chasms with vineyards growing up those steep slopes some of which date back to Roman times or even earlier. There is a twicedaily boattrip down the canyon which is well worth the time. In both cases in the summer visits should be made in the morning it gets very hot in both places in the afternoon! An ivy and mosscovered bridge I think is the one over the River Mio near Portomarn. Certain coastal shots were made up in the Ras Altas in one case I think it was near Camarias but in another case possibly near the famous beach known as As Catedrais' in the province of Lugo. Wherever wherever write down Galicia for your next holidays! You will not be disappointed.My one complaint about this film is that I did not hear even one genuine Galician accent from anybody! Which frankly left me feeling rather flat. I mean the Querejetas could have shot it in Aragn or Asturias or Murcia or anywhere else and it would not have made any difference to the film  apart from the scenery which anyway is just as good in these places. For this failure I must take off a whole point from my vote which is slightly on the high side of six out of ten.The Spanish spoken is mostly fairly easy to follow with only a few brief exceptions.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even though Love 'em and Leave 'em had been a Louise Brooks vehicle in 1926 that didn't stop Paramount from lifting the plot and refashioning it into The Saturday Night Kid for Clara Bow in 1929. As Clara often said she was given any old story that was fished out of a rubbish bin!!! To add personal insult to injury Edward Sutherland was assigned to direct it. Louise Brooks who was married to Sutherland wrote that Sutherland always excluded Bow from parties and gatherings  he didn't think Bow was of their class  even though Brooks begged him to invite Clara.Mayme Clara Bow and Janie Jean Arthur are sisters  they both work at Ginsbergs' Department Store  but while Mayme is in love with dependable Bill James Hall Janie is on the look out for money. Poor kid she doesn't know what it's all about worries Mayme then when they see her driving past in a flashy car Bill quips I'd hate to see her when she wises up!! From the first scene Janie shows she is not to be trusted  borrowing Mayme's step ins and perfume  she is also not above betting heavily on the races. Jean Arthur steals the movie on a red hot platter. Her's is the only role with any get up and go and her husky voice is very pleasing. Janie does her best to drive a wedge between the cute couple and at a rooftop party Mayme gets fed up  I'm just a Saturday Night Kid the love 'em and leave 'em kind  I thought now for some Clara Bow action but it was not to be. She was the good girl the nice sister and as such had to hang around while her bad sister got all the attention. Janie gets deeper and deeper into debt and gambles with the store's welfare fund she is the treasurer. She confesses what she has done to Mayme who wins back the money in a crap game. Janie though has already told Mrs. Streeter the glorious Edna May Oliver that Mayme is the thief and when Mayme turns up with the money she Mayme is sacked.

	onyx:emotionText "Even though Love 'em and Leave 'em had been a Louise Brooks vehicle in 1926 that didn't stop Paramount from lifting the plot and refashioning it into The Saturday Night Kid for Clara Bow in 1929. As Clara often said she was given any old story that was fished out of a rubbish bin!!! To add personal insult to injury Edward Sutherland was assigned to direct it. Louise Brooks who was married to Sutherland wrote that Sutherland always excluded Bow from parties and gatherings  he didn't think Bow was of their class  even though Brooks begged him to invite Clara.Mayme Clara Bow and Janie Jean Arthur are sisters  they both work at Ginsbergs' Department Store  but while Mayme is in love with dependable Bill James Hall Janie is on the look out for money. Poor kid she doesn't know what it's all about worries Mayme then when they see her driving past in a flashy car Bill quips I'd hate to see her when she wises up!! From the first scene Janie shows she is not to be trusted  borrowing Mayme's step ins and perfume  she is also not above betting heavily on the races. Jean Arthur steals the movie on a red hot platter. Her's is the only role with any get up and go and her husky voice is very pleasing. Janie does her best to drive a wedge between the cute couple and at a rooftop party Mayme gets fed up  I'm just a Saturday Night Kid the love 'em and leave 'em kind  I thought now for some Clara Bow action but it was not to be. She was the good girl the nice sister and as such had to hang around while her bad sister got all the attention. Janie gets deeper and deeper into debt and gambles with the store's welfare fund she is the treasurer. She confesses what she has done to Mayme who wins back the money in a crap game. Janie though has already told Mrs. Streeter the glorious Edna May Oliver that Mayme is the thief and when Mayme turns up with the money she Mayme is sacked. All ends well for Mayme and Bill  he overhears the girls talking and realises Janie is the sneak  not that he ever doubted Mayme's honesty.True to Clara's generous spirit  there was one actress a bit player whose confidence was really boosted  that was Jean Harlow.

	schema:reviewBody "After audiences of the 1920s had become accustomed to seeing Clara Bow portraying the carefree flapper or an aggressive woman out to get her man this movie strays from those formulas.  Confined by the limitations of the role of Mayme and the constraints of early sound films Clara is much more inhibited and restrained in this film.  That high energy personality and wonderful facial expressions that I love about her were absent in this movie. As another reviewer stated Clara would have been much more suited to play the role of Janieparticularly the scene where Janie steals Mayme's boyfriend that went to a young Jean Arthur.  Even when she was several pounds overweight for a leading ladysex symbol Clara still manages too look great and she does well in the somewhat thankless role. Mayme is a good girl that has developed a cynical and hard boiled attitude from past romances gone bad. It was also interesting to see Jean Arthur play a selfish impulsive immature Janiewho doesn't hesitate to stab her sister in the back if her neck is on the line after seeing her in more virtuous roles in the 30s and she turns in a good performance despite just an average script and dialogue.  The Saturday Night Kid also provides an interesting glimpse into the late 20s lifestyle from riding a street car to working in a department store.  Yes 75 years ago they were doing company pep rallies that employees had to attend and show their enthusiasm whether they were enthused to be there or not.  There are very few films that were made in 1929 with outstanding productions values and are enjoyable to watch. While this film has it's problems I think it is better than most of the early sound films that I've seen including THE WILD PARTY with Clara. 610".

In 1927 Bow reached superstardom as the It girl in It and playing in first Academy Award Winning movie Wings. So now two years later you have superstar Bow age 24 and star Arthur age 29 playing sisters.Oddly Arthur seems to be playing the younger sister. In the opening scene Bow brazenly pulls up Arthur's dress and reveals Arthur's underwear for the camera. She accuses her sister of stealing her stepins. It establishes Clara as the dominant personality.Later there's a wonderful scene where both are in their underwear about to go to bed. Arthur has just stolen Bow's boyfriend. Bow prays while Arthur hops into bed. She moans innocently I can't help it if he like me more than you. Bow snaps back Shut up I'm saying my prayers. Bow is strong and gives a great performance but its Arthur with a thin almost squeaky voice who steals every scene.The movie moves briskly with nice scenes in a department store on the street and on an apartment porch beneath what could be the Brooklyn Bridge.Nice comic support is given by Edna Mae Oliver who plays a store manager putting on a pageant for Goldberg's the store where the sisters work. In the play that she puts on she casts Arthur as virtue and Bow as pleasure to show the triumph of virtue over pleasure. This is ironic as in the movie they are playing the opposite roles.Charles Sellon the unforgettable Mr. Muckle in W.C. Fields Its a Gift also gives a great performance. He's gamblerneighbor who cons Arthur to give him money by reassuring her With me its not a gamble but an investment. Bow would go on to make eight more films over the next four years and then quit movies forever in 1933 at the age of 28. On the other hand Jean Arthur continued starring for twenty more years in classics like Mr. Deeds Goes to Town and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.Some people will be disappointed because the film is pretty light weight. It is barely over an hour and basically climaxes just when it is getting most interesting. Still watching Bow at the top of her game and Arthur rising to match her is delightful.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE SATURDAY NIGHT KID Paramount 1929 directed by A. Edward Sutherland might have been an appropriate title for a jazzage movie about a funloving party girl meeting and dancing with an assortment of young men every Saturday night. For this feature the title is used for only a remake of a recent silent feature about shop girl sisters in LOVE 'EM AND LEAVE 'EM Paramount 1926 starring Evelyn Brent Lawrence Gray and Louise Brooks directed by Frank Tuttle. Rather than having those three leading players reprise their roles in the latest sound edition based on the popular play by George Abbott it was given to Clara Bow James Hall and Jean Arthur instead. Having recently played a department store girl already in IT Paramount 1927 the movie that gave Bow her signature name as The IT Girl it might have been more interesting to see how the movie might have turned out had Clara Bow starred in the sound remake of IT instead.The basic plot deals with the Barry sisters Mayme Clara Bow and Janie Jean Arthur a couple of New York City shop girls working for Ginsberg Department Store residing in an apartment building overlooking the Brooklyn Bridge. Living next door to them is William Taylor James Hall a young clerk promoted to floorwalker at the same store who happens to be loved by Mayme. After rising at 630 a.m. to prepare themselves for another day's work the trio leave together with Mayne and Bill traveling by bus while Janie hitches a faster ride in somebody else's automobile. As the employees gather together at a staff meeting headed by Mr. Ginsburg Hyman Meyer Miss Streeter Edna May Oliver the store's oldest employee arranges for the staging of an Employee's Welfare Club pageant. Janie elected treasurer uses the club money to give to landlord Lem Woodruff Charles Sellon a bookie who cheats her of her winnings at offtrack horse racing. Aside from having Mayme take the blame for the stolen money and talking her way out of staying late for inventory where Mayme fills in for her Janie also takes further advantage of her sister by claiming Bill all to herself causing friction for all concerned. Also in the cast are Ethel Wales Lily Woodruff Irving Bacon Mr. McGonigle and Mary Gordon. The blonde shop girl Hazel Carroll is played by the uncredited Jean Harlow 19111937. She can be spotted in a couple of brief scenes behind the counter and later through seen with her head towards the camera along with few lines of spoken dialogue.Standard routine plot clocked at 62 minutes THE SATURDAY NIGHT KID indicates the story might have been slightly longer had it not been for the noticeable jumpcut by the midway point. Some years before Jean Arthur would prove her range in comedies for Columbia Pictures and work in three classic productions under the direction of Frank Capra her conniving character gathers the most attention here even though she might seem out of character by those familiar with her latter screen work. Arthur would return to shop girl department store roles to better advantage in EASY LIVING Paramount 1937 and THE DEVIL AND MISS JONES RKO Radio 1941 the latter highly recommended viewing. James Hall the male costar appearing much older than his true age gets by with his maninthemiddletype performance. He would later appear opposite Jean Harlow in HELL'S ANGELS United Artists 1930 the epic wardrama that elevated Harlow from bit player to leading role status. Better known by film historians more for her silent productions than those produced during the sound era THE SATURDAY NIGHT KID indicates how Bow might have succeeded better and longer in talkies had there been better scripts or more challenging roles in both comedy and drama to fit her needs. Quite good in comedy Bow has her limited range here amusingly playing a gym appliance demonstrator at the store. Bow demonstrated her ability as a fine actress in both CALL HER SAVAGE 1932 and HOOPLA 1933 for Fox Studios before retiring from the screen forever. Yet her character as played in THE SATURDAY NIGHT KID is very much Bow material carried on from some from the silent movie era.

	onyx:emotionText "THE SATURDAY NIGHT KID Paramount 1929 directed by A. Edward Sutherland might have been an appropriate title for a jazzage movie about a funloving party girl meeting and dancing with an assortment of young men every Saturday night. For this feature the title is used for only a remake of a recent silent feature about shop girl sisters in LOVE 'EM AND LEAVE 'EM Paramount 1926 starring Evelyn Brent Lawrence Gray and Louise Brooks directed by Frank Tuttle. Rather than having those three leading players reprise their roles in the latest sound edition based on the popular play by George Abbott it was given to Clara Bow James Hall and Jean Arthur instead. Having recently played a department store girl already in IT Paramount 1927 the movie that gave Bow her signature name as The IT Girl it might have been more interesting to see how the movie might have turned out had Clara Bow starred in the sound remake of IT instead.The basic plot deals with the Barry sisters Mayme Clara Bow and Janie Jean Arthur a couple of New York City shop girls working for Ginsberg Department Store residing in an apartment building overlooking the Brooklyn Bridge. Living next door to them is William Taylor James Hall a young clerk promoted to floorwalker at the same store who happens to be loved by Mayme. After rising at 630 a.m. to prepare themselves for another day's work the trio leave together with Mayne and Bill traveling by bus while Janie hitches a faster ride in somebody else's automobile. As the employees gather together at a staff meeting headed by Mr. Ginsburg Hyman Meyer Miss Streeter Edna May Oliver the store's oldest employee arranges for the staging of an Employee's Welfare Club pageant. Janie elected treasurer uses the club money to give to landlord Lem Woodruff Charles Sellon a bookie who cheats her of her winnings at offtrack horse racing. Aside from having Mayme take the blame for the stolen money and talking her way out of staying late for inventory where Mayme fills in for her Janie also takes further advantage of her sister by claiming Bill all to herself causing friction for all concerned. Also in the cast are Ethel Wales Lily Woodruff Irving Bacon Mr. McGonigle and Mary Gordon. The blonde shop girl Hazel Carroll is played by the uncredited Jean Harlow 19111937. She can be spotted in a couple of brief scenes behind the counter and later through seen with her head towards the camera along with few lines of spoken dialogue.Standard routine plot clocked at 62 minutes THE SATURDAY NIGHT KID indicates the story might have been slightly longer had it not been for the noticeable jumpcut by the midway point. Some years before Jean Arthur would prove her range in comedies for Columbia Pictures and work in three classic productions under the direction of Frank Capra her conniving character gathers the most attention here even though she might seem out of character by those familiar with her latter screen work. Arthur would return to shop girl department store roles to better advantage in EASY LIVING Paramount 1937 and THE DEVIL AND MISS JONES RKO Radio 1941 the latter highly recommended viewing. James Hall the male costar appearing much older than his true age gets by with his maninthemiddletype performance. He would later appear opposite Jean Harlow in HELL'S ANGELS United Artists 1930 the epic wardrama that elevated Harlow from bit player to leading role status. Better known by film historians more for her silent productions than those produced during the sound era THE SATURDAY NIGHT KID indicates how Bow might have succeeded better and longer in talkies had there been better scripts or more challenging roles in both comedy and drama to fit her needs. Quite good in comedy Bow has her limited range here amusingly playing a gym appliance demonstrator at the store. Bow demonstrated her ability as a fine actress in both CALL HER SAVAGE 1932 and HOOPLA 1933 for Fox Studios before retiring from the screen forever. Yet her character as played in THE SATURDAY NIGHT KID is very much Bow material carried on from some from the silent movie era. Never distributed to video cassette DVD nor presented on cable television the film overall is a worthy rediscovery especially those interested in the early films and career of both Jeans Arthur or Harlow or the It Girl Clara Bow with a new title name as The Saturday Night Kid.

However if you watch 1929's The Saturday Night Kid you'll see nothing that would indicate she would ever be a star. In fact she's just awful! While IMDB says that the director hated Clara Bow's voice it's practically gorgeous compared to Arthur's very highpitched whining...and she whines through most of the picture. I can only assume that the director was somehow also at fault as Ms. Arthur became an accomplished and likable actress....but here you just want to see someone slap her character and yell Shut up!.The film is about a couple of sisters. The older sister Mayme Clara Bow is the responsible one who takes care of her younger sister Janie Jean Arthur. However Janie is an adult and Mayme too often makes excuses for her. In fact she helps enable Janie...and as a result Janie is a sneaky godawful creature...one who whines incessantly and who is so transparent...too transparent that you wonder how ANYONE would put up with her.This is the problem with the film....Janie is such a whiner and is so obvious that it really destroys the movie. Clara Bow despite some complaints about her acting was actually just fine....but Arthur puts on one of the worst performances of her day. Thank goodness she learned to be more subtle less whiny and truly endearing in future films.".

But the movie was a big letdown especially after reading the book.Although much touted for it's visual image I was disappointed by the lack of little details. Many parts just didn't give one the feeling of being there. Forinstance the train ride eastward if it has been done like in Dr. Zhivago it would have been great.The Russian camp commander was a totally cardboard character. Evil and mean but with no depth. And he is supposed to have followed a single escaped prisoner for 3 years and 8000 miles. Where was his accountability to his superiors for taking off on his own like this. Surely they wouldn't have permitted his being away from his command for months on end in the pursuit of a single escaped prisoner. In reality the searchers spent a couple of days scanning a 50 kilometer radius then gave the escapee up for dead.And when after dogging his prey for 3 years the commander finally catches up with him...and then lets him go? Oh please. I have seen better turns of a plot on womens afternoon shows.And that Siberian woman who fell instantly in love with him and bedded down with him the same day he came to in her Teepee. She happened to be beautiful and wore only the finest quality traditional garb. This was a totally unnecessary addition to the film.I know that a movie can't follow all the detail of a long book about a longer journey. But so much was glazed over.The dramatic end was conversely wonderful. The reunion with his wife was a great scene and done so well. It brought to life what must have been the most powerful emotions. But was cut off short by the ending credits. if they'd have added a couple of minutes to the end it might have gone a long way toward saving something of this movie.Overall As far as my feet will carry me had me longing for my feet to carry me out of the theater. At best it is a medium quality made for TV production.".

Now if this premise were presented as a work of fiction it would seem so preposterous that more than likely it would have been laughed out of theaters. This film should appeal to several diverse groups To those of you who seek out true stories to fans of escape films to those who enjoy Man vs. The WildNature themes to the fans of German andor foreign cinema and to those with an interest in diverse cultures and film shoot locations.One thing that really impressed me Most True Stories in recent years stretch the truth quite a bit for dramatic impact!

First the Russian search would not have extended beyond a few days as they would have believed he died and was eaten by the wolves or covered in new snowfall. Next at that time in history and still today Russia was poor. And for two Russian hunters to come across him asleep and not robkill him is a stretch. Then for those hunters to take him in another stretch. Then for one of those hunters to be caught and taken to exact same Russian post even though by that time they were much closer to other posts is unbelievable. Then to come across natives that have a stunningly beautiful woman who just happens to have lost her husband and she is ready to strip and give herself to this new man entering the camp another stretch. Also a jew helping a German escape and prepares to commit suicide if caught helping the German? Sure that happens a lot. The train scene where they catch Clemens his dog saves him as he runs off and several Russians shoot at him in close range with machine guns and of course he doesn't get hit. That worked well in Rambo II and III. Then the most unbelievable is the Russian camp leader treking all over the Soviet Union trying to find this one German even going as far as Siberian to the Iranian border and of course gets to the EXACT same check point then lets him go? This movie was so poorly done it is hard to classify as a Drama it was more of a Comedy.

The movie has some good actors in it like Michael Mendl Hans Peter Hallwachs and also the main actor Bernhard Betterman does a good job. Its a story of a single german POW Clemens Forell who escapes from prisoners camp in siberia and walks thousands of kilometers to the border of Iran where he would be in safety of the sovjets. It was a true story and in the 50ies a very popular TV series much popular than this movie was made of it. I did not like that movie very much. I think there were just to much thinks mixed together  a lovestory the plot with russian smugglers the scenes with Forells family and much more. It could not really concentrate on one topic the hard conditions of war prisoners in Germany and adventurous scenes were put together  in a bit cheesy hollywoodlike style. That works in Germany with american movies but not with german ones. And so it could not satisfy german watchers For people interested in politics or history of that time it contained not enough information for blockbuster watchers was not enough action in it. Thats why I think this movie is even better for foreign watchers they get a bit about german history but theres some adventure to and it never gets to deep that they cant understand some things. Rating 410".

I think there were just to much thinks mixed together  a lovestory the plot with russian smugglers the scenes with Forells family and much more. It could not really concentrate on one topic the hard conditions of war prisoners in Germany and adventurous scenes were put together  in a bit cheesy hollywoodlike style. That works in Germany with american movies but not with german ones. And so it could not satisfy german watchers For people interested in politics or history of that time it contained not enough information for blockbuster watchers was not enough action in it. Thats why I think this movie is even better for foreign watchers they get a bit about german history but theres some adventure to and it never gets to deep that they cant understand some things.

There could have been more direct evidence of German atrocities preceding the prisoner's transportation but in more subtle ways the makers do suggest that Forell and his compatriots were not as pure as the driven snow. In the scene before the transport where he receives his sentence of hard labour reference is made to antipartisan activities in which he had participated and in which many innocent civilians were usually killed. In the train one soldier starts a fight for claiming they deserve their fate for what they did to the Soviet people. And then there's the dialog with his Jewish helper at the end of the film.I do not find the depiction of how ordinary Soviet citizens help an individual German soldier that incredible. Unlike the average German of the time often indoctrinated with racial hatred it seems ordinary Soviets were quite capable of distinguishing between the individual German soldier and the horrendous system that sent him. But life in general was cheap in Stalinist times and this may go some way in explaining how the prisoners were treated.What added to my enjoyment was that untypical for most German movies most of the Soviet protagonists actually spoke Russian. It's a pity that the makers caved in when characters had more dialog so we inexplicably hear the two Siberian trappers speak heavilyaccented German with Forell. Overall the authentic period feel and beautiful scenery make for an entertaining 2.5 hours of viewing a forgotten piece of history.".

	schema:headline " An epic journey with some epic omissions";
	schema:reviewBody "As Far As My Feet Will Carry Me takes the audience on the epic journey of a Nazi POW who escapes from a brutal GULAG on the far eastern shores of Siberia. It is essentially a remake of a popular television series that was made back in the 1950's and deals with a subject that has been for the most part ignored perhaps for a good reason. It is a good thought provoking watch but falls disappointingly short of the cinematic masterpiece it could have been.Beginning in the summer of 1944 Clemens Forell bids farewell to his pregnant wife and young daughter as he ventures off to the Russian front during the last 12 months of the war in Europe. The film then jumps forward a year with the war over and German POW's in Russia being transported to the GULAG's in Siberia. The scenes on board the train showing the appalling conditions mirror those that you would expect to see in most Holocaust films.Upon arrival at the end of the line the prisoners then embark on a march through the snow until they reach their final destination and the very eastern tip of the USSR. Once at the GULAG at Cape Dezhnev the prisoners are sent down lead mines where historically most perished over the next 10 years.The film effectively shows the harsh conditions imposed on the prisoners although at this early stage of the film the viewer is still deciding whether or not they feel sorry for the central character and his countrymen who's exact crimes are not made clear in the film. During WW2 the USSR witnessed the very worst atrocities carried out by the Nazis so feeling sympathy for these guys is hard to do if you know the history.When Forell makes his successful escape following an unsuccessful one the journey that follows is truly remarkable. From the desolate barren landscapes of Arctic Siberia Forell encounters a variety of characters including a tribe of Siberian Eskimos that thankfully only took up a small portion of the film. The romance with the Siberian girl was silly and unnecessary.The remainder of the journey leads Forell to eventually cross the border into Iran but not before another silly scene with the GULAG camp commander who has supposedly chased the escapee for 3 years only to meet up with him on the bridge between the border posts. This was daft and took away a lot of credibility that the film does earn at different stages. A large chunk of the story them seems to disappear as Forell finds himself in a prison in Tehran waiting to be executed for being a Soviet spy. This part of the story could have been the subject of a film on its own.I'm not going to spoil the end but it was quite effective if not brief. I will say that the viewer will be left still thinking whether or not the hero of the film really is a hero. Watch a film like Come and See then see how you feel about the Nazi POW's portrayed in this film.Overall the film was a good watch not a great one as it could have been had a few more details been provided for the audience. Hardy Martins' direction has its moments. The acting was generally good although Anatoly Kotenyov was wishywashy in the role as Kamenev the Soviet officer who chases Forell throughout the film. Michael Mendl in his brief role as Stauffer was memorable. Bernhard Bettermenn in the lead role was solid although the true nature of his character is never fully realised. As a Nazi officer fighting on the Russian front the goodguy persona needed to be more toughened up. Realistically only the hardened of men could have survived what Clemens Forell did.".

The immense natural beauty is contrasted with the most dreaded encounter. The suspense and emotion of it is beyond words.Apart from the tight and intense plot and the excellent execution So Weit die Fe Tragen is filled with very touching elements. The ending will surely bring anyone to tears.

These people were soldiers and not helpless civilian population. If one wants to understand the Russian attitude which I personally don't support as it was applied against their own citizens by Stalinshould watch the movie Come and See 1985 aka Idi i smotri by Elem Klimov and understand the Russian animosity towards the German soldiers they were absolutely not gentleman. Let's put it in the right historical perspective!The roots of suffering started in Germany under Hitler were more than 90 of the population collaborated mostly willingly without a second thought or hesitation. On the artistic side the movie is too long and mainly a nice shot of the Asiatic part of Russia with a very melodramatic end...it makes new generations to think that in this criminal unique phenomenon of the history all sides were equal in their maliciousness !".

You've made me laugh again. And not just once or twice during the movie but continuously. The fabulous highlights of the film for me are Norman's collision with the local band the three ways of doing oneself in the famous man overboard scene I especially like the gun play here the three ways of Norman's trials gymnastics divingcostume mountains the ridiculous Attention! boxing scene and a bit further  a reprise of it and space travel with Norman pushing every button to get any result.

But his genius lies in the ability to make us identify with him to 'live the life' with him even as we guffaw.In the Bulldog Breed there are stock characters aplenty and the players act their roles accordingly but Wisdom like a wicked imp seems to dodge and dart round the convention  hierarchy that still in 1960 characterized much of the English way of doing things. He is like the benign counterpart of a poltergeist causing disruption certainly but not as an alien or supernatural incursion rather a human intervention into a stiff and inhuman environment. The sequence in which he gets a whole ship's crew into the water is an excellent example of this.One thing that often goes unremarked in Wisdom's films is the sexual presence there. There is almost always some lubricious lovely in the lineup and in this case Wisdom after some other amorous adventures ends up on the beach with a girl in a grass skirt being told to 'carry on'. By contemporary standards what is there is so laughably little that it seems distinctly odd to regard it as 'sex interest' but in historical context it is definitely that and as much a part of the humour as 'dirty postcards' were a part of the English seaside holiday of the time.Bear in mind by the way that in the years running up to the first moonlanding this film is also a comment on Britain's presence in space!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Bulldog Breed is a Norman Wisdom vehicle that's directed by Robert Asher  cowritten by Wisdom with Henry Blyth  Jack Davies. Plot sees Wisdom as Norman Puckle a hapless grocer's assistant who is hopelessly in love with Marlene Penny Morell. When she spurns his offer of marriage he attempts to commit suicide but he proves to be inept at that as well. Finally settling on jumping off of Lover's Leap as a sure fire way to die he is saved at the last minute by a Naval Officer who seduces him with talk of life as a sailor where the girls are plenty and life is totally great. Buying into it Norman enrols but he quickly finds that it's a tough life that he is hopeless as a sailor and that the commander wants to fly him off into outer space!.The Bulldog Breed comes at a time when Wisdom was most prolific on the big screen in a 17 year period from 1953 to 1969 Wisdom was the lead star in 15 movies. While during this time he was lending support to a number of ensemble and TV pictures too. It's inevitable that during a busy period such as this that the quality of entertainment will vary this effort falls some where in the middle on the list of Wisdom's best movies. The formula remains the same as Wisdom plays plays a bumbling but lovable dope who creates carnage where ever he goes. The comedy set pieces are many with a man overboard sequence of events the particular highlight. While it also serves as an interesting snap shot of the times. Where The Bulldog Breed differs from many of Wisdom's most fondly thought of film's is with its darker tones of suicide and sexual suggestion the latter beautifully brought to life by the sultry Liz Fraser. It's an odd mix of a film and one that has proved to divide Wisdom purists. Newcomers to his work are most likely better off choosing something else as a starting point to his movie output. 610Footnote The film marks early appearances of Michael Caine and Oliver Reed who share a scene together with Wisdom. While fans of British soap Coronation Street will find value in seeing actors Johnny Briggs and William Roache also appearing in the piece.".

Here the plot sees him as wait for it a lowly worker who makes good gets the girl and shows up the toffs at the same time!  So not a mile or a yard away from the usual fare then.  But that's fine the usual stuff is actually OK.  Here his usual routines are mostly OK but some are just average.  If you usually get a laugh from it then this will just about suffice.Wisdom is good and has a strong support cast.  However the problem is that it feels too heavily on his shoulders and the rest aren't used well enough to share the load.  When you've got actors like Hunter Chapman Jones Alexander and the ever great Le Mesurier then you need to use them.  Most have the odd good line or two but I wanted more from all of them.The comedy is basic and times and you know where it's heading from minute number 1! I'm a fan and found this to be amusing but not Wisdom's best by any means.  If this is your first meeting with Wisdom then you may be disappointed fans will enjoy it.".

It's as if the writers had several under developed ideas for a story then not knowing what to do with them tried to piece them together which gives the movie a very episodic feel Despite these criticisms THE BULLDOG BREED remains one of Wisdom's most watchable movies simply because it features so many well known faces from television such as a couple of long running cast members from CORONATION STREET not to mention a couple of uncredited appearances from future film stars Oliver Reed and Michael Caine".

One can read the actors' minds just from a telling turn of the eye curl of the lip. Wonderful. Everyone impresses but Winters is most sensational showing us the character's mixedup feelings about the magnetic sexy character Garfield plays right from the first accidental encounter.";

He is dynamic as a cop killer who is onthelam and hiding out in the apartment of a middle class family. The film is a taut thriller  with many tense moments and Garfield pulls no punches while he devises an escape plan. The captive family is well played by Shelley Winters who falls for the thug Wallace Ford and Selena Royle her parents and Bobby Hyatt the little brother. There is also a gem of a cameo performance from Gladys George as Garfield's mother and also by Norman Lloyd as his partner in crime. Alas Garfield displays all his bad boy mannerisms and gut wrenching force that we came to expect from him...and what also made him a star.".

	schema:reviewBody "This strange entry in the noir canon features John Garfield delivering a sweaty paranoid performance as a smalltime crook who shoots a cop during a heist gone bad and then holes up with the family of a girl he meets and desperately latches himself on to Shelley Winters. He virtually takes the family hostage threatening to kill whichever member he has with him at the time if any of the other members try to seek help. Meanwhile a game of patriarchal dominance begins between Garfield and the father whose sense of masculinity is threatened by his inability to help his family. It all leads to a showdown in the street as Garfield attempts to run away with Winters who may or may not have genuine feelings for him.He Ran All the Way is more about the dynamics of family than anything else. In the first scene we see what kind of home life Garfield's character comes from. His blowsy mom played divinely by Gladys George who has far too little screen time verbally and physically abuses him and then refuses to come to his aid later on when he's in trouble. As a result Garfield tries to make a sort of surrogate family of the one he's taken hostage attempting to establish a twisted kind of domestic tranquility with himself as father figure. The most unsettling scene transpires at a family dinner when Garfield forces the family at gunpoint to eat the meal he's prepared for them.Throughout the film Garfield acts with a desperate intensity you can practically smell. Unlike all of those cooler than cool crooks who populate the worlds of other noir films Garfield is lousy as a criminal his own paranoia and panic give him away at moments when he otherwise wouldn't be in any danger. Shelley Winters plays his love interest as a dowdy mope the second time that year see A Place in the Sun she played a frump who meets a goodlooking lad and then regrets it. Wallace Ford and Selena Royle do the honors as mom and dad.He Ran All the Way is not one of the more ambitious entries in the noir cycle but like so many of the lurid lowbudget films that came out around this fertile period in cinema history it has fascinating undertones that belie its simple plot.With crisp photography by James Wong Howe and a propulsive sensational score by that old pro Franz Waxman.Grade A".

They go out from a public pool and return to her apartment and then Nick forces her family  father Wallace Ford  John Ford's brother  mother Selena Royle and child to hide him from the police chase .This enjoyable film contains a relentless manhunt  thrills  suspense  violence and some elements of Noir cinema . Most actors  screenwriters  director were pursued by American government during ominous period of Mccarthismo. Interesting writing credits  written under pseudonyms  by Dalton Trumbo and Hugo Butler  front Guy Endore  being based on a novel by Sam Ross . Very good acting by John Garfield as a violent and desperado delinquent . Garfield had a sad as well fruitful life  as he signed a contract with Warner Brothers who changed his name to John Garfield. Won enormous praise for his role of the cynical Mickey Borden in Four Daughters 1938. Appeared in similar roles throughout his career despite his efforts to play varied parts  being his best film  Body and soul . Active in liberal political and social causes he found himself embroiled in Communist scare of the late 1940s. Though he testified before Congress that he was never a Communist his ability to get work declined. While separated from his wife he succumbed to longterm heart problems dying suddenly in the home of a woman friend at 39. His funeral was mobbed by thousands of fans in the largest funeral attendance for an actor since Rudolph Valentino.Atmosheric and appropriate cinematography in black and white by James Wong Howe who along with John Alton and Nicolas Musuraka are the main cameramen of Noir genre . Thrilling as well as evocative musical score by the classic Franz Waxman . The motion picture was well directed by John Berry . Director John Berry and coscripter Hugo Butler's names were removed from the credits for a time after release due to the blacklisting of supposed Communist sympathizers at the time. Assistant director Emmett Emerson is thus often credited as the film's director . Berry Was named as a member of the Communist Party by Hollywood 10 member Edward Dmytryk in Dmytryk's 1951 testimony before the House UnAmerican Activities Committee when the blacklisted director named names to revive his Hollywood career and effect a return from exile in Europe. After Dymytrk's testimony the formerly disgraced director who had served a prison term for defying HUAC in 1947 was allowed to resume his Hollywood career and direct movies in America but Berry was blacklisted and went into exile in France. Ironically Berry had directed the documentary The Hollywood Ten . Berry directed interesting films  such as 1955 Headlines of Destruction  1949 Tension 1949  1948 Casbah 1946 Cross My Heart and 1946 From This Day Forward  among others .".

Unfortunately the family doesn't understand how unloved he feels and his friendly signals are rejected causing him to act out. Winters handles a difficult role beautifully  a young woman without much life experience attracted to this man and terrified for her family. Is her goal to get him away from them or does she really care for him? Wallace Ford as the frustrated father who is unable to protect his family is excellent.Like another poster I would have wished for a bigger film as Garfield's last but in the end he handed in another excellent performance and elevated the movie. What was ahead for him? Well he was blacklisted  perhaps his friend Clifford Odets' affirmation that Garfield had never been a member of the Communist party would have helped him but we'll never know.

	schema:reviewBody "twists and turns and unusual developments. The perfect suspense and noir film not only for John Garfield fans.Garfield is a man down on his luck who with partner in crime Norman Lloyd decides the perfect heist is to rob a payroll clerk on payday. They steal the money and to escape he blends in to the crowd. He ends up at a sort of YMCAneighborhood pool which is very crowded the police are looking for him but he hides the money in his locker. There is much suspense created here under rather ordinary circumstances. Some of the scenes in the pool are interesting as when he is swimming hiding underwater to avoid the police. He flirts and eventually befriends a standoffish Shelley Winters. She has that likable and vulnerable quality that a thief could use to hideout. He takes her home which turns out to be a small apartment where she lives with her parents and kid brother. The parents portray the average working class decent people who would not expect a man to be capable of such crimes.Eventually Winters falls for him. She has her hair done and even buys a new dress to impress the Garfield character. He needs to make a getaway and gives her 1500.00 of the money to get a car. When she returns the jig is up. The police have been notified and it is just a matter of time. Garfield doubts that Winters even bought the car... she must have turned him in he thinks. Possibly not? The ending has a good twist of fate and movies such as this are hard to come by. Highly recommended.There was something very real and affecting about these movies centered in NYC. Nothing since has ever come close. If you enjoyed this you may also like Pickup on South Street with Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter. Also Road House with Ida Lupino and Richard Widmark. Another standout. 910.".

There is much suspense created here under rather ordinary circumstances. Some of the scenes in the pool are interesting as when he is swimming hiding underwater to avoid the police. He flirts and eventually befriends a standoffish Shelley Winters. She has that likable and vulnerable quality that a thief could use to hideout. He takes her home which turns out to be a small apartment where she lives with her parents and kid brother. The parents portray the average working class decent people who would not expect a man to be capable of such crimes.Eventually Winters falls for him. She has her hair done and even buys a new dress to impress the Garfield character. He needs to make a getaway and gives her 1500.00 of the money to get a car. When she returns the jig is up. The police have been notified and it is just a matter of time. Garfield doubts that Winters even bought the car... she must have turned him in he thinks. Possibly not? The ending has a good twist of fate and movies such as this are hard to come by. Highly recommended.There was something very real and affecting about these movies centered in NYC. Nothing since has ever come close. If you enjoyed this you may also like Pickup on South Street with Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter. Also Road House with Ida Lupino and Richard Widmark. Another standout. 910.";

Also Shelly Winters is much more effective here in a role she virtually perfected as the lonely whimpering victim than she was in the classic A PLACE IN THE SUN which also came out that year.".

	schema:reviewBody "He Ran All The Way was John Garfield's last movie before his untimely death from a heart attack at the age of 39. This talented actor featured in a number of film noirs most notably The Postman Always Rings Twice 1946 and Body And Soul 1947 and regularly impressed with the levels of intensity and authenticity that he brought to his roles.Interestingly this movie is now widely regarded as being the first of the home invasion dramas which would later include such notable offerings as The Desperate Hours 1955 and Unlawful Entry 1992. In these movies the victims are terrorised in their own homes by very dangerous men whereas in other examples such as The Hand That Rocks The Cradle 1992 and The Page Turner 2006 the threat posed to the victims is initially far more subtle and comes from very calculating women.He Ran All The Way is the story of Nick Robey John Garfield a jobless man from a dysfunctional family background who has a nightmare about being constantly on the run and shooting someone. His nightmare soon becomes a reality after his friend Al Molin Norman Lloyd persuades him to take part in a payroll robbery which goes wrong. As the two men are making their escape Al is shot and Nick has to shoot a cop in order to make a clean getaway.Nick tries to look inconspicuous by mingling with the crowds on the street and then goes into a public swimming pool where he accidentally bumps into Peg Dobbs Shelley Winters a young woman who's learning to swim. Following their awkward introduction to each other Nick takes Peg home and she introduces him to her father mother and younger brother who are going out to see a movie. When the family return home Nick becomes very anxious and convinces himself that they must know who he is. He brandishes a gun and tells them that he's a fugitive who's wanted for shooting a policeman.From this point on Nick keeps at least one member of the family with him at all times so that the others can carry on their regular working routines to avoid raising any suspicions. This tense situation continues until action that Peg's father takes enables her to turn the tables on Nick.John Garfield gives a powerful performance as the paranoid killer who doesn't trust anyone and is prone to panicking. His inability to relate to other people is profound and the combination of this quality and Peg's awkwardness and naivety makes their attempts to relate to each other painfully difficult. Shelley Winters' openfaced expressions and confused looks work well to make her character's gullibility seem utterly convincing and Wallace Ford provides the standout supporting performance as Peg's father.Visually this claustrophobic drama's atmosphere is emphasised very effectively by cinematographer James Wong Howe's use of high camera angles and heavily shadowed areas and the movie's poignant conclusion looks stunning and provides further evidence of his considerable skill.A look at the names of the people involved in the making of this film highlights the impact which the work of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee had on the industry in the early 1950s. John Garfield was one of the most famous actors to be blacklisted as a result of refusing to name names director John Berry went to live in Paris for many years to avoid having to appear before the Committee and screenwriter Dalton Trumbo served a prison sentence for refusing to testify. Furthermore the finger of suspicion was also pointed at another screenwriter Hugo Butler and cinematographer James Wong Howe.".

Garfield left us way too soon with the strain of the blacklist on his heart weakened with rheumatic fever years earlier. The film is an independent one released to the theaters by United Artists.If Garfield had to die at least he went out on with a crackerjack performance in a really good part. He's a truly evil young punk who kills a cop during the course of a robbery after the cop shoots and kills Garfield's accomplice Norman Lloyd.Fleeing from the cops Garfield takes refuge in a public swimming pool and meets and charms young Shelley Winters who takes him home to her family which consists of parents Wallace Ford and Selena Royle and kid brother Bobby Hyatt. When the truth comes out about him Garfield becomes a caged animal knowing he can't move around with no transportation and the city police force looking for him as a cop killer whom they'd just as soon shoot on sight.The supporting cast gives uniformly brilliant performances down the line. Garfield wasn't the only one with blacklist trouble involved in He Ran All The Way. Dalton Trumbo of the Hollywood Ten wrote the script under an alias and Selena Royle would soon be blacklisted as well and couldn't get work unless it was in such junk classics as Robot Monster. The fact the film got made at all in 1951 was something.The film has a lot of similarities to the big budget Paramount classic The Desperate Hours with Humphrey Bogart and Fredric March. And if you're familiar with that one you can figure somewhat how He Ran All The Way came out.This was not Garfield's last role. After this he did do his infamous testimony at the House Un American Activities Committee and then did a revival of Golden Boy in the lead. Garfield had been in the original production but in the supporting role of the brotherinlaw. He was born to play the lead that William Holden did in his breakout role. Garfield's bad luck that Columbia rather than Warner Brothers bought the screen rights.He Ran All The Way is a great tribute to the rebel career and life of John Garfield.".

Unfortunately Hollywood didn't do too well in casting him in better roles. Because he was so young he was somewhat of a pretty boy except his youth was spent on the tough streets of NYC. He had the experience behind his toughguy roles. During his stagecareer  preHollywood  he was a sure winner for Golden Boy a dramatic story of a young violinist with just as much punch in the boxingring. That role didn't come till much later William Holden played the original. When Garfield finally played it he studied with Isaac Stern who did the real fiddlin'. Garfield's acting was truly convincing this would have been a wonderful final film. It was not to be. He moved back and forth between NYC and Hollywood which couldn't cast him right although he was a major star at his death. Good looks and a beautiful smile will get you lots of places.He Ran all the Way was another version of minor crimestories for so many of Hollywood's young actors. Garfield had an edge over most of them because he was a very good actor. Unfortunately a very weak heart and extreme good looks done him in.......he died at 39. TCM did an original letterbox with his daughter doing the narration with lots of pictures.Director John Berry was excellent following the plot written by blacklisted Dalton Trumbo original book Sam Ross following the ritual of early copsandrobbers films. Robey pullsoff a petty robbery he wounds a cop his partner gets shot Robey begins running into the crowd on the streets. Garfield did an excellent job of portraying a frightened crook with major paranoia. He follows the crowd into a public swimmingpool where he meets sexually repressed Peggy Dobbs Shelley Winters. Predictably he windsup in her home taking her family hostage for a hideout. Peggy's mom and dad Wallace Ford Selena Royle seem to be really glad some guy has finally found her attractive they don't know how to handle the hostage situation but did very good acting. Again predictably Peggy falls for Robey but is torn between terror for her family and love for him. It becomes apparent that Robey was prettymuch finished with running......Although Garfield threw himself into this role his disappointment in its finished product  and his constant philandering  he most probably knew his career was coming to an end. The movieindustry dropped him when the committee huntingdown communists among Hollywood stars disclosed he had had dealings with those radicals for a long period and his wife was a partymember. He refused to testify but did not learn that Clifford Odets testified for him  he died first. Many careers and lives were ruined by The House unAmerican......Too handsome genuine too machohunky made John Garfield a misfit for Hollywood. He excelled in the roles he was given there but realized his niche was on the stage in NYC. Who knows how many great films he could have made had not Hollywood and the committee done a job on him. Watch this film with respect for a very good actor whose potential was barely shown. He Ran all the Way was Garfield's last run.".

He excelled in the roles he was given there but realized his niche was on the stage in NYC. Who knows how many great films he could have made had not Hollywood and the committee done a job on him. Watch this film with respect for a very good actor whose potential was barely shown. He Ran all the Way was Garfield's last run.";

The pool scene where he hides out may not make much sense why risk the money being stolen from the locker but is an unusual and eyecatching venue. However once the movie sets up shop in the Winters family apartment the dynamism subsides and I'm reminded of one of those Playhouse 90 melodramas of the time. They were interesting stage plays for TV but too static for a screenplay. And despite director Berry's efforts to build tension from the resulting hostage situation the film never regains the earlier momentum.What the movie does have is the great John Garfield in unfortunately his last role. Frankly he doesn't look well but still manages a dynamic performance without which the film would totally collapse. Snarling one moment and cooing the next he's still believable as a cynical gunman torn between softer fellow feelings and a desperate sense of survival. The suspense comes from not knowing which side will ultimately dominate. Unfortunately Shelley Winters plays the hapless girl he picks up at the pool. She's supposed to be emotionally vulnerable which she is at first but Winters has a hard time being vulnerable without being pathetic  for example A Place in the Sun 1951. Thus she soon becomes more annoying than sympathetic. The climax is nicely ironical yet fails to help move the proceedings beyond the programmer stage. Too bad that Garfield didn't clock out on the wings of a more memorable movie.".

Unfortunately he would die of a heart attack on the eve of his HUAC hearing the next year at the young age of 39 ironically the premise of a hounded petty criminal hiding out in an apartment block actually seems to be a tragically prescient parable for his current personal plight! Anyway here the star is ably supported by the likes of Shelley Winters Wallace Ford and Norman Lloyd.Though essentially routine not to mention overly familiar the film is undeniably wellmade reasonably slick for an independent production  though of course not quite in the same league as the star's earlier BODY AND SOUL 1947 and FORCE OF EVIL 1949  and at a mere 77 minutes thankfully it does not overstay its welcome. Suspense is nicely sustained throughout from the opening payroll robbery which snowballs into murder to a scene where an argument escalates into hysteria and results in a hand injury to the heroine's mother and the effective  if contrived  downbeat ending. A memorably hardboiled moment constitutes perhaps the most hilarious order ever given at gunpoint  Garfield to Ford Carve the turkey! Among the notable credits are scriptwriters Hugo Butler and Dalton Trumbo both boasting associations to my favorite auteur Luis Bunuel! cinematographer James Wong Howe making the most of the enclosed setting production designer Harry Horner ditto editor Francis D. Lyon and dialogue director Arnold Laven  interestingly the last 3 all eventually graduated to the director's chair while both Trumbo and Howe would try their hand at it just once. Also worth mentioning is the fact that apart from Garfield director Berry and the aforementioned scriptwriters with Guy Endore 'fronting' for Trumbo were similarly targeted by the socalled Red Scare.".

On the run he takes refuge in the workingclass apartment of a girl he just met Shelley Winters and her family  Mom Pop and kid brother. His identity is discovered by the family and he quietly takes them hostage holding a snubnosed .38 on them. But what's he going to do with them? How is he supposed to get away with the dragnet out for him? Mom and Pop are quietly repulsed by him but Winters is attracted and evidently spends the night with him intending to accompany him on his getaway. He sends her out to buy a car with part of the payroll money but comes to believe she didn't buy the car. Instead she's betrayed him to the police. In the end she's forced to shoot him at the doorway to the apartment house. He looks surprised says You never had no love for me stumbles out the door only to discover before he collapses that she'd been true to her word. There sits the car. And Garfield plops into the rainfilled gutter.Mostly  throughout the movie  they talk. Then they talk more. Then they go on talking more. Garfield's character emerges as embittered and cynical self pitying angry at those who have betrayed him all through his life beginning with his mother.But he's not very smart. He allows the family to go out in order to show up at work or run errands as long as he has one member at home for a hostage. While the rest are absent in a burst of generosity and hope he has an elaborate turkey dinner prepared. When they return he beams with pride and tells them to dig in. But they remain silent and Mom produces some leftover stew which they proceed to spoon out without enthusiasm. I don't get it says Garfield. What's the mattah with the toikey? Ga head  cahve it up. Pop tells him solemnly This is our dinner. The turkey is YOUR dinner. Garfield is dumbfounded. Huh? Oh  I GET IT. Finally. It could easily have been a radio play still popular at the time 1951 or a live TV show from Playhouse 90. The budget is low and the story skeletal. Usually they find room for remarks about how this is going to be the hottest day of the year or something. Here the patter is limited to remarks about the future about good character about responsibility and they lead nowhere.I usually find John Garfield's performances likable  another lowermiddleclass guy from New York  but never magnetic.

The beautifully shot scenes by James Wong Howe of New York reminded me of Dead End and the many television series and movies shot in the 1950's and early 60's in New York. This film is evidence that the House Unamerican Activities Committee was a blight on the land that badly damaged cinematic art in this country. HUAC and the Hays Moral Code were the two worse catastrophes to hit Hollywood in the 20th Century. Excellent performances and solid Hollywood production values send it to the top of the must see Film Noir list.".

The beautifully shot scenes by James Wong Howe of New York reminded me of Dead End and the many television series and movies shot in the 1950's and early 60's in New York. This film is evidence that the House Unamerican Activities Committee was a blight on the land that badly damaged cinematic art in this country. HUAC and the Hays Moral Code were the two worse catastrophes to hit Hollywood in the 20th Century. Excellent performances and solid Hollywood production values send it to the top of the must see Film Noir list.";

This probably wasn't a very challenging role for Garfield. It's similar to the types of roles he played early in his career. Perhaps a little edgier and lacking charm or humor.

However Shinzon is revealed to be a clone of Picard who was raised on Remus a slave planet to the Romulans. Later on Picard discovers that this peace treaty was nothing more than a setup on account of the fact that Shinzon needs Picard in order to survive.

Despite mainstream belief I think 'Insurrection' was a beautifully written film and despite the simple story it worked nicely as the characters were having fun.This film is very serious and although I don't like action films  this movie was pretty intense thanks to its villain. The characters aren't having fun at all which I think detaches the audiences a little cause it's not a fun adventure. The stakes in this film are more personal to the characters so there's no time for the regular jokes once the story kicks in as there's too much at stake.That aside this film is handsomely produced with a great production design and has some exciting conflict between Picard Patrick Stewart and his nemesis Shinzon Tom Hardy. The face off between the two characters in the final 30 minutes is very exciting.The performances where all brilliant in the film and I hope to see the full version of the film on DVD as I think the mind rape suffered by Troi Marina Sirtis could have been further explored.Why this film failed at the boxoffice was the timing. You don't release a Star Trek film 5 days before Lord of the Rings. L.O.T.R. is more popular than Star Trek right now but this film could have reignited the franchise if people went and saw it. Delaying its release in Australia was a good idea as this has given it a no. 1 spot on opening weekend which it deserves despite an almost nonexistent marketing campaign here.It wasn't a bad film by any means and I think the critics didn't like it because it was so dark and that there's little sense of fun.I think 'Nemesis' is a very worthy chapter in the Star Trek franchise. It took a while to reach Australian audiences but most of us believe it was well worth the wait. 8 out of 10".

It's hard to have perspective when there is no measure so with that said I can say safely without a shadow of doubt in my mind that Star Trek II Wrath of Kahn is the greatest of the Star Trek Movies ever made period. There has never been a movie prior or post this movie that has engaged excited or enthralled a Treker. If you want to know why exactly read my review on it.Now during this era of Star Trek movies they never muddled with the plot killer dimension time except one Star Trek IV Return Home. All of the other movies where how would 'Q' put it linear. Honestly anything that has a plot where someone goes back into time and tries to change it or prevents its change well lets say it kills the plot by putting a plot hole the size of ablack hole. I was never a real fan of the time travel as a script concept simply because if it was possible at all everybody and anybody would eventually try to go back in time and change things to a more favorable outcome for themselves. Basically if you were able to go back in time wouldn't you pick the winning lottery ticket numbers? So if you can do that why can't I? The next thing you know you've got a million winning tickets. Star Trek Nemesis gets one gold star for having a plot that does not change time on a clock.In fact it's pretty good. There are flaws and incongruities especially in regards to the Generations episodes and there is no justification for some of the oversights but the movie shines where it should. A real attempt was made to develop the villains character Shinzon of Remus Picard's clone. He isn't just a villain he is a Picard an alternate version.So what's new? Picard embodies the perfect Starfleet officer. But take that uniform off and replace it with tattered clothes and remove that individual form his starship and place him in the deep recesses of a sunless world mined by slaves tortured by Romulans and you get the picture.What I think people missed in this movie was the big question are Picard and the clone so different. Shinzon even asks Picard that in the movie. Could Picard have changed or convinced the clone had he had more time? Could the original Picard in a similar situation become evil? Either way it is the human element and conflict within each of the Picard's and is what will intrigue an audience and is what I especially liked about this movie.The special effects are good and really enhance a situation not nearly explored enough in Star Trek the tactics of starship combat. This and only a few other instances has there been such an emphasis on strategy and tactics in starship combat.JeanLuc Picard  Patrick Stewart and his clone Shinzon of Remus Tom Hardy are both at the top of their game and fluently exercise their Shakespearean acting talents. Especially Hardy who convinces us that he is Picard's clone and then convinces us he's nothing like Picard. The Enterprise crew is at their best and Stuart Baird's direction gave Nemesis a movie like feeling rather than TV minimovie feeling.In closing who wants to be an ensign when you can be a captain? In the end Trekers have to realize that Star Trek and its stories are about its captain. It is the captain who gets to say those cool lines like 'Energize' and 'Fire' 'Divert Warp Power' 'Meet me in my ready room' and Picard's trademark lines 'Make it so!'.A must see for SciFi buffs and openminded Trekers.".

When four long years passed between INSURRECTION and NEMESIS and Paramount always skittish about the expensive series chose to advertise the film as THE END OF TREK A Generation's Final Journey... you knew that not only the film but the entire franchise was in serious trouble.

Sounds good doesn't it? But Nemesis is not a good movie in fact its a fitting epitaph for the way the series had progressed and sheds light on the how and why of its ultimate failure. Producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga have consistently affirmed that its franchise fatigue that caused the film to die at the box office  a contributory factor perhaps but not the most important reason. In some respects the film's failure was set in stone prior to it's production because the three previous Trek's had been simply so average. You can blame the television shows but frankly if you've been doing your job right there should be an audience out there looking forward to the new movies because its the kind of event story and spectacle that they can't get on the small screen. Nemesis had come during a period in which successive Treks both on and off the small screen simply hadn't cut the mustard and this was bound to catch up with Paramount sooner or later. It's ultimate failure though is as ever the script. Logan's story is clearly based on his favourite  The Wrath of Khan and you can see where he's coming from. Khan has it all. The perfectly recreated spirit of the T.V series the emphasis and development of character excellent action set pieces and the perfect solid storyline that mixes the personal and the epic. Nemesis however does none of these things. It's funny it should be a story about doubles because it's Khan's poorer clone a sort of a B4 to the 2nd film's Data if you like which desperately needs to assert itself an a bigbudget action spectacle but in doing so looses the subtly and the character dynamics that produced the best of the T.V series. Stewart and Spiner were given story input and huge salaries to effectively addtestosterone to their characterisations and unsurprisingly place the story emphasis on themselves but in doing so managed to alter both characters so as to divorce from their small screen counterparts. They'll claim they have the right of course but such selfindulgence only points to the general loss of grip exhibited here. In turning Star Trek into some kind of actionfranchise phaser rifles and the like the shows heart is gradually lost. In fact the general contempt for the show's history is there everywhere from the way in which Wesley Crusher is relegated to a nonspeaking background part his return warranted explanation the Romulans are carelessly neutered and Data is needlessly dispatched for for the sake of plot rather than logic.

As the nearest ship the Enterprise is sent to Romulus to supposedly negotiate peace with the new government of the planet.  On arrival Picard discovers that the head of the Reman is his clone.  The Enterprise quickly finds that the peace talks are no more than the start of a planned attack on Earth.Given that the evens are always the better films when it comes to Star Trek films I had reasonable hopes for this film most of which were met adequately note the choice of word.  The plot is where both the potential and the weaknesses lie.  The film has the discovery' of a Data prototype on an uncharted planet and then the discovery of a Picard clone and then kicks off into a bigger plot where the Enterprise must stop the Reman from attacking Earth with a powerful outlawed weapon.  The various touches of the film are both good and bad.  The discovery of B4 sits awkwardly with the rest of the film and never really makes complete sense.  Shinzon being Picard's clone works quite well and allows for a greater level of involvement in the plot than if he had been just another bad guy out to destroy the world.  However I did think the film still had room to really go for it and push the emotional conflict a lot better.Part of the problem was Shinzon himself I never really ever felt that he was Picard's match where I should have felt like I was watching two titans in battle.  That said when it comes to the battles they are all pretty enjoyable and the effects are good.  Some of them are genuinely quite exciting although the film struggles to have a consistently tense mood.The cast are all pretty comfortable in their wellworn roles.  Stewart is always good as Picard but I didn't feel that either Frakes or Sirtis were allowed to do much with their material.  With no solo material Dorn McFadden and Burton do their best and they do well to make an impression regardless.  Spiner cowrote this film and that says a lot.  His usual Data role is as good as always but his B4 just smacks of his selfserving hand in the script the film would have been better without this character and could have driven the plot in other ways without him.  Perlman is almost totally unrecognisable under his makeup but projects menace nonetheless. Hardy is a bit too calm and polished for the role  I didn't get the feeling that he had any of Picard's passion or gutsy mentality he should have had that AND been a lot more aggressive due to his environment  having a shaved head and an English accent just didn't cut it even if he was good in earlier scenes.Overall this is an evennumbered Star Trek so it is fated to be enjoyable and on the most part it is.  The plot has one good concept that works the clone and one concept that really doesn't at all B4 and would have been dismissed were it not for Spiner's hands on the script.  The action is good and Stewart is as good a central point as ever making for an enjoyable if unexceptional entry in the long running series.".

From an interview John Logan is a Star Trek The Next Generation fan but it seems as though he neglected to truly include that series into the movie. As well as the other Star Trek series such as Deep Space Nine and Voyager.Such inconsistencies includes mostly based upon trailers and the 3 mentioned Star Trek series the initial introduction of the Remans. Worf being on board the Enterprise though he is suppose to be an ambassador to Qo'noS Klingon home world at the series finale of DS9. Having Wesley Crusher making a cameo when he is suppose to be with a super being known as the Traveller. As well as technical information of the Enterprise that doesn't conform to information with a previous movie. As well as what could be ridiculous technology or equipment that includes the Star Fleet SUV. But what is even more troubling is that nearly a third of the movie wasn't shown which includes a very intense scene on the turbolift involving Counsellor Troi. Shown on the trailer but not on the movie. And some of those deleted scenes could have added support to the movie. Fortunately many of the inconsistencies are mended with Star Trek novels that are directly related to the movie.However everyone in the movie did make a real attempt at making this a good movie with some success. In fact though plagued with budget constraints many areas of the limited budget made the movie even better. For example the planet Kolarus III was shot with digital flairing and other relatively inexpensive techniques and it really felt like you were on an alien planet. And on a scene that has Captain Picard interacting with Shinzon via hologram the hologram was originally suppose to be partially transparent but budget restrictions made Shinzon solid but with a distorted voice yet felt more true to the interaction between the two of them.Mostly a remake of Star Trek's 2 and 6 it's okay but the inconsistencies and clichs really hurts it. Otherwise it would be about an 8 or 9 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me state for the record that I have loved Star Trek for most of my life. The Next Generation is still one of my favorite TV shows thanks to enduring cable exposure. Traditionally the ST films alternate goodbad. Star Trek II IV VI and First Contact were very good but parts I III V Generations and Insurrection were not that good with part V being the outright worst outing ever. Logically this meant Nemesis should have been an upswing. Sadly it is mediocre at best which in my opinion sounds the death knell for Star Trek.The largest problem here is like Insurrection the antagonist simply isn't intimidating in the slightest. Besides being skinny and bald he spends a majority of the film sitting down or doubled over in pain why I won't say for spoilers sake. His alien subordinates look more intimidating but don't really DO anything scary. One of them seems kind of psychic but that is never really explained for any reason.Speaking of no explanation I found the new android to be ludicrous. Without giving anything away the other Data you see in the commercials is a walking plot hole whose every action is a forgone conclusion. When I saw Brent Spiner the actor who plays Data had a writing credit I knew who was responsible too. Data does a lot of ridiculous things in the film the least of which is sing Irving Berlin's Blue Skys.I'm not the diehard Star Trek fan I once was and movies like Nemesis show me why. It's just not very good certainly not worth price of admission. If you want to enjoy a 40year old franchise go see James Bond in Die Another Day. Now that movie had a bald bad guy and it worked! ".

Star Trek II IV VI and First Contact were very good but parts I III V Generations and Insurrection were not that good with part V being the outright worst outing ever. Logically this meant Nemesis should have been an upswing. Sadly it is mediocre at best which in my opinion sounds the death knell for Star Trek.The largest problem here is like Insurrection the antagonist simply isn't intimidating in the slightest. Besides being skinny and bald he spends a majority of the film sitting down or doubled over in pain why I won't say for spoilers sake. His alien subordinates look more intimidating but don't really DO anything scary. One of them seems kind of psychic but that is never really explained for any reason.Speaking of no explanation I found the new android to be ludicrous. Without giving anything away the other Data you see in the commercials is a walking plot hole whose every action is a forgone conclusion. When I saw Brent Spiner the actor who plays Data had a writing credit I knew who was responsible too. Data does a lot of ridiculous things in the film the least of which is sing Irving Berlin's Blue Skys.I'm not the diehard Star Trek fan I once was and movies like Nemesis show me why. It's just not very good certainly not worth price of admission. If you want to enjoy a 40year old franchise go see James Bond in Die Another Day. Now that movie had a bald bad guy and it worked! ";

	schema:reviewBody "Star Trek Nemesis has gone through the mill. At first it had the pressure of being an even numbered Trek film usually a tell tale sign that it would be good. Then it has the pressure from fans who were not happy with Insurrection. So let's first put all things into perspective. Insurrection was not as good as First Contact but it certainly wasn't a bad film. It had a tight plot developed the characters and was well paced. In fact all the Next Generation films are very watchable films even Generations which seemed to think it needed William Shatner to prop it up.I really can not see how people can complain about this film. Again it develops the characters further has plenty of decent actions sequences which includes by far the best space battle of all the films. The story moves along nicely and I find it thoroughly enjoyable to watch. Jerry Goldsmith gives it a dark edge with his score and so much so that it ends up being darker at times than First Contact.However for all the story it has the reason Nemesis is a fine finale to the Star Trek films is the epic battle at the end. People can moan about its similarities to Wrath of Khan and The Undiscovered Country but they were great battles and why not take elements that work and build on them? I have to admit I sat in the cinema loving Picard's desperate move gripped in anticipation. That was something we had never seen. In all other space battles the enemy had a little trick up their sleeve to beat our heroes. This time they were out gunned and overpowered yet sheer bravery and determination win the day not a fancy homing torpedo or a tricky move. Sheer guts was all that they had left.It's a good action film and a good Star Trek film. Not the best but still a fine finale".

	schema:reviewBody "I find it tragic that people could actually find something good to say about this movie. I have the entire collection of Star Trek and not only was this a bad movie it would even rank as the worst of all the episodes including the Star Trek Enterprise Pilot... and that is just sad. The one certainty that has always been part of the legend of the Star Trek Universe is character continuity. When Warf's character reached fulfillment on Star Trek DS9 for example he was a Federation Ambassador...suddenly in Nemesis he is back on the Enterprise as a Lt Commander having already made Commander on DS9 without explanation. Wesley Crusher was A Traveller able to reach through the confines of time and space which also includes weddings apparently. He could have gone on board Enterprise and had them on Remus in about a second yet no mention was made of his powers abilities or relationships. We are to believe that Picard's Nemesis was Picard...too bad Locutus was not around to hear that or he would have been upset. The cheap Chinese copy of Picard was sickly and yet infinitely more powerful than the original who rose to Captain in the Federation. The Federation's ultimate enemy from Kirk to Picard was the Romulans...Vulcan's with attitude who were to sly what Vulcan's are to logic. Apparently the only thing the Federation had to do to destroy them all this time was send Picard with a smart bomb. The thousands of worlds they conquered must have been shocked that one guy Picard with Hair could destroy and entire Empire in a few minutes and then set his sights on the Federation. We apparently were supposed to forget that Spock the legendary ambassador to Romulus after years of infiltrating the Romulan society with his teachings of logic had ultimately failed....and what Romulans really wanted was a human to lead them. I don't think so. Star Trek was never about space travel it was about people and how they lived on the edge of a new reality...a new frontier. These people are heroic figures to the show's fans and cant be belittled or downplayed because as it affects the show's characters it effects us as the loyal audience. Just as Star Trek Entrprise tried to create Vulcan's as an enemy Romulous being taken over in a day just does not fly with an audience loyal to the traditions of a future we want and love. We want men of logic and learning to help us traverse the frontier and we want enemies that we could never really best before to be more formidable than surrendering to Picard with hair. Visually it was an interesting movie with special effects that wow the eye. Data spacewalking from one ship to the other was very well done. One of the opening sequences with the spaced out dune buggy was almost fun and nearly Star Trek in its rare humanity. If I was to rewrite this story to make it plausible and fit in with the Star Trek universe I would have had Romulus overrun by either Borg or Dominion forces and have the Enterprise the only ship that could save them and thus cement a peace that began with the Dominion war. At the end the total logic society would have taken over Romulous and it would be welcomed as part of the Federation. Shinzon if you had to have Picard versus Picard could have headed the Romulans loyal to the enemy rather than give up their struggle against the federation. We need one more Star Trek Movie like the Undiscovered Country for TNG fans. It is to pathetic to leave Star Trek at this travesty of a movie. One would think that after making millions of dollars with the entire Star Trek franchise Universal would at least like to finish it on a good note...and who knows maybe grow new fans for TV shows and movies in the future.

	schema:reviewBody "6 out of 10If the rumors are to be believed then approximately fifty minutes of footage for Star Trek Nemesis are lying somewhere in Paramount's vault. While the movie itself is technically welledited with a slick Hollywood gloss this might explain why everyone but Picard and Data are left shorthanded with minimal screen time and dialogue.  Hopefully the missing footage will find its way to the DVD release where we can get the final tribute the crew of The Next Generation deserves.As a story for a final adventure Nemesis isn't quite the epic one may hope for.  The plot mostly focuses on the parallels between Picard and the new Romulan leader a human named Shinzon Tom Hardy who claims to desire peace between the Romulans and the Federation.  He also has a special bond to Picard which I won't give away suffice to say Data also gets to experience something similar throughout the film.  Essentially the plot isn't particularly interesting and it works primarily as a setup for the climactic space battle definitely the movie's highlight.Before then the only setpieces worthy of interest are a gratuitous but enjoyable car chase ! on a desert planet that resolves in a grininducing fashion and a fastpaced shootout on board Shinzon's warship the Scimitar which also resolves in a pretty cool manner.  That's all the action we get in the first 80 or so minutes meaning there's a lot of talky scenes that go nowhere and clumsily insert the good ol' Nature vs. Nurture debate to no avail.   Outside of the action what makes the first 34's of the movie watchable are the excellent special effects and the crew's camaraderie. Acting wise we get excellent performances from Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner by the way is it just me or does Stewart look even more physically fit than ever? Old age is doing little to bring him downClearly the final space battle is what we've been waiting for and after 10 movies and 23 years we get what is easily the most elaborate action sequence of the entire Trek franchise.  The segment runs just short of a halfhour and features the Enterprise going toetotoe with the Scimitar and to keep the concept of one starship battling another from getting boring because let's face it that gets old in a matter of minutes director Stuart Baird throws in a few more ships some more phaser fights from boarding enemy parties which prove to be the most exciting parts of the movie fisticuffs and even a selfdestruct sequence that could prove fatal for everyone.  It's a doozy of an action scene even if it is slightly marred by Troi's psychic link and tiresome reports of collapsing shields. This is the sequence that makes the movie worth watching to scifi action fans.Personally I would have preferred had Baird just spaced the action out more evenly a la First Contact rather than stuffing it all in the conclusion since the plot itself is hard to hold interest on its own.  Still from the space battle alone this is more actionpacked than any of the original crew's films and comes out just ahead of First Contact in terms of quantity if not in quality.  The finale also features the death of a beloved character which isn't executed quite as properly as it should have but is touching on its own.  Once again I'm hoping the director's cut will fix that up.  Until then this is just satisfying enough to those who thirst for outerspace action.".

Wesley Crusher was... But these characters have always been good together and hugely watchable because of this. The discovery of the B4 android was an interesting idea if a little boringly executed. If he had been given a glimmer of personality it would have been so much more interesting. Shinzon's story was a bit vague but I thought Tom Hardy was quite good in honesty could have been a lot worse. Just look at the S'ona in Insurrection for example. Boring. Shinzon's intent and general hatred for humanity was well written and could have been explored and expanded so much more. The battle in space was real good and so badly needed in a Trek film. Data's sacrifice was touching but a real cop out when B4 started humming Riker's wedding 'present' tune at the end. But this set up things for Data to return echoing the circumstances of 'The Wrath Of Khan' where Spock sacrificed himself only to return in the next movie. Trek fans shouldn't slate this film too much as it had a lot of elements that usually please fans. Seen the cuts which had been made to the film recently one of which explains Wesley's Starfleet uniform. Hope to see a Director's cut of this soon as these scenes explain a lot".

Along the way they discover two things a prototype android that bears a striking resemblance to Data and a young human warrior who bears a striking resemblance to Picard in his younger days. The ceremonies will have to wait as the Romulan Empire has been brought to its knees.Wow. That's the word to describe this one  wow. I watched Insurrection not long ago and found it to be a decent movie. For the fans who wanted to see the crew travel and explore it was a nice treat. However for those who paid to see it in theater... it was a slap in the face. We were treated to nothing we couldn't have seen for free on the average episode of the series. Why bother with a film if you're just going to showcase characters for no reason? Nemesis doesn't mess around. The Riker and Troi saga finally enters the next phase. Data's history is explored and he goes on one of his greatest adventures yet the free float in space scene is awesome. Picard must face himself the ultimate adversary... this is a film that taps into the characters' personas as much as it gives us action. There's even some romance towards the end... wait for it.Some of the other characters get sidelined Worf and LaForge are pretty minor here and Janeway from Voyager is brought in for no good reason. But it works. We are given the characters we want most and a story of the Romulans that was bound to happen. As great of villains as they've been they've never been discussed to their fullest possibilities. This film changed that thank goodness.If you're not a Trek fan this may not be for you. But you probably wouldn't pick it up in the first place if you weren't would you? If you are a Trek fan and haven't seen it yet you're missing out. Generations was good First Contact was good. But this is by far easily without a doubt the best Next Generation film that was made... and since I do not believe they'll ever return to the series it's the film you'll want to remember these characters in... pure brilliance. Brent Spiner who plays Data and also wrote the screenplay should be commended  where was his writing prior to this one? Oh and Wesley Crusher shows up for about five seconds too.".

The fact of the matter is is that none of them are classics except for the people who know and love the characters in them namely Trekkies.It has been said that Stuart Baird was brought on board to try and open up Trek to a wider audience but that simply insults the viewers Trek already has. Voyager tried and failed and Enterprise is rapidly going the same route.The better Trek films are those that revolve around the characterdynamics and seeing those people work as a team. In those films such as Wrath of Khan The Undiscovered Country or First Contact the comradeship of the protagonists is evident.Not so in Nemesis which is ironic especially considering the entire film is purportedly about such relationships. None of the characters have been drastically altered as many might suggest but there is very little interaction between them there's no moment where the viewer would think only PicardDatawhoever would get them out of this situation. It's all a bit for lack of a better word bleh. There's no adventure something that has been missing from Trek since First Contact.Shinzon is a powerful character a wonderful character but sorely underused. It's almost as if he's never really serious about what he's doing and as such never seems to pose much of a threat. This is emphasized through the cliched dramatic countdown timer sequence used excessively in Trek but here lacks substance especially since it is entirely and utterly pointless.Nemesis starts off well full of hope and joy and the prospect of Troi and Riker's wedding and the viewer too is led into a false sense of hope at the prospect of the film. But Stuart Baird lets us down harshly. He was the wrong director for the job the script if you listen to the dialogue watch the cut scenes etc is not an action script but a characterdriven one with a few action elements.Baird has turned that on its head and produced an action film with very little character involvement.As a plus point it must be noted that Goldsmith has outdone himself  the music although in parts evidently synthesized rather than orchestrated is a delight. Buy the CD and forget the film.".

Its story is superior to the last movies as is its direction. Nemesis almost certainly gets to the point and creates an atmosphere quite unlike most science fiction movies manage to pull off. Goldsmith's score fits the movie to the last note every edgy feeling emotion or action piece is caught perfectly in his remarkably original score. The acting by Stewart and Hardy dominate the screen and in my opinion sets new standards for future movies. The special effects by Digital Domain are jawdropping from time to time the possibility of an Oscar nomination here should not be overlooked. I don't want to give too much away so all I can really say is go and see it. Take the kids too they are bound to love it and find it cool at least. A film for nonfans as much as the fans themselves...Highly recommended  1010".

Nemesis is symbolic of conflict against oneself. It begins at the wedding reception of Commander Riker and Deanna Troi. This is fun but it is not capitalized upon enough. It is as if these subplots were tacked on just to give the characters something to do. Central action involves Romulans claiming to be initiating a peace offering when in fact they are plotting an attack against earth. Very clever with many plot twists and blazing action. Director Stuart Baird creates an entertaining film but it lacks character development. He previously made the mediocre action misfire Executive Decision. Patrick Stewart still holds dignity as Captain Piccard. Brent Spiner as Data demonstrates loyalty and sacrifice. Other roles are flat including Jonathan Frakes and Michael Dorn. Frakes gets hitched but from there that is pretty much his highlight. Dorn as Worf discovers that he has a zit but this is hardly an interesting development for a character of this nature. LeVar Burton plays Geordi La Forge whose identity has him wearing a special device for his sight. This is labeled as the final film in the franchise although we have been fooled with this sort of marketing before. Exquisite effects that celebrates another era in the franchise. Score 8  10".

	schema:reviewBody "The Youth of Maxim is a film driven by its raw humanity. Through the disparate events and characters in the movie the linking thread for us members of the audience is the empathy that the film creates for the main characters. Choosing to keep the plot simple worked to the film's benefit because it allowed more scenes to build the characters. In particular the introduction of Maxim and his two friends is interesting.After the brief and somewhat out of place prologue three men are introduced by having one of them call out for his friends. And of the three friends the titular characters is the fourth to appear arriving with a dog in front of him. One of them talks about his dreams Maxim arrives singing and they all enjoy each other's company. The film takes time to show emotion in its scenes and gives a view into the hearts of the characters. This allows us to see the central transformations in the characters and makes many of the scenes more powerful.One of the best moments of driving a scene by emotion is during the strike. The entire sequence relies on an implicit understanding of what all of the members are marching for and because of the events leading up to that one and because of the deliberate moments spent immediately prior to the strike the scene works tremendously well. With barely a word spoken there is conveyance of the intense emotion felt towards the cause of the grief towards the owner of the factory and towards the system that allowed the events.Outside of just plot the movie characterizes well using the actors physical movement and their voices both in dialogue and especially in song. The clearest example is inside the prison where the characters are trying to sing while they are being physically restrained by the officers there. The movie does not try to be to subtle and whether that is good or bad in the eyes of a viewer is probably the deciding factor for their enjoyment of the film.".

The plot revolves around a revolutionary underground group that spreads leaflets of mostly antitsarist slogans. Among one of the members is Maxim who is portrayed as an ideal communist hero. Maxim's character matures as the story unravels as he begins to be exposed to the reality of the workers conditions. The audience clearly see's the progress of Maxim who was at the beginning seen as an innocent ignorant peasant to his gaining of social consciousness of the reality before him. This can be seen whenever he was brought it to meet his superior who asked him if it would be okay to sell out his comrades. Also the scene where he asked the same person to help his comrade who had gotten injured working the machines but was immediately denied help and even told it was his friends fault for coming to work drunk. Considering this is a relatively dark film the directors take it upon themselves to play with the lighting in certain scenes. The boss of the factory is particularly highlighted almost to the point where he is glowing. His appearance most likely serves as this contrast between the workers. He is seen as this clean bright higher status individual while the workers have this dirty unkept lower class appearance. The same scene I mentioned early where Maxim was asking his boss for help but got rejected there was a moment where dirt was actually thrown unto him giving this direct connotation. Other individuals of higher rank are also highlighted such as the soldiers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoiler Ahead STOP NowThis was a classic case of sequel trying to live off the fervor of the original but had gone bad in horrible ways.So if you want to view this pathetic excuse for a movie stop reading now go see it then finish this slash and burn review.The movie speed was a dreadful snooze for many minutes at a time. I found myself actually more entertained looking around the theater to see if other people were doing the same. The story started out plausible and there may even be a tiniest shred of actual history to support the artistic privileges the story writers embarked on. Let me think.. Lincolns assassination and a letter from the French to the Confederate Union 3 statues of Liberty 2 identical desks Oval office and in the Queens of England's Office and Mount Rushmore IS located in South Dakota and not in South America.I have a SERIOUS beef with this Disney Production on that last one. Everybody who watched this movie left there dumber than they entered. The gullible people out there probably think there is a lake on the top or within walking distance of the top of Mount Rushmore. Even WORSE people may actually believe that an ancient Mayan culture lived in South Dakota built caverns and then transported and lined them with tons of gold. Sure why not it's a movie! The story leaped from Dad's house to the Gates' mansion to Paris to London to University of Maryland to the White House to a Presidential retreat to the Library of Congress to Mount Rushmore to a Lake on Mount Rushmore... all seemingly in a span of a day or two. I guess it is technically possible to zip around the world like that but jet lag would have surely taken its toll... yet everybody seemed fine. The one place they did not get even remotely close to was South America. Hello! The major story line leaned heavily on the Mayan civilization. WTF?Seems the story writers perhaps in response to the critics wanted to liven up the snooze screen play so they injected a ridiculous car chase. Complete with self repairing cars drifting sequences bullets at point blank range that hit everything but the target and my new favorite... using the red light camera to take a photo then getting that photo back later of Mayan writing at high speeds. Yeah... right. Ed Harris should have stayed out of this one. His performance mechanics were fine but the story writers simply didn't know what to do with him. Seemed as if the original plot had him doing more but huge chunks of character development were left on the cutting room floor.. well we can hope that. This might have been the best the writers could have mustered.Abigale was useless. Oh she had her 60 seconds of lines but that was about it. The story writers made a horribly obvious fix to the story using her. She just magically appeared in the right place she was in the States earlier and the right time without any coordination to help Benjamen sneak into the Queens office. Plausibility... Zero.Riley was cute and lovable as before. The writers tried overly hard to capitalize on this comedic charm. What the heck... he's pretty handy with an IPod and a laptop. Benjamen as a positive role model for a Disney film should go to jail. Let's count the offenses Speeding reckless driving theft trespassing destruction of property conspiracy to kidnap and kidnapping. Disney thinks this is all fine since he's the hero after all. Thanks Disney! I have no idea why the Feds were in this film. They didn't do anything until the very end... but that was only after Benjamen called them.The book was a pathetic story prop. They could have used a spoon or pile of play dough. If only the book had been used throughout the movie... Nope that would take real story writing skills.Nitpicks... 1 I doubt duplicated cell phones really allow you to receive a call in two locations at once. 2 The story title Book of Secrets relates to a book that had a total of 30 seconds relevance I am being generous here to the whole story. 3 Clich the bad guys hijack ridiculous vehicles in a high speed chase. In this case a truck loaded with kegs of beer. 4 Security in the Queens Office seems laughable. Just walk in take what you want and walk out. 5 Riley can remotely unlock security gates and set off fire alarms from a restroom. Seems the Disney group has a low opinion of British security. 6 Riley also has super human strength. He picked up a block of gold and by the look of it should have been about 400lbs. 7 Clich let's turn this spinnerlever thing and see what happens... not once.. but 5 freaking times.... yawn. 8 Hey.. didn't they have one of those rolling doors in Indiana Jones? 9 Oh sht we're all going to drown... panic!!! Let's all go to the lowest point in this crisis and speed up the drownings. What's that? A glimpse of sunlight from above? How about treading water until things fill up so you can walk out. Nope can't do that. Got to have another unnecessary plot complication to wipe out the useless bad guy.Summing up. The National Treasure Book of Secrets will join the ranks of sequel movie blunders. Story writers never made clear why chasing after this lost city of gold would prove that Gate's great great grandfather was not a Confederate collaborator. WTF is up with this lake on Rushmore and this Mayan culture. Generally the story was fragmented slow clichs everywhere gross leaps from plausibility and a disgustingly irresponsible display of story telling by Disney.".

	onyx:emotionText "Spoiler Ahead STOP NowThis was a classic case of sequel trying to live off the fervor of the original but had gone bad in horrible ways.So if you want to view this pathetic excuse for a movie stop reading now go see it then finish this slash and burn review.The movie speed was a dreadful snooze for many minutes at a time. I found myself actually more entertained looking around the theater to see if other people were doing the same. The story started out plausible and there may even be a tiniest shred of actual history to support the artistic privileges the story writers embarked on. Let me think.. Lincolns assassination and a letter from the French to the Confederate Union 3 statues of Liberty 2 identical desks Oval office and in the Queens of England's Office and Mount Rushmore IS located in South Dakota and not in South America.I have a SERIOUS beef with this Disney Production on that last one. Everybody who watched this movie left there dumber than they entered. The gullible people out there probably think there is a lake on the top or within walking distance of the top of Mount Rushmore. Even WORSE people may actually believe that an ancient Mayan culture lived in South Dakota built caverns and then transported and lined them with tons of gold. Sure why not it's a movie! The story leaped from Dad's house to the Gates' mansion to Paris to London to University of Maryland to the White House to a Presidential retreat to the Library of Congress to Mount Rushmore to a Lake on Mount Rushmore... all seemingly in a span of a day or two. I guess it is technically possible to zip around the world like that but jet lag would have surely taken its toll... yet everybody seemed fine. The one place they did not get even remotely close to was South America. Hello! The major story line leaned heavily on the Mayan civilization. WTF?Seems the story writers perhaps in response to the critics wanted to liven up the snooze screen play so they injected a ridiculous car chase. Complete with self repairing cars drifting sequences bullets at point blank range that hit everything but the target and my new favorite... using the red light camera to take a photo then getting that photo back later of Mayan writing at high speeds. Yeah... right. Ed Harris should have stayed out of this one. His performance mechanics were fine but the story writers simply didn't know what to do with him. Seemed as if the original plot had him doing more but huge chunks of character development were left on the cutting room floor.. well we can hope that. This might have been the best the writers could have mustered.Abigale was useless. Oh she had her 60 seconds of lines but that was about it. The story writers made a horribly obvious fix to the story using her. She just magically appeared in the right place she was in the States earlier and the right time without any coordination to help Benjamen sneak into the Queens office. Plausibility... Zero.Riley was cute and lovable as before. The writers tried overly hard to capitalize on this comedic charm. What the heck... he's pretty handy with an IPod and a laptop. Benjamen as a positive role model for a Disney film should go to jail.

But this movie manages to disappoint even fairly modest expectations such as those.In the end it really comes down to two problems 1 It doesn't make any sense. 2 The acting is awful.On 1 I really don't mean to nitpick on historical minutiaehell I'd be happy to suspend disbelief for two hours on stuff such as Lincoln's assassination Mayan treasures Mount Rushmore geography and all that other nonsense. No problem there. But the point of a treasure hunt movie is the ability to follow the main character in his struggle perhaps struggle with him see him figure things out and perhaps guess with him. For this to work the universe of the movie doesn't have to be consistent with the world we live in but it has to be consistent with itself. But the universe of this movie is like a great big fairy tale with the central character pulling white rabbits out of his sleeve whenever he needs them. Yes the movie tries its hand at some drama but it just doesn't work. Things go pretty smoothly for the most partinto the Queen's office out of it again oops we are being chased heck let's take a photo oh no camera ah there is a traffic camera yep and by the way can you just hack into the computer and download the pic and on to the next event same thing with the oval office then kidnapping the president. While the hero thus McGyvers his way through an increasingly preposterous story the whole thing just starts to feel stale and you get the feeling that it might have been better if he had not stolen the Constitution in part 1 so the writers would not have to top this. The villain is lame and for the most part useless not to speak of somewhat incoherent I am not going last so I might as well go firstsay what?.None of the story really makes the slightest bit of sense including the motivation of the hero to clear the name of his greatgreatgrandfatherthat's why he risks his life the life of friends and loved ones not to speak of his own good name by kidnapping a president!. It's all just a steaming pile of nonsense aimed at people who really do not give a damn about story and stuff but who just want to see a lot of movementaction hightech gobbledygook explosions and cheap patriotism.However as bad as the story was 2 the bad acting was even worse. Everybody in this movie was disappointing even a nonactor like Kruger. Her career should end with this movie over out finito. She cannot do it and it's not been for a lack of opportunity. If you had a consistent record of failure like hers in any regular job you'd find yourself with a lot of spare time very soon. But even the real actors here just make you cringeGreenwood Harris Mirren Voight they all deliver horrible performances that seem to betray their lack of passion and their paycheck mentality. We know they can act we have seen it before but they just don't in this movie. Keitel comes away without much harmhis part is so tiny there just isn't a lot of opportunity to screw things up too badly.Why oh why do they keep making this fluff? Because for some reason we attend it. We go there drop our cash and watch this nonsense. I am guilty as charged. But if you haven't seen it you and your money can still make a difference.

Let me set the stage for you The theater was pretty packed for a New Year's day 800 p.m. showing. The audience was in a good mood to start. I could feel the energy with the laughter coming from the Goofy cartoon that preceded this dreck of a film. The group synergy was great and it lasted until about halfway through the film. Once we all realized what a complete waste of time and money this movie was we immediately stopped laughing at Justin Bartha's quips and started laughing at Diane Kruger's acting... which was far more humorous. Seriously the only thing she was good for was that scene in the oval office where she was wearing that skimpy little dress. The movie was full of lousy punchlines delivered by an even lousier combined effort from some Alist actors. Based on the first National Treasure movie I didn't expect this to be a masterpiece in cinematic eloquence but I did expect the likes of Voight Mirren Keitel and Harris to give a little more than this. Harris' performance was particularly awful mainly because of the complexity of the way his character was written. First he's a shrewd southern business man who wants nothing more than to find this city of gold. Then he turns into somewhat of a hero and sacrifices himself. WTF?!? Then he says All I wanted to do was find the city and help you to clear your name. That's ALL HE WANTED?!? Again WTF?!? This coming from the same character who said no more than two scenes prior Well if I'm not going last then I might as well go first when it came to a perilous situation. Uhhh ookkaaayyyy. Mirren's performance wasn't all that bad. Her character was poorly introduced and her first scene when arguing with Voight's character was pretty hard to swallow. Keitel's performance was okay as well but I think that is only because he didn't have enough time on screen for the writers to screw it up too. Honestly the movie as a whole was not worth the time. It was so far fetched that it really just became incredibly unbelievable in every way. Government agencies infiltrated at the ease of entering a WalMart International government Web sites hacked like they were a link from Google. The Secret Service as inept as a group of security guards at a Foghat concert. This was just lame. Poorly written poorly acted and a poor choice on my behalf. Should've known better.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's so much wrong about this pitiful film I don't know where to start! As an adult I found National Treasure Book of Secrets the most boring movie I have seen on the big screen all year. I had to use every ounce of will power not to walk out of the theater and demand my money back!Before the movie even started I was forced to sit through an infuriatingly dopey Disney cartoon which was nothing more than a notsosubtle commercial for expensive T.V. and stereo equipment. It went on and on and on. Finally I had to close my eyes in order not to get overly aggravated! Wow! How low Disney has sunk to make a buck.The story was written to the level of a 10 year old! There's close to nothing to entertain an adult. It's a blatant and poorly done ripoff of Raiders of the Lost Ark.I can deal with a story that's preposterous if it's enjoyable. But kidnapping the president by walking him through a tunnel. How exciting! Finding a Central or South American city hidden thousands of miles away in the Badlands of South Dakota! Yikes! how insulting to all the Plains Indian tribes can you get? Or how dumb do you think the American movie going audience is? Can at least a modicum of reality seep into the story?The special affects are so trite! The props look so fake that I thought they were using an amusement park to film this movie. I was waiting for a water slide to show up any moment! The acting was pitiful! Nicholas Cage had such a painful look throughout the movie I though he must either be embarrassed or ashamed of himself for stooping so low. I realize actors need to make a living. But he of all people can pick and choose his film projects. The only good thing I could think of is the scene with President and a cameo of a Hillary Clinton lookalike at the President's birthday party. Since the Hillary cameo was having such a good time at the party it can be assumed the Democrats won the 2008 election!".

There's close to nothing to entertain an adult. It's a blatant and poorly done ripoff of Raiders of the Lost Ark.I can deal with a story that's preposterous if it's enjoyable. But kidnapping the president by walking him through a tunnel. How exciting! Finding a Central or South American city hidden thousands of miles away in the Badlands of South Dakota! Yikes! how insulting to all the Plains Indian tribes can you get? Or how dumb do you think the American movie going audience is? Can at least a modicum of reality seep into the story?The special affects are so trite! The props look so fake that I thought they were using an amusement park to film this movie. I was waiting for a water slide to show up any moment! The acting was pitiful! Nicholas Cage had such a painful look throughout the movie I though he must either be embarrassed or ashamed of himself for stooping so low. I realize actors need to make a living. But he of all people can pick and choose his film projects. The only good thing I could think of is the scene with President and a cameo of a Hillary Clinton lookalike at the President's birthday party. Since the Hillary cameo was having such a good time at the party it can be assumed the Democrats won the 2008 election!";

Truth be told the concept of hunting for Cibola was a decent concept too. I'll also give Helen Mirren some props for being a bit of an interesting character.The bad The problems I had with the first National Treasure are even more prevalent in this one. Here you have a father Voight son Cage and a museum curator Kruger all for protecting history and yet have a habit of destroying historical artifacts. Fold up the Declaration of Independence? Sure. Throw an example of rare Native American hieroglyphs into the river? Yep you bet.Of course before tossing the hieroglyphs it took a 5 minute car chase where nothing happens except repeated shots of a certain automobile maker's logo being pictured on every single turn and captured by the traffic camera.Also it makes me feel safe knowing that the Queen's study the Oval Office and the Library of Congress are so easy to break into. And if I ever get the chance to kidnap the president it's nice to know he's the kind of guy who will allow me unescorted and unrestricted access to see the nation's secrets. Yep that Book of Secrets the title of the movie takes up as much screen and plot time as the opening credits... and much less than the car chase. But it provides a convenient segue to a sequel around page 47 of the book of secrets. Maybe it was the plot summary? So now off to Mt. Rushmore which was built to obscure some landmarks which weren't hinted at in any of the clues on a map which also wasn't in any of the clues nor found... OK so our intrepid adventurers are in the middle of the Black Hills though it's not quite clear whether they're actually on top of Mt. Rushmore or not. Let's assume they are on Mt. Rushmore narrowing the search area from around 600 sq miles the area of the Black Hills to Mt. Rushmore which is a few square miles. So they become enlightened when they realize water turns rocks darker... not to mention clothes and pretty much everything else Lo and behold they happen to find the exact spot. Some puzzle solving huh? They're now on their way to Cibola. That's assuming of course that no one had read a 6th grade history textbook about how Cibola wasn't that far north.Then after some funky physics on a huge stone platform built inside a carvedout mountain by Stone Age tech Native Americans a bit of flooding one of our defenders of history rips up a 5 ft by 5 ft gold brick out of the ground withonehand and tosses it in his backpack.Seriously this movie made Sahara look plausible even if you hadn't read the book.Enough about the plot... as far as acting goes I remember a time when Nicholas Cage was the future of acting. I just don't see how a guy can go from 8mm or Lord of War to movies like this and Ghost Rider. You could almost hear the drum roll before and after Justin Bartha delivered one of his zillion oneliners but it was pretty silent. Kruger's character behaves exactly opposite of how an educated lady who has an exboyfriend break into her house should... then again considering how roughly she treated the Declaration of Independence in the first movie I shouldn't be surprised about her makeout session on the floor of the Oval Office. The one I feel worst for is Ed Harris whose character had multiple personalities and all of them were bland. It was almost like the writers were trying so hard not to use a villain similar to the first National Treasure... but then they'd occasionally realize they needed a villain to keep the plot moving. Ed Harris should know better than to take these kinds of roles... maybe that's why he dropped his accent by the end of the movie.If you made it this far perhaps you think I obsessed too much about the plot holes the blatant disrespect of historical artifacts. That should be a sign that the movie did not catch my attention. Hey the movie 300 isn't historically accurate but not only was it entertaining it also didn't try to pass itself off as legit with monsters and goldenskinned Persian emperors.The scary thing about a movie like National Treasure 2 is that people will watch it and think that's how historians archaeologists and even private treasure hunters act. They'll probably spout off the same clich oneliners too.".

	schema:reviewBody "Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer have dived yet again into their secret book to pull out a map that leads to treasures of vast fortune. No not a legendary city of gold but the riches that come from storming the box office. National Treasure Book of Secrets is everything a big budget adventure sequel should be. A bigger story and better action help make Book of Secrets a surprising end of the year crowd pleaser.Setting out to clear his ancestor's name Ben Gates is back in treasurehunting action to unequivocally prove that his family had nothing to do with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. With his usual cohorts Riley Abigail and his father Patrick Gates the trio must race against the clock to stop a new enemy Mitch Wilkinson from uncovering an ancient treasure before they can or forever risk the Gates name being associated with the death of one of America's greatest presidents.A hit for Nicholas Cage has been long overdue. Spanning nearly two full years making dud after dud Cage is back and in good form even if a sequel to the massively successful National Treasure was a safe nobrainer. Book of Secrets is just as outlandishly fun as its predecessor oneupping the original by having the principle characters break into Buckingham Palace and even kidnap the President of the United States! Kudos have to be handed over to screenwriters Cormac and Marianne Wibberley for crafting such a big adventure yet staying true to the themes that director John Turtletaub and company established with the first National Treasure. Even though their new adventure takes the entourage of talented character actor's across the globe Book of Secrets manages to keep this treasure hunt a uniquely American tale. Just wait until you see where our government hid one of the most famed and sought after treasures of all time! Upping the production value from the last film Book of Secrets is crammed packed with puzzles car chases and exciting action sequences to help keep the film filled with riveting adventure from opening to closing frame. John Turtletaub has again done a great job of keeping the manic pace of the film frantic and fun even if there are a few solitary moments when the picture starts to feel the weight of its lengthy running time.While the returning cast again does a stellar job continuing their characters newcomers to the series Ed Harris and Hellen Mirren are welcomed additions to the story. While Harris is perfectly suited for the role his character Mitch Wilkinson seems to be the only weak link to the story. Wilkinson seems like a very torn individual. One minute the dastardly villain is opening fire on our heroes vowing to end their lives to get at the treasure and the next he is helping them! Luckily the picture's best moments don't hinge on confrontations between Cage and Harris. The real fun of National Treasure has always been watching as the characters solve some of history's most challenging puzzles. Book of Secrets is assuredly no different keeping audiences on their toes and tantalizing them with conspiracy theories that will likely continue the franchise forward.Between massive Pirate's plunder and uncovering buried National Treasure 2007 aims to be a financially lucrative year for Disney's live action department. With surprises at every turn Book of Secrets has established National Treasure as a viable and fun adventure franchise making the film a must see holiday blockbuster that the whole family can enjoy.Joe Russo".

	schema:headline " Interesting...I liked It but something feels missing...";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all National Treasure the first one is one of my favorite movie ever. I love history specifically American history and it had clever references and facts about American history that lead to finding the treasure in a way that is not predictable. That being said I felt something was missing in National Treasure Book of Secrets. It almost felt like the writers could not think of any new clever clues for Nicolas Cage to solve or more suspense without action scenes.First lets look at the positives. This movie was very welldone. The acting was as superb as the first Nicolas Cage and Justin Bartha are amazing. It was very believable. Also the action scenes are excellent and full of invigorating suspense. The scene near the unexpected end where they had to balanced the steel block thing in the cave was terrific. All the action scenes were awesome right out of an Indiana Jones movie. Another thing I liked was the ironic humor and sarcasm used by Nicolas Cage's character and other characters throughout the movie that gave it a light fun feel. With interesting history references and a brilliant score by Trevor Rabin what could be wrong with it?You may not agree with me. But I felt that the ending and a few other scenes were rushed. For example they spent literally about five minutes in Paris both finding and figuring out the clue. After that they moved on to London they spent about 15 minutes there 5 of them were spent finding the clue. It all felt rushed which tended to confuse me. And the ending definitely did not satisfy me. It was too sudden and I felt it was incomplete even though the movie was over two hours long. As I think back to some of the scenes in the beginning and middle of the movie I forget why I included negatives because it was so brilliant and I loved it as much as the first one. But then I remember the ending. it just didn't satisfy like the last movie did. I can't explain the nice feeling the first movie gave me its what the perfect movie gives you I guess. Anyway I would recommend this to anyone who has scene the first one and anyone who would like a good crimeactionadventure flick with excellent acting with lovable and believable characters. It's a great movie it just didn't live up to my expectations or the original's".

	schema:headline " National Treasure Book of Secrets is a lot of hush hush halfwitted fluff!";
	schema:reviewBody "The first National Treasure 2004 movie qualified as a predictable potboiler that was fast furious frivolous fun. The sequel National Treasure Book of Secrets is just plain frivolous. Nicolas Cage heads up a seasoned cast including Jon Voight Ed Harris Helen Mirren Bruce Greenwood and Harvey Keitel that looks like they had a blast. If watching other folks have a heck of a lot of fun on the bigscreen turns you on then National Treasure Book of Secrets will delight you. Unfortunately National Treasure Book of Secrets lacks virtually everything that good actionadventure movies boast. You won't find many suspenseful scenes that are realistic enough to make you squirm at the edge of your seat. Everything here resembles a carefully contrived amusement park thrill ride. When all is said and done the heroes villains and sidekicks engage in an endless game of musical chairs. In fact the entire movie looks like an episode taken from producer Jerry Bruckheimer's CBSTV series The Amazing Race. Basically the principals scramble breathlessly across Europe on a harebrained scavenger hunt for clues that bring them into contact with several famous places or highranking people such as the President of the United States. Moreover you know that nobody is going to get die or get seriously hurt except perhaps the dastardly devious villain. Worse you know a movie like National Treasure Book of Secrets is secondrate when the cartoon shown before it is more amusing than anything in this rated PG 130 actionadventure comedy of errors. Right the best thing about National Treasure Book of Secrets is the Walt Disney Studios' cartoon about Goofy and his arduous antics to assemble a highdefinition television set within the confines of his modest home.National Treasure Book of Secrets should have been subtitled Books of Secrets. Villainous Mitch Wilkinson Ed Harris of Apollo 13 uses a missing page from presidential assassin John Wilkes Booth's diary to implicate an ancestor of Benjamin Franklin Gates Nicolas Cage of Next and his father Patrick Gates Jon Voight of Heat as the mastermind behind the Lincoln's assassination. Naturally our overgrown Hardy Boys heroes don't take kindly to Wilkinson's smear tactics. They embark on a race for clues that will clear their ancestor of this accusation. Some audiences especially around these parts may take offense at the way that National Treasure director Jon Turteltaub and scribes Cormac  Marianne Wibberley try to rekindle the flames of Southern hatred with a plot gimmick that involves a secret Confederate society. Along the way Ben breaks into restricted parts of Buckingham Palace with his estranged archivist girlfriend Abigail Chase Diane Kruger of the first National Treasure and their computer savvy comicrelief sidekick Riley Poole Justin Bartha of Failure to Launch so that they can ransack antique desks and then run rings around British security personnel. At another point Ben and company make monkeys out of the U.S. Secret Service when our protagonist kidnaps the President Bruce Greenwood who played JFK in the Kevin Costner thriller Thirteen Days during a ceremony at George Washington's estate at Mount Vernon. Ben has to separate the President from his bodyguards long enough to learn the whereabouts of the Chief Executive's Book of Secrets. This apocryphal reference book about nation's paranoid secrets is concealed in the Library of Congress. Eventually the trail takes Ben and company to the Black Hills of South Dakota and Mount Rushmore. Along the way Ben's father Patrick has to reconcile with Ben's mother his exwife Emily Appleton Helen Mirren of Prime Suspect who helps them decipher obscure Native American symbols. These reconciliations between Ben and Abigail as well as Patrick and Emily never generate much mirth.National Treasure Book of Secrets isn't half as good as its predecessor. Moreover some of its scenes have been cloned from other recent movies. The backwards car chase in London looks suspiciously like the backwards car chase from the slightly better but just as objectionable The Da Vinci Code. The writers took the dialogue almost wordforword about those paranoid national secrets straight from another Jerry Bruckheimer blockbuster The Rock 1996 with Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage. The biggest setpiece occurs at the climax of the action with our heroes heroine sidekick and villain atop an implausible giant spinning waffle iron contraption that looks like something out of the 1980 Flash Gordon extravaganza. What few historic facts and stories that come up in the plot could be found in the trivia section of any college textbooks especially the phrase about mud. Altogether if you're looking for lightweight disposable fare to forget about the moment you hit the exit door National Treasure Book of Secrets is superb. The first National Treasure movie coined over 347 million worldwide so it was inevitable that Bruckheimer would produce another installment.".

Treasure hunter Ben Gates tries to clean its name by looking for an ancient treasure. The first half of the movie is kinda slow and even tiresome too much talking and very little action. But it gets better on the second part towards to the end. The cast is excellent Nicolas Cage in a role he knows very well Jon Voight as Cage fathers is very convincing Ed Harris is the bad guy that the only thing he wants is to find the treasure and keep it to himself Harvey Keitel as an FBI agent wit a brief but convincing performance and Helen Mirren as Nicola's mother with a good and even funny performance. Although this movie isn't the greatest thing it is very enjoyable and entertaining perfect to spend some time with the family.".

How did the Queen of England know about some vital abstract part of a Native American folklore when they couldn't even read the symbols on the planks?!

I didn't see the first National Treasure so I thought I'd check this one out. Oh man was I sorry I'd wasted the time.Let's leave aside the fact that Nicholas Cage should not be doing this kind of role. I don't think anyone could have made this awful script work including Harrison Ford in his Indiana Jones prime. This is as a matter of fact probably the first film featuring Ed Harris that I didn't like. Wait did I say didn't like? I HATED IT!! There wasn't even a hint of real suspense. The Cage character never once showed that he might actually be working at anything. Like an adolescent fantasy he simply figures out every last little clue no matter how obscure in a matter of a minute or so.Here is the spoiler which pretty much sums up the absolute stupidity of this movie for me. After wending his way with all his costars through the Black Mountains to find a lost Aztec city of gold and I can't for the life of me understand why an Aztec city is in a mountain in North America! spending a good deal of his time immersed in water he gets out and makes a cell phone call! Good God I want to know where he got a cell phone that could spend that much time under water and still work!! The movie did have this going for it. I have seen some really bad movies and still found something to recommend them. This was the first movie in a long time that actually left me feeling embarrassed for being in the theater.".

	schema:reviewBody "National Treasure Book of Secrets will always be known as the film that prevented Helen Mirren from meeting Queen Elizabeth after the success of The Queen. I mean really I would have made the same choice because this film is truly high art. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the first installment for its poorman's Indiana Jones feel mixed with glossy effects and convoluted plot lines Bruckheimerisms as I like to call them and for the most part had fun with this one. Well that is until the discovery was complete then the film just dragged on and on for what seemed like hours. This is a Disney film people you know they will find the treasure and all will be well with the world. Therefore all the intrigue and the discoveries to find the location of their desire complete with massively annoying cross cuts between four different locales and ten different characters every five minutes was totally subverted by the ending's adventure nonsense with no stakes because we all know how it would turn out. There were two things going for it though I became real nostalgic for Legends of the Hidden Temple and found out that yes Lyle Lovett is still alive.I give director Jon Turteltaub and screenwriters The Wibberleys credit for coming up with some real interesting set pieces and situations for our adventurers to partake in. Weaving the Lincoln assassination with ancient Native American lore and United States historical mythology and rumor is quite a feat and it is successfully handled in my opinion. What goes wrong here is the whole mentality that sequels need to be bigger and better. The first film achieved a sort of balance with its amount of characters but this one just goes too far. We have to now work in the President and our hero's mother who just happens to be one of a handful of people that can decipher the language needed to complete their quest not to mention throwing Harvey Keitel a bone by giving him five minutes of screen time just so we have continuity with a friendship from the previous story. Honestly while I enjoyed National Treasure I never asked for a part two and I don't think too many people did. Unfortunately however it appears we will probably be seeing a part three in the future if the setup here means anything.The movie is if nothing else a good time. I admit to being a big Nicolas Cage fan and enjoy his overthetop shenanigansthey are in full force here and I loved the scene at Buckingham Palace that showcased them. Also Justin Bartha is priceless as the hapless and underappreciated partner. His expressions and oneliners really add a muchneeded dimension here. The rest of the cast is adequate if very underused. There are a lot of familiar faces with thankless roles and many famous ones with little to do. Diane Kruger looks gorgeous as usual but her role is more female in distress than really adding anything necessary to finding the treasure unless you count watering rocks.So in the end this film is going to be huge regardless of quality. If you liked the first you will have a good time. It is not an Oscar winner or any Nobel Prize winning commentary it's just a good oldfashioned mindless romp. As far as actionadventure goes you could do much worse. With some great laughs and some really fascinating connections from history you may actually learn something on the journey. Never preaching its intelligence you are allowed to glean nuggets of truth at the same time as the characters that are still in the dark do. Fun is fun and as far as that goes this one succeeds despite the fact that it doesn't in any other cinematic category.".

	schema:reviewBody "This time around in National Treasure Book of Secrets Benjamin Gates Nicholas Cage and his father Patrick Jon Voight exonerate the good name of Great Grandfather Gates for the heinous assassination coup of Abraham Lincoln. Ed Harris's Mitch Wilkinson makes this startling allegation along with possessing incriminating evidence of a long held family letter. Also in prescribed convoluted fashion clearing the Gates family name explicably leads to the search for the mythical City of Gold thought to be built by Native American Ancestors. Go figure. Clues to The City of Gold are uncovered from the desks of the Queen of England and the Oval Office itself. The key to The City of Gold and the Lincoln Conspiracy is concealed in the ubiquitous Book of Secretsan urban legend of sorts. The Book of Secrets originated in the Hayes Administration and consequently handed down to each succeeding President. Apparently this Book documents all of our National Secrets running the gamut from Area 51 to the final Warren Commission Report. To obtain The Book of Secrets Ben must kidnap the President of the United States. No problem.Director Jon Turteltaub's National Treasure Book of Secrets takes a while to throttle into overdrive and it is the story set up that is most captivating. Book of Secrets has one of the most complex writing credits involving The Wibberleys among at least 4 other writers. This kluge of writers wildly veers in story coherence however they context some of the most amazing facts from American history. Or at least I think they do. Then again this is an entertaining action movie so pointing out this failing is rather pointless.Personally the highlight of the movie was not the chase car scenes or the deadly balancing stone platform rather the conversation between Gates and the awesome Bruce Greenwood as the President in the hidden tunnels of Mount Vernon. Cage and Greenwood are compelling and smart in their discussion of The Book of Secrets. And as my bud Peter pointed out there is perhaps a clue leading to the movie's sequel. The rest of Book of Secrets is cookie cutter action albeit excellently executed. The acting is impeccable. Joining Oscar winners Cage and Voight is Helen Mirren as Professor Emily Appleton who is Ben's mother. The scenes with Voight and Mirren are classic and amazing.Returning in Book of Secrets are Diane Kruger as Abigail Chase and Justin Bartha as Riley Poole. Abigail Chase and Ben apparently did not live happily ever after since National Treasure. We learn that Abigail has asked Ben to move out of their estate. Riley suffers an income tax debacle since obtaining his share of the last treasure. He has written a book of his exploits but still remains in the shadow of big Ben. However all band together to clear the Gates family name and determine the location of the mysterious City of Gold. Cage Voight Kruger and Bartha are good here but do not lend any insight or depth to their characters. Again this may not have been a priority for this movie. Cage has the right balance of smart ass and hero that works. He does so with ease and humor. Jon Voight and Helen Mirren nearly steal the movie.National Treasure Book of Secrets will not win any award. However it is a wild ride very entertaining and visually stunning. Yes it is needlessly convoluted. Just enjoy the ride.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review National Treasure Book of Secrets";
	schema:reviewBody "If I may be able to conjure up conspiracy theories of my own then I will attempt to hypothesis how National Treasure came about to debut on the big screen based on opportunities which presented itself at the right time. First the popularity of Dan Brown's controversial The Da Vinci Code which was made into a movie of its own but took a tad too long in doing so. Topping the bestseller charts around the world it made Hollywood execs sit up and realize that wild goose chases and solving riddles and clues do make an interesting workable formula. Coupled by the fact that the Indiana Jones trilogy at the time probably will not have another sequel see the light of day then the onus is on crafting a tale based on controversies with Indy Jones tendencies and chances are a new winner will be born.Hence National Treasure in the year end of 2004 which made a decent dent in the box office starring Nicolas Cage as an Indy like clone Benjamin Gates embroiled in a mystery of the Templar's treasure with sidekick Riley Poole Justin Bartha as the tech wizard necessary to assist him while at the same time romancing Abigail Chase Diane Kruger who joins his band of treasure seekers against her wishes. The Indy references don't just stop here they extend to having a Henry Jones resemblance in Jon Voight as dad Patrick Gates. If you were to deck Cage in a fedora whip and gun the references will be just too blatant.But let's not get ahead of ourselves. The important question is is the sequel Book of Secrets as good as or can be accredited with the rare accolade of being better than the original? Well in all honesty it's still an entertaining ride as this time we go around the world OK so perhaps just Paris and London versus the original story being UScentric. However like the first installment the material clues and riddles are still quite US history heavy so if you're well versed with certain characters brought to life early in the movie or events thanks to paying attention during history lessons then yes Book of Secrets will give you an additional boost in being able to identify with it. Otherwise don't fret as the casual movie goer with popcorn in hand will definitely not feel lost.The narrative and plot still feel a little staged and rigged for convenience and run time of course as one event will inevitably lead to the next and to the inevitable ending like how CSI solves crime within 45 minutes sans ads but they're still a lot of fun watching how the characters go through the motion in believing that they're onto something really big. While the first had a lot of puzzles to solve which kept some of us guessing and playing along as well this time round the number of riddles have been reduced significantly and signs of Mission Impossible creeping in as our band of treasure hunters seek to perform the impossible pertaining to levels of security guarding their mark.In an excuse to make the sequel we have Ben Gates and GATESENIOR reuniting to clear the good name of their ancestor who's recently accused of being a coconspirator or even mastermind behind the assassination of US President Abramham Lincoln. And of course help comes in the form of Abigail who's now estranged from Gates trusty tech sidekick with the complementary witty lines Riley and his red Ferarri and now joined by Ben's mom Emily Appleton played by Helen Mirren who's in the movie to contrast her relationship with Patrick to that between Ben and Abigail.However we're not really interested in whimsical attempts to add depth to characters are we? Sure they have their issues with one another and with Ed Harris' Mitch Wilkinson being the token and very bland bad guy wanting to make his mark on history the focus more often than not is to shift to the next big stunt  chase sequence. Like the first movie one of the highlights touted in the trailer involves the art of balancing which unfortunately was already done in the first movie. Don't you just hate repeated stunts? And toward the end I can't help but to compare it to Jackie Chan's The Myth which in itself was somewhat of a treasure hunter movie involving the elixir of life We're still stuck with gold here though.And add to that Harvey Keitel's FBI agent Sadusky the office of the most powerful man in the world and teases from the Book of Secrets we've got ourselves a handful being squeezed within 2 hours. Not to forget Nicolas Cage's absolutely horrendous haircut the final verdict is that it's a fairly decent year end blockbuster which primed itself for yet another sequel courtesy of page 47 of the titular book if the box office numbers prove favourable.".

Instead this movie is a perfect example of a sugarcoated adventure for family viewing in a lazy Saturday night in DVD in pijamas snacking microwave popcorn.The plot is weak and far from plausible. There are the iconic characters the smart hero and his lovehate girlfriend the funny hero's assistant the divorced hero's parents the bad but not so bad guy the good cop and so on. It's too much clich for a single movie for allowing it to be a good one.This definitely isn't a Top 10 adventure movie. It's OK for viewing with the kids and just it.".

Secondly who left the clues anyway if no one remembered where the treasure is hence the hundreds of years to find it again?Then  how come over the years clues were added again to a treasure no one knows the location of?And how can you make a clue if you're not privy to the other clues or other stories and references that Gates Cage later somehow connected?Lastly you'd think there would be some decoy or false clues as well.Since the Masons left clues in a bunch of old monuments all you have to do is walk around and dig behind every Mason symbol you find with a pocket knife.Now for other problems oh where to start?Okay  the chase scene  You have this ancient piece of wood clue and you trust a traffic cam to pick up a picture of it in high zoomable resolution. I wouldn't. Then you expect the kid to hack right into their system.Speaking of that how the heck does this kid hack into the most secure systems in the world using a crappy Mac notebook and some wires taped to tiles?How do they instantly get detailed schematics and blueprints to every building they need to get into? Why would they post those details somewhere on their sites anyway?The Oval Office  again  one of the most secure locations on this planet and they get some White House flunky to take them in there THEN  He doesn't think looking for an earring all around the room is ridiculous. You'd think she'd lost it earlier. How does a earring fly across the room and under a desk? Then the magic box desk  The flunky doesn't seem to hear all the locks and tumblers snapping up and down? Oh that's right because he was getting kissed by the girl which didn't seem to arouse any suspicion in itself maybe something else though.I won't even go into the Kidnap the President part  I was slapping my forehead at that point.The clues  Geez  so vague but then Gates just steps away for a second and figures it all out correctly. I mean you can look at anything a thousand different ways. How do you even know you had all the clues? Where iswas the chief clue keeper tracker anyway?You can't make a sensible clue based treasure hunt without one.Again if all these people from different walks and times have clues to offer then wouldn't that prove somebody or somebodies knew where the treasure was? So why is it lost? How did the kid fly that helicopter like that without looking half the time? Also of course the copter had a high def camera on board as well. How did he get the helicopter in the first place? WalMart in France? Yes I know you have to go to a higher end RC store than that. But still. Guess they took it on the plane with them.How come the President can not only pardon all the federal offenses that occurred they also didn't have to answer to any of the destruction they caused everywhere else either?The last points are just for measure. I could have sat here all day but I didn't take notes while watching all the ridiculous plot pieces. There are too many to recall.".

	schema:headline " It's no secret. National Treasure Book of Secrets was not as good as the first movie. Regardless it was still a fun watch.";
	schema:reviewBody "When it comes to unnecessary sequels. This film directed by Jon Turtetaub  produced by Jerry Bruckheimer takes the prize. It didn't really need to be made. Everybody in the original film 2004's 'National Treasure' truly did lived happy ever after. At least that was the climax of that Disney movie made it seems. However I guess that wasn't the case as this sequel has the crew of renowned treasure hunter Benjamin Gates Nicolas Cage partake yet another adventure. This time in order to erase Gate's family's ties of being a conconspirator in President Lincoln's assassination. Without spoiling the movie too much while the action sequences were compelling. The conflict  drive for those scenes seemed a little forced. Look I can understand some people ostracizing Ben if one of his immediate family members done something wrong somewhat recently but judging his character over something his ancestors did over 100 years ago is really stretching it. It's like hating an innocent modern day American because his or her family once own slaves in the 19th century. They have no control on who they would be related to. Even if Gate's forefather was indeed one of the conconspirators I really doubt most Americans would bat an eye to continue to hold a social stigma against the family. If some of them did at least they would be somewhat understandable  sympatric as there are plenty of examples of living descendants of notorious figures from the past just trying to live life as patriotic Americans. One such example is Edwin Booth the reallife brother of assassin John Wilkes Booth. He just continued to do his job becoming one of the most famous Shakespearean actor of the 19th century following Lincoln's assassination. He was so beloved by the public he even befriended Lincoln's son Robert at a very early age. Likewise most people would see past tragic events like that as 'water under the bridge'. Surely it wouldn't make any current generation of Gates seem anymore unAmerican. Nevertheless I do understand why Ben was driven by a fierce desire to clear their family name of infamy even if it's highly unhealthy exaggerating behavior. The value of good reputation is characterized as something worth preserving even going to great lengths to protect and honor. However it's not something worth risking life  limb for if the grumbles are from a bygone era. I find it highly ridiculousness that Gates is willing to break multiply federal and international laws just to prove long dead 19th century people wrong. Honestly besides one out of place kid it seems like the majority of people in the film don't really care that he was related to a coconspirator if they continue to invite him into White House Buckingham Palace and other famous social events. People still acclaim him for his treasure hunting skills than anything else during the course of this movie. His name isn't really cover in mud as part of the film make it out to be. Because of that I find his action to be jarring. Like really what was his goal anyways? How does finding a long lost city of gold absolve his forbearer from the crimes he was accuse of? The movie made the quest seem a bit too vague but if it's my guess it seem like the crew bribe the government with enough gold that the federals look away or cover up theirs past crimes. If anything Gates  his crew seem more like the villain than the heroes. Their willingness to lie manipulate assume false identities and trespass is bit troublesome. Nevertheless moviegoers will surely just be tempted to dismiss their actions completely because they were made in the service of an honorable endand because the Gates family didn't intend to mean no harm. Still I found their good nature request to be somewhat morally flawed. After all it could had easily been resolved in more quiet way but I guess we wouldn't have a movie if it was that simple. Regardless of that the crew is mostly still mostly likeable. I just didn't like the subplot romantic argumentum elements that came with most of them. I found it highly annoying. Still most of the performers did fine work here even new comers like Ed Harris as the antagonist Mitch Wilkinson. The villain was a huge improvement from the first movie. At least Mitch was murky  creepy. Still his heel to face turn in the climax was really jarring. The only flaw in what was otherwise a compelling ending. Along with that the music by composer Trevor Rabin really adds to the suspense of that sequence. I love how the puzzles  heist elements wasn't as predictable. You really didn't know the twist  turns the clues would led. It made the film a little more fun. This movie prove that smart entertaining live action adventure PG films are still possible even without a lot of harsh language violence  sex appeal to prompt people to take an interest in history. Still it is necessary to suspend your disbelief at times as nobody should take this movie as a legit American History lecture. After all it is an action adventure film that claims that France  Britain knew about a Mesoamerican City of Gold in South Dakota for years  still gave up those lands to the United States for cheap in 1803 with the Louisiana Purchase. Despite the imperfections with reallife history  its many plotholes. I do have to say the movie was compelling enough to look past its flaws. It really got you into the sense of treasure hunting. Hopefully a third installment will one day come to fruition. Overall With 4th of July celebrations just around the corner as of this writing. This is one sequel worth watching on Independence Day. It was a blast.".

After all it is an action adventure film that claims that France  Britain knew about a Mesoamerican City of Gold in South Dakota for years  still gave up those lands to the United States for cheap in 1803 with the Louisiana Purchase. Despite the imperfections with reallife history  its many plotholes. I do have to say the movie was compelling enough to look past its flaws. It really got you into the sense of treasure hunting. Hopefully a third installment will one day come to fruition. Overall With 4th of July celebrations just around the corner as of this writing. This is one sequel worth watching on Independence Day. It was a blast.";

Zeffirelli said in an interview that he was changing it so the love of the two teens was mutual and not onesided and that I believe was his mistake. The book is not about love at all it's about obsession. Readers have complained that we don't meet Jade until halfway through the book and she hardly seems to merit all that fixation but that's the point. It's all in David's head.In the book when they reunite he's trying to make them have sex exactly the way they did years ago. The opening pages show him looking through their window feeling banished from this wonderful perfect family but he ignores all the clues that they are nothing of the kind when he sets the fire they can't cope because they are all on acid in what the mother later describes as a lastditch effort to bring the family together. The mother watches her daughter have sex in order to live vicariously because her own marriage is falling apart. The father sneaks stimulants into his daughter's food because he believes in homeopathy. The brother we later learn brought David home as he brought other classmates home mostly to impress them with how cool and hip the family is and then dump them when he gets bored we learn later from an old classmate David meets on the plane that the brother did the same thing to him. David is obviously emotionally fragile to begin with but these horrible poseurs are exactly the people he doesn't need to meet. They exploit him as an audience for their Coolness Quotient and then dump him without regard for what they might be doing to him. He's a psycho alrightbut if he weren't he might see through them which he obviously hasn't done even by the end of the book.Little of this was conveyed in the movie which also did not keep Spencer's late'60s setting which would have made the Butterfields' boho weekendhippie aspirations more understandable. A lot of suburban people were trying to prove how groovy they were back then look at mainstream magazines like Ladies' Home Journal or Newsweek and you'll see articles on open marriages the pill and symbolic meanings of Beatles Album covers. The respective talents or lack thereof of Shields and Hewitt have been the subject of much debate and jeering but I don't think much could be done with a script that jettisoned the essential unreliable narrator aspect of the book i.e. what David thinks he's telling us about the Butterfields and himself is not necessarily what we decide to believe after we've heard some of the details. All we have left is the starcrossed lover thing and that has been done by Zeffirelli himself in RJ and modernized in West Side Story. Without Shakespeare's words or Bernstein's music or any novel element or perspective it's hard to justify doing it again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay okay....just a little bit of clarification here for the naysayers who don't like this film OBVIOUSLY folks who never had an intense first love in their teen years  and you DON'T need a burning house to have felt that....1. WHY DID David BURN DOWN THE HOUSE? A lot of commenters have said they don't know why David burned down the house. It was not his INTENTION to burn down the house. David's friend played by Tom Cruise in his acting debut  which I thought would have made his lines more memorable to most folks! explains how a friend or it may have been his brother wanted to get a girl's attention that had broken up with him. He lit some wet newspapers on her front porch which smoked like hell  NO FIRE. The friend or brother then yelled to everyone in the house that there was a fire and got everyone to safety  without there ever having been a real fire. This made him a hero in the eyes of the family. Problem was  the newspapers at Jade's house weren't wet enough so the house actually caught fire.2. WHY DOES JADE'S MOTHER SIT ON THE STEPS AND SMILE AS HER 15YEAROLD DAUGHTER HAS SEX? If you've watched the movie up to this scene you'll know why. Jade's mom is a complete hippie  all about free love expressing yourself living in the moment etc. etc. It is blatantly obvious that she is not the typical mom who would scream in hysterics at the site of her daughter having sex. She finds it beautiful she feels the love that David and Jade share and leaves them to their free love. Daddy doesn't feel quite the same way of course.3. FOR THOSE LIKE ME WHO THOUGHT MARTIN HEWITT WAS THE HOTTEST THING ON TWO LEGS  HE STILL IS!".

	onyx:emotionText "Okay okay....just a little bit of clarification here for the naysayers who don't like this film OBVIOUSLY folks who never had an intense first love in their teen years  and you DON'T need a burning house to have felt that....1. WHY DID David BURN DOWN THE HOUSE? A lot of commenters have said they don't know why David burned down the house. It was not his INTENTION to burn down the house. David's friend played by Tom Cruise in his acting debut  which I thought would have made his lines more memorable to most folks! explains how a friend or it may have been his brother wanted to get a girl's attention that had broken up with him. He lit some wet newspapers on her front porch which smoked like hell  NO FIRE. The friend or brother then yelled to everyone in the house that there was a fire and got everyone to safety  without there ever having been a real fire. This made him a hero in the eyes of the family. Problem was  the newspapers at Jade's house weren't wet enough so the house actually caught fire.2. WHY DOES JADE'S MOTHER SIT ON THE STEPS AND SMILE AS HER 15YEAROLD DAUGHTER HAS SEX? If you've watched the movie up to this scene you'll know why. Jade's mom is a complete hippie  all about free love expressing yourself living in the moment etc. etc. It is blatantly obvious that she is not the typical mom who would scream in hysterics at the site of her daughter having sex. She finds it beautiful she feels the love that David and Jade share and leaves them to their free love. Daddy doesn't feel quite the same way of course.3. FOR THOSE LIKE ME WHO THOUGHT MARTIN HEWITT WAS THE HOTTEST THING ON TWO LEGS  HE STILL IS!";

David is someone I can identify with he's an only child and that makes him selfish and needy. Evidently David stands out as a student both academically and as a risk taker. He is very clever yet very foolish. As an only child myself I sympathize with and understand but not encourage or condonehis wacky misguided behavior. Some people think that Martin Hewitt was miscast I strongly disagree. By most peoples' standards Hewitt is a handsome guy he'd have to be to attract Brook Shields. No problem there! The relationship is based on physical attraction from Jade's viewpoint this is doubly true. No miscast. James Spader made his start here and his portrayal of Keith no doubt is what propelled him to higher success. In my mind Sex Lies and Video Tape was his best but this was a close second. Keith is all too real he's the stud who leads David on and betrays him his agenda is as speculative as Mrs. Robinson's! Nevertheless Keith goes on doggedly to rectify what he personally sees as a huge mistake. Spader brilliantly imparts a sense of honor and responsibility to in the hands of a lesser actor what would seem like mindless cruelty. Just because you're xing my sister ... What a great line! When David finally fights back in the Vermont hotel I was cheering! There are loose ends. How did the police determine David's guilt about the fire? Did David admit it? The movie should have made it clear because a Keith shows guilt for knocking David unconscious and bHugh saves David and no doubt he regrets it later. And then there's the unclear ending. If any movie needed a clear happy ending it was Endless Love.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was misunderstood from the beginning because since early childhood we have been taught such nonsense as beauty is only skin deep  don't judge a book by its cover and look for a soul mate with brains. Endless Love is about the overwhelming beauty of teenage Brooke Shields. Yes she was and is a horrible actress but in EL that didn't matter. It was about a boy obsessed with her unearthly beauty. This is a very hard theme to accept in a world where everyone is beautiful in their own way because everyone isn't beautiful to anything close to the degree that Brooke was at that age.Like Flaubert's Madame Bovary the story was inspired by a more or less unresearched news clip about a similar incident boy obsessed by girl burns her family home but there was no attempt made to explore motivation other than the mothinflame attraction of Martin Hewitt. The movie can drive therefore straight to the psyche and skip the dull niceties of psychological inquiry. In its own way the film is simple and brutally honest. It explores a facet of the human existence that we often wish to ignore the worship of pure physical beauty. This theme creates anger and derision in many people who simply feel that intellectually the human race has progressed beyond the point where Hewitt is at in the story. The reaction comes off as something like grow up. But we have not totally grown up with regard to our attraction to physical beauty. It is just something we try to stifle intellectually like the thing to do and think.The movie also recalls the laterinlife trials and tribulations of Leni Riefenstahl her quest for 3rd Reichlike eugenics in the 1970s80s among the physically stunning Nuba of Africa. Few people are aware that Riefenstahl was once again nearly blackballed especially in Europe for her cinematography with the Nuba. First it was beautiful people on mountains then beautiful Nazis finally beautiful naked African bodies.There is a direct relationship between Riefenstahl's eugenics and Endless Love. Both create a kind of poopoo porn rejection in viewers who prefer repressing their nonintellectual magnetism to human aesthetics. As I said our mothers taught us to look at what's inside. A great part of our makeup does not always want to look there. In this way EL is countercultural and even threatening. It is easier to call the acting bad which it is and the motivation flimsy which it is not than to confront this part of our human character.I rate the movie high for its daring theme the beauty of its teenage actors not just Shields but look also at James Spader at that ageand its bold originality. Yes it was a paen to Brooke but she deserved one at that time. Nature did not produce many of her ilk.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember reading the book about 4 years ago and really liked it so if I forgot something from it I apologize. I understand that certain things in the movie must change from the book but sadly it you make changes the change has to make sense. This didn't happen.1. These two leads are terrible! I can honestly say that Edward and Bella had more things to say than this. They at least had a conversation about science together. David and Jade just like saying how much they love each other and how they couldn't be apart from one another. That's it. There is no character development from them and no reason for them to stay together. Plus no offense to the actors but there not good at playing these roles. Maybe it's the directors fault but it still is terrible. David is unpleasant to watch which was part of the book but they should have at least made him understanding enough for the audience which sadly he isn't and makes his role as leading male disturbing. Jade is just a whiny teenage girl that I've seen before.2. The side characters are obnoxious and eerie to watch. The dad is totally crazy the mother is honestly one of the more frightening mother roles I've ever seen the other characters are dull and the only one who deserves the one star I'm giving this movie is James Spader. He did a pretty good performance for what he was given.3. The story is just a mess of problems. Why didn't the dad throw David off his property since technically he was trespassing and refusing to leave? Why did the judge say he couldn't contact Jade yet David is seen sending her letters? Why didn't the dad do anything when he saw naked David in his daughters room and then she went in with only a towel on? Yeah motivations in this movie are apparently just silly myths.This could've been a good movie. I could see potential behind it but sadly this movie fell flat on its face. The romance doesn't work the characters don't work and sadly the story doesn't work. When those three things don't work in a romance movie you sadly have a bad movie.".

I understand that certain things in the movie must change from the book but sadly it you make changes the change has to make sense. This didn't happen.1. These two leads are terrible! I can honestly say that Edward and Bella had more things to say than this. They at least had a conversation about science together. David and Jade just like saying how much they love each other and how they couldn't be apart from one another. That's it. There is no character development from them and no reason for them to stay together. Plus no offense to the actors but there not good at playing these roles. Maybe it's the directors fault but it still is terrible. David is unpleasant to watch which was part of the book but they should have at least made him understanding enough for the audience which sadly he isn't and makes his role as leading male disturbing. Jade is just a whiny teenage girl that I've seen before.2. The side characters are obnoxious and eerie to watch.

	schema:headline " Classic tale of boy meets girl boy loses girl boy burns down girl's house...";
	schema:reviewBody "Endless Love is one of those films that asks you to accept some rather inappropriate and bizarre behavior as normal and to sympathize with an obsessed stalker. Throw in gratuitous nudity and it's hard not to see why this ruined Brooke Shields' movie career.The film basically demonstrates what happens when two teens David and Jade start dating and their parents let them do whatever they want. David's parents have the excuse of being oblivious but Jade's parents... oh wow... where to begin? They do drugs with their kids and throw wild parties. They condone David spending the night in Jade's room. Both parents catch them and while the father does get mad the mother calmly stands there and watches them have sex! Her father even sees David brazenly walking around naked in his daughter's room with the door wide open.It's only when an exhaustedfromconstantlovemaking Jade tries to swipe some sleeping pills and starts dozing off in class that common sense finally prevails and the father forbids David and Jade from seeing each other albeit temporarily. David protests and pleads his case which is normal. What he does next however is not.An idiot friend of David's talks him into anonymously setting Jade's porch on fire with the intent that he would come back to rescue them. The big dummy actually does this the fire gets out of control and the house burns down. Gee who could've seen THAT coming? David confesses and gets sent for psychiatric observation. While I applaud that they didn't gloss over the consequences of his actions this is where the movie takes a really dark turn as David starts to become obsessed and I mean Fatal Attraction obsessed.He does nothing but pine for Jade and write letters to her every day. He blows off therapy sessions and begs his parents repeatedly to get him out despite the fact that he refuses to get better. In addition Jade's parents divorce and they move to New York. David's parents do likewise and I can't say I blame them.Finally he gets released and what does he do? He goes to New York to track her down. The craziness only escalates as he finds Jade's mother only to have her hit on him but David's too obsessed to care. Jade comes to his hotel room to let him down easy only for him to shamelessly beg her to take him back and pretty much rape her. Since no one behaves like a real person in this movie this wins her over. Then he has a contrived encounter with her father just so the idiot can be run over as he chases David across the street.This culminates in a scuffle in a hotel lobby when Jade's brother accuses David of killing their father and ends with David being arrested and likely sent back to the nut house which is where he sadly belongs. Jade who still can't get the hint has a hearttoheart with her mother about taking him back and the movie closes on her coming to visit him while he's locked up. I think my heart skipped a beat. The film's biggest problem is that is treats David and Jade's relationship as one you're supposed to root for when in reality it's puppy love gone horribly wrong. We never see how they got together they never fight disagree or have any kind of meaningful conversation and they constantly have sex. Everything about the movie wants you believe this is true love the writing the acting even the soundtrack. Sort of makes you wonder if anyone ever told Lionel Richie what the movie was really about before he wrote the classic title track. It doesn't help the film beats you over the head with the song either.The film also has pacing issues once David gets locked up. It says two years have passed but there's not much to indicate this and there's even less sense of time once David goes to New York. The movie shifts focus solely to David and Jade just drops off the face of the earth for fortyfive minutes. What's especially weird is that two years would only make Jade seventeen and probably still in high school so how's she wandering around New York and making trips to David's hospital unsupervised? And you can definitely tell that Brooke Shields can not pass for seventeen or eighteen.The Razzies would have you believe that the main cast gave bad performances but I have to disagree on this one. Shirley Knight puts in a believable performance for perhaps one of the worst mothers ever portrayed on film and Martin Hewitt does a respectable job playing essentially a crazy stalker. A young James Spader proves early on that he plays a great smug jerk. Brooke Shields does the best she can pretending to have sex when it's quite obvious she hasn't although instead of pulling her toe couldn't someone have at least demonstrated the kind of faces a person makes when they're making love? And she's still nowhere near as bad as say Jaden Smith in After Earth or Selena Gomez in Getaway. It's the story that really fails them. It's one of those stories that the more effort the actors put in the worse it looks. The movie wants you to believe it's true love when what's shown on screen is unhealthy obsession. Instead it ends up a cautionary tale about mistaking lust for love and what can happen when parents don't set boundaries for their children and I really don't think that's what they were going for here.".

He ain't in love he's obsessed.

It turned out SHE wanted to do him. Not only that after he got out of the sanitarium she helped him to get in contact with her daughter! Call the cops woman this nut tried to burn your family alive. Why didn't he get more intensive therapy after the sanitarium found out he was trying to contact Jade? THE JUDGE TOLD HIM NOT TO CONTACT JADE AND HER FAMILY yet his parents took him out. The scene where he's raping her and crying out how much he loved her man that was hilarious. Yet after he burned her family's house caused her father's death raped her Jade still love this guy Yikes!

I'd like to give this film a proper ending or epilogue Jade feels David is suffocating her metaphorically and asks to go on vacation and the nut follows her so she breaks up with him the following night she feels David is suffocating her Literally!!

Her sometime boyfriend is apparently obsessive. We see the usual nebulous references to psychiatry which was a prevalent plot twist during this time period. When a story plot could not gel the psychiatric angle would be thrown in to the story Think Prom Night Halloween or Lipstick.Don Murray as the ever concerned but clueless father once again. Disjointed families divorce and early 80's drama. Not the worst but certainly could have been better. The hospital and diagnosis of the obsessive boyfriend were completely surreal. 410".

Her sometime boyfriend is apparently obsessive. We see the usual nebulous references to psychiatry which was a prevalent plot twist during this time period. When a story plot could not gel the psychiatric angle would be thrown in to the story Think Prom Night Halloween or Lipstick.Don Murray as the ever concerned but clueless father once again. Disjointed families divorce and early 80's drama. Not the worst but certainly could have been better. The hospital and diagnosis of the obsessive boyfriend were completely surreal. 410";

EL is a beautifully shot and acted film of a boundless love between two late teens Shields and Hewitt perfectly paired which when sabotaged by outside parties heads on a path of damage and destruction which weighs heavily on Hewitt's character. He becomes unhinged by the vetoing of him from Shield's family after things really start to heat up. Besides an undeniable and explosive passion there are other contributing factors here with exams and finals coming up. Don Murray as Shield's father was a standout here where Shirley Knight as the mother who was really good but it was Murray who added spice. Knight's open Mother character was one I really liked though. As you'll see they aren't your typical family but they're one you like to be part off. James Spader as the protective and pushy son who was the catalyst you'll see was fun to watch. You really feel for Hewitt's character during his breakdown with emotionally powered moments this the strongest section of story. But it's hard to really feel anything for Shield's character until her return after a long absence of screen time as really you hardly learn much about her character and not that much more in the after. Nearing it's end there were some well up tear moments where soon you have a sudden yet unsatisfactory but thought provoking ending in this Zeffereli's 80 masterpiece. One movie that will make you ponder well after the curtains have come down.".

I enjoyed watching this movie for the first time being older having all that distance from today and the time the movie was made 1981. I feel like the hippie parents were very similar to parents of my high school acquaintance. Most of all I remember how young love is different from older love  not better not worse just different. The movie showed this. The acting is far from 'wooden.' All of these actors have gone on to other sometimes better things. What a treat to be able to see they so young fresh and skilled in these roles.".

It was quite daring for the time with a fairly graphic love affair between a high school senior boy and a 15yrold girl in Chicago. In fairness the young actress used a body double for the most revealing scenes but it was till pretty daring. As was the scene where the girl's mother discovers the two of them naked making love in her home and only watching. And even more daring a few years later tries to seduce the young man now in his early 20s characterwise.Not at all new to controversial roles playing a 12yrold prostitute in Pretty Baby and playing a stranded girl getting pregnant in Blue Lagoon Brooke Shields is the 15yrold love interest Jade Butterfield. Her family seems pretty normal until she and the boy Martin Hewitt as David Axelrod begin getting very close. So close in fact that he begins to sleep in Jade's bedroom. Mom doesn't seem to mind she is happy that Jade is finding love but dad gets to the point where he will do almost anything to break them apart for good.This version probably closer to the source book is quite dark and the ending is more ambiguous. It also has a very young Tom Cruise in a very small but very important role.SPOILERS FOLLOW As David and Jade get too close for comfort and David is asked to stay away one night he applied an idea he got from the Cruise character he lit some newspapers on Jade's family's porch started a fire that burned down their house. He received a suspended sentence if he would go into a mental hospital for therapy. He got out after two years and Jade's family had moved out east and her parents had split up.

Bishop has his hideaway out on the Bayou where he enjoys the finer things in life like playing the soft classical music that soothes him after a killing and rebuilding his Jaguar. And his idea of rebuilding involves micrometres as much as wrenches. He's got an arrangement with a woman that involves quick visits and wads of cash left on the table. His friend Harry tells him that he Bishop needs companionship but the movie makes it pretty plain why his friendships don't last long.

He then proceeds to hunt down and kill everyone involved even his best friends son. Yep that's right he drags this innocent kid into the situation he doesn't need the kids help for any of it nor does he makes any attempt to explain anything to him he just goes to very elaborate lengths to plan the kid's death.The end.".

So depressing and grotesque.2. The pair go around and into other's places and they don't wear gloves leave plenty of fingerprints and yet they aren't once suspected of murder.3. Honestly if Bishop knew that he'd get into pickle with his boss why did he even bother with Steve at all. A good assassin would be professional and not go out of his way to train some drunkard douche and kill him later.4. What was the point of the O'hare bus fight??? I know Bishop wanted him out of the way quick but why bother putting his work aside for the sake of killing some random guy?? 5. On that note how did no one notice a fight on a bus but just a guy getting hit with a car after being tossed out a window? 6. The ending. Steve is like 20 KM from the gas station and this is a wireless detonator. How is that even possible????? There HAS to be some distance limit. That was such bullcrap.7. The acting is terrible. Statham an actor I usually love was limited to 2 emotions if you can call them that 1. Don't bother me I'm trying to figure out who this target is and 2. Don't bother me I'm trying to make sure the job is done correctly Ben Foster mumbles his way through the film I literally could not understand WTF he was saying. You thought Ray Winstone's mumbling in Edge of Darkness was bad? Ben is FAR worse. His lines needed English subtitles.8. Better than 80 of the film was reaction shots with no dialog of people standing around looking shocked. The rest of the film is jargonfilled exposition heavy dialogue and about 5 minutes of actual action.9. LAZY ACTION SCENES. I'm tired of going to action films and getting sick because the director has a problem with people being able to see what's going on. Shaky camera and quick cutting must die I'm tired of it. 10. When I walked out I felt depressed and sick like I just ran 4 miles and ran face first into a brick wall. I was excited but this was just bleak boring and lame and I am a Jason Statham fan.I have not seen the original and I must say I CERTAINLY don't plan on it any time soon. Avoid.".

He's found his niche and he's sticking with it more power to him.But this movie is pretty bad. I saw another reviewer describe this movie as a thriller. It is not. Nothing happens in this movie that you can't see coming a mile away. Here's the Reader's Digest condensed version which CONTAINS SPOILERS. Jason Statham is a badass professional murderer Sorry hitman who likes to kill his targets in ways that look like accidents which is kinda clever. He works for the company which is never named so I'm going to call it Evil Incorporated. Evil Inc is run by two guys The soft spoken wheelchair bound older guy who's been Statham's character's friend since forever. The other guy has a corporate haircut wears an expensive suit and rides around in a convoy of sleek black vehicles accompanied by sunglasseswearing men with guns. Anyway Corporate Guy tells Statham that his old friend is In League With The Enemy and Statham kills his old pal at Corporate Guy's behest. The Old Pal's drunken loser kid shows up and asks Statham to train him up so he can find and kill the man who killed his dad. Statham agrees because I guess a washed up vengeance crazed drunk is the guy you want along when speed silence and skill are your keys to survival. Cue training montage.Statham finds out that Corporate Guy is SPOILERS AHEAD the real villain bet you didn't see that coming. They set out to kill him Drunk Loser Kid finds out Statham killed his dad they kill Corporate Guy Loser Kid tries to kill Statham but Statham gets away and kills him instead. Roll credits.In addition to the cookie cutter plot there were a few other things that annoyed me. 1 Statham's character is utterly unsympathetic. He's a loner who kills people for money. His only female companionship is a hooker. 2 He's supposed to live in the bayou area near New Orleans. His house has glass walls. Never mind that his work depends on secrecy that's a hurricane zone. 3 I know this is small but anyway during the training scene we see Statham and Drunk Kid shooting various guns. In one show motion cut someone fires a Barrettype .50 caliber rifle and the spent casing gets ejected toward the camera. The casing is crimped on the projectile end It's a freaking BLANK. Seriously guys? Wait for the DVD and watch it with pizza and easily amused friends.".

Killer for hire finds out that his next target is his mentor and friend. As the professional he is he executes the job anyway but later discoverers that not all is as is should be. Time for revenge. A simple straightforward and well working story.Things are complicated a bit by Bishop taking his friend's son under his wings. Of course he wants to walk in his fathers footsteps. He is inexperienced but also undisciplined. Something that not surprisingly is causing problems.I do like that Bishop stays a no bullshit hardass killer throughout the entire movie. No whining or silly emotional outbreaks or breakdowns. I also like the unemotional silent and deadly impression of a professional assassin the he radiates.There are quite a few fairly well done action scenes in the movie ranging from silent assassinations to the obligatory blow things up scenes. The parts where Bishop and Steves goes after the big bad guy is quite well done with some quite cool stunts without being over the top.The ending was probably the only thing in the movie that was a bit unexpected. Unexpected in a good way that is. I quite liked the little surprise there.Overall I as well as my son liked this movie quite a lot. I hope that Mechanic Resurrection is as good as this one.".

But there is one thing it does rank as and that's one of his best pure balls to the wall action films to date. In the last decade Statham has consistently delivered hard hitting B Action films and if your a fan of the old school 80's90's R rated action the mechanic is a must watch. For a brisk 90 mins it manages to provide on some no holds barred brutal and bloody action. It will remind you of the days when they made more adult oriented action without all that CGI and PG 13 but more fight choreography and realistic stunts and action. I think this is one of the most underrated and one of the better action movies within the last decade.Overall this is a movie worth watching more than once and if your a fan of action and haven't seen this and your looking for a quick 90 min movie to entertain you without thinking too much this is highly recommended.710".

After all hitman ARE human too and have feelings just like the rest of us who work at more mundane jobs. The problem with this movie is that the story is so weak that not even the nonstop violence is enough to prop it up. Gratuitous scenes of violence is a telltale sign that a movie is in trouble and this movie is in deep trouble. Besides offering the thinnest of stories the movie contains what has to be some of the cheesiest acting in recent cinematic history. The movie borders on being campy yet fails to attain that dubious status since it's really not goofy enough to be taken with a grain of salt. In short the story is stale but without being laughable. The characters are twodimensional cartoonlike and are devoid of anything that sparks even the slightest bit of interest. The violence is pervasive and explicit but when the targets themselves are vicious the violence fails to generate any sympathy. A hitman plotting to assassinate another hitman just does not make for a dramatic story.".

The problem with this movie is that the story is so weak that not even the nonstop violence is enough to prop it up. Gratuitous scenes of violence is a telltale sign that a movie is in trouble and this movie is in deep trouble. Besides offering the thinnest of stories the movie contains what has to be some of the cheesiest acting in recent cinematic history. The movie borders on being campy yet fails to attain that dubious status since it's really not goofy enough to be taken with a grain of salt. In short the story is stale but without being laughable. The characters are twodimensional cartoonlike and are devoid of anything that sparks even the slightest bit of interest. The violence is pervasive and explicit but when the targets themselves are vicious the violence fails to generate any sympathy. A hitman plotting to assassinate another hitman just does not make for a dramatic story.";

That may be the only kind of job offered to him or maybe Statham himself chooses to stay in the action genre because he likes it. Or he possibly knows the fact that the fame is transient and treacherous so he does not reject any role fearing that it may be his last one. But you know what? Whatever the reason it is I am not bothered at all of seeing him over and over interpreting the tough guy with a good heart challenging the adversity with guns or his fists and making unlikely stunts by car. After all his charisma and solid performances almost always benefit to those movies. What takes me to The Mechanic the most recent film in which he has been involved which is an entertaining but not very memorable action film.The Mechanic is a serious violent and brutal action film but not lacking of a sense of humor in its overthetop action scenes and in Statham's performance which is virtually identical to the one he brought in the films The One The Transporter and its sequels Revolver Death Race Crank and its sequel and The Expendables. But that does not matter because it is exactly what The Mechanic required besides the chemistry he has with Ben Foster is pretty good because their interaction simultaneously captures the potential of an incipient friendship and the distrust of sharing the most secret aspects from their life with a stranger. As for Foster's individual work he brings another one of his realistic and passionate performances showing the flexibility which allows him to work with the same credibility in arthouse cinema like The Messenger and Birds of America and in action films like this one and Pandorum. And despite his short stature his physical development is equally competent.I also liked to see in The Mechanic some moments of solid drama and emotion at least inside of what we can expect in a movie from this genre. So in conclusion I think that The Mechanic deserves a moderate recommendation because despite not being very memorable and the screenplay being a bit predictable I cannot deny that it made me have a good time.".

With no feelings I might miss something and perfect assurance I could have been doing something better than watching a rock video for serial killers. Instead of following the formula that worked in the past the producers and director this time around decided that it had been missing graphic and brutal depictions of murder so they fixed it. But ended up breaking something that didn't need fixing.If your thinking that I am just not into violent films you would be wrong. Many films have brought the fictional representation of violence to the level of fine art. This is not one of them. In fact I had not it was a remake even. I did see the original though. I caught it late at night just as it started in 1983 on HBO.The film was riveting. I have often thought back to it through the years as a fine example of American action suspense film.Halfway through this Redux of fail I began wondering why I was watching it at all. Then I caught a post from a young man reviewing it here Which said this film is so lame  so on and so on.. But what got me was the end of his review. The movie they based this on must suck to I will never watch the original. That is pretty damn sad.I had different issues than the angry young man had with this film. Over all it is well made. I think the director lost his mind and forgot he was making a movie though and attempted to make The Mechanic into the first Blockbuster Snuff Film. The assassinations depicted for these so called professional killers are very close to torture. Long involved scenes of merciless stabbing choking crushing and slicing the contracts they are paid to terminate left me queasy.By halfway through the film I had lost all consideration for any kind of plot. I no longer cared for or could root for either of the main characters. Once you start thinking that your main heroes should both be lobotomized and incarcerated for life because they are sociopaths its pretty hard to care if there is a story .All I remember is how bad I felt for the people I was supposed to not care about or even dislike as they died. So in my opinion this film was wretched and forever tarnished the good name of a foundational piece of American Cinema.".

The hit is perfect when no one knows that he was ever there. Bishop's mentor and friend Harry McKenna Donald Sutherland dies and Bishop takes Harry's son Steve Ben Foster under his wing to teach him the business. Together they are one force you don't want to be within their gun sights! My Comment This is a story of professional killers in action and in this movie you will get plenty of action sequences and explosions. Usually Bishop is detached from his assignment but when he goes after the people responsible for Harry's death all he wants is vengeance. Jason Statham's outstanding performance as the cool killing machine was right on target. Ben Foster's character of killing his target is a little more complicated than killing someone the easy way. There is a lot more brutality however Steve pays the price for not following what Bishop taught him. In one scene where Bishop questions a body guard at his home to get his boss' address he goes way over the top. Overall I liked this action packed movie but it is over before you know it.

As well it seems from comparison watching the remake and knowing the stars of the original the mechanic being Charles Bronson that both sets of actors seem to fit the role quite well for this typical turn your mind off and watch stuff explode and plans go wrong action film.

	schema:reviewBody "thefilmsmith.com The iconic bald white guy John McClane is no longer allowed to say his catch phrase on screen or shoot people who actually ooze blood. So it's good to see another bald white guy take up the action film banner in all its messiness.Jason Statham plays Arthur Bishop a mechanic who whacks guys with the skill to make them look like accidents. Things get dicey when his wheelchairbound boss Harry McKenna Donald Sutherland is killed and McKenna's vengeful son Steve Ben Foster comes looking for an education in the assassin business.From The Transporter to Crank Jason Statham is a wrecking ball you wheel him in to rock the house but if you're looking for something more riveting between action feats character development acting etc you need a different tool. Which is where Ben Foster is useful. In the critical darling The Messenger or The Mechanic Foster vibrates with a centered zen that draws you in. Statham may have a menacing mug but Foster as the enigmatic Steve upstages the action star at every turn.Neither actor benefits from Simon West's direction since most action scenes are close enough to make out nose hairs but none of the fisticuffs. Where Statham's physical virtuosity could be showcased West forces us to be in the scuffle with nary a notion of what's going on. This film doctor prescribes some wide shots from a Jackie Chan film.Despite directorial issues some action pieces escape mangling. Handtohand combat is particularly brutal when smallstatured Steve goes up against a 300 pound foe and his clever shots with a Glock 9mm make him an admirable badass.The brutality of these scenes is a change of pace since we've been raised by a decade of PG13 cop films that avoid the FBomb or bits of blood that get a film slapped with an R rating which equals lower box office receipts and restrictions on advertisements. Foster and Statham dispatch goons in such varied messy ways you almost feels sorry for the hapless henchmen. The film's blood lust is as dark as its blood stains.MAJOR SPOILERS SKIP PARAGRAPHS What's most disappointing about The Mechanic is that it looks to conclude with a poetic equilibrium yet trades it in for a perfunctory ending that leaves an opening for a sequel.One of the plot twists to the film is that Arthur is told Harry McKenna crossed the company they both worked for. Arthur kills Harry who tells Arthur I'm glad it was you this leaves dangling tension between Arthur and Harry's son Steve. Once Steve knows Arthur killed his father the two men stop at a gas station. At this point each of them knows the truth but neither let on. Which makes it all the more meaningful when Arthur tells Steve I'm sorry about everything in a vague unrelated way possibly hinting that he knows what Steve is about to do.Steve walks away from the truck while pumping gas and shoots the gas tank engulfing Arthur's truck in flames. He then goes back to Arthur's place. A sports car Arthur has been working on is now completed and Steve takes it for a spin. He sees a piece of paper in the passenger seat which tells him If you're reading this you're dead. Steve goodnaturedly lols before being blown up.A nice reciprocal poetic ending for a couple of assassins.Until The film cuts to security camera footage of the truck explosion which shows Arthur rolling away in a comical fastforward  rewind loop. We then cut to a close up of Arthur leaving the crime scene and driving away in a truck he just happened to have stationed nearby for just such a random occasion.There isn't anything inherently wrong with this ending  it's just not as fresh as the one hinted at. Having Steve kill our lead guy went against tired action film tropes. The ideal ending would have had Steve drive away with Arthur's sports car a changing of the guard or even having them both kill each other Steve's last words being laughter. That would have been something to talk about.But no. Kill the most interesting character and leave the block of wood Statham standing to live another day  or star in another installment.MAJOR SPOILERS OVER Yes I'm disappointed the film didn't follow through on its transcendent ending but don't let that dissuade you from seeing this. The action sequences will making you think you've been transported to the 1990s some digital blood but otherwise tons of practical effects and Ben Foster makes it capable of withstanding a second viewing. If you were disappointed by The Expendables The Mechanic is a good mix of bullets and character to quench your action thirst.Remington Smith".

It's the stale screenplay by Richard Wenk and Lewis John Carlino and the uninspired approach from director Simon West Con Air Tomb Raider that had me feeling like I had already seen The Mechanic numerous times before. The setpieces are sporadically enjoyable granted but everything else surrounding those fleetingly good moments are dripping in dullness. The plot is predictable the characters are one dimensional and the violence  although gory  is hardly entertaining. Even the soundtrack is strangely boring.Since his double whammy debut of Lock Stock and Snatch Jason Statham has churned out cookiecutter action flicks like they're going out of fashion. He's starred in everything from the good  Crank The Italian Job Death Race  to the bad  The Expendables the Transporter trilogy Cellular  to the ugly  Ghosts of Mars In the Name of the King. Perhaps he's worried one day he'll be out of the job a likely outcome if he insists on starring in underwhelming vehicles such as this. The Stath needs to take a few risks and steer away from the calm cool and collected badass that he's apparently so comfortable playing.He's given capable support in the way of Ben Foster a young actor who hasn't wholly delivered on the promise he showed a few years ago. Foster proved with his remarkable performance in 310 to Yuma that he can do the eerie menacing type complete with charisma and flair however here his quiet craziness lacks the same gravitas. Elsewhere old timer Sutherland is completely redundant and Goldwyn is neither threatening nor humorous as the wimpy boring bad guy. To be honest the cast aren't given much to work with past clichd characters and stilted dialogue but then why in the name of decent film selection did they sign on for this? There's nothing on offer here that you haven't already seen throughout Statham's career.2 out of 5 1  Rubbish 2  Average 3  Good 4  Great 5  Brilliant".

	schema:headline " Mildly amusing family comedy horror film aimed at the kids really...";
	schema:reviewBody "HollywoodMonster or the more widely used  much better alternate title Ghost Chase starts with a groovy credit sequence involving big pink animated eyes  a catchy 80's pop tune after which we are introduced to Fred Tim McDaniel who is a huge horror film buff  aspires to make his own  uses his friend's Warren McCloud Jason Lively  Laurie Jill Whitlow to star in it. One night on his 21st birthday Warren receives a phonecall from his lawyer Julian Curry who informs him that he is invited to the reading of his Father's will. Sensing some money Warren  Fred are visibly disappointed when all he is left is an old suitcase containing a clock it's quite a nice looking clock but still only a clock. Meanwhile corporate villain Stan Gordon Paul Gleason has a mysterious interest in the suitcase himself  sends some seemingly random half German half American guy named Karl Leonard Lansink to steal it. Back at Warren's house  as the clock strikes one the ghost of his Grandfather's butler Lewis appears who reveals that there is an absolute fortune hidden in his Grandfather's house  he was murdered to protect it's whereabouts. Warren Fred Laurie  Lewis set out to find the missing fortune...This German production was cowritten  directed by Roland Emmerich who would later go on to make mega budget Hollywood films like Universal Soldier 1992 Stargate 1994 Independence Day 1996 Godzilla 1998 The Patriot 2000  The Day After Tomorrow 2004  I personally didn't think it was too bad but at the same time wasn't exactly brilliant either. The script by Emmerich Oliver Eberle  Thomas Kubisch is definitely aimed at children for the most part although there is some minor violence  bad language. HollywoodMonster moves along at a fair pace although it is a bit dull at times the comedy isn't really that funny while the horror elements are played down  it doesn't particularly satisfy in either department. Lewis the ghost is almost a secondary character doesn't get much screen time  when he does get some he barely does anything other than stand there  talk anyway. The plot is silly childish  somewhat predictable with all the clichd feel good family elements present  correct like in the end the good guys win the bad guys are defeated while love  friendship conquers all but then did you really expect anything else? On the positive side HollywoodMonster goes about it's business with a certain likability as a whole the film sort of entertains  has a nice climax when our heroes have to fight a possessed suit of armour in a basement dungeon.Director Emmerich pays homage to the horror film throughout as he uses the typical slasher scenario at the start to try  fool his audience he tries to get as many posters into the background as he can from the likes of The Shining 1980 to Friday the 13th 1980 he shows lots of clips from Night of the Living Dead 1968 has the lead character who drives around in a hearse  is obsessed by horror films  he sets various scenes in a special effects workshop. I must confess I'm confused as to why he has done this considering HollywoodMonster is pretty family friendly these homages  references are going to pass most children by especially one instance when he name drops Boris Karloff how many preteens are going to know who Boris Karloff is?Technically HollywoodMonster is well made with good cinematography music  solid production values but nothing particularly stands out. The special effects are decent enough considering the time it was made. The cute large eyed bushy eyebrowed design of Lewis obviously is meant to appeal to children I would have preferred him a little scarier. The acting was OK but nothing spectacular.HollywoodMonster is an OK film but in no way a brilliant one it passes an hour and a half without too much pain  provides a few decent scenes here  there although I'm sure children will get more out of it than adults. Worth a watch if you catch it on TV for free or it's going cheap somewhere.".

	onyx:emotionText "HollywoodMonster or the more widely used  much better alternate title Ghost Chase starts with a groovy credit sequence involving big pink animated eyes  a catchy 80's pop tune after which we are introduced to Fred Tim McDaniel who is a huge horror film buff  aspires to make his own  uses his friend's Warren McCloud Jason Lively  Laurie Jill Whitlow to star in it. One night on his 21st birthday Warren receives a phonecall from his lawyer Julian Curry who informs him that he is invited to the reading of his Father's will. Sensing some money Warren  Fred are visibly disappointed when all he is left is an old suitcase containing a clock it's quite a nice looking clock but still only a clock. Meanwhile corporate villain Stan Gordon Paul Gleason has a mysterious interest in the suitcase himself  sends some seemingly random half German half American guy named Karl Leonard Lansink to steal it. Back at Warren's house  as the clock strikes one the ghost of his Grandfather's butler Lewis appears who reveals that there is an absolute fortune hidden in his Grandfather's house  he was murdered to protect it's whereabouts. Warren Fred Laurie  Lewis set out to find the missing fortune...This German production was cowritten  directed by Roland Emmerich who would later go on to make mega budget Hollywood films like Universal Soldier 1992 Stargate 1994 Independence Day 1996 Godzilla 1998 The Patriot 2000  The Day After Tomorrow 2004  I personally didn't think it was too bad but at the same time wasn't exactly brilliant either. The script by Emmerich Oliver Eberle  Thomas Kubisch is definitely aimed at children for the most part although there is some minor violence  bad language. HollywoodMonster moves along at a fair pace although it is a bit dull at times the comedy isn't really that funny while the horror elements are played down  it doesn't particularly satisfy in either department. Lewis the ghost is almost a secondary character doesn't get much screen time  when he does get some he barely does anything other than stand there  talk anyway. The plot is silly childish  somewhat predictable with all the clichd feel good family elements present  correct like in the end the good guys win the bad guys are defeated while love  friendship conquers all but then did you really expect anything else? On the positive side HollywoodMonster goes about it's business with a certain likability as a whole the film sort of entertains  has a nice climax when our heroes have to fight a possessed suit of armour in a basement dungeon.Director Emmerich pays homage to the horror film throughout as he uses the typical slasher scenario at the start to try  fool his audience he tries to get as many posters into the background as he can from the likes of The Shining 1980 to Friday the 13th 1980 he shows lots of clips from Night of the Living Dead 1968 has the lead character who drives around in a hearse  is obsessed by horror films  he sets various scenes in a special effects workshop. I must confess I'm confused as to why he has done this considering HollywoodMonster is pretty family friendly these homages  references are going to pass most children by especially one instance when he name drops Boris Karloff how many preteens are going to know who Boris Karloff is?Technically HollywoodMonster is well made with good cinematography music  solid production values but nothing particularly stands out.

	schema:reviewBody "I was over at the local used bookCDmovie store the other day when my friend came up to me showing me this movie for sale for 2.50. He told me he was going to buy it because it looked really bad. NO! I said. I'm the one who collects bad movies I should be the one buying it! He with held from my torment for a while until I showed him where the Godzilla movies were. THEN he gave it up in favor of Godzilla vs. Mothra. Haha! I exclaimed holding the movie over my head. I have won! Little did I know that this movie was the one who REALLY won.If you are reading this it probably means you have rented or bought this movie and you should be ashamed of yourself. How dare you support this movie with your hard earned money! The basis of this movie should have told you right away that this movie was a piece of crap. A group of film makers are struggling with production when one of the kids I mean kids literally because these actors look as if they were only 17 or 18yearsold. None of them should be living on their own making movies. They should be in high school. gets called to the reading of a family will. He gets a bunch of junk left to him by his great grandfather. One piece of junk was an old clock that turns out to be housing the spirit of an old servant of the kid's great grandfather. And every time the clock struck 100 am the spirit left the clock to roam his surrounding area. What I didn't get was why this spirit didn't do the same all of the other hundreds of nights he was locked away in that trunk. Well the director of the films sees the ghost and immediately after he wakes up begins to construct a bunch of things that resemble what he saw when the spirit came into his room. He makes puppet about two feet tall a scale model of a huge house and writes a script for a movie based on his vision. My question where did he get the money and the knowhow to make such detailed objects. The puppet is shown to have radio controlled eyes. What kind of a technological high school drop wizard is this guy who knows how to rig up remote sensor appendages? I don't know...  On to the next important thing!Across town another film maker this one in his 30's hears about the will reading and orders a spy to steal the clock. The ghost appears again scaring away the spy and this time he inhabits the puppet made by the director guy. This leads the ghost I think his name is Lewis to speak of the great grandfather and how he had lots of money but he never gave it to anybody rather put it in the basement of some house. So the kids spend the night roaming Hollywood in search of some house trying to jog Lewis's memory along the way because Lewis is a moron and can't remember where the house was.Well they finally find the house after a girl recognizes the house in one of the older movie maker's movies only to find out that the older guy is going to blow it up for the grand finale of some movie. They sneak into the closed set end up in the basement of the house and are about to break into a wall when the ghost of the great grandfather shows up inhibits a suit of armor and begins battling the kids. One blow and the armor falls apart though but it somehow reassembles itself and begins to exact it's revenge. It puts the director kid on a bed of spikes entraps the great grandson behind bars and does something to Lewis but Lewis can still talk and he tells the director kid that the only way to defeat the great grandfather's ghost is to destroy the clock. So he does it and the house blows up with the kids inside it. They find the fortune the director kid is upset because he lost Lewis the old director is bankrupted because the kids exploit a fraud he committed back a few years ago and to end the movie they drive away in a limo with guess who driving?... Awww... it's Lewis... Everybody with me Awwwww... Lewis is still alive. DAMN YOU LEWIS!!! Damn you back to the pits of despair you came from!!! And as you're on your way down don't hang onto me for support because I'm not giving any! Lewis doesn't deserve it!! This movie doesn't deserve it! The actors don't deserve it! Nobody related to this movie deserves it!All in all this movie wasn't all that bad. The ending was what killed it though. I never liked Lewis. I wanted him to stay dead and when I saw him driving that limo I wanted to punch a hole through a wall. By far the WORST ending I have ever seen. That is my opinion and I'm sticking to it. Good day gentlemen...".

Directorcowriter Roland Emmerich relates the entertainingly goofy story at a steady pace and maintains an amiable lightweight tone throughout.

Paul Gleason does well as mean jerk studio head Stan Gordon and Leonard Lansink contributes a funny turn as Gordon's bumbling flunky Karl. Popping up in nifty bits are Chuck Porky Mitchell as huffy diner owner Mr. Rosenbaum and veteran character actor Larry Pennell as a boozesodden bum. Karl Walter Lindenlaub's slick cinematography gives this picture a nice glossy look. The bouncy soundtrack and the groovybumpin' score by Joel Wachbrit and Hubert Bartholomae keep things bubbling along.

Actually this unoriginality is one of the lesser problems I had with this movie. It's a pretty cheaplooking movie for one thing with poor cinematography and lighting. Much of the dialogue seems postdubbed and many of the special effects are tacky. And they apparently couldn't afford a decentsounding musical score. But most of the blame falls on Emmerich's direction and script. Emmerich doesn't seem to know how to stage scenes many times look at how the bicycle crash and the overpouring of coffee in a mug is filmed.

In both Britain and the U.S. the picture was cut by 30 minutes to a 67 minute running time atrociously dubbed retitled to GIRLS MARKED DANGER and dumped in the U.S. by distributor I.F.E. into the grind houses and driveins. It was not reviewed by any of the major newspapers although Variety documents it twice. Its director Luigi Comencini has made quite a few good films in his career including the legendary BREAD LOVE AND DREAMS and BREAD LOVE AND JEALOUSY FRISKY with Gina Lollobrigida the Italian Boys' Town film PROIBITO RUBARE and an excellent adaptation of Elsa Morante's novel LA STORIA. This must qualify as an interesting guilty pleasure and although it is a distinctly lesser effort of his it bears reviving and reevaluating just to see this cast of actresses together in one film.".

The rest of the movie covers Liam Neeson the undertakerand his attempts to convince her that she is in fact dead and help prepare her for her funeral. But is she really dead?This movie is not about life after death. Its not about what happens when you die. This movie is about people not really living their lives wandering through life like they're dead already. I think its fairly obvious that the main character is in fact very much alive when taken to the undertaker. Numerous clues point to this in the movie breath on the mirror the 'muscle relaxant' that shes injected with and the fact that shes walking around and has to be locked in and finally to confirm that Neeson is lying in the final scenes he clearly kills the boyfriend. But the movie has several scenes that seem to ruin this and push the film to seeming supernatural grounds. With numerous scenes or nightmare scenes like the confrontation with her younger self and the old woman's corpse walking and talking. These slightly detract from the overall focus of the storyline but keep you guessing if she is alive or dead.In the end this is a good movie with an interesting story and direction only slightly let down by some of the scenes.

	schema:headline " A confused clumsy piece of pretentious melodrama.";
	schema:reviewBody "Ah here we see yet another selfassuming clunky mess of a film. We should have known having seen the pretentious dot that has been placed between the two words of the title for no apparent reason.The opening is somewhat promising involving a bored and depressed Christina Ricci who gets involved in a budgeteffective car crash and wakes up in a funeral parlour with the grim Liam Neeson looming over her explaining that she is in fact dead. That he tells her her blood flow has stopped before promptly injecting her with drugs a rather pointless endeavour for someone with no circulation denies the essence of her filmlong confusion. But that doesn't seem to bother anyone at this point because we like to give movies the benefit of the doubt don't we. Unfortunately Ricci's sole demonstrable skill in the film appears to be going from squeaky desperation to grim monotonous acceptance and back again in a matter of minutes. This simply serves to add more confusion to the already bizarre plot and ultimately makes us unsympathetic during the final scenes.The problem with the film is that it has no idea what it is. The director has clearly been hoping for a cut above the average horror flick but there is not enough originality or wisdom to transform it into anything else. The result is a cheap and excessively melodramatic Bside horror which lacks the spooky scares that make its tawdry counterparts so much more exciting. The fact that the film takes itself so very seriously throughout makes it all the more infuriating.One of the film's very few silver linings is Liam Neeson's understated performance as the unhinged funeral director convincingly dishing out a mix of soothing sobriety and chilling psychosis and managing to drag some life out of the clumsy and repetitive script. But then you'd expect that from a man so undeniably badass that he's even played an actual lion in a film.A diluted and overlong episode of The Twilight Zone for horror completists and fans of Ricci's feminine form only.POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOWI find the ending worth a mention. Downer endings are all well and good in the right context. When the film's content is strong and there is method and moral to the disappointment one can still come away from it feeling rewarded or at least provoked into contemplation.Unfortunately none of this is applicable to After.Life. The film's plot relies on the prospect of a recovery and reconciliation between its two leads the character development is too thin and plot points too few and far between to allow for anything else. So after having sat through an hour and a half of dreary nothingness we as a now solidly popcorneating audience expect the alleviation of some form of resolve to reward us for enduring the rest of the film and to tick one final box in the series of clichs that it has been following so avidly throughout. But unfortunately the film seems to think that a negative finale is a oneway ticket to critical acclaim. And once upon a time it was but now this is simply not enough. And so we are left with an uninspired and underwhelming descent into rigor mortis with the bad guy living to strike again and again and again. God forbid.".

	schema:headline " Good idea great actors but the film just has too many flaws.";
	schema:reviewBody "I understand that this is a film that will divide opinions. Perhaps it is intelligent. Perhaps it has a most wonderful original idea for a movie that made me rent it in the first place. Perhaps Liam Neeson and Christina Ricci are wonderful actors. But it doesn't change the fact that the film simply has too many flaws. You can accept a few in an otherwise good film but having too many of them simply destroys the atmosphere. That is precisely what happened in this case in my opinion.Allow me to elaborate. George Lucas once said that a movie doesn't have to follow the rules of our reality in order to be believable it just needs to follow the rules of its own reality. This is exactly where this movie fails. It creates an unexplained horror world where something absurd happens every now and then lights go out every time a lady walks past them with a big noise until the whole corridor has turned black how clich is THAT?! plastic bumping head starts suddenly moving for no apparent reason following a guy when he is walking. I wish the movie would have at least allowed me to believe that it was something the characters imagined in their heads as in some other more respectable scenes. But no the guy didn't even see the lifeless bumpy head moving it just did so for no apparent reason. What is so psychologically thrilling about that? These kinds of events go on and on. For example after the mightbedead lady escapes from the man holding her as prisoner she suddenly starts bumping into walls in a straight corridor! and making a terrible noise. Possibly we are supposed to assume that she is so scared she has become hysteric but then again she didn't seem hysteric either in the previous or in the following scene nor is she in any immediate danger  the guy holding her as prisoner isn't really threatening in any way.The words for no apparent reason are key words for several events in this movie. Believibility requires a reason for a cause. This movie doesn't provide them just irregular events placed around the plot  events that more often than not don't affect the plot any way I might add.The most disturbing part for me however was the way it dealt with the questions of life and death. It tries to talk about indepth questions  what happens to us when we die and are we really that alive when we live our pathetic fearrun lives and so forth  but ends up stating clichs such as we die to make life more meaningful or something along those lines. Something we have heard billion times before in every funeral or Bclass drama movie we've gone to. The movie is filled with tons of other clichs as well  along the lines of you are more afraid of living than of dying and a small child telling the woman I am you when she asks who the kid is in her nightmare or whatever you call them weird visions all the characters keep getting every now and then and so forth. And the worst part is these clichs just won't stop! There is hardly any action just line after line and EVERY SINGLE LINE seems to be one I've heard a dozen times before! I wonder if the screenwriters were on strike when this film was scripted because a good idea just falls flat this way.And finally  what exactly happens to a person when heshe dies? The question of whether heshe will go on living as a spirit of some sort is an intriguing question. That is a question that doesn't seem to concern this movie at all. The question that does concern this movie  whether the body can go on living running in the hallways and throwing stuff around  is not an intriguing one not to me at least. Sure one could respect it in a 50's style zombiehorrormovie. And if this was one I might accept it. But this isn't one. This is supposed to be an intellectual movie raising intellectual questions about life and death. To assume that we should even consider the possibility that a MATERIAL BODY jumping around throwing things and BREATHING for Christ's sake could be DEAD is underestimating the intelligence of the same audience for whom the movie is sold to as an intelligent psychological thriller.All of the above is more or less absurd. And I am a person who finds absurdity amusing. I suppose one could respect a movie for making one burst out a laughter every few minutes. But if its unintentional there seems to be something wrong with either the script or directing sometimes acting too but not in this case. Seriously I did laugh every now and then. Out loud too not just inside my head. And an intelligent psychological thriller shouldn't make you do that.Liam Neesom is a wonderful actor  once again. That gives this film two stars. Third one for a good attempt to create something original  even though in my eyes the attempt somewhat failed in this case. I would love to give more stars to an original and a clever idea but every time I try to go for the fourth a picture of the moving plastic head bumps into my head and once again I begin to laugh.".

Although Ricci is on the mortuary slab and seminude for most part of the film comparably to Anna Falchi in Dellamorte Dellamore 1994 to WojtowiczVoslo's credit it's never in an explicit or over sexualized presentation. Liam Neeson is convincing as the mortician Eliot Deacon in a subtle performance where he communicates with the dead. He's creepy and cold although not given a back story his character has many layers. The tension between Neeson and Ricci is noteworthy and create some great moments.Die Hard 4 star Justin Long is average as Ricci's fiance as he doesn't have the convincing weight of the other players. However Young Chandler Canterbury as the little boy Jack is memorable. The supporting cast are a mix of familiar face's including Josh Charles and Shuler Hensley and the other officers.

	schema:reviewBody "AFTER.LIFE yes that is a dot between the two words suggesting this may be a video game...or blog or something created in cyberspace takes a long shot can a oneline story keep an audience's attention for over 103 minutes? Not having noticed whether this played in theaters or is one of the direct to DVD films that question is tough to answer. The director and writer Agnieszka WojtowiczVosloo writing in tandem with Paul Vosloo and Jakub Korolczuk asks us to suspend belief and muse about the idea that there is a time between 'death' and the actual burial or other means of final intermentdisposal when the spirit may struggle with the idea of life ending. It is an interesting hiatus to study and fortunately a cast was selected to portray the characters involved in this internetlike game that makes it watchable. Schoolteacher Anna Taylor Christina Ricci and Paul Coleman Justin Long are in a rocky relationship they could be headed toward marriage but Anna has trust issues that prevent her from committing to same. In a rage she leaves the frustrated Coleman subsequently is killed in a car accident and is taken to a mortuary where mortician Elliot Deacon Liam Neeson begins preparing her body for the funeral. Anna is unable to move anything but her mouth and denies that she is dead a situation Deacon encounters with most every dead body he prepares for burial. And this is where the conundrum begins is Anna dead or is she alive kept prisoner by Deacon? Anna's hateful mother Celia Watson visits her daughter's corpse and has few kind words to say.

	onyx:emotionText "AFTER.LIFE yes that is a dot between the two words suggesting this may be a video game...or blog or something created in cyberspace takes a long shot can a oneline story keep an audience's attention for over 103 minutes? Not having noticed whether this played in theaters or is one of the direct to DVD films that question is tough to answer. The director and writer Agnieszka WojtowiczVosloo writing in tandem with Paul Vosloo and Jakub Korolczuk asks us to suspend belief and muse about the idea that there is a time between 'death' and the actual burial or other means of final intermentdisposal when the spirit may struggle with the idea of life ending. It is an interesting hiatus to study and fortunately a cast was selected to portray the characters involved in this internetlike game that makes it watchable. Schoolteacher Anna Taylor Christina Ricci and Paul Coleman Justin Long are in a rocky relationship they could be headed toward marriage but Anna has trust issues that prevent her from committing to same. In a rage she leaves the frustrated Coleman subsequently is killed in a car accident and is taken to a mortuary where mortician Elliot Deacon Liam Neeson begins preparing her body for the funeral. Anna is unable to move anything but her mouth and denies that she is dead a situation Deacon encounters with most every dead body he prepares for burial. And this is where the conundrum begins is Anna dead or is she alive kept prisoner by Deacon? Anna's hateful mother Celia Watson visits her daughter's corpse and has few kind words to say. Paul is devastated comforted by his colleague Tom Josh Charles that Anna is dead and visits the mortuary to see the body but is refused admittance by Deacon. One of Anna's young students Jack Chandler Canterbury seems to have a special affinity for the dead and spies on the mortuary where he sees Anna standing in a window.

But it is a question first time director Agnieszka WojtowiczVosloo tackles in After.Life with surprising depth and skill. Christina Ricci plays Anna a woman disconnected from her almost fianc Justin Long and alienated by her mother who moves about her days in a mostly apathetic haze. For the most part Anna's life seems well rather lifeless  until she wakes up on mortician Liam Neeson's slab only to learn that she is in fact dead. What exactly that means is the mystery.My favorite way to see a movie is when I know next to nothing about it so I won't spoil anything here! and that's how I went into the AFI screening of After.Life last night. I knew the basic premise and a little about the story but other than that  nada. Which I have to say is a great way to approach a thriller. The highlight for me was Liam Neeson no real surprise there who brings surprising warmth and complexity to what could have otherwise easily been a very twodimensional character. The other standout was Chandler Canterbury as Jack Anna's young student who has a little figuring out of his own to do. Their performances alone are worth the price of admission. The director's attention to detail dream imagery and color most notably a scene where Neeson washes the dye from Ricci's hair as she lies stretched across an embalming table reminded me of the stark Gothic beauty of Six Feet Under and Dexter. That said this film isn't cut and dry doesn't tie everything up neatly at the end and asks more questions than it answers. It's definitely not your typical American movie  something I consider a positive aspect. If you don't then I'd suggest skipping this one an netflixing Twister.".

The director handles the genre scares and thrills with the assured skill of a veteran yet refreshingly poses some interesting and awkward questions about life and death and the fragile line that separates them. However the main reason I've given this film an 8 rather than a 9 or 10 is that I'd have liked to have spent more time on the intriguing question about what happens when you die.

He is shouting to his dead clients in order to show how bad he is but you still don't believe that he is convinced of what he is doing. It just looks like acting and this gives you a bad feeling when watching the movie. Christina Ricci is performing excellent yes she looks great and there are some nude scenes but this doesn't save the movie. Justin Long is neither excellent nor bad. Who cares... his part is not that important for the movie.However the cast is not the main problem because the story is illogical as it can be. The director took it too easy with going into both directions and ignored the resulting contradictions during the final. I'm afraid that after all the hints in the movie that were pointing in both directions there was no room for a logical ending without removing the scenes that do not fit. The illogical story makes this movie a complete waste of time because there is no other interesting point in this movie but to find out what is really happening and why the hints are going in both directions.However in the end the director just throws away half of the hints and delivers an easy solution  too easy for serious storytelling.".

But it's much more than that. It deconstructs the genre with both humor and respect. The director is obviously a genre fan and shows respect for the genre conventions while poking gentle fun at it.And as a genre piece it works extremely well. There's a forbidding menace hanging over every scene that gets deep under your skin. Liam Neeson as the Funeral Director is tremendous and makes the duality of the character very believable. Justin Long is also a revelation  he can do serious acting! But overall I think it's the message of the film that stays in your head. What does it mean to be dead? And most importantly what does it mean to be alive?".

But it's much more than that. It deconstructs the genre with both humor and respect. The director is obviously a genre fan and shows respect for the genre conventions while poking gentle fun at it.And as a genre piece it works extremely well. There's a forbidding menace hanging over every scene that gets deep under your skin. Liam Neeson as the Funeral Director is tremendous and makes the duality of the character very believable. Justin Long is also a revelation  he can do serious acting! But overall I think it's the message of the film that stays in your head. What does it mean to be dead? And most importantly what does it mean to be alive?";

The movie might seem like it sets out a lot of questions but if you just watch for the white van you will see that it is the vehicle that is behind Anna honking its horn and trying to get her to go faster. I believe the character of Eliot does in fact kill Anna and Paul and that he does not hold a gift to speak with those crossing from living to death. To me Eliot telling Jack that he has the same powers was just a way of keeping him from Jack believing Anna was still alive when he saw her in the window. All in a I give the movie a 8 out of 10 it was suspenseful and the director had us guessing at scenes like the die from her hair looking like blood the blood from her nosewhich we never did find out why she was popping pills non stop when she was still alive.".

And that worked so well.The story told in After.Life is really riveting and compelling. It is the type of story that will keep you in suspense and wanting to see what happens next. The plot is Anna Taylor played by Christina Ricci is in a car accident and wakes up on a mortuary slab where she is attended to by Eliot Deacon played by Liam Neeson. And the story lets you guessing if she really is dead or alive and whether it is all a ruse set up by Deacon. I am not going to reveal any more of the story except that it was fantastic.I like movies that keep you in the dark and have you grasping at clues trying to figure out what really is happening. And After.Life really takes you on a thrill ride where you don't know what is true or false.The cast was really good and they did good jobs with their roles. Especially Liam Neeson in the role of the mortician Eliot Deacon. He was right on the money with this performance. I read that they had initially casted Alfred Molina for this part and I think he would have done an equally good job as he has been seen in a mortician role before. And also Christina Ricci was doing a good job with her role as Anna Taylor. And it is good to see that Justin Long is finally shedding that teenage role of his and stepping up into the bigger league of acting.If you like thrillers then After.Life is definitely worth checking out. The story blew me away and took me completely off guard. I hadn't expected it to be anything like this.".

Well at least half the film makes you keep thinking of what is really going on than it leads the audience to decide and throws another reason for the audience to doubt their decision. The plot is this a stupid girl played by Christina Ricci who is a school teacher gets into a accident. Which leads her body to be in a process of being prepared for her funeral and the person that takes care of her body to look presentable during the funeral is played by Liam Neeson who does a great job with the roles he is given most of the time. While this is going on her boyfriend is trying to seek out her body in order for him to get closure because he personally thinks she is still alive. Christina Ricci wasn't bad in this role but I never liked her or found her attractive and found her acting all cocky most of the time to be a bit annoying. But she played her character pretty well in this one although very stupid at times. The main highlight of this film is the constant guessing game where it leaves it up to the audience for the most part of the movie. Of whether the girl is really dead or if the whole thing is just a sick game. The ending is pretty good and terrifying as well. Sure there are aspect of the film that doesn't make any sense but it didn't get to the point it got irritating to watch for the most part.Spoilers below The title to this movie is misleading in a way. And I found it odd how there are hardly and emos or goths in this flick considering the ending and all. This could have also been another Saw movie with less blood and gore but with the title Saw it's a dead give away of what is really going on.7.210".

At one level it's a tightly made horror thriller with enough scares and creepy moments to keep the most ardent horror fan happy. But at another level it's also a thoughtful and provocative examination of what it's like to be dead  or more importantly what it's like to not be living.The film starts by following a young woman Anna Christina Ricci trying to cope with her depression and a relationship that appears to be falling apart and the local funeral director Eliot Liam Neeson as he prepares for a funeral. The opening sets up a suspenseful inevitability that Anna's and Eliot's paths will soon cross.But it's when Anna has a car crash and wakes up on Eliot's slab that the film really kicks into high gear. Eliot calmly tells her she's dead and he's preparing her body for her funeral. Despite Anna's pleas that she's still alive Eliot's chilling calmness convinces us that Anna is really dead. Eliot has a gift. He can talk to the dead to help them transition to the afterlife.It's a fascinating premise. A funeral director helping people come to terms with their death and the regrets of their life so they can be finally at peace and move on. Anna asks if she's ghost and we sense that perhaps she is. That maybe ghosts are only transitory during the period between death and moving on to an afterlife.But as the film progresses Eliot's behavior becomes more sinister. And as the film literally becomes darker Eliot's motives become less clear. Is Anna really dead? Or is Eliot drugging her so she only thinks she's dead? The answer is surprisingly evasive. At one stage I thought she was definitely dead but then subtle clues made me think she was alive... and then 10 minutes later I was convinced again she was dead! The strength of the film is that you're never quite sure until the very end.The performances were incredible. Liam Neeson's looks were enough to send chills down my spine. An amazing actor. Christina Ricci was very convincing and very sexy! And Justin Long was surprisingly good in a serious role although the film was also darkly humorous in places.A strong intelligent story. Great performances. But it was the overall look that really blew me away. Beautiful colors and striking visuals  especially with Anna in a vibrant red slip lying on a white slab in a cold gray room. Stunning! This unusual and very original film will not be to everyone's taste but audiences who enjoy thoughtful provocative filmmaking will be delighted to find something in the theaters that's not a gorefest or comic book.".

It's one of the great mysteries of life and one that people have been contemplating for centuries. Agnieszka Vosloo's take is very original and very compelling there's a transitional period between our death and when we buried. A period when we have time to reflect on our past and come to terms with our death and life!.It's an intelligent film but also a highly commercial one. Great performances from an A list cast. Liam Neeson in particular was devastatingly good in the lead role as the funeral director. He was believable as both a kindhearted angel helping people transition to the afterlife and as a sinister psycho who may be burying people alive. Both interpretations were equally plausible we never know the truth until the very end of the film and even then my boyfriend was convinced she was dead all the time while I think she was alive!.An intelligent scary creepy stunning visual movie!!! It should be a huge hit if well marketed. I can't wait for it to come to the cinemas hopefully soon so I can watch it again. This is definitely the sort of movie that you could watch more than once and discover fresh things on each viewing. I haven't heard of this director before but based on this film she'll surely have a great career ahead of her. I can't wait to see what she does next.".

It seems to have a ground truth but presents a world that violates that truth.I've read on the forums here that the director's commentary claims that Anna was alive and that the funeral director killed her.This may have been the director's or the writer's intent but there are also story elements that indicate something else is going on. We see dream and hallucination sequences that seem to contain information the dreamer wouldn't know. There is a bobblehead doll that turns to face Paul as he walks around the room.The idea that a living Anna wouldn't fight more completely breaks my suspension of disbelief. She doesn't seem to eat for days or have other bodily functions.In the end this is just a movie. The director's intent in telling a story does not make it fact. There is no ground truth in reality and not even a decent facsimile in fiction. The film was shot edited and acted very well but no level of production quality can make up for a poorly written story.If you would like a visceral thriller built around the theme of an idea you will probably enjoy this. If you are looking for a well thought out supernatural mystery you will be disappointed.".

Though its Southwestern locations Indio California was used are both a bit too sparse and modern to suit the source material in every other way this captures the ineffable aura of Jim Thompson's prose and anyone who's actually READ The Getaway knows how utterly impossible a task translating his best effects to film really is. Director Foley has done a splendid job in setting a tone of dreamlike sunburned melancholy and maintaining it throughout aided immeasurably by fine performances by Rachel Ward  Bruce Dern and an absolutely riveting one by Jason Patric. I had faint hopes for this film before seeing it due mostly to Patric in the lead I was floored watching it and all DUE to Patric's performance. Though a little young for the part he captures perfectly the likable ambivalence and roiling inner pathology of the Jim Thompson Hero you never stop feeling for the guy even as you know he will inevitably be compelled by his inner torments to do monstrous things before the story ends. Patric's complete immersion into Kid Collins steals a little thunder from one of Bruce Dern's most chillingly indelible portrayals of slime personified Uncle Bud. Fans of Dennis Hopper's Frank Booth from BLUE VELVET would take to Uncle Bud immediately I think. More than any other film adaptation of Thompson AFTER DARK even more than THE GRIFTERS  embodies that peculiar cowtown existentialism of his that tells us we're each of us alone in a world where things start bad and only get worse pretending we're sane the way kids pretend there's a Santa Claus. A film without an audience in 1990 but little by little year by year a growing and appreciative audience is building. See this movie.".

Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward give possibly the best performances of their careers.  And the always phenomenal Bruce Dern might have even toped him self with this one.

While not a perfect film noir AFTER DARK MY SWEET is a particularly unusual one in that it uses bright atmospherics as opposed to the standard dark ones used to enhance the downward decadence of the material.  This picture was made at a time when pulp novelist Thompson was getting a bit of a revival on screen with a remake of THE GETAWAY and a nifty film version of THE GRIFTERS.  The remarkable French film COUP DE TORCHON also based on a Thompson novel entitled POP. 1280 uses the same bright noir approach.   AFTER DARK MY SWEET stands admirably along side all these films as a relevant tribute to a writer who often exposed people's dark anxieties with tough stylish precision!

And although the film was no huge hit when it was released After Dark My Sweet was at the beginning of a new trend the neonoir film. John  Diehl would later impress us with Last Seduction and Red Rock West but while those noirs had the style of the older genre After Dark...has the dialogue and attitude of old the words coming out of Patrick's mouth are clearly classic Jim Thompson. That sort of dementia a kind of poetry is hard to fake. James Foley has translated the novel to screen without losing the feel. When Collie is flashingback to his boxing days our heart races with him. When Collie recalls all of his past regrets and his own selfloathing the sound of his voice and the words he is speaking are haunting and haunted. Jason Patric's performance is his best he is pathetic yet endearing stupid but savvy. A tough role to pull off but he does it in true shaggydog ease. Rachel Ward and Bruce Dernalways the crazy one play good backup especially Ward with her 1940'sera fastspeak witty banter straight out of Barbara Stanwick movies. But this is Patrick's and Thompson's show.Bravo to James Foley for this topnotch adaption of Jim Thompson's nightmarish reality one that is desperate and lifethreatening and sometimes all too real.".

It seems that most of the truly great noirs of the last two or three decades have taken place in the South where the men glisten and the ladies um glisten too. Why? Because it's hooooottttttttttt. And because everyone looks better wet at least the men do  sweaty women leave me clammy. Anyway  there might be some spoilers in here. This film is a wonderful example of everything a noir should be  steady pacing though some with attention disorders refer to it as 'slow' clearly and broadly drawn though not simple characters and tons of atmosphere. Noir if anything is about moods and attitudes. That's why the great ones are not marked by your traditional definitions of 'great' acting look at Bogart Mitchum Hurt and Nicholson  they and their characters were anything but real  but they had style and sass and in a crime movie that's exactly what you want. or quickly paced adventures again all great noirs seem to be on slow burn like a cigarette. Great noirs create an environment and you just inhabit it with the characters for a couple hours. After Dark My Sweet let's you do that  and it let's you enjoy the company of some very interesting and complex characters. Uncle Bud and Collie are intriguing  never allowing the audience to know what really makes them tick  and Patric and Dern I love Bruce Dern by the way are pitch perfect Dern especially see previous comment. They take the basic outlines of a character and give them depth and elicit our sympathies. The story itself is also interesting. There're better plots in the world of noir hardly any mystery here  mostly it's suspense but this one is solid. If anything the simply 'okay' plot has more to do with Jim Thompson's writing than anything else. With Thompson plots are almost secondary he eschewed the labyrinthine tales of Hammett and Chandler for simpler stories with stronger more confusing characters. Look at a novel like The Killer Inside Me and and you'll see right away from the title what it's all about. When it comes to Thompson it's not what it's about it's how it's about it to quote Roger Ebert. So really the relatively simple plot of a kidnapping is not the point and if you don't like it well the jokes on you. Why this is an 8star movie rather than a 10star one is because of the female lead. She's not bad per se but she's not Angelica Huston or Anette benning see the adaptation of Jim Thompson's The Grifters if you don't know what I'm talking about  besides it's a better movie and you should start there for contemporary noir  it's the best of the 1990s and challenges Blood Simple for the title of best since Chinatown. She simply doesn't have the chops or the looks for that matter and though she and Patric have some chemistry I don't have it with her. So there.".

Brian De Palma Noir is dead for me because historically I think it's a simple view. I've taken it as far as it can go. I think I've expanded on it a great deal taken it further than any other American novelist.  James Ellroy After Dark My Sweet is an atmospheric neonoir in which a mentally handicapped man is suckered into kidnapping a child. This may sound like a familiar noir plot  and it is  but the film nevertheless does several interesting things.Firstly instead of a femme fatale seducing our noir hero into committing a crime we have an elderly man played by Bruce Dern. Because Bruce is a sort of surrogate femme fatale figure who seduces the girl into seducing our protagonist we're never quite sure how involved in the criminal scheme the film's female character is. Is she innocent? Is she a pawn? Who is really pulling the strings? Secondly we're never quite sure if our noir hero is really mentally handicapped. Is it an act? Is he really mentally disabled? Is he simply playing everyone for a fool? Because the film deliberately withholds information we get a slightly different rift on noir. Yes there is a malevolent noir God pulling the strings the crime goes vastly awry but what the film does differently is extend this conspiracy in such a way that the principal characters themselves do not know which roles they play.In this regard the film serves as a modern update of Detour a famous low budget noir narrated by a possibly insane wholly unreliable narrator. Here the unreliability extends 4 ways the three characters and the camera.810  This is an archetypal story which though it betters similar neonoir fare Body Heat Kill Me Again Red Rock West Blood Simple Memento Bound The Last Seduction Jade etc still suffers from the problem which James Ellroy tries to articulate above.Made in the 1980s and 90s these films emulate noir narratives of the 1940s and 50s a framework which was put to rest in Blast of Silence arguably the last of the classical noirs. True modern noirs XFiles series The Wire Twin Peaks Inland Empire Eyes Wide Shut Mulholland Drive etc offshoots of the conspiracy thrillers of the 1970s are virtually incomparable to neo and classical noirs positing far larger worlds global narratives that are always in flux and never resolved.Worth one viewing.".

As happens with such schemes things go awry the kid turns out to be a diabetic for one thing and it falls to Patric to put matters right by a supreme act of selfsacrifice.But the somnolent pace and elliptical plotting that worked in Thompson's telling sit uncomfortably on the screen.

For instance the solicitous attraction felt by the 50yearold bachelor doctor George Dickerson toward Patric can only be homoerotic. While Thompson chafing under the constraints of his time left that to be distantly inferred there's no reason to be coy about it more than 30 years later there's little coy about the lovemaking between Ward and Patric.

And the long fuse between Ward and Patric sputters on and on the movie could only be improved by losing half an hour of downing drinks and exchanging alternating glances of hatred and lust.  The best thing about After Dark My Sweet is Patric's performance even if in keeping with the fads of the 1950s it gives off too many whiffs of method.'  At least he gives the role his best shot.  The movie's flaws however can't be ascribed to Thompson.  Latterday filmings of his work like The Grifters of the same year and especially The KillOff a year before show there's plenty of punch left in the old pulpmeister.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this as part of my cinematic Jim Thompson quest.It's a subject of debate whether or not neo noir is really importantly noir. What used to be a type of film that spoke of a life in the city as disorienting and the beginning of illusions in the mind born from it is now merely a template and what used to be a socially conscious film that directly addressed the fabric of its world is now only cinematically conscious maneuvre. Neo noir is not so much an expression then as it is an idiom.This is an intriguing study of that noir cosmos in cinematic terms.We have the hapless exboxer schmuck who's taken one too many beatings in the ring enter a world that seems to be lying in wait for him specifically him to set it in motion. He's foiled in an ensuing kidnap scheme so far a traditional noir device where the fates pull the strings. Here comes the revision though.By becoming aware of another scheme to which he is the victim he's no longer swept up in this world. The movie then presents us with a situation where by effecting control upon that preexisting world by realizing that he's part of a noir narrative and that he won't simply consign to be the cog he imagines his own noir narrative in which the woman his only chance for redemption can be nothing else but the femme fatale.This idea is born in him out of suspicion for a world he sees where no one cares or loves. This world which the femme fatale codifies with her presence in film noir is here refuted by the actual woman thought to be the femme fatale  instead she represents the salvation of a genuine contact.We share for all this his point of view.

	onyx:emotionText "I saw this as part of my cinematic Jim Thompson quest.It's a subject of debate whether or not neo noir is really importantly noir. What used to be a type of film that spoke of a life in the city as disorienting and the beginning of illusions in the mind born from it is now merely a template and what used to be a socially conscious film that directly addressed the fabric of its world is now only cinematically conscious maneuvre. Neo noir is not so much an expression then as it is an idiom.This is an intriguing study of that noir cosmos in cinematic terms.We have the hapless exboxer schmuck who's taken one too many beatings in the ring enter a world that seems to be lying in wait for him specifically him to set it in motion. He's foiled in an ensuing kidnap scheme so far a traditional noir device where the fates pull the strings. Here comes the revision though.By becoming aware of another scheme to which he is the victim he's no longer swept up in this world. The movie then presents us with a situation where by effecting control upon that preexisting world by realizing that he's part of a noir narrative and that he won't simply consign to be the cog he imagines his own noir narrative in which the woman his only chance for redemption can be nothing else but the femme fatale.This idea is born in him out of suspicion for a world he sees where no one cares or loves. This world which the femme fatale codifies with her presence in film noir is here refuted by the actual woman thought to be the femme fatale  instead she represents the salvation of a genuine contact.We share for all this his point of view.

	schema:reviewBody "After Dark My Sweet is a film with a classic noir setup a desperate man teams up with a violent drifter and an alcoholic widow to kidnap a rich child. Director James Foley takes this plot and makes the best film that could possibly have been made with an already good premise. It helps that this is based on a short novel by Jim Thompson a writer whose pulpy crime plotswhich focus more on twisted characters than plot detailsseem to work especially well on the screen.The main character here is exboxer Kid Collins a drifter who is troubled by an incident from his past. He's so troubled that he seems strange to everyone he encounters this inspires extreme reactions so that people he has just met are equally as likely to try physical violence on him as they are to try to take him home. His skewed perspective is especially well represented by scenes that suddenly end with jarring transitions that seem to strike like lightning. Troubled as he is he usually seems to have the best interests of others at heart. Given a chance to escape the plot he's about to be pulled into he refuses it because he sees a chance for a real connection with the widow.So this film has all the best elements of noir a troubled antihero a desperate criminal plot and a sense of weary inevitability in the way the plot unfolds. The visuals editing direction and acting are all top notch and this has one of those great endings that gives the viewer a new way to look at everything that has happened before. This compares well with the best noir and neonoir films ever made in fact I'm shocked by its obscurity.".

	schema:reviewBody "What's worse than a leatherfaced madman chasing you through the bush with a chainsaw? How about three!!Wrong Turn' stars Desmond Harrington as Chris Finn a man who is late for a very important interview. Finn takes a back country road to avoid a traffic jam and ends up involved in a car accident with three debutantes Eliza Dushku Lindy Booth and Emmanuelle Chriqui and their boyfriends Jeremy Sisto and Kevin Zegers. The group splits up as they try to find some help. Unbeknownst to them they are being stalked by an unspeakable horror. Living in the woods around the crash is a family of cannibalistic mountain men who are overtly grotesque from generations of incest. Before the group knows it they are in a fight for their very lives.Wrong Turn' was in one word an utter shock to the system. There hasn't been a film this gory grotesque and chilling in a very long time. Not since the 1970's Texas Chainsaw Massacre' has a horror film such as this been made. The best way to describe the experience is that if you took 2001's Joy Ride' and Jeepers Creepers' added 1972's Deliverance' then threw them all in a blender. You may come up with Wrong Turn'.The tension in this film is harrowing and relentless as it bats you back and forth. You are exhausted and maybe even queasy when you come out of the theatre. But if you love horror films then you probably have an ear to ear grin as well.I really liked some of the early editing of this film by director Rob Schmidt who allows the scares and shocks to come with brilliant accuracy. I also liked how Schmidt barely shows the mountain men throughout the film. The parts we do see are horrific but the filmmaker relies heavily on the chase and shock than on the gore. Schmidt could have easily dived down the gore shoot to hell but he made a wise choice that works in spades.It's the film's harrowing tension and atmospheric pursuit that overshadows the young stars that make up the cast. Dushku is strong and emulates some of her Buffy the Vampire Slayer' character Faith in her portrayal here. Dushku loves to play debutantes with edge and her character here has a lot of it. I wasn't extremely familiar with Desmond Harrington before this film but he plays a good leading man. The rest of the cast play typical generic 20somethings from the horror film franchises of old. I have always liked Lindy Booth but she has nothing to play with here and the same is goes for Jeremy Sisto. But come on this isn't exactly an intelligently written and detailed drama.I liked Wrong Turn' purely because of its shock value and its no holds barred return to classic horror. It is always in your face and it doesn't let go till the credits. This film isn't for the faint of heart. What a rush! 3.5 out of 5 So Says the Soothsayer.".

	schema:reviewBody "I decided to see this movie mainly out of boredom plus an eyefriendly cast was promised so i basically thought it'd turn out to be another standard popcorn horror flick. Thankfully what i discovered was notably more enjoyable.Yes it is true to say that it does follow along the same vein as many other horror movies in that many key aspects of it are quiet predictable. However in spite of this a distinct empathy can be felt for the majority of the protagonists who you really don't want to fail victim to the insane murderous mountain psychos. Not alone this but I feel that it is safe to proclaim as i'm sure have and will many others that the atmosphere is one of well created nail biting tension which lasts throughout the duration of the film.In fact I found the atmosphere that the movie exuded to be so compelling that I failed to notice certain flaws that would normally aggravate me in a film. I of course will refrain from elaborating on these details so as not to spoil the viewing for those who have yet to see it.What I really liked about this film was that it didn't try what so many other horror movies as of the last seven years or so haave tried and that is to be ironic. It is just a horror movie with the distinct and generally successful aim of scaring and entertaining. Its atmosphere undeniably achieves this however its not alone it is true to say that this film is not for the squeamish. Several scenes prove to be quite graphic.In this respect I would have to admit that Wrong Turn doesn't have the makings of changing the world of movies as we know it but it does however have the capacity to push you to the edge of your seat.

	onyx:emotionText "I decided to see this movie mainly out of boredom plus an eyefriendly cast was promised so i basically thought it'd turn out to be another standard popcorn horror flick. Thankfully what i discovered was notably more enjoyable.Yes it is true to say that it does follow along the same vein as many other horror movies in that many key aspects of it are quiet predictable. However in spite of this a distinct empathy can be felt for the majority of the protagonists who you really don't want to fail victim to the insane murderous mountain psychos. Not alone this but I feel that it is safe to proclaim as i'm sure have and will many others that the atmosphere is one of well created nail biting tension which lasts throughout the duration of the film.In fact I found the atmosphere that the movie exuded to be so compelling that I failed to notice certain flaws that would normally aggravate me in a film. I of course will refrain from elaborating on these details so as not to spoil the viewing for those who have yet to see it.What I really liked about this film was that it didn't try what so many other horror movies as of the last seven years or so haave tried and that is to be ironic. It is just a horror movie with the distinct and generally successful aim of scaring and entertaining. Its atmosphere undeniably achieves this however its not alone it is true to say that this film is not for the squeamish. Several scenes prove to be quite graphic.In this respect I would have to admit that Wrong Turn doesn't have the makings of changing the world of movies as we know it but it does however have the capacity to push you to the edge of your seat. My advice is if you're a horror fan its well worth the watch!";

We have seen this before in Texas Chainsaw Massacre and more recently in XFiles Episode Home. A group of young adults are stranded deep in the woods of West Virginia and are hunted by a family of cannibalistic freaks. Wrong Turn is very predictable and the gore is abundant but the film is delivered in an inyourface style which kept me interested.  The acting is on par with most slasher flicks which is good enough to get the point across.  All in all it was a good waste of a boring thursday evening.I do want to spoil much but the tree top chase is very well done.  Any fan of the genre might be surprised by Wrong Turn...I was.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wrong Turn is about a group of 6 people in two different cars make a wrong turn hence the movie title in the back woods of West Virginia. One car runs over some barbed wire which leaves them stranded in the middle of the road when another car crashes into it due to not paying attention. They are in the middle of a forest where cell phones get no reception and not a gas station or any other convenience for miles and miles. Most of the group decide to walk back the way they came in hopes of finding help while a couple stay behind with the vehicles. This is where the mountain men begin their murder spree. They obviously began well before the movie started but for these 6 people this is where it starts. It is also probably the most graphic and creepy part of the movie.The special effects on the mountain men were great. They remind me of someone but I can not put my finger on it. They were creepy enough in the way they walked and grunted that they were not too much of a joke. I would probably run from these people if I was alone in the woods. Much better than the Boogeyman from Boogeyman anyways. Some characteristics remind me of the main monster in Monster Man though.I thought the cast for this movie was great. I have always been a big fan of Eliza Dushku and the other two girls Emmanuelle Chriqui and Lindy Booth were no slouches themselves. In fact if there were 3 girls to be stranded somewhere with I would have no problem if it were these 3. You could certainly do a lot worse.The only guy in the movie that annoyed me was thankfully knocked off first. It was like they were reading my mind. Jeremy Sisto and Desmond Harrington were pretty likable and did a good job overall. The acting in this movie was pretty good especially considering it was a horror movie.The movie borrowed a little bit from a lot of different movies most notably Deliverance which one of the characters even mentions by name but in todays day and age when we have seen it all it was a pretty good effort. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Wrong Turn tells the story of Chris Flynn Desmond Harrington a doctor who gets stranded in the middle of nowhere after being late for an important meeting. In hopes of getting to his final destination in time Chris takes a back road through the woods of West Virginia to avoid the traffic jam and accidentally crashes into a car which belongs to a group of friends led by the somewhat bitchy heroine Jessie Burlingame Eliza Dushku. Having two wrecked cars the group decides to wander through the woods in hopes of getting help unaware that they are about to get stalked and killed off onebyone by a group of hideously deformed inbred family who has been living and feeding with human flesh in that area for more than 30 years.Having seen the film countless times before I was always strangely fascinated by it but I never truly understood why. I did always love it but there was always something about it I just really dug. Having seen the film again now I've finally realized what and the reason is very simple  the film is just a very welldone homage to all those badass 70s Horror films and just combines the highlights of those flicks in one simple and highlyenjoyable Slasher film.Another reason why I probably like this movie so much is because of its fantastic and unique eerie atmosphere. Throughout the whole movie you repeatedly get that uncomfortable feeling of being watched by someone and the scares which constantly appear through the movie just add to the atmosphere. The tension and the special effects are very well done too thanks to Stan Winston who creates a really disgusting and menacing inbred family but he does it so good you don't even look at them in that way sure they are scary as hell and look horribly deformed but beneath that all you still do realize they are all just a bunch of humans well at least sort of.The cast is really good too. The two leads Desmond Harrington and the lovely and talented Eliza Dushku do an amazing job here and since they both play likable strong characters you really root for them and want to see them live. The other cast members Jeremy Sisto Lindy Booth and Kevin Zegers are all great actors but they don't have really much to work with here since their characters are basically wasted though Emanuelle Chriqui really stands out and plays the supporting female lead role very good and convincing. Even though you already know from the start who is going to survive there's still plenty of tension and scares present throughout the whole movie so if you think this is just another typical gory Slasher flick  think again.One thing I'm very impressed with here is the directing. Schmidt does a terrific job and you can say he's a horror geek by just watching several clips from the movie. We get some Deliverance references now and then a little bit of Last House on the Left The Hills Have Eyes The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and loads more. The kills are very effective and absolutely gory too so if you are a fan of brutal death scenes you will almost definitely dig the deaths. The film does have some weak points though. Some of the dialog is a bit cheesy in parts and the ending is really predictable clichd and a bit rushed if you ask me but the film still really impressed me and is definitely one of my favorite movies now.So in short  Wrong Turn is a movie you either love or hate. I definitely belong to the first group for a couple of reasons and even though I do realize Wrong Turn is not the best film ever I love every second of it for one simple reason  it's a simple highly enjoyable and scary nobrain throwback to 70s Horror movies so if you're just looking for a fun and gory Horror film Wrong Turn is then definitely a right turn and an amazing film you should definitely not miss! Highly recommended.810".

Good actors a solid storyline that doesn't drag great makeup and visual affects and fast paced directing make this movie a must see for the serious horror fan. Wrong Turn is a great throwback to the classic horror movies of the 70's and 80's with the an excellent production budget which a lot of the older classics simply could not afford to have.Wrong Turn did not disappoint this reviewer and I really think it's too easy to compare this movie to Deliverance as other reviewers have. Regardless I would rather watch these guys chase Eliza Dushku through the woods and up the trees any day than to watch Ned Beatty squeal like a pig!  Wrong turn is a truly scary and very creepy horror film. I get the willies every time I watch it! You really want these characters to make it out alive. Dushku is fantastic in her role as the strong female survivor. She plays it with everything she's got and it shows! The scene in which she is taken back to the cabin and tied to the bed.....well it's a great piece of acting just as good as any of our beloved scream queens from years past.The rest of the cast also delivers consistently throughout the film. All in all this is a great film and a class apart from what has been released to us horror fans in the last few years. I enjoyed it tremendously and would recommend this movie to anyone who is a horror film fan!!".

	schema:reviewBody "A group of six young people find themselves stranded in the mountains of West Virginia. When four members of the group leave to find either help or a phone they stumble upon a cabin that at first appears to be deserted. But what they find in the cabin proves that it is actually inhabited and not the place they want to be when the owners return home. Just as they are making their exit a truck pulls to the front of the house and three inbred mountain men enter the house carrying the dead butchered bodies of their friends with them.What Works Inbred Hillbillies. Movies with backwoods murderous inbred hillbillies have always fascinated me. Some of my favorite movies The Hills Have Eyes The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Final Terror etc. feature this kind of character. These characters are frightening because you know they're based in reality. There really are people out there who look and to a lesser extent act like this. As a bonus the makeup used on Three Finger SawTooth and OneEye is excellent. It's another argument in favor of traditional quality latex makeup.No Jokes. Other than a few bits of comedy that fit within the framework of the plot Wrong Turn is played straight. Most movies made today with this many horror clichs would turn into one big selfreferential jokefest. I'm glad Schmidt avoided going down this road. There is no attempt to go out of the way to create comedy or fill the movie with inappropriate oneliners that only serve to ruin mood and atmosphere.Scenes of Violence. I found many of the scenes of violence particularly well done. These inbred hillbillies are brutal and savage. They care not for human life. Their methods of killing are primitive but effective. One of my favorite scenes involves a bow an arrow and human eye. Nice! What Doesn't Work It's Not West Virginia. My wife is from West Virginia and I've been there any number of times. I could tell almost immediately that the film wasn't actually made in West Virginia. I wasn't surprised to discover that the actual location was Ontario Canada. If you're going to film a movie that is set in West Virginia why not film it in West Virginia? This just bugged me throughout the entire movie.Why doesn't Eliza die? With the exception of Eliza Dushku's character every other victim the inbreeds run across is immediately slaughtered. So why did they or better yet why does the script treat Eliza differently? Why is she spared long enough to be rescued? Obviously I know the answer but it's an inconsistency in Wrong Turn that I didn't appreciate.Wrong Turn is a nice throwback to the 70s movies I grew up with. It's vicious raw brutal and a lot of fun. In short it's my kind of horror movie. Just thinking about the movie should make my family's annual October camping trip to West Virginia a more interesting.".

	schema:reviewBody "I used to disdain Wrong Turn as a hollow derivative of The Hills Have Eyes and for some time actually preferred the sequel until checking it out again recently and rather changing my tune. It is still derivative of The Hills Have Eyes to an extent Wrong Turn being among the earliest of the newer rash of inbred cannibal against resourceful prey films and The Hills Have Eyes being if not the earliest then certainly the first definitive entry in the genre. But the two differ crucially the earlier film comes from a critical eye a director who has watched society and sentenced it while Wrong Turn is simply a fun horror film. And its a whole lot of fun with some rather wonderful traits that do not seem to often appear among later films in the genre or even mainstream horror in general. The key to it all comes in the very first scene as scaling a rock face becomes a terse nightmare for a couple of cannon fodder youths. The girl falls enough to incur broken ribs and likely unconsciousness maybe even broken legs and back but still manages to get up and keep moving. The entertaining fusion of tension and silliness seen here informs the rest of the film and it really works especially since things never aim for truly gruelling nastiness just engagement and fear. Thus the car crash that brings the protagonists together yields less angry recrimination than instead cooperation and good vibes and in the films barmiest moment characters perform feats similar to that which nearly killed Jackie Chan on Armour of God one of them even with a gunshot wound to the leg. And the inbred villains of the piece can wield a bow and arrow like Robin Hood as well as climbing trees like the most fearless of gymnasts. Its all thoroughly silly but great fun at the same time and it never really jars with the more frightening moments there's one real winner of a suspense sequence here unlike say The Hills Have Eyes '06 with its ill fitted marriage of brutality and cheesy action. The gore here is almost well judged as the silliness there isn't a whole lot of grue but whats there is mostly short sharp and effectively savage without any appearance of trying to make the audience sick with realism. A smidgen more would definitely have been beneficial though particularly when the villains are buying the farm. Acting is generally reasonable a stone faced Desmond Harrington bears little charisma but Emmanuelle Chriqui emotes to good effect Kevin Zegers and Lindy Booth make for amusing stoners and in the best written part Jeremy Sisto has chilled out but ultimately heroic ball. And Eliza Dushku delivers mondo hotness which is a big plus. The handiest thing about the characters though is that they are all written sympathetic rather than obnoxious and self absorbed or resolutely vapid there's a sense that the writer cares about them rather than just treating them as cannon fodder and it makes for a much more involving experience. I'm not sure I have any serious complaints about the whole film actually it really rubbed me the right way. Actually I have one it needed nudity. In a fun trashy horror film nudity is virtually an essential and there ain't none here. Still righteous stuff though strong 710 from me.".

	schema:reviewBody "The title is chosen well and from this title it's pretty easy to imagine how our protagonists get into trouble. It all starts out with Chris Flynn Desmond Harrington playing Joey Quinn in 'Dexter' who is out for a job interview but ends up in a huge traffic jam which makes him search for an alternative route. Needless to say that the road he takes is a wrong turn. Driving up a dirt road through mountains and forest he crashes into an other car. Nobody gets seriously hurt and after the initial shock they split up of course after all this is a horror movie. Two stay behind the other four including Chris go to get some help. But they will soon find out that the crash wasn't just an accident and that there are inbred people living around who's help you really don't want. Do not expect a unique storyline or an intriguing plot as you will not find it. It's all basically your typical horrorslasher clich. But is that always a problem? I would say no. The good thing about Wrong Turn is that it never gets boring. I have seen many horror movies and though I do definitely prefer a movie with an original storyline at times it's just really entertaining to see an average story worked out well enough without any real pretensions. There's a 'pleasant' creepy tension that goes on throughout the film it had me glued to the screen the whole time. It's not a movie in which people get slaughtered nonstop though certainly not everyone survives but what you have is the constant threat that they might get slaughtered any second. Do the characters have much depth? No not really. We see nothing more than some hints about their lives. But again does it matter? Nah.... as long as I am entertained enough I forgive the writers. The actors do a good job in being believable which I d find really important. Eliza Dushku plays her part well as a nobullshit young woman and though at times I couldn't help but seeing her as the sexy vampire slayer Faith Buffy the Vampire Slayer you will not hear me complain about that. Desmond Harrington did a fine job too and he and Eliza had good chemistry going on. Allinall I really liked Wrong Turn. Yes it has many flaws and lacks originality but there is nothing wrong with the acting and it has enough creepiness and tension to add a fine movie to it's genre. If you like the entertainment of 70's  80's horror movies grab yourself some snacks dim the lights and you will have an enjoyable evening on the couch.".

	schema:headline " A terrific 70s style horror flick";
	schema:reviewBody "After seeing Wrong Turn I decided to look back at other Stan Winston produced movies to see what I may have missed by him. Stan is a special effects master who has created scary monsters for some great flicks Alien Predator Artificial Intelligence Edward Scissorhands Chiller The Hand and more. Wrong Turn begins by introducing you to some very real characters during daytime and in bright sunlight. The plot begins with an intelligent med student Desmond Harrington trying to reach a destination but coming across a traffic jam on a main route through a mountain pass somewhere in West Virginia. He decides to make a Uturn and soon afterward finds a shortcut through some very rural woods of WVA. Or so he thinks! He quickly meets up with a stalled vehicle in the road belonging to four campers thru an accident he has with their car destroying both vehicles while no one is hurt. They are all effectively stranded in the middle of nowhere. They begin looking for a way to communicate with the outside world. Cellphones are useless out here. As they begin their search we discover they are being stalked by some awful looking inbreds this flick's monsters. The monsters are actually disfigured people who capture any unfortunate souls who happen to travel down the road into their neck of the woods. The main characters stumble right into the empty homestead belonging to these inbreds early in the story which serves to make for some intriguing discoveries about the nature of their stalkers. At this point the story turns to a chase of sorts with the intelligence of the quarry sometimes helping gain a foothold on their stalkers. You find yourself deeply involved in the movie pushing all else aside as you start rooting for the stalked as they disappear one by one until the survivors finally rise to the challenge as you find yourself cheering them on screaming Yes! as they start to get the upper hand on their madmen stalkers! There are some terrific graphics which I haven't seen in other films. I watched the original theatrical version on a whim not knowing that my money would be so wellspent. I would like to point out that there's some good talent being splashed around on the screen here both in the main characters played by Desmond Harington and Elisha Dushku as well as in the supporting cast of Jeremy Sisto Emmanuelle Chriqui Kevin Zegers and Lindy Booth. I love this cast and would like to see them reunite for a second effort possibly in an entirely different setting  maybe for a great haunted mansion flick. I'd give this movie an A.".

Well I am glad I watched it as it was better than I thought it would be.Chris Finn Desmond Harrington is on his way to a job interview and is driving through the mountains of West Virginia. There is then a chemical spill on the road so being short on time he decides to take a different route an abandoned dirt road in the middle of nowhere. He then by accident crashes into a car sitting in the middle of the road. He then meets a group of five friends on a hiking trip who include Jessie Eliza Dushku whom are stranded on the road. Two people stay at the car and another group goes for help only to find a sinister cabin nestled in the West Virgina woods that is home to a trio of cannibalistic mountain men horribly disfigured from years of inbreeding. They then make a mad dash for their lives through out the woods only hoping to make it out alive. But will the trio let them leave their hunting grounds? This is one of those films which are as clich as you can get and the plot is predictable all the way through. But still I did like 'Wrong Turn'. It had more than just the classic kids get lost in the woods and get killed. There was a little spark to it and I loved the fact that the killers were deformed mutated humans who were more closer to real monsters than the more routine big bad guys. One thing I hated is the fact that the actors are so beautiful and glossed over even when they come out of burning towers running through the wild and their throats are parched without water. But I liked it  some of you who may not have seen too many horror movies like me may like it.710".

	schema:headline " A slasher that needs more...well everything!";
	schema:reviewBody "Rating  out of Wrong Turn seemingly has all the ingredients necessary for an effective slasher a good setting and decent premise a very attractive and likable cast memorable makeup and gore effect and a refreshingly unironic tone that reminds us of the days when oldfashioned horror didn't rely on selfconscious humor to pass for entertainment value. In that manner Wrong Turn is actually a little nostalgic not unlike the rest of the recent batch of backwoods horror flicks Cabin Fever House of 1000 Corpses and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake.But aside from two solid setpieces the movie rarely fulfills its admittedly limited potential. The script matters little in this subgenre but there's almost no plot after the illfated teens arrive at the mountain men's cabin. This is about twentyfive minutes into the film after we've already dispensed with the obligatory character intros basically 3 hot chicks and 3 hunky but also surprisingly personable guys and whatever reasons they have for being stranded in the middle of nowhere West Virginia.Everything after that is typical catandmouse filler the killers three inbred cannibalistic hillbillies searching for their prey while our protagonists run and hide behind trees. There's very little in the way of suspense namely because it's so obvious who's going to live and who's going to die and in what order. And because the cast is so small you can't even enjoy a particularly large body count half the main cast is killed off less than forty minutes into the picture.Wrong Turn is also missing much of what makes slasher movies fun to watch explicit nudity and the occasional bit of gratuitous sex. With such an attractive cast Emmanuelle Chriqui is cute and Eliza Dushku and especially Lindy Booth are total hotties the movie regrettably skimps on the goods. Such a complaint probably wouldn't matter if the characters were better developed but despite a talented cast the most interesting aspect characterwise is noting how different a couple Lindy Booth and Kevin Zegers played in Dawn of the Dead. As for the rest of the cast Desmond Harrington is a solid actor but does little more than run grunt and dive headfirst into every dangerous stunt his volunteering for every dangerous move actually makes him pretty likable even when we question his logic. Eliza Dushku simply coasts on her looks and proves that all hottie TV actresses are destined to play a big screen scream queen at least once in their lives while Emmanuelle Chriqui just shrieks her way through her part. Standing out a little is Jeremy Sisto who infuses a bit of humor into an otherwise very disposable role.The forest is something of a disappointment as well. With a potentially excellent setting at his disposal director Rob Schmidt fails to generate any creepy atmosphere in an environment where you'd think atmosphere would almost come naturally to be fair a lot of horror movies also seem to have this problem the last time I saw a forest setting utilized perfectly was in 2003's terrifically frightening Dead End. Despite the fact I've done little more than harp on the film there's no denying that the middle halfhour is occasionally entertaining. There's a semisuspenseful scene set in a vehicular junkyard finally a little variety in setting huh? and another effective sequence set inside a watchtower that segues to an exciting chase atop the branches of some very large trees. The murders are too sparse given the small cast but they're gruesome and memorable and thankfully not as relentlessly cruel as the deaths in Cabin Fever but boast just the right touch of menace and hardedged violence.The three hillbilly killers aren't quite as successful as the gore in fact seeing less of them would have been appreciated considering their grotesque appearance almost crosses into the realm of selfparody. Even The XFiles knew better than that. Anyway whatever momentum the middle halfhour built up comes crashing down in the final minutes with the film actually closing out with an explosion surely a sign of desperation on the part of the screenwriter if he can't come up with any brighter ideas in a slasher I was in fact about to give the movie a  12 until the climax. Overall this is mildly recommended to slasher fans or anyone who wants to gawk at Dushku for a little over an hour. Wrong Turn at least has its heart set in the right place which is more than can be said for most slashers these days.".

Wrong Turn at least has its heart set in the right place which is more than can be said for most slashers these days.";

	schema:reviewBody "Horror films always open with the mandatory jumpstart. This usually consists of a pair of a wandering teenagers looking to have a night of passion together or b innocent and quite frankly stupid passersby who have made a wrong turn. They always make wrong turns. And the baddies always get them  while managing to stay mysteriously O.S. a.k.a. offscreen to those unfamiliar with scriptwriting which I take it the creators of Wrong Turn are indeed familiar with or are either blunderingly naive as they seem to cram their film with millions of horror clichs while managing to still make it plenty fun.What I find amusing is how the idiots in the beginning of the film who die without sympathy get killed in seconds and yet the idiots who are the main characters of our story manage to survive and outwit their hunters  though they seem to display the same keen flair for choosing the worst possible case scenario for every event they encounter. Quick forget the car which will lead us back to civilization  let's flee into the woods and try to outrun them! type of stuff.But I enjoyed Wrong Turn for what it is  a typical horror flick that offers plenty of stupidity and plenty of fun. But yet I do find it smarter than some of the other horror crap hitting the streets these days  much more so than a great many other films I have seen recently. Perhaps that has to do in part with the paranoia of being trapped in a West Virginia forest and being pursued by mutated hillbillies. Or perhaps it also has to do with the great creature effects by the best creature effects artist of motion picture history 4time Oscarwinner Stan Winston whose credits go out to such films as Predator Aliens The Terminator and Jurassic Park to name the more mainstream projects he has worked on. Winston brings a sense of realism to his productions  I swear that the Predator was real I would bet my fortunes on that TRex being more than just a sock puppet. And yet that's all it is  and Winston makes believers out of everyone. If this film had resorted to cheesy CGI effects and a more marketable PG13 rating I would have given it a bad rating  no doubt about it. But this project seems determined to prove good horror films can still be made  the plots and acting and scriptwriting are all still as weak as they were in the 70s such as dialogue typically explaining Let's split up into random pairs of two and go look for the missing person even though there is a killer on the loose and the missing person is undoubtedly dead but we'd better just make sure!.The plot A doctorintraining Chris Desmond Harrington is passing through West Virginia. He has to be in Raleigh in a few hours but there's a traffic jam on the highway. He takes a shortcut through hillbilly town mistake number 1 and stops to ask directions at a gas station owned by a man who looks like the offspring of Elmo and Gollum mistake number 2. He looks at a map and notices a small road leading through the state that will take him right to where he wants to go. He takes this as a good sign even though the manager of the gas station doesn't seem to thing it's a good idea. He takes the route. Mistake number 3.He gets in an accident with a band of six young adults about his age one of whom played by Eliza Dashku is conveniently not with a partner like the other four people. She later gives some lame excuse for why she no longer has a boyfriend  but like that even matters.They split into a group of four and two mistake number 4 and the group of two get killed by shadowy creatures lurking in the woods. The group of four which includes Harrington and Dashku stumble upon a little cabin in the middle of nowhere and decide to go look for a phone inside mistake number 5 6 and 7  it counts for three points since it's so blunderingly stupid a mistake.Fun ensues as a gang of ugly hideous barbaric hillbilly folk come after them with axes and crossbows and Lord knows what else. Winston's effects bring these gruesome characters to life  CGI would have been a huge mistake in this case. I'm not entirely against CGI I just believe it to be overused in too many films nowadays.We know who's going to live and die. We know exactly what happens long before the movie itself seems to. But yet I enjoyed Wrong Turn a lot more than I thought I would. In a time when modern horror films resort to cheesy CGI truly awful acting numerous money shots to attract male audiences and deliver thrills that are less thrilling and scary than some comedies I suppose that it's safe to say I was a bit refreshed by this film. The movie truly disappointed me in its lame corny ending which resulted in me giving it half a star less than I was going to but then it dives into a catchy cliffhanger during the credits which actually had me looking forward to another Wrong Turn.I guess you can say that I made a right turn on this one.3.55 stars.John Ulmer".

As each kid continues to buy it the tension builds and you don't know what's going to happen until the climatic ending. Boy the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was an entertaining movie but if you want to see a cheap poorly made imitation that sucks as much as the female actress breasts bounce in their tshirts then by all means get this movie because it blows.So this young stud Chris played by Desmond Harrington We Were Soldiers is late for a meeting and there is a huge accident on the highway so he back tracks and goes down this dirt road in bumfcked West Virginia where he runs into literally a van full of young adults led by the unexplainable single Jessie played by Eliza Dushku True Lies looking for sex and fun. So when they discover that the road was booby trapped by someone four of the six go looking for help while the remaining red shirts I am sorry I mean teenagers stay with the cars to both die violently. So then the remaining four discover that they are being hunted by crazed killer and run around trying to escape and end up all dying except the main two characters.This movie is a complete ripoff of TCM. The amazing thing is that this movie came out in the same year that the remake of TCM was released. Movie monster and makeup genius Stan Winston produced this movie and for the life of me I don't know why. There is nothing original about this movie the mountain men are poor excuses for 'monsters' the actors with the exception of Dushku were bottom of the barrel obviously collecting a paycheck and getting experience.I have a warm spot for Eliza she was in one of my favorite TV shows Buffy The Vampire Slayer plus she was in a movie with Arnold that's Schwarzenegger and she does have some skill. But this was just the wrong movie for her to be in plus lets face it she has a beautiful face and a hot body with some athletic skill and that is why she was cast in this movie. Hopefully she will get something better in the future.Director Rob Schmidt was completely over his head in the direction. The lighting was often off and he overused every scare tactic that was beaten to death by the endless supply of Friday the 13th movies. Since he has done nothing since lets hope he is a car salesman in Minot North Dakota.Nothing much more to say avoid this movie at all costs. I have watched Disney movies that were more thrilling and Jane Austin movies with more suspense. The DVD is even boring and the commentary is so bad it seemed that the actors and director were bored also. Note to DVD makers when doing commentary for movies don't have large gaps of silence in the commentary it makes bad movies even worse when you can't here it. To punish myself for renting this I am going to get circumcised by a blind doctor who is shell shocked while playing the 1812 overture in his ear.

	schema:headline " This is an underrated Gem of a horror movie!.";
	schema:reviewBody "This film shows you how a horror movie should be done with a good cast good acting and beautiful cinematography. I really enjoyed this film i thought it was very entertaining and the reason this film works is many reasons.1 you have a great location for the story to take place in which is of course deep in the woods miles from civilisation and you get the feeling of dread as the movie goes on which is a good thing in a horror film. 2 the directing and acting are all top notch in my opinion and the music throughout the film is very good. 3 this film has a lot of likeable Characters yes that's right LIKEABLE characters and that's one thing i really like in a horror film! i like having characters we actually care about rather than some stupid bimbo characters that don't matter at all. That way when characters get killed you actually feel sorry for them because you liked them to begin with. That's one of the big reasons this film succeeds because you care about almost everyonethere were maybe one or two i didn't care much for but that's only because i knew nothing about themhowever our four lead characters are extremely likable and sometimes funny and because of this you want them to survive when they get lost out in the woods. This film also holds a lot of tension which is another reason it works well and the film has quite a dark atmosphere and is a little creepy in places too. I will admit this film does have a couple of problems but they are so minor that you barely notice them and the dark atmosphere and tension the film holds more than makes up for it. The film is about a man who is on his way to a job interview and he gets caught up in traffic so he takes another route to try and get to work faster but he ends up taking a wrong turn and he see's a dead animal in the road and gets distracted by it and he accidentally crashes into this other car with flat tires and that's when he gets out and meets all these other people.they are angry about their car at first but then they decide to help him and they all end up helping each other to try and get back home and they end up becoming friends. People say this movie is clich and i will admit yes it is a little bit sometimes like when you have a group of people trapped in the middle of nowhere or when people have no telephone reception or no signal. but those clichs did not bother me because the film was so entertaining and fast paced! and it will make you want to keep watching! and i liked the idea of all these people working together to try and get out of the woods. yes i will admit that it was annoying that their cars had broken down but i understand why that was in the filmthey had to put that in the film so the story could go on! otherwise there would be no story!.I liked the lead actor Desmond Harrington i thought he was a very solid likable character and I like Eliza Dushku her character was also very likable and cool and i wanted her to live. I also really liked Jeremy Sisto's Character Scott i thought he was cool and very funny at times and i also liked the character of his wife i thought she was good in the film too and i really enjoyed her back and forth Dialog with Jeremy Sisto i thought those two were hilarious at times! and they both gave good performances. Those are the sort of characters i like in a horror film they were not stupid or annoying they were fun characters that you like and can have a good laugh with and it made you wan't them to live. of course as the story goes on two people are killed by the hillbillies and our remaining four characters have to try and escape from the woods so they all work together and that's what i liked about the film we had characters that helped each other out so when one person was in trouble another person would help that person out and that's what made them proper characters and that's why they deserved to live and while watching the film you'll wan't them to beat up the hillbillies!. At the end of the film there is a big fight with the hillbillies in their cabin that i thought was very good and exciting. if people want a good suspenseful horror movie that is entertaining then i highly recommend this film because in my eyes this film works! and does everything right! and i thought it was a Great film!.".

That is exactly what Rob Schmidt's horror film Wrong Turn does. It has its typical side with the formula and pretty dense characters but it also has its creative side showing off impressive camerawork cinematography and very amusing effects work. It is what some might call a joyous bloody excursion.The story's plot is standard fare a rushed man Washington takes an unexpected detour to avoid heavy traffic and collides with a group of teenagers who are sexcrazed potsmoking goofballs who have got a flat tire. There's no signal no gas station for miles so some of them inevitably start walking. It is too inevitable that some will stay put and wind up getting hacked to bits by deranged backwoods lunatics who play by their own rules. Their own rules involve jumping screaming running around senselessly and shooting anything that moves.One will say that Wrong Turn is just simple horror fluff resurrected on every horror clich. In a way they're not wrong. The film has more going for it than a lot of other modern pieces. It's 2003 and the seventies style of horror seemed dead. Films didn't want to go back to the past to see what made films like The Hills Have Eyes and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre special. Director Rob Schmidt did. He went back and followed a blueprint once used by classic seventies horror. The turnout doesn't involve any audiencewinks pointless sex scenes or implausible irony. It's sophisticated and sometimes even wholly creepy.I think the main reason for its creepyvibe is the fact that the film knows the importance of suspense and atmosphere. We get some pretty decent buildup before the inevitable kill and the delightful unease of the woodsy setting is utilized very well. Similar to how Eli Roth evoked atmosphere and setting to tell his story in Cabin Fever. The only problem was with that film the payoff was a little loose and short. Here Wrong Turn doesn't stop at look and tries to go the extra mile.If anything the film is entertaining. Short dark entertaining and interesting. It's too bad the film didn't want to go for the full look of a seventies picture by adding film grain and dirt to the lens to give the appearance of a cheap Grindhouse film. I could see that intensifying the whole experience making it scarier than it currently is. But as it stands Wrong Turn is tolerable horrorfare and brutally honest Mapquestmotivation.Starring Desmond Harrington Eliza Dushku Emmanuelle Chriqui Jeremy Sisto and Kevin Zegers.

	schema:reviewBody "Andrew Dominik's The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a deliberately paced stunningly visualized and emotionally charged exploration of the early development of mass media celebrity in America. The film riveted my attention for two hours and 40 minutes and has remained on my mind for several days after my viewing. Although centered on one of the iconic legends of the Old West it is far beyond an updated reincarnation of the Western. It is an epic allegory about the development of the American cult of celebrity and the effects of this obsession on the individuals caught in its web.Visually the film soars beyond anything that has hit the screen since Conrad Hall's final masterpiece with Road to Perdition. Roger Deakins the cinematography genius behind The Shawshank Redemption Kundun and all the Cohen brothers films since The Hudsucker Proxy surpasses his best work. He pulls out all the stops hereintricately orchestrated changes in focus richly textured colors dazzling use of light sources careful manipulations of time powerfully significant fadeins and fadeouts and shots through rain snow and rippled old glassto communicate the story. Deakins' contribution stands out in the railroad train robbery sequence at the beginning of the film. Clearly defined flickering light sources and deep black shadows create a dazzling nightmarish vision that haunts the rest of the film. This sequence alone is worth the price of admission.The richly textured historically precise visual aspects of the film bring to mind Terrence Malick's Days of Heaven and Robert Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller. However instead of the understated realistic performances featured in those films The Assassination of Jesse Jamesshowcases powerful yet still realistic performances by an outstanding ensemble cast.Sam Rockwell as the nottoobright but wellmeaning Charley Ford and MaryLouise Parker as Jesse's loving wife stand out. Yet the film belongs to the two titular leads both of whom deliver the performances of their careers and create characters filled with disturbing contradictions. Brad Pitt's Jesse James is alternately pitiable and terrifyingan affectionate loving father an oldbeforehistime sage an adventurous daredevil an unrepentant bad boy and a vicious sociopath. Casey Affleck's Robin Ford is a complex repellent and tragic character who challenges the audience's complicity in the undercurrents of the film.All in all this is a great filmnot for those seeking the simple pleasures of instant gratification. But definitely worth the attention of those who still believe that movies are an art form.".

This movie delivers on every level of film making be it cinematography acting or writing. Casey Affleck delivers a fantastic performance in how he portrays Robert Ford as the bright eyed fawning kid in a way so sincere it makes the audience uncomfortable even when it shouldn't. Brad Pitt underplays his part as Jesse James hitting all the right notes while never saying much. Exactly the way one would expect an outlaw to act when they have everything in the world to hide. I can't say the movie didn't FEEL two hours and forty minutes long but I never wanted it to end sooner than it did. I guess I just enjoyed the time I got to spend watching these characters for the full running time.I loved this movie. Unfortunately a long western without action is something seemingly impossible to sell to the public these days. It would be to the advantage of the studio to sell this like The English Patient was sold 10 years ago. Just make people feel like ignorant idiots if they don't like it! As much as it pains me to say it I think most people don't care enough to bother seeing what makes this movie so great. The only other option to make this a success is to fool them into THINKING they love the movie. I'm really curious how many folks out there that like the movie agree with me here.".

The only other option to make this a success is to fool them into THINKING they love the movie. I'm really curious how many folks out there that like the movie agree with me here.";

The lengthy title of the film tells all or at least the official version of the story.But was that accepted version the real story? For the first time the Ford brothers Robert and Charley get their due. As played by Casey Affleck Robert Ford was a most complex character indeed. Ford is shown for what he was a moonstruck kid who was brought up on those dime novels and idolized the legendary bandit. The fact that Charley was already riding with the James gang got him into the group.After the last job the James gang pulled and the only Ford was ever in on the Fords kind of attached themselves to Jesse James. Of course the idol is no hero. Brad Pitt plays a most unheroic Jesse.Hints of Pitt's interpretation of Jesse's character are found in the classic portrayal of Jesse James by Tyrone Power. Remember when the laconic Henry Fonda as Frank James dresses Jesse down tells him he's getting mean meaner every day even with some of his own gang members? Power was showing signs of it but we see Pitt as Jesse do some really brutal and cruel things. At the same time he's a loving husband to Mary Louise Parker and doting father to his two children.As good as Pitt is I think the acting honors go to Casey Affleck. His gradual disillusion with his idol is really something to see on the screen. He becomes really scared of Pitt for reasons I won't reveal but were definitely sufficient to want him to get Pitt. We also get to see the Fords sorry aftermath. Things did not go so well for them. Bob Ford did not quite get the acclaim he would have liked as Jesse James became bigger after death than in life.Frank James as played briefly in the beginning is an odd peripheral character in this film. The James brothers did separate some months before Jesse's death. Frank is played by Sam Shepard who has an encounter with young Bob Ford at the beginning of the film and announces to one and all the kid creeps him out. But Jesse likes having the kid follow him around like a puppy dog to his ultimate regret.The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a very good western and we sure don't see too many of them in these times. It's shot in an unusual color almost like one of those sepiatone films that were in vogue for a brief spell. The location shooting was done in western Canada and looks a whole lot more like Missouri then than Missouri does now.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow does this film have style or what? The Assassination of Jesse Jamed by the Coward Robert Ford is one of the longest titles I've ever seen for a film and the movie's runtime follows the same pattern. I have no problem with this. I would sit through a ten hour Jesse James because of the excellent tone given out by director Andrew Dominik. The frozen Missouri Kansas landscapes are a treat for the eyes. The musical score does its job to blend into the film so subtly that I cant imagine the images on the screen without it. The narration neither detracts or adds to the tone although there is one bit of bad editing that confused my friend as to whether the narrator was speaking or a man's voice had been dubbed poorly.Jesse James delves deep into the inner conflicts and emotions of every character. We live with them eat with them and often feel their pain or their confusion. This confusion is often associated with the bipolar nature of the film's central character Jesse James played by none other than Brad Pitt. Casey Affleck delivers a subtle performance here that actually becomes the most effective as the film progresses over its 160 minute running time. I hated Robert Ford for a good portion of the film thought he was so annoying and clingy that it was a wonder Jesse James didn't kill him within the first day of their complex relationship. But then as I sat through the so called gruelling running time of the film I learned to feel for him and understand his motives and attraction for Jesse. But ultimately his childhood comic book worship of the famous outlaw changes.The style of the film is evident in the first frame of passing clouds. Roger Deacon's cinematography is the best I've seen since Conrad Hall's work in Road to Perdition perhaps better. He is definitely winning the Oscar this year between this and No Country For Old Men. There is a scene involving a train robbery where the visuals and utter style blew me away. The lighting and camera direction becomes more subtle and less noticeable after the train scene but does not lessen in quality and pure artistry. There is a topic on the IMDb message boards approaching the topic of whether certain films should be labeled art films. Well all films are works of art some are horrendous some are extraordinary. Well The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is an extraordinary work of art.".

	schema:reviewBody "From writerdirector Andrew Dominik comes the long titled and lengthy timed The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford starring Academy Award nominee Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck. The film in so much of its glory has both positive and negative components that make this an uneasy experience at the movies.Director Dominik has great control of the picture but when the film went into the editing room the film underwent some problems. The film never keeps the momentum to be an amazing picture. The viewer is connected for the first 15 minutes then bored for 10 then enchanted for 45 bored for 15 then comes the anticipated climax and you think its over then it goes on for another half hour. Dominik gives the audience the best understanding of Jesse James possible so we can become better acquainted with him but brings in an slew of different characters that to be perfectly honest I don't care that much about. I believe this might be a example of over character development where we get all the aspects of his life but all we want is Jesse.Last year many critics were stating Brad Pitt gave his best performance ever in Babel however his Jesse James is the best performance of his career by a mile. Pitt wears Jesse like an overgrown coat that you don't want to get rid of. Pitt gives the most tortured endearing and frightening performance of the year thus far. He makes the audience so uncomfortable and awkward yet gives off sensitivity and compassion for a very unlikable and ferocious man. If buzz builds expect Pitt to be a huge contender at the Oscars.Casey Affleck arguably the better actor of the Affleck clan gives the most pathetic annoying and cowardly performance in the last ten years and its brilliant. With his deep admiration for Jesse his Robert Ford is engulfed in Jesse's presence and wants enjoy the moments with him even if he is in fear of him. The finale is truly his show as he stretches out his acting legs and dissolves into a character you can't wait to see offscreen.The cast ensemble is a true revelation as each character as overdeveloped as they might be all bring a sense of humanity charisma and heartbreak to their roles. Sam Rockwell who is on the verge of being a household name and coming his way to a nomination one day plays Charley Ford brother of Robert as magnetic as the character demands. Mary Louise Parker who is one of the better actress' working today goes nowhere as Jesse's wife. This is a role that is very Academy friendly and throws it away in a her limited screen time Sam Shepard who plays the older brother of Jesse shows fear and anguish built up in a man who yearns for emotional freedom from crime. Paul Schneider Jeremy Renner and Garret Dillahunt all turn in exceptional performances and enhance a cast of big name stars. Expect a possible Screen Actors Cast Ensemble nod for these men.Expect a possible and much deserved cinematography nomination for the overdue Roger Deakins which is the strongest technical aspect of the picture. Also a great score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is a possibility along with great costumes by Patricia Norris and perfect art direction by Janice BlackeyGoodine. The appeal is there for the film as a whole but it leaves us floating a little too often in a long river of bravery artistry and commendation. Dominik will likely be cited for some breakthrough director awards with the picture popping up during precursors' season.Get ready for the assassination everyone knows is coming but no one can prepare for. Never has been a film that tells you the entire story in the title and can still surprise the viewer with beautiful cinematic moments.Grade ".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been thinking of a good way to start my review I've been pondering many opening sentences but none of them are close enough to the point so I've decided to just say that this film is perfect in all aspects. When the credits started to roll I didn't move at all I sat staring at the screen just thinking about what I just watched. I was trying to understand if what I just saw was really that good or if I was just thinking it was. The film runs at almost three hours but never looses your attention for one second. It moves forward through dialog that is poetic but increasingly haunting at times.First off the performances. Brad Pitt as Jesse Jame makes you feel that he is a vulnerable person and then at the next second he'll make you completely change all your feelings for him. He doesn't talk much in the film but is none the less flawless. Casey Affleck as Robert Ford is in his best performance ever makes you hate him. His character is very shaky very nervous at times but always seems confident of what he's doing whether it's right of wrong. He steals most of the scenes he's in. The biggest surprise however for me was Sam Rockwell as Charley Ford Robert's brother and Jesse's right hand man. At the beginning of the film you think that Charley is the stupid brother and that Robert is intelligent beyond any standard Charley could reach. At the end of the film though the roles switch. You realize that Robert has been making all the dumb decisions and Charley has been trying to save him by covering them up and usually taking all the crap for it. His last scene was intense and beautiful. One other performance to talk about is Paul Schneider as Dick Liddil an outlaw womanizer. His performance is somewhat comedic but in some scenes he can be the backbone for the drama. I can easily see Pitt getting a Best Actor nomination while Affleck pulls in the Supporting Actor for the win.The musical score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is on par with Clint Mansell's classic Requiem for a Dream score if not better. In the films most horrific scenes the music turns them into something beautiful. You'll want to sit through the end credits just to hear it one more time. The music will draw you back to the film to see it again. The score also fits the tone for the most of the scenes.Andrew Dominik's direction is perfect. He uses the camera in such a unique way that you never miss anything that happens. In one of the film's best scenes he places the camera so that you can only see Pitt's silhouette become meshed into a train's smoke and then reappear seconds later as it pops out. Dominik also wrote the entire script by himself which really shows how versatile he is. He originally wrote the film into a 3hr and 50min cut that the studio made him trash. I can't wait to see that cut.The best thing in the film though is Roger Deakins' cinematography. That is what you gives the feel for the film. The blurry landscapes the wheat fields that Pitt gracefully moves through and the greatest train robbery scene ever on film. It perfectly portrays the landscapes of the old 1800's and everything that took place there. The film is consistent with providing one memorable scene after the other. When the assassination finally happens you'll be sitting in your chair gawking at the screen in amazement of how sudden it happens.I am very proud to say that this is now my favorite film of all time and my definite choice for Best Picture of the year. It brings new flavor to the arthouse scene and never lets you down. I recommend this film to everyone. It truly is a beautiful film.I give it a 10 out of 10".

It's slow and likes to surround its characters with enormous landscapes that almost swallow them whole. But it's also not averse to closeups. Director Dominik who has only made one other film Chopper and it's been seven years since then loves to concentrate on facial expressions as well as body language don't know if I've ever seen a film with this level of attention to body language or maybe it's just not something to which I've ever been lead to pay much attention. The cast is uniformly brilliant. Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck are the titular leads and neither has done as well. Affleck is a revelation. The supporting cast includes Sam Rockwell MaryLouise Parker Jeremy Renner Garrett Dillahunt and Paul Schneider. Andrew Dominik is the star though. There have been plenty of successful Westerns over the past couple of decades but I'd be hardpressed to name a single one out that so beautifully and completely reinvents the genre. 310 to Yuma may well be the big moneymaking Western of the year but I think history will recall it as being the year that The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford was released. It is the best film of the year so far and will be hard to top.".

Brad does not shy away from the real roles and proves time and time again what a brilliant actor he is. Roger Deakins shots are stunning capturing the true beauty that lies within the Canadian rockies. The artistic shots through the old style glass is fantastic. Score is very unorthodox yet amazingly effective.The only downside to the film many say is the running time but I admire that Andrew allowed for the performances of the actors to be the showcase. Many scenes with not a lot of background music just the intense performances.".

Brad does not shy away from the real roles and proves time and time again what a brilliant actor he is. Roger Deakins shots are stunning capturing the true beauty that lies within the Canadian rockies. The artistic shots through the old style glass is fantastic. Score is very unorthodox yet amazingly effective.The only downside to the film many say is the running time but I admire that Andrew allowed for the performances of the actors to be the showcase.

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit looking at some of the other comments here I'm not sure if I and other reviewers saw the same movie. I want the minddulling 240 of my life back.Moreso than even your average Hollywood movie this picture is overlong. Sufficiently overlong in fact that it makes the overblown title seem succinct in comparison it has one of the lowest plottomovieruntime ratios I have ever encountered in cinema. And at least a film like say Koyaanisqatsi does not pretend to involve plot but is more honestly a painting in motion rather than a photoplay. I did not come into this movie expecting a typical shootemup Western. But at the same time some hint of charisma in the portrayal of Jesse James some hint or shadow of how one of the most famous outlaws in American history became famous and even revered would have been appropriate here. This movie relies on telling us Jesse James is revered and having a simpering Robert Ford hanging at his heels for most of the picture like a spineless puppy dog. There is very little in the character himself to suggest even past greatness or charisma. Russell Crowe's Ben Wade in 310 to Yuma illustrates  even and especially outside of the actual shootemup scenes  the kind of charisma the personal presence force of personality what have you that make his gang fanatically loyal to him. There is essentially no trace of this from Brad Pitt's Jesse James. If the viewer's knowledge of history and the film's many narrative assurances weren't constantly reminding us that Jesse James was a Very Great Man you certainly wouldn't guess it from the portrayal of the character here.As for the portrayal of Robert Ford it is overly kind to call the performance nuanced or lowkey it is so lowkey that there might as well not even be any music. The character is weak dull uninteresting and shows very little actual development. Essentially he goes from being a lightlyregarded lightweight who retreats into his Jesse James fantasies to a lightlyregarded lightweight who is spurned by the object of his fantasies to a selfpuffed up caricature of himself cashing in on his notoriety or rather as the film might have us believe the notoriety of Jesse James before someone finally mercifully ends his story and thus the movie.As for the other characters in this film they are sufficiently even more forgettable that I have literally forgotten them. Large stretches of film yawn devoid of anything happening great empty spaces more forsaken than the Western landscapes the cinematography so lovingly dwells upon. Main characters disappear from the screen for long periods of time and their return is heralded by a lethargic second helping of yetincreased tedium.It is true that some of the landscapes and cinematography are quite beautiful  however for around the price of an average movie ticket these days one can instead go to the local chain bookstore and obtain a coffeetable picture book of lovely Western landscapes andor national parks from the bargain bin. I would have greater respect for the camerawork and locations if they were either the backdrop for an interesting story or the centerpiece of a more documentary work in which the open spaces themselves starred. This movie is neither  in fact the lingering shots seem to exist primarily to pad both the movie's alreadybloated runtime and the equally bloated and selfsatisfied egos behind the excretion of this allegedly artistic work.In the end to me a movie may involve skillful work or some measure of importance beyond the creators' selfimportance but if it fails to somehow intrigue me or draw me in or perhaps above all entertain me on some level then I judge it to be a failure. By this standard this picture is an utter failure. It bored me with almost perfect uniformity from beginning to the end to such a degree that the only dramatic tension I experienced was whether I would literally fall asleep in the theater from sheer tedium or simply walk out of the theater in pure disgust at wasted time and money. Sadly I did neither.In retrospect I would rather have had three hours of my life painlessly and instantly excised from my lifespan than have my memories polluted with the remembrance of what is easily one of the most dull and flatout worst movies I have personally experienced.".

	schema:headline " A Shakespearean tragedy with one of the finest performances in history.";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite some pointless narration and irrelevantly blurred editing during the scenes with this narration and the complete mistreatment of one of the finest actresses of the decade The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is easily one of the finest modern films around and certainly one of the best of the year. It plays as a Shakespearean tragedy instead of an outlandish actionfilled western that one would expect when hearing the name Jesse James. Featuring some of the best performances of the decade the film is a wonderful mix of subtle and emotional heartache with biting realistic tension and a beautifully flawed character that everyone can relate to in some way. Slowly the film builds a tension and knowing dissension towards the inevitable downfall of Mr. James. It's a heartbreaking story of one man trying to be remembered and another knowing a betrayal is quickly coming upon him.A contrast between the main characters Jesse James Brad Pitt and Robert Ford Casey Affleck is presented throughout and really shows the truth that Ford is exactly the same as James just at an earlier stage in his life. Jesse was the youngest of three boys and rose above all of them to be the most renowned outlaw in American history. He murdered and stole but gained nothing but respect and admiration from those who heard the stories of his crimes. Of course with all of this fame and the bounty of men he's had work with him and in his trust Jesse knew that a betrayal was soon coming. He averted one before but he can see the end in sight and this time he is welcoming it instead of trying to fight it.This portrayal of James is one of the many things that make this film so brilliant. He's a melancholy brooding bipolar and enraged mess. A man who knows the end is approaching but has come to a point in his life where he doesn't see any reason to try and stop it. We see him for how he truly was instead of the gunslinging charismatic outlaw that James is constantly portrayed as time and time again. This deeply heartbreaking man is perfectly personified by Pitt's awardworthy performance. We see a side of the light breezy Brad Pitt that I personally could never have imagined. He presents so much pain and anguish behind those steely blues that my heart stopped every time he started intently with his eyes ever so lightly filling with tears.I have no hesitation in calling Robert Ford the most tragic character in cinematic history. He is the youngest of five brothers and all day he gets picked on and disrespected so when he sees another man who's the youngest of a number of brothers he begins to idolize him. When he finally gets the chance to meet his hero and work alongside him his tendency to give a bad first impression albeit he is a bit eerie with his strong admiration of the James boys leads to more humiliation from the man he considered to be everything he wanted to grow up into. Obviously this leads the young man into spite and bitter insecurity. He becomes a wreck but in this state of depression he is able to finally realize his true feelings and express them to the world. Due to this Bob begins to get more respect and fear from those around him and the Sheriff decides to capitalize on this bitterness by enlisting Bob in a sortof undercover mission to arrest James though everyone knows there is no way to arrest the man. It can only end in the death of one of the men.Of course the title and any kind of history book reveals who the dead man is and Ford assumes that this will lead to him becoming a legend in the same way that Jesse was. An icon on the morally right side instead of as a criminal. However he is gravely wrong and he's met with more disrespect and tales of him being the biggest coward in American history to match Jesse's status as the biggest and most respected criminal. James was an icon and Ford was just the snake in the grass who stabbed him in the back. This undoubtedly brings more depression to Robert he killed his hero for fame and was forever remembered as a coward who betrayed an icon. And then another man gets the idea that Robert had he was going to murder someone infamous in order to be remembered and with this second murder ends the tragedy that is Robert Ford's life. The man who wanted nothing more than to be Jesse James and became his killer.Casey Affleck's performance is the stuff of cinematic legend. His dynamic brilliance deeply emotional strength and powerful absorption into this fatally flawed character combine to create what is easily one of the best performances I've ever seen and quite simply the best performance of the year so far. I've been a fan of this underrated genius for a long time now and this performance is his best by far and is sure to get him a lot of attention come awards season I could even see an Oscar in his future. He completely steals the show from Pitt who still turns in an excellent portrayal and perfectly embodies a character who just breaks my heart. Casey creates such a nice demeanor and personality for this dangerously awkward young man that makes him one of the most complex and as I said before easily the most tragic character in the history of film in my eyes. A true revelation to modern acting and proof that when you get the right role in the right film you can take it all the way to the top.".

	schema:reviewBody "Until last night I had struggled to find the right opportunity to watch this movie. Sometimes I find a movie that I know I will have to be prepared for to be completely attentive in order to fully appreciate it. This was one of those movies for me. I had been put off by the fact that it was going to be quite a long film which essentially I knew the outcome of before even watching. If you don't know the history behind the real life character of Jesse James before then the title is a real giveaway as to what to expect in terms of its ending  but this is in no way a bad thing. I began to watch this in bed while feeling quite sleepy. I half expected to switch it off halfway through and watch the rest another time. Impossible. Historically the accounts of Jesse James's murder allowed Jesse an immortality through legend. Robert Ford was portrayed as the coward who shot an unarmed man in the back. This movie does not take sides however which allows the viewer a much more open experience. However it does allow the Ford brothers a fairer representation than they have had before. Essentially the movie portrays James and Ford as the characters they were  flawed human beings whose lives were shaped by how they reacted to circumstances around them. Pitt gives an incredible performance as Jesse the man not the legend. He steals and he murders. He does what he deems is necessary. As Ford Affleck is unforgettable. Watching him twist through a range of emotions as he journeys with his hero is intriguing. He is fragile yet vicious torn between feelings of adulation and disgust towards Jesse the man not the legend he envisaged. The cinematography and musical score capture the mood of the movie perfectly. Silence is often preferred to the masculine speeches and action expected of western movies. This gives us time to assess what life would have been like back then. Far more ruralised lonely and silent. But also a ruthless world where your own survival could come at the cost of killing another man. We get to witness cold acts of murder as they are  necessary to the person committing them. This movie is highly engaging from start to finish. The intriguing relationship between James and Ford is a seriously fresh take on actual events. The two and half hours flew by for me which is often the sign of a great movie. The only thing that annoyed me while watching was in the bar scene when Ford has been mocked in a song and announces to a silenced bar who he is. After this he falls on the floor drunk then leaves silently. I think there was serious potential here for a legendary speech to be made by Affleck. It would have given more weight to the argument that Ford's role in the saga has been unfairly misrepresented over time. Perhaps this wasn't done so that the movie could remain neutral to interpretation where a rousing speech may have caused the viewer to sympathise with Ford. Overall I have given the movie 9 out of 10 because it is an unforgettable story and arguably the best western this century. The actual assassination scene remains wide open to interpretation. Do I think James wanted to die? No. But in the moment he dropped his guns I think that he embraced and accepted death.".

Overall I have given the movie 9 out of 10 because it is an unforgettable story and arguably the best western this century. The actual assassination scene remains wide open to interpretation. Do I think James wanted to die? No. But in the moment he dropped his guns I think that he embraced and accepted death.";

Still it has some great acting musical score cinematography with good directing.Casey Affleck has had a great year in acting with this movie and Gone Baby Gone. He gives such a deep authentic and complex performance you could say he deserved an Oscar for it . He has what his brother Ben Affleck does not have dedication to the character and the meanings and purpose they have within them. When I think about his performances and roles in both Gone Baby Gone and this really makes me wonder about myself and my character. Brad Pitt gave a very interesting performance as well but I still did not find it to be that great. At times he was a bit over the top but this is not to say that he was not good.What really transformed this movie was the cinematography and directing. The directing and cinematography really delivered on what the purpose of this movie is. It helped you understand the feelings personalities but most of all the complexities of all the characters involved in the story. The cinematography and music fused together and really made me get a feel for the story and the movie.In a way this movie reflects our society today. The message of this movie was really deep and meaningful saying that everyone plays a role in society even if you don't like your role that is what you are. The public determines your destiny and image. It depicts gang life and how betrayal is the worst act that can be committed and in which loyalty is a must even if you know longer have relations with it. It shows how there always has to be a necessary evil or a scape goat no matter what effect it has on people because people do not want to blame themselves they want to blame others instead. This is movie happens to take place in the west rather than it being a western. This moviestory tries to tell us something that is deeply embedded in our minds and in our society. It displays what we think of ourselves is drastically different of the image of ourselves from other people.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a handsomely mounted filmschool like study of the last days of the infamous James' Gang by director Andrew Dominik. Growing up in awe of Jesse James Brad Pitt Robert Ford Casey Affleck finally gets to live out his dream of living side by side with his idol when his brother Charles Sam Rockwell joins the gang. Young Robert quickly learns that the exploits of the murderous trainrobbers are far from the exciting flights of fancy he grew up reading about in newspapers and dimestore novels. A series of cowardly acts in the wake of doublecrossings and humiliations ultimately lead to the titular event.The style of the film is often visually arresting and downright disturbing especially in the acts of violence which leave the most gruesome parts slightly off camera but are frequently shot and framed in such a way as to maximize shock value and leave an uncomfortable feeling of tension in the theater seats. Dominik sometimes relies too heavily on voiceover narration torn straight from the book upon which the film is based leaving us to assume that aside from dreadfully beautiful photography of passing clouds and desolate Midwestern landscapes he wasn't always sure how he visually wanted to tell the story. This leads to a sometimes snails' pace as the plot unfolds though the haunting Oscarworthy cinematography from Roger Deakins and mesmerizing music score from Nick Cave and Warren Ellis eventually get under your skin even as the hands of the clock seem to move slower as if stuck in a pretty photograph of a nightmare.The acting in the film is superb from all involved. However the performances often blur the line between caricatured scenerychewing and emotional nuance especially from Pitt and Rockwell. While there is some entertainment to be found in the lighter scenes of camaraderie amongst the gang members the audience never really feels anything for the characters aside from sharing their sense of paranoia and fear knowing that around any corner someone will be betrayed and shot. The film also suffers from some scene stealing cameos from James Carville as the governor hellbent on catching Jesse and the otherwise lovely Zooey Deschanel who appears out of nowhere for a few moments about ten minutes after the film should have rightfully ended.When the credits finally rolled I wasn't sure what to make of the film. There's some unforgettable imagery my personal favorite being the almost surreal depiction of the clothmasked robbers waiting in the dark woods as the train comes roaring down the tracks and many commendable artistic elements to be found in the film. If the idea was to leave the audience feeling the era showcased was a tensionriddled and violently lonely existence then the film succeeded wonderfully. Those seeking a more pure entertainment will most assuredly be left stressed and stretched to their limits.".

	schema:headline " Interesting but flawed";
	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to imagine this film being much of a success despite starring Brad Pitt. It's a longhaul slowmoving intensely melancholic and sombre dealing in greypaletted landscapes and skyscapes pauses silences things unsaid as much as things said. Still it's been critically successful and it address questions pertinent to today's society. Fame. Hero worship. The desire to be someone else as an escape from the drudgery of your own life do you want to be like me or do you want to be me?. The realisation that that someone else is just a man just like you and that he perhaps struggles with the same sense of drudgery and hopelessness as you do. Notably the film conveys a sense of the drudgery and sheer hardship of life in the west that many films miss and unlike most other westerns with the exception of 'True Grit' the dialogue often feels authentic  slightly grandiose perhaps stilted to our ears  almost Elizabethan slow deliberate unusual and just right. Roger Ebert comments on the bleak emptiness of the landscape like McCabe and Mrs Miller it was shot in Canada all huge grey skies desolate waving wheatfields snow ice and mud and how because of this because the land is so empty it creates a vacuum demanding men to become legends. As in the Russian drama 'The Return' the landscape becomes almost a character or at least a driving force which partially dictates why the characters behave how they do and what courses of action they take.I say this partly because no explanation is sought or offered by anyone in the film for the gang's actions. This is simply what they do  perhaps to avoid the drudgery of working in a grocery store like Bob or making shoes as Frank suggests he will do perhaps for the money to give themselves a chance of a fuller life. Perhaps simply because in this environment doing anything feels almost like a random act. The film is detached from the characters and the characters are detached from themselves. At one point Jesse speaks about watching himself from outside I look at my red hands and my mean face... and I wonder 'bout that man that's gone so wrong. The state governor comments that while some say Jesse's crimes are revenge on Republicans and people who wronged his family his victims didn't seem to be chosen on account of their political persuasion. In other words he's no political rebel. He's just an outlaw who does what he does  who knows why? That's not important to the governor. He wants the man captured not to understand his motivation. The film should go beyond his concerns though and examine the latter..shouldn't't it? Doesn't it?I'm not convinced that it does and more context of the sort hinted at in the governor's two or three lines might have helped. For all the film's desire for historical accuracy in detail in the bigger picture it's rather sketchy. I'll return to these criticisms later. But still it's a film easy to admire for several reasons the use of space and silence building tension in long drawnout dinnertable conversations. The inexorable build toward death like Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in the West' a dance of death  or a slow deliberately paced walk towards it. It feels like something winding down everyone is aware of impending confrontation but unable to escape from it. People face their deaths with stoicism as if this is what fate has dictated for them as if it is their role to play the gang member Pitt shoots in the back for real or imagined betrayal James himself who glimpses his assassin in a mirror but makes no attempt to dodge the bullet's path.It will probably be admired most for its performances Casey Affleck's insinuating awkward heroworshipper at once understandable and pitiable  bullied insecure unloved  and at once somewhat contemptible annoying and disturbing. Pitt's James  aloof detached melancholy for no clear reason at one point he hints at his desire for death for suicide. Once you've looked over the other side you'll never want to go back into your body he says. Or something of the sort. Then shoots holes into the ice.Ultimately however despite this admiration it's hard to like much less love. It is characterised by the same aloofness I've just discussed in its protagonist. Jesse's occasional mentions of the soul raise the possibility of a deeper philosophical strain which might be somewhat out of place given the dour 'factual' 'realistic' nature of the film such as the vomit that smears Bob Ford's suit when he falls over on a saloon floor but it remains merely a suggestion adding to a vague impression of some sort of inexplicable sadness. Of course James is not simple a psychotic family man. But there's a lack of insight into his character and the other characters in the film. They seem to remain ciphers who simply exist rather than fully fledged human beings who act. James' family seems barely to exist except for occasional shots to show that he has one. The film observes dislikeable characters doing dislikable things the audience is left to judge but are not given that much to base their judgements on despite the slow pace. The film's attitude to its legendary titular character is unclear do we admire him? He's a coldblooded murderer  surely just as much of a coward as Bob Ford. Or is he let off the hook because he's Brad Pitt because he's brooding and handsome and has a family? Ultimately the film is indifferent  neither tragic nor exciting just generally glum it gives the impression of saying more than it actually does. It had the potential to be more than it is and is thus an interesting perhaps necessary but flawed movie.".

The movie was over when James was shot dead. These scenes were unnecessary or at best should have been handled earlier in the story.Regardless Andrew Dominic's debut feature in America  like his Australian debut 'Chopper' marks him as a exceptional talent and I for one hope to see Casey Affleck in progressively more challenging roles.Though 3.10 to Yuma has broader appeal this film is a more significant cinematic achievement.".

	schema:headline " Recapitulating the act of betrayalThe Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford";
	schema:reviewBody "In what could be my favorite film name of alltime The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is much more than its superfluous moniker. From its bloated runtime to its slow methodical pace Andrew Dominik's epic tale contains an inner beauty that allows for all the pretensions one seems to associate with it. Dominik is unrelenting on his quest to tell the story the way he wants it told never compromising by cutting scenes or shortening the name so it will fit on theatre marquees. The film even seems to have been languishing in the doldrums for over a year before finally seeing the light of day. Maybe the time was spent because no one would distribute it without changes and if that is so I'm glad to have waited for its introduction. Had anything been compromised I don't think I would have enjoyed my time nearly as much. Do not expect the wild west or gun fights at every corner. This is not a tale of excess or young guns but instead one of paranoia suspicion friendship and betrayal from all sides.I thought I would be seeing James during his heydays of robbery and murder eventually meeting his demise at the hands of one of his crew. Instead we are introduced to the legend just before his final night ride with brother Frank. It is the last train robbery he undertook before attempting to retire home with his wife and kids that he meets the Ford brothers and their ragtag degenerate friends. James is no longer as Godlike as he might once have been. A shell of his former self he is constantly uprooting his family children who don't even know his real name in fear of capture by the Pinkertons. Always paranoid and untrusting of those around him after all his brother has retired and his normal crew all gone jailed or dead James begins to fear for his safety. By riding to cleanse himself of those that may be conspiring against him he begins a journey that will take him back into the friendship of Robert and Charlie Ford. Whether from depression caused by the memories of all he has done or an escalation of the malice and crazed disposition that allowed him to do it this reunion for a series of planned bank robberies finally leads to his end.Dominik's film is filled to the brim with nuance and subtlety. At every turn we are even quiet moments of the landscape and metered prose of speech slowly contemplated and released into conversation. Everything is orchestrated with great care and each frame a thing of beauty. The film must have been storyboarded like crazy because the compositions of each scene is balanced and gorgeous to behold. From the extreme closeups the smokeladen atmosphere and the visions from behind periodaged impure glass Dominik has taken painstaking care in making sure each second is perfect. Even the narrated moments telling of James' past are vignetted and blurred to give a sense of age and dreamstate. Everything is deliberately timed both enhancing the period being portrayed and adding to the mood and almost nonexistent changes in mental disposition as the wheels turn inside each character's head.All the acting on screen is topnotch. Brad Pitt really shows how good he is as the man behind the stories. This is a time of instability for him as his state of mind causes uncontrollable outbursts of violence followed by fits of laughter at the lapse in control. He realizes that he is not himself anymore and it is this knowledge of his own fallibility that makes him even more cautious of what is happening all around him. Did he deserve the best actor award at Venice this year? I don't know. He is very good possibly close to his best however he was overshadowed to me by costar Casey Affleck's Robert Ford. He truly shines as the young kid able to ride alongside his idol only to be shot down as strange and queer. His joy expressed very openly to his hero comes at a very bad time. Just as James starts to look at everyone more carefully in comes this kid with a dangerous obsession. As Pitt says before sending Ford away I can't tell if you want to be like me or be me. Affleck's performance is one of the years best. The times when he must try and hide the rage bottled up inside while his dreams of being the James Brother's sidekick shatter are tough to watch. From this showing Ford was no coward but a man tired of being kicked while he was down. Perhaps the act of murder itself was cowardly but only because of the circumstances surrounding it. Ford was working for the sheriff in order to capture the criminal but when the opportunity presented itself when James finally realized what was to happen you can't help feel sorry for the 20year old has he wrestles with what is about to transpire.I applaud Dominik for having the courage to create something that is by no means a bankable commodity. For every person that goes to see Brad Pitt's new movie there will be at least three that scoff at the almost threehour duration and slow unfolding of plot. Either way this film is a masterpiece to behold a work of art encapsulating a moment of history. Even the epilogue of what happens to Ford after the assassination helps shape the motivations for all that transpired during the course of the film. It never feels boring and it never shies from the weight it carries on its shoulders. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is simply something that needs to be seen to understand the effect it has and that experience should be at the theatre so its composition and visual splendor can be viewed in all its glory.".

Here's how I think it's supposed to work the movie is shorter than the book and when it comes to biographies and histories the book is shorter than the actual event itself. And since it's live action this is the most important thing we're supposed to be entertained. Compared to this Lawrence of Arabia was a stroll and Dr. Zhivago a short story. This movie was endless and DULLER than thirdgeneration nylon stockings.All credit to Brad Pitt for successfully making this character thoroughly unlikable since we know from Devil's Own he can make the bad guys look somewhat charming with a bad accent. And James' character here is the closest to reality  best since The Long Riders and that was the best until now far better than some of the laughable depictions seen in The Outlaw and the like.But with Jesse as one endlessly scary dude I spent most of the movie waiting for the promised old west justice and wishing I had brought my own six shooter so I could put an end to my misery. No nice daffodils or tulips no sand dunes  nothing to distract me while I'm waiting. And waiting. And waiting. Oh and since there was nothing to wax lyrical about I admired everyone's full mouth of beautiful clean teeth there's historical accuracy for you.Since we all know what happened to Jesse the only surprise is why I sat through the whole damn film.".

	schema:headline " A great film telling the lives of two similar yet very different men";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERSThe Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert Ford is a film that may be offputting because of it's lengthy title. But none the less this is a film that must be seen. The name Jesse James has been one that has always been known people may not know exactly who he is but rest assured they've heard of his name that demands people's attention.SPOILERS BEGIN HERE This film however is in my opinion not about Jesse James and more about Robert Ford. A character that I find very interesting. Casey Affleck portrays the character as soft spoken and very figity. When I first saw the character I couldn't stand him but I deeply enjoyed Jesse James as time progressed however their roles flipped I was rooting for Robert as I saw Jesse become the wild west's Robin Hood and turn into a common gang leader. Robert began in the movie as Jesse's 1 fan and as it progressed he was pushed into developing a deep and complicated resent for him.After a series of events Robert decides to arrest Jesse James and to do that he must become close to him. There are many who do not know how the legendary figure died and it is not in the epic way so many western gun slingers meet their end however for me it was equally intense. Jesse states that he should take his guns off to avoid suspicion in town then after doing so says that a picture of a horse looks dusty he walks over stands on to of a chair and sees Robert's reflection in the picture and does nothing then he is shot. This whole scene historically accurate seems out of character for Jesse James and leads me to believe that he wanted Robert to kill him he previously gave Robert a gun as a present. The ending of the movie has me sympathizing for Robert he felt he would have became a legend and instead....nothing. His life was full of remorse and mixed emotions. In 1892 Ford himself was assassinated by Edward O'Kelly.This is not the type of Western with epic showdowns one would imagine it instead trades it for the intensity Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck bring to these two characters. I highly recommend that if you have even the slightest interest in this movie WATCH IT!".

	schema:headline " Arguably The Most Underrated Movie Ever";
	schema:reviewBody "The background of every outdoor shot is incredible the sky the crops the grass the snow !! Every outdoor shot is like a beautiful painting in motion.Its the most vivid and alive cinematography I remember in any movie. Most movies that have great cinematography tend to make things dark and lean towards noir but in this movie I found the cinematography to be exactly the opposite and far from making things dark and dull the screen just seems so alive. This was the first thing that struck me about this movie and drew me in.The movie is one of the most comprehensive studies of how the fear of a man can paralyse people and how fear can make a man seem invincible to another and how that fear will often lead us to greatly over estimate the situation and the danger present and how that fear will lead us to take drastic steps. Brad Pitt as Jesse James is inspiring and very believable as the feared Jesse James.Jesse James is a bandit robber whatever you might wanna call him that the people are afraid of who chooses to justify his robberies in the name of the civil war and is a hero to all those who are on the same side of the war as him. He has a demigod status among his followers and band members and they say you can never sneak up on Jesse James and you can never betray him for no one knows how but Jesse is always wise to every police party that has ever turned up at his door to arrest him or of any gang member who has even thought of betraying him. There are kids that have grown up reading about his stories. One such kid is Robert Ford who has a whole collection of things related to Jesse James and is encyclopedia on the man. He is a meek kid who has been bullied all his life and who to use a very clichd line has been nobody all his life. He has only ever had one dream that of being Jesse James. During one of the conversations Jesse James in fact clearly asks him Do you want to be LIKE me or do you want to BE me. One day with the help of his elder brother gets to join Jesse James' gang and rob a train and after the job is done Jesse James whose main crew has either retired or in jail takes Robert Ford in his gang. Robert Ford is of course delighted and tries to impress Jesse James all the time including with flattery. Jesse James realises that he has some kind of control over Robert Ford and he uses him for rather unconventional chores like carrying his stuff while shifting house among other things. Jesse James at times finds Robert Ford to be queer and well weird. Robert Ford is subject to ridicule constantly from every member of the gang and at times from Jesse James himself.Jesse James being one of the most renowned criminals of his time has a huge bounty on his and so some gang members are plotting to turn him in and take the bounty himself. Then comes the moment when the hero who has been worshiped for so long falls from grace. Jesse James at one mission opts to take Robert Ford's brother instead of Robert Ford with him and Robert Ford can't take it anymore. In his fury and desire for fame a desire for renown which ever bullied kid has in him he does something drastic and that forces him to live in constant fear of Jesse James and he is worried that if Jesse James finds out what he has done he will be killed and a part of him tells him that Jesse James already knows.This fear paralyses him. Jesse asks Robert Ford and Robert Ford's brother to join him on a trip to rob a bank and they stay at Jesse's House for a day or two. It is here that things reach a boiling point and it is a great study in human nature and drama of how fear can drive someone to take drastic steps out of imagined danger.Brad Pitt as Jesse James is exactly what the character should be and in every scene he is in you know he is in control of the situation. It is however Cassey Affleck who steals the show as the lost self doubting scared self confidence lacking Robert Ford. His performance deserved more recognition than just the academy award nomination that he got for the role. I had seen Cassey Affleck in Gone Baby Gone and found him to be superb but as Robert Ford I think it is one of the most memorable performances of the decade by an actor. The rest of the cast also turn in top level performances.The movie is a very deep study in character development and human drama and human nature. Some might find the pacing in the movie slow so its not a movie for everyone. If the pacing in Shawshank Redemption and Schindler's List was alright for you then you will not find this movie's pacing any problem. Any good story needs time to tell its story and this movie is no different. Another word of caution is that some may have the misconception that this is a typical spaghetti western with lots of fast gun drawing action and shooting. Its not its nothing like a spaghetti western and if you into the movie expecting a lot of gunfire on screen then you will be disappointed. This movie has little mindless action and focuses entirely on the human aspects and is a great study in human nature.All in all I think without doubt that this is one of the most underrated movies of all time.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the films that isn't for everyone because it's a slow and yet realistic film with a lot more talking and drama than action. It just very beautiful to watch though and the realistic approach is done very well. Some audience might be turned off by this film because for a movie about one of the most famous outlaw there is hardly any action in it or robberies. The film is about the last days of Jesse James before his assassination and everything from the acting to the cinematography is done very well. Brad Pitt does what he does best and his acting is top notch he was excellent in portraying Jesse James in a complex and yet charismatic manner. Casey Affleck was perfect for this role in portraying Robert Ford his acting was very believable when trying to act all annoying and cowardly. If your one of those types that don't care for stuff blowing up every minute or constant action you might enjoy this film. It's artistic western with great acting and amazing cinematography showing the ending of Jesse James's career. With that said this film is not for everyone. Most teens will probably be bored by this movie I personally liked this film enough to give it a 810.810".

	onyx:emotionText "This is one of the films that isn't for everyone because it's a slow and yet realistic film with a lot more talking and drama than action. It just very beautiful to watch though and the realistic approach is done very well. Some audience might be turned off by this film because for a movie about one of the most famous outlaw there is hardly any action in it or robberies. The film is about the last days of Jesse James before his assassination and everything from the acting to the cinematography is done very well. Brad Pitt does what he does best and his acting is top notch he was excellent in portraying Jesse James in a complex and yet charismatic manner. Casey Affleck was perfect for this role in portraying Robert Ford his acting was very believable when trying to act all annoying and cowardly. If your one of those types that don't care for stuff blowing up every minute or constant action you might enjoy this film. It's artistic western with great acting and amazing cinematography showing the ending of Jesse James's career. With that said this film is not for everyone. Most teens will probably be bored by this movie I personally liked this film enough to give it a 810.810";

	schema:headline " A Legend Born and a Coward Ignored";
	schema:reviewBody "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford says it all but it has even more than meets the eye. Not only is the title a spoiler but it sums up the two main characters. JESSE JAMES is in BIG BOLD letters like the legend he is while Robert Ford is hardly noticed underneath his name with the publicly attached coward in front it. The title allows us to sit back and enjoy the journey of Robert Ford in his quest to become famous and Jesse James' journey into infamy and legendary myth. The film stars Brad Pitt as the notorious Jesse James. Brad Pitt delivers an incredible performance. This may be his crowing achievement along with the character Tyler Durden which he played to perfection in Fight Club. He plays Jesse James like he's bipolar so we never know what he's thinking or what he's capable of doing at any given minute under any given circumstance. One minute he's jovial and the next he's ripping at Robert Ford's head as he presses a knife to his throat with a demented look in his eyes just screaming of a homicidal maniac. Brad Pitt doesn't play him perfectly and some will notice the infamous Tyler Durden laugh peeking through but it's a great performance that is thoroughly layered with deep dark and buried emotions. It is worthy of a nomination at the very least. Jesse James' past and his actions seem to haunt him. Pitt plays a man suffering from a deep and very dark depression as he tries to hide his inner demons with good nature and laughter. Jesse James always knows what's going on. He's very cerebral in his actions. He's like a homicide detective with his carefully intimidating probing of terrified subjects as he looks for answers but finds nothing but lies. James finds himself all alone surrounded by people that are looking to get paid off by giving him up to the law. He is always on the run and we gradually see him become tired of running and tired of living the way he is. His insomnia keeps him up at all hours as he lives in fear and paranoia. The assassination scene one of the best scenes in the film is incredible and shockingly suspenseful as well as chilling. The pacing in that scene is deliberate and thought provoking which will leave you thinking about it long after you see it.Casey Affleck plays the coward Robert Ford. He is surly Oscar worthy here and undoubtedly gives the performance of his lifetime in a career year  Gone Baby Gone. He plays Robert Ford as a weird meticulous well intentioned admirer of Jesse James thrust into his inner circle. He's the youngest brother of five boys. He's the weak one. He's the one always made fun of. He's always overlooked or looked down upon. Robert Ford is an uncomfortable person to be around and Affleck plays him perfectly as a very odd young man with an obsession of Jesse James  the James gang that cross over boundaries of more than just admiration. He wants to be so much apart of that gang that that's all he has ever wanted since he was a young child reading the fascinating stories of the James gang and his legendary idol Jesse James. He wants the fame and the respect that Jesse has and he wants to be apart of something grand. He wants to know what it feels like to be Jesse James in his shoes. As he joins the gang he starts to feel the pressure of Jesse James and his feelings of the man start to change. When Robert Ford is sent to capture and arrest Jesse James that is when Jesse James becomes haunting as he watches his every move and death seems immanent to both Robert Ford and his brother Charley Sam Rockwell. Robert Ford becomes every bit as famous after the murder as James was then the people stop caring and they start hating. The final act of the film may be the most impressive since we see the kind of backfire stardom can have on you in a celebrity obsessed culture  even in the late 19th century. The journey leading to the assassination and the incredible acting is something to truly admire and become utterly fascinated to watch unfold. The acting was just incredible even with some of the smaller parts especially with the lying and conniving Charley Ford or the funny smart and very creepy Dick Liddil Paul Schneider. The acting on a whole was fantastic and no one upstaged anyone. The four main characters are all fantastic and all very different. The cinematography was absolutely beautiful and mesmerizing this is some of the greatest film has to offer. The scenery is vast and breathtaking. The way some of the images are shot with blurred and distorted edges gives the audience the same feelings of the blurred perceptions between myth and fact. There are several shots through distorted windows giving a blurred outlook on this folklore world that Dominik creates. We never really are sure if something happened this way since the truth has been lost in myth and legend. The set and costume designs were fantastic along with the argot. It feels as if you have been transported back to the late 1880s. It's a slow character study and wonderful cinematic piece of art. The score is both beautiful and haunting matching the tone of the film to perfection. This is one of the decades best films. Andrew Dominik deserves a lot of credit for this masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a really amazing film. All the pieces  props costume camerawork script and acting  fit together as well as the finely crafted parts of a nickelplated revolver. I was surprised I'd not heard more about it.The film tells the story of the James Gang and specifically the fatal relationship of Jesse James and Robert Ford. During the course of the action we see darkness and light in everyone even the coward. Care is taken to finely pare into the psyches of these Outlaws and the cold world they walk in. I think I saw just about every emotion there is to have in these men and we can almost understand even if we can't accept what moves them in their deadly paths.Pitt is both iconic and vulnerable  beautiful and frightening as Jesse James a robber and killer who hoists up a reputation of fearless boss on one shoulder and charming folk hero on another. His character's movement through peril and praise reminds one of the great gangster characters from Scorsese's work with an added rawness that only Pitt and a few others can genuinely summon. His fatalism is also quite entrancing and subtly masterful.Affleck is truly mesmerizing as a born misfit who is so uncomfortable in this world around him that his neuroses if they can be called that really get into your skin. I was reminded of Joaquin Phoenix's role as Comodus but it's even more intense and yet so very believable. As the audience I was torn between pitying the character being utterly disappointed in him and just wanting him to somehow be better. And the script's maturity really comes into play with this character. No one is beyond reproach understanding or grim fate.I'd say that's the main theme here fate.There's no easy formula. No one simply gets what's coming to them. There are no simple villains or heroes. There's just life and the actions taken and the echoes of those actions and eventually an end. It transcends any petty ideas of justice or even legend. It takes a full snapshot of a beautiful and grim reality and lets us just take it in like a corpse on ice. Profound by presentation alone.".

Dragnet is one of the guilty pleasures I have a film that will never be rated as one of the greatest of all time but a film that I split a gut laughing at even though I know all the jokes coming.Dragnet is a satirical version of the famous documentary style police show from the Fifties and the later color version from the sixties. Dan Ackroyd's deadon impersonation of the nononsense monotone Jack Webb that a generation of Americans grew up remembering is excellent. Like Webb he plays it completely straight or maybe I should say straight man.Because he's got a new partner fresh from undercover narcotics in Tom Hanks. Ackroyd's not quite used to the girl chasing motorcycle loving partner that he's been assigned to. He's been brought up in the strict traditions of his Uncle Joe and he has a photograph of Jack Webb on his desk. He's even got Harry Morgan as his captain and we well remember that Harry Morgan was Jack Webb's partner in the sixties version of Dragnet.Anyway the two of them are assigned to investigate an assortment of crimes that a motorcycle gang called the PAGANS are responsible for. I can't explain any more because the plot gets positively surreal from here. All I can say is the laughs never stop.Look for some good supporting performances in addition to those mentioned from Elizabeth Ashley as the new police commissioner Alexandra Paul as 'the virgin Connie Swale' Jack O'Halloran as a Pagan member Kathleen Freeman as a foulmouthed landlady and Dabney Coleman as a Hugh Hefner type publisher.But most of all this film belongs to Christopher Plummer in every scene he's in. He plays the whole thing with a twinkle in his eye when he's being the most sanctimonious as the Reverend Jonathan Whirley. I can't think of a film where Plummer is funnier in or one where it looks like he's having such a good time.The good time is positively infectious.

	schema:reviewBody "It's Saturday November 6. 921 a.m. I've just watched Dragnet.A lot of old television shows have been made into movies. Most of them frankly have been disappointments. I have to say that the movie version of Dragnet is one of the better ones. Based on the cast it should be. I'm not sure you could do any better than casting Dan Aykroyd and Tom Hanks in the lead roles respectively of Sgt. Joe Friday supposedly the greatnephew of the Joe Friday from the series and Tom Hanks as his new partner Pep Streebek. Both played their roles perfectly. Aykroyd was a great satirical take on Jack Webb's character and Hanks was the perfect balance. The supporting cast  with names like Christopher Plummer and Dabney Coleman and Harry Morgan reprising his character of Gannon from a 1969 Dragnet movie who's now the police captain  also made this worth watching.The story has Friday and Streebek investigating some type of pagan cult that's been causing havoc on the streets of the city. Their undercover encounter with the cult at one of its gatherings was hilarious. Overall mind you this isn't an outrageously funny movie. It's more humorous than anything with appeal mostly to those who've seen the original series. If you've never seen the original series a lot of the subtle humour which revolves around Aykroyd's parody of Webb's character will be lost. However for those who do know the original series it's a fun nostalgia trip with a good cast.".

	schema:headline " Great fun.";
	schema:reviewBody "Dragnet is the type of lowbudget 80s movie that you love to love. It's cheesy. It's fun. And it's incredibly stupid. Yet somehow actors Dan Aykroyd and Tom Hanks manage to rise above the material and make this one of the more memorable copbuddy actioncomedies out there.Make no mistake about it Dragnet is not a remake of the worldrenowned and wellloved series. It's a parody. From Aykroyd's contorted facial features that imply he is suffering from a serious case of constipation to Hanks' fun role as his New Age partner this movie knows that it stands no chance against competing with the series itself so it aims for the funny bone. It mimics the biggest copbuddy clichs and television stereotypes and unless you're open enough you may think that the clichs are actually being used seriously. But you'd be wrongfrom the opening credits Dragnet knows exactly what it is doing. And it stays that way throughout the entire film. Well almost.Occasionally it gets a bit TOO cheesy and glossy  the opening credits with a revamped theme song a sacrifice scene fun but nevertheless very silly and the last standard shootoutcarchasebuddy bonding fifteen minutes or so become disappointing. But the film more than makes up for itself in other areas.Dan Aykroyd is strikingly accurate as Joe Friday nephew of the original but still carrying the chiseled features of his uncle the straight hat and freshly ironed suit along with the monotone voice. Just the facts.Tom Hanks is having lots of fun as Streebeck Friday's new partner whoon the first day of work and filling in the shoes of Friday's preceding partnerarrives completely happy and oblivious of his flaws in a brokendown car and illeva wearing shaggy shredded clothes and a big bushy beard. That won't do. Off with the beard in with an ironed blue suit and handsome haircut.The two cops are put on a case involving recent pagan murders. We later find out that P.A.G.A.N. stands for People Against Good and Normalty I wonder how long it took them to come up with that slogan. The leader of the occult is none other than a prominent figure of the city played by the strange Christopher Plummer who seems adamant in proving that he can play dark roles. He personally refers to The Sound of Music as The Sound of Mucus. In short he hates the film for typecasting him as a cheery father figure.Dan Aykroyd seems born to play this role. The Canadian actor has had his fair share of bad films Nothing But Trouble My Girl 2 Feeling Minnesota Crossroads but he's also had his fair share of great films The Blues Brothers Ghostbusters and in my humble opinion the campy cheesy The Great Outdoors. Dragnet ranks as one of his better films and better roleshe plays his character with such ease and joy it's hard to imagine anyone else as Joe. Why is it that films and television shows from the fifties and sixties always named their heroes Frank or Joe?It's clearly evident that Tom Hanks is enjoying himself as Streebeck  and who wouldn't be? He gets to play the laidback new generation cop that doesn't take things as seriously as perhaps they should be taken. Joe Friday seems to have been stuck in some sort of time vault or maybe his uncle overly influenced him. Either way they're complete opposites and it's fun to have Aykroyd marching forward while Hanks hangs back and shrugs his shoulders. Tom Hanks made a lot of fun movies during the eighties. Another guilty pleasure of mine is the lovable Turner and Hootch a film that though clichd and extremely predictable is just as fun as Dragnet. Here Hanks plays the loose cop. There he plays the straight cop and the dog Hootch is the carefree partner. Am I comparing Tom Hanks' character in Dragnet to a dog? Gee I sure hope not.Dragnet is the type of comedy that I classify as a latenight Friday popcorn flick to be enjoyed with some popcorn and soda and all the lights off. It's the type of movie that comes on TBS at two in the morning and if you're a night owl like me is much better at night than during the day. It's a happy comedy that puts a smile on your face. Maybe the fact that I saw it late at night influenced my thoughts on this film but I've seen it countless times since during day and night and I love it.There's plenty of clichs in this movie plenty of OTT scenes and plenty of stupidity.

	onyx:emotionText "Dragnet is the type of lowbudget 80s movie that you love to love. It's cheesy. It's fun. And it's incredibly stupid. Yet somehow actors Dan Aykroyd and Tom Hanks manage to rise above the material and make this one of the more memorable copbuddy actioncomedies out there.Make no mistake about it Dragnet is not a remake of the worldrenowned and wellloved series. It's a parody. From Aykroyd's contorted facial features that imply he is suffering from a serious case of constipation to Hanks' fun role as his New Age partner this movie knows that it stands no chance against competing with the series itself so it aims for the funny bone. It mimics the biggest copbuddy clichs and television stereotypes and unless you're open enough you may think that the clichs are actually being used seriously. But you'd be wrongfrom the opening credits Dragnet knows exactly what it is doing. And it stays that way throughout the entire film. Well almost.Occasionally it gets a bit TOO cheesy and glossy  the opening credits with a revamped theme song a sacrifice scene fun but nevertheless very silly and the last standard shootoutcarchasebuddy bonding fifteen minutes or so become disappointing. But the film more than makes up for itself in other areas.Dan Aykroyd is strikingly accurate as Joe Friday nephew of the original but still carrying the chiseled features of his uncle the straight hat and freshly ironed suit along with the monotone voice. Just the facts.Tom Hanks is having lots of fun as Streebeck Friday's new partner whoon the first day of work and filling in the shoes of Friday's preceding partnerarrives completely happy and oblivious of his flaws in a brokendown car and illeva wearing shaggy shredded clothes and a big bushy beard. That won't do. Off with the beard in with an ironed blue suit and handsome haircut.The two cops are put on a case involving recent pagan murders. We later find out that P.A.G.A.N. stands for People Against Good and Normalty I wonder how long it took them to come up with that slogan. The leader of the occult is none other than a prominent figure of the city played by the strange Christopher Plummer who seems adamant in proving that he can play dark roles. He personally refers to The Sound of Music as The Sound of Mucus. In short he hates the film for typecasting him as a cheery father figure.Dan Aykroyd seems born to play this role. The Canadian actor has had his fair share of bad films Nothing But Trouble My Girl 2 Feeling Minnesota Crossroads but he's also had his fair share of great films The Blues Brothers Ghostbusters and in my humble opinion the campy cheesy The Great Outdoors. Dragnet ranks as one of his better films and better roleshe plays his character with such ease and joy it's hard to imagine anyone else as Joe. Why is it that films and television shows from the fifties and sixties always named their heroes Frank or Joe?It's clearly evident that Tom Hanks is enjoying himself as Streebeck  and who wouldn't be? He gets to play the laidback new generation cop that doesn't take things as seriously as perhaps they should be taken. Joe Friday seems to have been stuck in some sort of time vault or maybe his uncle overly influenced him. Either way they're complete opposites and it's fun to have Aykroyd marching forward while Hanks hangs back and shrugs his shoulders. Tom Hanks made a lot of fun movies during the eighties. Another guilty pleasure of mine is the lovable Turner and Hootch a film that though clichd and extremely predictable is just as fun as Dragnet. Here Hanks plays the loose cop. There he plays the straight cop and the dog Hootch is the carefree partner. Am I comparing Tom Hanks' character in Dragnet to a dog? Gee I sure hope not.Dragnet is the type of comedy that I classify as a latenight Friday popcorn flick to be enjoyed with some popcorn and soda and all the lights off. It's the type of movie that comes on TBS at two in the morning and if you're a night owl like me is much better at night than during the day. It's a happy comedy that puts a smile on your face. Maybe the fact that I saw it late at night influenced my thoughts on this film but I've seen it countless times since during day and night and I love it.There's plenty of clichs in this movie plenty of OTT scenes and plenty of stupidity. But Aykroyd is so good impersonating Jack Webb and Hanks is so funny opposite him Dragnet is a surefire way to spend a Friday night in  or any night in for that matter. And as Joe Friday might say those're the facts.45 stars.John Ulmer";

Those who do not know the original show whether that be because they are too young or simply because they never watched it might enjoy this version on its own merits. Dan Akroyd and Tom Hanks certainly strike an agreeable comic partnership though the story is rather hackneyed even at spoof material level.Sgt Joe Friday nephew of the Jack Webb character from the original TV series and played here as a bythebook stickler by Dan Akroyd is paired with a new partner the loud and cocksure Pep Streebek Tom Hanks. Together they drive the streets of L.A in search of crime and criminals. The mismatched duo find themselves drawn into a case involving a sect of demented cultists who go by the acronym P.A.G.A.N People Against Goodness And Normalcy! The P.A.G.A.Ns are fronted by a powerful leader whose identity is kept from them as he wears a goat's head mask during cult gatherings and rituals. Friday and Streebek infiltrate one of the P.A.G.A.N ceremonies and rescue a virginal young beauty Connie Swaile Alexandra Paul who is to be sacrificed by the cultists. In the ensuing fracas Connie discovers that the goatheaded cult leader is actually Rev Jonathan Whirley Christopher Plummer and for the rest of the picture the trio of Friday Streebek and Connie try to prove to the doubters that the greatly revered Reverend is actually a criminal mastermind of considerable repute and depravity.At 106 minutes the film is pretty brisk and never really taxes one's patience. As mentioned the plot is hackneyed and in truth is never used as anything more than a backcloth against which to highlight some comic set pieces. The comedy itself is amusing though never more I certainly can't think of a line or sequence which I would call hilarious. There was an opportunity here for some witty interplay between the two heroes but generallyspeaking the film tends to reject this opportunity in favour of a more physical and frantic brand of humour. Akroyd is good as the absurdly ruleabiding Friday and Plummer gives an enjoyably villainous turn as the film's sinister smirking bad guy. But the film mainly belongs to Hanks still in the relatively early days of his film career who brings energy and confidence to his role. There's nothing remarkable about Dragnet but it passes the time painlessly enough.".

	schema:headline " The Dan Aykroyd Show";
	schema:reviewBody "'Dragnet' is the movie Dan Aykroyd must have lived his whole life up till then to make. It is truly a moment of cosmic destiny that sees him donning the guise of Sgt. Joe Friday nephew of the original and it fits him like a glove. The film itself has its lags and fizzled gags but Aykroyd himself has never been better. The machinegun verbal delivery he honed to perfection on 'Saturday Night Live' is given its best showcase here and even though Tom Hanks is on board as well and is very likable and funny make no mistake this is Dan Aykroyd's show all the way. The best moments of 'Dragnet' come when he spews his rapidfire dialogue at anyone and everyone quoting regulations lecturing bad guys and coworkers alike on everything from sex to zoo animals declaring his love for Los Angeles and its police department and generally being so straight a straightarrow you wonder if he's ever told a lie in his life. Conviction is one thing that Aykroyd's Joe Friday is definitely not lacking. And that is really the fun of 'Dragnet' it takes you inside Friday's world a place without too much in common with modernday reality but a place he believes so firmly in that you can't help but be sucked inside. Hanks' Pep Streebeck is there as a sort of reminder of real life and under other circumstances the combination wouldn't work but here it does. The plot is silly having to do with a porn magazine publisher Dabney Coleman who is secretly in cahoots with a rightwing preacher Christopher Plummer of all people doing a letterperfect takeoff of Pat Robertson. Aykroyd's Friday even has a love interest the Virgin Connie Swail Alexandra Paul who is as offthewall in her own way as Friday is his so they make an ideal couple. The film was only a modest hit and it certainly wasn't Dan Aykroyd's most successful movie in terms of boxoffice.

	onyx:emotionText "'Dragnet' is the movie Dan Aykroyd must have lived his whole life up till then to make. It is truly a moment of cosmic destiny that sees him donning the guise of Sgt. Joe Friday nephew of the original and it fits him like a glove. The film itself has its lags and fizzled gags but Aykroyd himself has never been better. The machinegun verbal delivery he honed to perfection on 'Saturday Night Live' is given its best showcase here and even though Tom Hanks is on board as well and is very likable and funny make no mistake this is Dan Aykroyd's show all the way. The best moments of 'Dragnet' come when he spews his rapidfire dialogue at anyone and everyone quoting regulations lecturing bad guys and coworkers alike on everything from sex to zoo animals declaring his love for Los Angeles and its police department and generally being so straight a straightarrow you wonder if he's ever told a lie in his life. Conviction is one thing that Aykroyd's Joe Friday is definitely not lacking. And that is really the fun of 'Dragnet' it takes you inside Friday's world a place without too much in common with modernday reality but a place he believes so firmly in that you can't help but be sucked inside. Hanks' Pep Streebeck is there as a sort of reminder of real life and under other circumstances the combination wouldn't work but here it does. The plot is silly having to do with a porn magazine publisher Dabney Coleman who is secretly in cahoots with a rightwing preacher Christopher Plummer of all people doing a letterperfect takeoff of Pat Robertson. Aykroyd's Friday even has a love interest the Virgin Connie Swail Alexandra Paul who is as offthewall in her own way as Friday is his so they make an ideal couple. The film was only a modest hit and it certainly wasn't Dan Aykroyd's most successful movie in terms of boxoffice. But 100 years from now when someone researches his career and wants to find the ultimate Dan Aykroyd movie all roads will lead them to 'Dragnet.' Here are some of his best bits of dialogueI don't care what undercover rock you crawled out from there's a dress code for detectives in RobberyHomicide. Section 3605. 10. 20. 22. 24. 26. 50. 70. 80.

	schema:reviewBody "The Land Before Time XI Invasion of the Tinysauruses the eleventh installment in The Land Before Time series. After seeing the last Land Before Time movie The Great Longneck Adventure it was a terrific movie so I was really looking forward to this sequel. Now still this was a fun movie had a decent story and the animation was good just it wasn't as good as I was expecting but it's a good movie still. This story is one that I'm too familiar with from every sit com in the world the problem with size how many kids are either too small or too big and are so concerned with their mega or lack their of ability of growing. But it's always a moral tale that needs a good repeat for the new generation and The Land Before Time now takes it on. But still I loved the animation the colors are getting brighter and the movement of the characters are more clean. How could you not enjoy these sequels? Littlefoot and his friends are a joy to watch on screen together and the writers added another story of the difficulty of accepting another adult into a child's life Invasion of the Tinyauruses is a good movie.Every year as the warm season approaches a certain tree in the Great Valley blooms with pink flowers. Since they are so delicious every dinosaur in the valley wants hisher fair share of it. Littlefoot and his friends Ducky Petrie and Spike are eagerly waiting to nibble the first treesweets. Ducky tries to take one but Littlefoot quickly tells her to stop and reminds them all that none may take any treesweets until Nibbling Day. Meanwhile Cera's father is visited by an old friend  a female treehorn named Tria it seems he used to have a crush on her. Cera doesn't take as kindly to her as her father does as she is jealous of her relationship with her father being put on hold because of Tria. Littlefoot meanwhile goes off by himself feeling very down about how little he is. As he returns to the treesweet tree he climbs up the cliff right next to it and tries to reach the treesweets by himself. As he does he accidentally falls right through the tree and knocks down every single treesweet. He finds himself surrounded by several miniature longnecks. They have eaten all the treesweets and quickly run away once the shocked Littlefoot starts screaming out of fear. Upon noticing that every treesweet is gone all the dinosaurs in the valley are standing in front of the tree they all suspect Littlefoot to be the guilty party. Littlefoot afraid to admit it was his fault that the treesweets fell off the tree blames everything on the tiny longnecks. Littlefoot falls down a pothole in the ground where it turns out the tiny longnecks are hiding in. First being afraid of them Littlefoot flees deeper into the cave but soon enough he finds out that the tiny longnecks are not as bad as he thought and befriends them. Upon hearing how difficult it is for the tinysauruses to find food he promises to help bring them as many treestars as he can every night. But he's still not sure how to explain their existence to the valley without getting blamed for the treesweets accident.The Land Before Time XI Invasion of the Tinysauruses was a good sequel not the best but still worth the watch. Littlefoot is getting a little more mature with each story I loved how he stood up to the valley and defended the little longnecks. The little longnecks were so cute and a great addition to the story. One story I did appreciate was the one between Cera her father and Tria a lot of kids have a difficult time when their parents split and start dating again so I think this was a good story to show. So over all The Land Before Time XI Invasion of the Tinysauruses is worth the watch it's a good sequel. So far it seems like the only reason people are complaining about these sequels are just because there are so many of them my advice is to get over it I'm glad I got into them. They are fun movies to watch for yourself the family or your kids. I do recommend Invasion of the Tinysauruses trust me I'm always honest with the reviews.510".

Littlefoot afraid to admit it was his fault that the treesweets fell off the tree blames everything on the tiny longnecks. Littlefoot falls down a pothole in the ground where it turns out the tiny longnecks are hiding in. First being afraid of them Littlefoot flees deeper into the cave but soon enough he finds out that the tiny longnecks are not as bad as he thought and befriends them. Upon hearing how difficult it is for the tinysauruses to find food he promises to help bring them as many treestars as he can every night. But he's still not sure how to explain their existence to the valley without getting blamed for the treesweets accident.The Land Before Time XI Invasion of the Tinysauruses was a good sequel not the best but still worth the watch. Littlefoot is getting a little more mature with each story I loved how he stood up to the valley and defended the little longnecks. The little longnecks were so cute and a great addition to the story. One story I did appreciate was the one between Cera her father and Tria a lot of kids have a difficult time when their parents split and start dating again so I think this was a good story to show. So over all The Land Before Time XI Invasion of the Tinysauruses is worth the watch it's a good sequel. So far it seems like the only reason people are complaining about these sequels are just because there are so many of them my advice is to get over it I'm glad I got into them. They are fun movies to watch for yourself the family or your kids. I do recommend Invasion of the Tinysauruses trust me I'm always honest with the reviews.510";

Granted that's quite a strange thing to accuse this kind of film of this late in the series as any paleontologist would tell you along with everyone jumping down various throats and saying Yes but it's a kids film so accuracy doesn't really matter. Fair enough. I'm not disputing that.However the original film and its sequels up to this point were...well at least believable within the Land Before Time universe. The idea of Littlefoot and pals raising a baby sharptooth or journeying to find a magic flower or having to deal with bullies are fine.But minuscule longnecks...no! That really does push the boundaries to breaking point! If it had been little creatures then this could have kept up the passable trend with the other sequels but just what was the point in these creatures? A fair idea that was let down by a lousy concept. The reason I'm giving it three stars instead of one was that this film does deal well with a fairly sensitive issue namely that of a single parent finding someone else and how it can affect both children and adults.Though I could quite happily have lived the rest of my life without finding out that Cera's dad was named Topsy...".

	schema:reviewBody "Seems to me as time goes on the plots in these movies seem to be geared towards a younger and younger audience. The first six actually had better plots and were more entertaining for older children. I still enjoy them even after ten years of watching them over and over.You would think the characters would mature as time goes on. Instead it seems they grow more and more immature with each movie. Cera becomes a brat in this one as she has gradually regressed to sadly about midway through the series. And she was a good character too. She does bring up an interesting point which my sister pointed out back in number six Littlefoot is very small for his age especially being a longneck. But she goes about it in the stupidest way. And the way they squabble over the tree sweets is a bit silly too and just downright childish. All around the plot was a good one but the dialogue seemed to be geared towards small kids and identifying with them. I don't really like that they keep making the characters seem so childish and yet again they messed up the voice acting with a sucky new voice for Littlefoot. That's about all the qualms I have with this movie. Best suited for the younger kiddies.On a positive note it does bring up a good lesson about the consequences of lying and the affects a significant other can have for a single parentsingle child family. Cera reacts much as I would expect any child to when faced with the possibility of another person receiving attention once directed to them. And I do think it is hilarious the way Cera's father attempts to hide a possible love interest from his daughter. Another comical point in the movie is when Cera's father finds the Sweet Tree in ruins and screams and listening to Littlefoot's Grandpa's reaction to it. The songs are really cheesy in this one but one song I really like in this movie is the one about Dads. To me every girl in the world can identify with that song because hey Dads CAN be a pain!The introduction of the Tiny Longnecks is a far shot to some but to me it's an entirely realistic possibility. I mean we focus on the big guys in the dinosaur world all the time and there is evidence of smaller ones. There are possibly many more species yet to be discovered so it could indeed be possible there were longnecks the size of kittens. I thought they were adorable and were a good addition to the cast.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pierce Brosnan and Salma Hayek are a pair of diamond thieves fighting an endless cat and mouse game with an FBI agent Woody Harrelson until they decide to retire and move down to the Bahamas. When a cruise ship arrives carrying a priceless diamond the chase begins anew.After the Sunset is a pretty ordinary movie with some entertaining moments and a lot of gorgeous scenery. It won't challenge the viewer at all but it will offer a pretty enjoyable ride. The premise is fairly simple and it is nothing really new. Brett Ratner keeps things easy and safe as he moves the film at a nice pace. The opening scene is pretty funny and nicely done. The middle is also pretty good yet a little dull while the ending is just plain disappointing. I was expecting a nice payoff but the ending was so simple. This didn't ruin the movie but it doesn't warrant a viewing either.The acting is pretty good and there are a few characters that keep the film interesting. Pierce Brosnan stars as Max and he gives a good performance. He sometimes looked a little tired but he usually seemed to be having fun. Woody Harrelson is great as the FBI agent and he looks to be having a great time. Salma Hayek offers great eye candy and a decent performance. She doesn't really do anything special except look very beautiful. Don Cheadle gives an okay performance though he doesn't get a lot of screen time.There are a few reasons why After the Sunset would make for a good rental. First the scenery looks great and eye candy never hurts. Second the chemistry between Brosnan and Harrelson is surprisingly good and it is fun to watch them on screen. Third those looking for some escapist fun should find it with this film. Last but not least Salma Hayek looks amazing. I would have preferred a little more substance but the movie proved to be entertaining. In the end After the Sunset isn't worth checking out in theaters but it could make for a decent rental.

As the two male characters get more closely acquainted throughout the film we start to wonder who's tricking who. Brosnan displays rare emotion in this film. Harrelson escapes his Cheers role by excellently portraying the many sides of what would have been a simple character.Hayek doesn't miss a chance to show off her body and Don Cheadle's villain was superb. The only problem with that character was that we didn't see enough of him.The film has some nice scenery and entertaining scenes particularly the shark capture.Rush hour director Ratner has made a great film which only really lacks style and good pacing. this film would have been better handled in the reins of say Steven Soderbergh.But nonetheless a very funny enjoyable film which will please fans of the cast and crew as well as the moviegoing public. It's not up to the standard of Oceans's eleven yet it beats the likes of Ocean's 12. Any fan of the comedythriller genre should go see this film but I will be looking more forward to Rush Hour 3.".

It's a pretty cool heist flick almost reminiscent of Thomas Crown Affair McQueen or Brosnan either one was great. If you haven't seen it yet I HIGHLY recommend it. There is a lot of great humour in this film too something that really surprised me. Also can anyone tell me if this was filmed on the Island of Nasssau? I did see a Disney cruise liner in the background of the first Harbor shot and and I know that is part of their usual route. Don Cheadle plays an excellent villain and the performances by Hayek Harrelson and Brosnan really make for an entertaining film. The premise is quite good and I'll reiterate it is not only a good heist film but one of the FUNNIEST movies of the year.".

I was tempted every five minutes or so to walk out. This is a heist movie where the heist is so incredibly implausible that it was just stupid. In my mind there has to be at least a miniscule possibility that the scheme would work but there wasn't even that. There are holes in the plot that don't make any sense as if the screenwriter said what the heck this is a good scene who'll notice that it blows a huge hole in the story. As for the actors I'm disappointed more than anything. Any bimbo could have played the Salma Hayak part. There must have been 10 scenes where the only noticeable quality was her cleavage. As for Pierce Brosnan let's face it if he's not playing James Bond he's nothing. Don Cheadle a very good actor unfortunately is saddled with the most insipid dialogue in the film. A wasted performance. Woody Harrelson is OK. At the end of the day though I'm sure all the principals just did this stupid movie for the money and a chance to spend time in a fabulous location on someone else's dime.

If you delete Woody Harrelson from the cast you get a pretty reliable threesome headed by former 007 Peirce Brosnan and rounded out with sexy Selma Hayek and the ever wonderful Don Cheadle. After the Sunset is about exjewel thief Max Brosnan and his lover Lola Hayek who retire to the Bahamas after being unbeaten in all of their heists. However FBI Agent Stan Lloyd Harrelson who Max and Lola harassed on several occasions during their career won't believe that the two unbeatable master criminals are done  so he finds them out in the Bahamas and tempts Max with the last Napolean diamond which is on a cruise ship docking in the local bay. Max and Lola say no but Max is further tempted when suave gangster Henri Moore Cheadle offers Max an offer he can't refuse. Lola is adamantly against it but poor Max is pathetically attracted. Meanwhile Max and Stan become friends.This movie is horrible. Brett Ratner does the WORST job directing and the script is really lame with only one or two really memorable lines that made you laugh. The rest of the time you are just so embarrassed for these actors that you want to shake them and say WHY DID YOU DO THIS MOVIE?!?!?!?! Selma Hayek puts on all her sexual charms for the role of Lola and would have probably done really well if she had actually had a really well written role. Peirce Brosnan well we miss him as 007. And who casts Woody Harrelson?! He is what makes this movie so bad. Woody do us all a favor and never act again k? The only person in the movie who does a good job acting is Don Cheadle who has probably never done a bad movie in his life. But his role in the film is so small that he is unable to really make up for the bad jobs that some of the other actors did. Plus the climatic scene where sorry to ruin this Max steals the diamond is probably only 3 minutes long and looks like they did it in a rush at the end of filming.All in all don't see this movie. It is LAME and a total waste of your time.".

Well Salma Hayek's curves are eye candy however does not justify having to sit thru this travesty of a film. If salma is the reason you can always hire From Dusk to Dawn again and again. Pierce Brosnan sleepwalks to the role that he has essayed many times before a smooth slick operator who has thought of everything and for whom things fall into place as if my magic. There is a force fed twist in the end but its so plastic that it ain't funny. Guys please don't waste rental money on this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Did I miss something? Was there a contest going through all the Grade Schools of America to find the best story for acclaimed director Bret Ratner to bring to the silver screen? If so why wasn't there a calendar made for those who didn't make the final cut? Oh wait apparently children did not write this film but instead a guy that wrote for the TELEVISION SERIES the Weakest Link. That surely makes him ready by all means to tackle the caper genre and inherit a big payday  right? You are the weakest link  goodbye. This movie was a disaster from the beginning. With cardboard acting an aging and girth growing sex symbol and a corny ending that incorporated nothing that we were shown through the entire film it is a big wonder how After the Sunset ever saw the illustrious greenlight. Perhaps it was the size of Salma's boo  name or perhaps the fact that Pierce Brosnan's The Thomas Crown Affair was such a cult film or maybe because Don Cheadle was in it because it had really no pull with just Woody headlining. So how did this film get made? This film targeted preteen boys and retirement communities and with their great pull the financing behind this film became very easy.This was a caper film right? We are supposed to go on this roller coaster ride of who's conning whom coupled with lies deceit and a surprise ending that will make you want to rewatch from the beginning to experience anything that you missed. That is the focus goal and overall tone that a film like this should have followed. Instead Ratner decided to just make a movie without any sort of excitement or drive. As I watched this film I never once felt excited about the plot. Why? Because there was nobody getting me excited. The acting in this film was well below par for anything that Hollywood has released. Pierce tries but just can't seem to capture the essence of the film. There is no little demon inside you rooting for anything. Salma's role was basically for eyecandy. She provided nothing spectacular either. I can literally say the same for Woody and Cheadle as well. Here we have strong actors doing absolutely nothing during the course of about two hours. These characters never drive the plot they bring nothing but clichs to the table and by the end we really don't have any true grasp as to whom they are. Honestly cardboard cutouts could have replaced the actual actors and After the Sunset would have been a better film. There was no depth to the characters no emotion no structure just the simple direction of step here say your line step here look surprised. It was embarrassing for all that were involved.I think a major flaw to this film was that Ratner did not fully understand or was prepared for the caper genre. From the opening moments until the end of the film you can tell that Ratner is just trying to use his friends in the industry and show the world that he has some power as well. I say this because I saw no true direction or moment of impressiveness where he defines himself as a director. He reuses the same ideas throughout the entire film he doesn't give anything strong to his players and nothing stood out in this movie. Sure it was a beautiful location but am I to believe that Salma spend a majority of the film building a deck for them to sit on? Am I to believe that Pierce is still a sex symbol even with a HUGE gut sticking out? Am I to believe that Cheadle is a bad guyimported American who is at the top of the community? Finally am I to believe that Pierce could still move as quickly as Ratner defined? I swear that in the final unclimactic moments of this film I could hear Pierce doing some heavy breathing to get from point A to point B. Maybe he isn't ready for the next Bond role.So without a good story or decent characters maybe there was some humor in it that could pull us away from the sour sensation cultivating in your mouth. Well guess who is placed in to do the humor element? Woody Harrelson. Now I don't mind Woody but in this role he just wasn't believable and his humor was so clich that I had trouble believing that he brought anything to this character. He literally plagiarized his entire role. Teachers and film viewers of the world should be very upset with him. Instead of bringing a new twist to his character he resorted to weird sex humor skimpy bully humor and that everpopular drunken humor while fishing that is sure to make that senile woman in the front burst out with laughter. To me it was pathetic and a worthless attempt to make a joke out of already dead film.Overall this was a massive disappointment. Here you had a decent director some strong players but the worst story ever written by a man who wrote for a game show. Which piece does not fit? There was this huge sense of apathy throughout this entire film and clichs riddled it that I just couldn't get past. Brosnan had trouble with this film and I couldn't tell if it was because he just didn't care or because he was working with such lowtalent that his heart just wasn't in it. The ending hurt as well. There was no excitement or intensity just plain  here it is  like it or not. I personally couldn't digest this film with its poor acting and belowpar story. This may be a good film for some that are not familiar with the caper genre but for me it was just hogwash.Grade  out of ".

Perhaps it was the size of Salma's boo  name or perhaps the fact that Pierce Brosnan's The Thomas Crown Affair was such a cult film or maybe because Don Cheadle was in it because it had really no pull with just Woody headlining. So how did this film get made? This film targeted preteen boys and retirement communities and with their great pull the financing behind this film became very easy.This was a caper film right? We are supposed to go on this roller coaster ride of who's conning whom coupled with lies deceit and a surprise ending that will make you want to rewatch from the beginning to experience anything that you missed. That is the focus goal and overall tone that a film like this should have followed. Instead Ratner decided to just make a movie without any sort of excitement or drive. As I watched this film I never once felt excited about the plot. Why? Because there was nobody getting me excited. The acting in this film was well below par for anything that Hollywood has released. Pierce tries but just can't seem to capture the essence of the film. There is no little demon inside you rooting for anything. Salma's role was basically for eyecandy. She provided nothing spectacular either. I can literally say the same for Woody and Cheadle as well. Here we have strong actors doing absolutely nothing during the course of about two hours. These characters never drive the plot they bring nothing but clichs to the table and by the end we really don't have any true grasp as to whom they are. Honestly cardboard cutouts could have replaced the actual actors and After the Sunset would have been a better film. There was no depth to the characters no emotion no structure just the simple direction of step here say your line step here look surprised. It was embarrassing for all that were involved.I think a major flaw to this film was that Ratner did not fully understand or was prepared for the caper genre. From the opening moments until the end of the film you can tell that Ratner is just trying to use his friends in the industry and show the world that he has some power as well. I say this because I saw no true direction or moment of impressiveness where he defines himself as a director. He reuses the same ideas throughout the entire film he doesn't give anything strong to his players and nothing stood out in this movie. Sure it was a beautiful location but am I to believe that Salma spend a majority of the film building a deck for them to sit on? Am I to believe that Pierce is still a sex symbol even with a HUGE gut sticking out? Am I to believe that Cheadle is a bad guyimported American who is at the top of the community? Finally am I to believe that Pierce could still move as quickly as Ratner defined? I swear that in the final unclimactic moments of this film I could hear Pierce doing some heavy breathing to get from point A to point B. Maybe he isn't ready for the next Bond role.So without a good story or decent characters maybe there was some humor in it that could pull us away from the sour sensation cultivating in your mouth. Well guess who is placed in to do the humor element? Woody Harrelson. Now I don't mind Woody but in this role he just wasn't believable and his humor was so clich that I had trouble believing that he brought anything to this character. He literally plagiarized his entire role. Teachers and film viewers of the world should be very upset with him. Instead of bringing a new twist to his character he resorted to weird sex humor skimpy bully humor and that everpopular drunken humor while fishing that is sure to make that senile woman in the front burst out with laughter. To me it was pathetic and a worthless attempt to make a joke out of already dead film.Overall this was a massive disappointment. Here you had a decent director some strong players but the worst story ever written by a man who wrote for a game show. Which piece does not fit? There was this huge sense of apathy throughout this entire film and clichs riddled it that I just couldn't get past. Brosnan had trouble with this film and I couldn't tell if it was because he just didn't care or because he was working with such lowtalent that his heart just wasn't in it. The ending hurt as well. There was no excitement or intensity just plain  here it is  like it or not. I personally couldn't digest this film with its poor acting and belowpar story. This may be a good film for some that are not familiar with the caper genre but for me it was just hogwash.Grade  out of ";

The title classifies Ambush at Cimarron Pass as a landscape western and it foreshadows where the climactic action will transpire. Mind you this is a characteristic of many westerns because the terrain acts as an arena for our heroes to prove their mettle. The Richard G. Taylor  John K. Butler screenplay based on a story by Robert A. Reeds  Robert E. Woods yields several quotable lines about masculinity. The central theme here is bargains. Survival depends on bargains. Copelan at the helm of his first and only film explores the usual themes of man versus man man versus society man versus his environment and the issue of apocalyptic armaments. Clearly the Winchester repeating rifles at the heart of this drama serve as metaphors for atomic weapons. Copelan emphasizes their role early on by presenting them in the first closeups so that we cannot overlook them. The durable and dependable Scott Brady must prevent these rifles from landing in Apache hands. The Apaches are the equivalent here for the Soviets.Twentieth Century Fox released this modest 1958 oater through its subsidiary company Regal Films and theatres originally projected Ambush at Cimarron Pass in a widescreen process called Regalscope. Unfortunately the Western Channel version is full frame but you can imagine what the extent of the composition. Showdown at Boot Hill lenser John M. Nickolaus Jr.'s photography adds suspense to the action. He composes his shots so that the Indians appear on the periphery frames shots through the arch on a warrior's legs so that they seem to dominate the terrain. Allinall Ambush at Cimarron Pass is a polished looking western. Copelan helmed a handful of television shows but spent most of hisher ? time as an editor on about 40 movies and television series. Clint Eastwood has a low opinion about his first western. He has been quoted as calling it probably the lousiest Western ever made. Actually Ambush at Cimarron Pass surpasses many lesser frontier army westerns and its armaments plotone of the genre's integral conventionsassumes greater significance in light of the Cold War era release date and the paranoia about Armageddon.Sergeant Matt Blake Scott Brady of Johnny Guitar of the Seventh Cavalry and the four surviving troopers of his patrol are escorting a civilian prisoner Corbin Baynes Barron of Fireball 500 back to Fort Waverly to stand trial for selling repeating rifles to the Apaches. We learn later that Corbin struck a deal to sell the Indians 36 repeating rifles. Blake describes the magnitude of the threat that these rifles pose to the cavalry. These new guns have the firepower of another company and fire 15 rounds without a reload. Our beleaguered cavalry heroes ride into an ambush less than five minutes into the action. They discover however the Apaches aren't trying to drygulch them. Instead a band of former Confederate soldiers led by exColonel Sam Prescott Frank Grestle of Crossroads are shooting at them initially until they agree to a truce and Sgt. Blake powwows with them. Although two years have passed since the end of the American Civil War old wounds don't heal as quickly. Prescott's secondincommand Keith Williams Clint Eastwood of Star in the Dust hates Blake from the start and accuses him of lying. All Yankees are liars Keith snarls with considerable animosity. The Georgia native bears a grudge against the Yankees because his family has suffered the wrath of General Sherman in the South.Prescott explains that Apaches masquerading as troopers jumped them and stole their whole herd of cattle. Blake realizes that the Indians must have gotten their uniforms from his slain troopers. A man has to take a lot of things he doesn't bargain for Prescott Blake observes and then adds Maybe that's what makes him a man. Prescott points out that they are heading for Waverly too. No sooner do the Southerners and the cavalrymen form an uneasy alliance than two Apache horsemen appear and leave a bound woman sprawled in open ground not far from them. Our heroes rush to Teresa Santos Margia Dean of FBI Girl and everybody is surprised when the Indians steal their horses and take Cobb Desmond Slattery one of the exConfederates as a hostage. The treacherous redskins used Teresa as a decoy so that they could distract our heroes. Teresa explains that she is from the Santos Ranch. It seems that marauding Apaches burned it and killed her brother sister and father. The Apaches offer our heroes a bargain Cobb in exchange for the rifles. Blake categorically refuses to negotiate. The Indians never let up on our heroes and whittle their numbers.Naturally tempers flare among the heroes over the value of the guns versus the former Confederates. Getting riled up at each other ain't the answer a conciliatory Prescott intervenes. Let's calm down and talk this out Eventually Blake Prescott Keith Teresa along with the troopers and Southerners have to strike out of foot with the 36 repeating rifles slung over their shoulders for a six to seven day march to Fort Waverly. Judge Stanfield Irving Bacon of Fort Apache refuses to tote any guns. Eventually Keith comes to his senses and sheds his antipathy toward Yankees in general and Sgt. Blake in particular. The last line that Keith utters summarizes the value of Ambush at Cimarron Pass in the career of Clint Eastwood. Says Keith Sometimes you have to lose before you can win. Another memorable line occurs when Private Lasky points out to Johnny Willows about their noncommissioned officer that A sergeant who isn't rough on his men winds up burying most of them. Clint Eastwood shouldn't be too ashamed of this Bwestern. You know the budget was tight because nobody changes their clothes throughout the action.".

	schema:reviewBody "AMBUSH AT CIMARRON PASS 1958 This low end western was a Regal Production released through 20th Century Fox. The cast includes Scott Brady Clint Eastwood Frank Gerstle Margia Dean Irving Bacon and Baynes Barron.A US Cavalry patrol led by Scott Brady has captured gunrunner Baynes Barron. Barron was collared with 36 new Winchester rifles he was planning on selling to the Apache. The Apaches are not amused and have been following the patrol knocking them off one by one.The men come up on another group that is also in having their share of trouble with the natives. The men have had their herd of cattle rustled by the same Apaches. In charge here is Frank Gerstle. One of his hands is played by Clint Eastwood. The men are all veterans of the late war between the States. The Cavalry are Yankees while the cattlemen were Confederate types.The two groups decide to join up for added protection from the Apache. They are soon joined by Margia Dean who was a prisoner of the Apache. Miss Dean delivers a message from the Apache. If they turn over the 36 Winchesters they can all go without a fight.Brady will have none of this idea he knows full well the Apache will wipe them out if they lay their hands on the rifles. The Apache chase off the group's horses that night leaving them on foot. It is at least a 6 day walk to the Cavalry fort.The next day the men and Miss Dean set off for the fort. The bunch is short of water and food but they have the rifles and plenty of ammo. The Apache keep their distance because of the firepower. They do however manage to knock off any stragglers etc. Also in the mix here is Irving Bacon. Bacon is stirring up trouble between ex Confederate Eastwood and the Yankee Sgt Brady.Matters come to a head when the Apache try a night time raid to grab the guns. The raid fails with dead on both sides. The group continues on their trek to reach the fort. The heat lack of food and a poisoned water hole take their toll on the group.On their last legs Brady has an idea to even the odds. They pull a night time raid on the Apache hoping to reclaim their horses. The raid goes sideways and the horses get away. The party though are able to do some serious damage to the Apaches. The surviving men and Miss Dean now manage to stagger their way to the fort.I seriously wanted to like this film but it barely rises above average at best. The 72 minute runtime seems much longer with cast being shown constantly walking up hills then down hills. The direction is incredibly static showing why this was the only big screen film helmed by Jodie Copelan. The story is just a rehash of tales one has seen many times before. Veteran writer John K. Butler had done much better work before.The cast gives it their all and are not to be blamed for the poor end product.".

This film has a distinct advantage over its stablemates in that the lead actress is supposed to be a Mexican and this gives her an excuse to hesitate twice as long between every word as the rest of the cast. 3 The script has a surfeit of feeble dialogue. There is not much action and what there is happens to be pretty tame. 4 The photography is flat and almost completely featureless. Gray tones are prominent and there is very little contrast. There is no such thing as a deep rich black in a RegalScope film. 5 Production values are noticeably skimpy.

This is a shame as the overall quality of the film suffered from it as it simply did not elaborate enough on the supporting characters and as gorgeous as Romy Schneider may be she is not great enough an actress to carry the movie like this. But the screenplay obviously did not do her any favors either. The shocking thing here is how many people worked on this script and still the outcome was so generic so disappointing and nothing superior to all the German film mediocrity from the 1950s. The core of the film like so many other times with Schneider is the romance and it is predictable from start to finish and the characters next to Scampolo simply aren't memorable at all which may have to do with both acting and writing. There are a couple known names in the cast here so it was a missed opportunity I must say. I give this one a thumbsdown and urge you to watch Schneider's Monpti instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie twice and as a matter of fact two things have remained in my memory young Romy Schneider in the main role just after her presence in ultra popular SISSI trilogy and the locations in which SCAMPOLO was shot  Ischia Island. That is why I gave it a 6 out of 10 since these two aspects make this movie really memorable.From today's perspective SCAMPOLO is not very interesting sometimes the action is so slow that one can fall asleep. In fact there is not much content adventures of a young girl who lives a light hearted life on the Isle of Ischia. However Romy Schneider is great! The fact that SCAMPOLO was filmed just after the third part of Sissi is too significant not to be skipped. Romy was considered to fit best to royal roles by a number of people. Partly thanks to SCAMPOLO she proved that she was talented at multiple levels. Another film that was a kind of escape from the impact of Sissi at that time and which brought an inevitable end to her Austrian period of career was DIE HALBZARTE where Romy played with her mother Magda Schneider for the last time. Very soon after that Romy moved to France and started her worldwide career on screen. Later on we all know how far she went. Pity she died so early...Therefore SCAMPOLO is not for every today's viewer since it is very specific. While watching it you have to have a bit knowledge about some facts from Romy's life and about that convention of the German cinema of the late 1950s. Only then SCAMPOLO is fun to watch it.Real fans of Romy Schneider and lovers of the beauties of the southern Italy's landscape esp. Ischia Island will find the movie entertaining! 610".

	schema:headline " This movie is nothing short of spectacular...";
	schema:reviewBody "When I bought this movie from Amazon I believed it to be a disaster movie in the likes of Hollywood movies such as Volcano 2012 and such. And the cover and text on the back of the cover didn't really let on to what this movie was it all just showed something of a typical disaster movie.So I wasn't prepared for what was ahead. Also because I hadn't done any research of reviews prior to buying and watching the movie. So I was in for one big surprise. There are those rare moments when you stumble upon something truly unique by sheer luck and this was one such moment for me.Aftershock blew me away. This movie is so much more than your average disaster movie. Sure there is a breathtakingly amazing disaster scene early on in the movie. And you just sit there with your hands clenched and biting your lip because that whole part is so intense and so amazingly shot. It is like you are there right in the midst of the chaos. I will go as far as saying that the earthquake scene in this movie far outshines any of that I have seen in Hollywood disaster movies.But Aftershock is not just a disaster movie it is also a movie that has a very touching story to tell a very sad and unfortunate story as well. But it tell its story in a very good way without being too much. You really get immersed in the story and it sweeps you off your feet and takes you along on an emotional rollercoaster ride. You might actually want to have some tissue at hand because there are some very very emotional scenes in this movie. It is also a story of emotions a story of how our lives and fates can change in the blink of an eye.The characters in Aftershock are very believable and they are so well portrayed on the screen by the actors and actresses. Each and every of the main characters are given so much room to grown and develop that you really get to feel with them grow with them feel their sadness loss and happiness. And for this the director was right on the money. This story was so welltold and wellshot that it is hard not to get caught up in the moment.The 130 minutes that the movie is in length doesn't feel that long because you get so caught up in the movie. I didn't leave the screen for a single moment. I just sat there mesmerized wanting to see what happened next what would happen to Fang Deng Fang Da and everyone else.I am a big fan of Asian cinema though I had never heard about this movie prior to finding it by sheer luck on Amazon. Now that I have seen it Aftershock will stay with me for a long long time. It was one of the most emotional and honest stories I have had the pleasure of witnessing in a long long time.Even if you are not a fan of Asian cinema or have a phobia of watching movies in a foreign language you should overcome that and do yourself the pleasure of sitting down to watch this movie because it is really worth it. This movie is truly an amazing one and it the story is one that deserves to be told.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Aftershocks";
	schema:reviewBody "In some ways Aftershock as a big budgeted epic sort of plays out like Feng Xiaogang's Assembly with the money shots concentrated in the first few minutes followed by a masterful treatment of human drama against an historical backdrop of events in China. As a fan of Feng's films thus far he continues to show that he's equally adept in handling commercial studio tentpole films like this one and smaller more intimate films like If You Are The One dealing with equal ability a cast of plenty or just a handful.Aftershock cuts to the chase and puts the audience smack into 1976 Tangshan China just about when the big quake struck. We're introduced to a family of four where soon enough Mother Nature's unforeseen wrath swallows up the entire city and shattering countless of lives and families in the process. What follows will set the stage for the entire two more hours to come where Yuan Ni Xu Fan has to make that Sophie's Choice of which twin for the rescuers to save  son Da Feng or daughter Fang Deng  since a beam separates the two. Tradition culture and custom will unfortunately make this a nobrainer when push comes to shove coupled with the fact that the death of her husband in rescuing her and her role as the dutiful wife to ensure the preservation of the family line but worst this decision is made within earshot of Fang Deng who's fighting for her life in the rubble.Heaven's compassion means Fang Deng survives the ordeal nonetheless but gets picked up by a PLA soldier and sent to a survivor's camp where she gets adopted into a foster family Chen Jin and Chen Daoming in excellent form here as foster mom and dad respectively. The narrative then tangents into two halves one following the grown up Da Feng Li Chen and the other Fang Deng Zhang Jingchu in their trials and tribulations of growing up in China in the last 30 years interspersed with shots of a growingly vibrant Tangshan and other cities of China where we see the economic development of the country. However Nature still is that unfortunate leveller and for all the technological advancement human emotions and a mother's love still continue to form the basis of a heartwrench when dealt with an unfair card in life.Based upon a novel What works here are the many small subplots that get introduced such as teenage romance filial piety and essentially the all important theme of family that merges well with the inclusion of landmark events such as Chairman Mao's death and another more recent quake that brings characters together. What more all the cast members gave stellar performances Save for the token Caucasian that will tug at your heartstrings and enable the melodramatic emotional finale to be all the more powerful as we come to learn how bitterness and hatred accumulated over the years can dissipate with the passage of time and the opportunity presented to seek forgiveness.Which somehow the editing seemed to give way under the weight of emotions and introduced some abrupt cuts away from scenes you'd think will linger for a more emotional closure. However art direction from costuming to sets here are superb in capturing the look and feel depicting the different eras from the 70s to the 90s and brought to mind other similarly crafted dramas like Heaven Eternal Earth Everlasting and Electric Shadow both films that you should give a watch as well should you dig powerful dramas like Aftershock.I can't attest to how great this film would have been on a larger than life IMAX screen simply because Singapore for all our record movie attendance we still find it not viable to have one we had one before but one thing's for sure the special effects employed here is on par with what Hollywood can dish out. While Hollywood can serve exaggeration for that wow factor think 2012 where everything falls apart Feng employs digital effects prudently to ensure that the emotional aspect doesn't get neglected. For all the individuals affected by the Big Quake one will actually feel for them when they get pulverized and it's hard not to be saddened when you realize it's actually all very futile when the ground beneath you starts swallowing everything. As one character said in the film there's no worry if it's a small quake and if it's a big one there'll be no escape anyway. It's this exasperation and resignation from a survivor that succinctly explains not only the physical scars but the emotional ones as well that lingers far longer with the survivors coming close to becoming pangs of guilt.So don't go in expecting a special effects extravaganza like what Hollywood will do. An earthquake doesn't last for that long but the emotional journey of family members set apart by a catastrophic event goes on for much longer. Aftershock is that film set on the right path in choosing to focus on this aspect and delivered a film rich in the human emotions of pain distress and suffering. Highly recommended and a natural inclusion to the shortlist of this year's best.".

	schema:headline " HK Neo Reviews Aftershocks";
	schema:reviewBody "An epic disaster picture disguised with a special human core...Aftershocks works because it believed in the simple message about human lives  value. In the midst of today's world people always conjure on the negatives rather than the positives in our lives. For a moment of two we forget about the person next to you and focuses on the troubles that surrounds us. Ultimately Aftershock is a movie about human survival and it works not because of the impact of the earthquake but how human beings deal with the aftermath of an extraordinary earthquake. Director Feng Xiaogang delivers an epic that is not about special effects but one that touches the very essence of a human heart by tackling important themes like survival how one deal with death love life and ultimate sacrifice. Aftershocks is a highly successful film that manages to be commercially saleable and also extremely humane. In doing justice to the victims it is certainly aren't easy but somehow Feng manages to engage express and emotes.Zhang Jingchu is a wonderful actress. Her main strength is the ability to make a character performance so believable yet human is almost extraordinary. In saying that she is the central to the success of this film will be an overstatement but without her Feng would not be so successful. Look no further than the scenes when she faces her mum again after 32 years for a moment of heart to heart cinematic performance. The highlight for me is most certainly the person who played Jet Li's Hero in the class of Chen Daoming. While he was subtlety cunning in Hero as the first emperor of China Chen is all class and humane as the caring fostering father of Zhang. His portray of the fatherly role is fitting and steals the show with his glaring eyes. His moments of anger are a joy to watch along with his interaction with his wife and daughter.All in all Aftershock is the blockbuster Chinese epic of the year and to wipe internal tears from my heart Feng have created something very special. It is not a easy job to satisfy both Chinese censors and still manages to create something worthy of our 5 senses. Feng knows the impending audience and smartly delivers what is essential a human drama about the aftermath of a devastating event. In the journey of their survival and seeing how every one of these characters due with life in their own way allows us to rethink reevaluate refresh and revalue the very essence of our own lives. It isn't so bad and it's good to be alive and loved. Most certainly the Chinese blockbuster not to be missed...Neo 2010 I rate it 1010www.thehkneo.com".

Even those who don't understand Chinese myself included will connect with the human story and its wonderful drama not to mention some amazing visual effects at the beginning.I'm not going to go into the plot of the film but it is essentially a very real human family drama that deals with the pain of continuing to live with guilt and having to restore one's life after a tragedy. It may sound familiar but the beauty of Aftershock is that its emotional core is something it never shies away from. You see and feel the journey of all three central characters and how a natural disaster can shape our destinies and change our perspectives on ourselves and those around us.While you can sort of see the plot unfolding before it gets there in the end it is essentially what you want. I really cared about these characters so anything less than what you would expect would have been even more harrowing. But the resolution which seems to solve everything yet still leaves an emptiness is remarkable.This is a film not to be missed. I was almost in tears by the end of the film  it has been one of the most captivating films I have seen in a long time and is a remarkable piece of cinema. Not to be missed.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was a little skeptical before viewing this film as to whether director Feng Xiao Gang could pull off a theme that literally begs to be a cinematic spectacle of special effects. I had the impression they would add surround speakers all around the theatre to give us that sensurround earth shaking experience.Feng did none of that. Instead he gives us a masterfully crafted story of a mother's love torn between saving only one of her son or daughter born as twins trapped under the same pillar during the devastating earthquake of Tangshan in 1976. She chooses to save her son. She tearfully hugs her daughter she thinks is already dead in an emotional farewell before leaving with her son for a safe medical shelter. The repercussion of that fateful decision has a profound emotional effect on the mother and her siblings. Unable to overcome the guilty conscience of her decision the remorseful mother lives a life of selfimposed solitude in a small house in Tangshan afraid to move out because she thinks her daughter's soul may not find her again and also for her husband who died saving her life in the earthquake. Unknowingly to the mother her daughter given up for dead and laid beside her dead father wakes up from her unconscious coma state. Traumatized and shocked by her mother's decision she stood up and wonders about aimlessly on the street laid with corpses. The feeling of being totally abandoned must have strike right through her fragile heart as she is dumbed and unable to talk for a long time. A kind couple from the army decides to adopt her. Slowly she regains her confidence and her speech but the anger and bitterness remain etched deep in her heart. She grows up without ever wanting to look for her mother again. To her the memory of her mother giving the only persimmon left on the plate to her brother on the night the earthquake hits is yet another sign that her mother favours son over her. Even the promise by her mother to buy her more persimmons the next day does nothing to dispel that suspicion.Many years later in 2008 the Sichuan earthquake produces another tragedy on a massive scale. Brother and sister are there as volunteers. There at a rest point she hears a man who turns out to be her brother recounting his mother's anguish about having to choose between saving either son or daughter in the 1976 Tangshan earthquake. It is then that she realizes that her mother feels equally painful about losing her than she is bitter about being given up in favour of her brother.The act of forgiveness and reconciliation between mother and daughter comes at the end in a highly charged emotional climax. As she enters her mother's home right on the table below the portraits of herself and her dead father is a plate full of persimmons. Her mother tells her she still remembers to buy the persimmons she has promised her. Tears flowed freely from my eyes watching this scene.".

	schema:headline " An intimate portrait of resilience and hope in the aftermath of life's unexpected calamities that turns out immensely moving";
	schema:reviewBody "Feng Xiaogang's Aftershock based on the Tangshan earthquake on July 28 1976 that measured 7.8 on the Richter scale and claimed 240000 people isn't your typical disaster movie. It isn't out to wow you with the scale of the disaster indeed there is no need for the numbers speak for themselves. It isn't out to showcase the latest special effects Hollywood has done enough of that with 2012. What it does is paint an intimate portrait of how a family devastated by the quake attempts to pick up the pieces and move on with their lives.Dad played by Zhang Guoqiang is a factory worker Mom played by Feng's own wife Xu Fan is a seamstress and Fang Deng and Fang Dan are their kids one boy and one girl and twins for that matter. The quake leaves Dad dead and Mom caught in an impossible dilemma. Fang Deng and Fang Dan have been pinned under one giant concrete block and the rescuers tell her she has to sacrifice one in order to save the other. She chooses the son unaware that her daughter did not perish.Fang Deng is eventually adopted by a childless couple both husband and wife in the People's Liberation Army PLA who helped out in the subsequent rescue effort. She grows up as Wang Deng played by Zhang Jingchu but her new identity doesn't erase the scar of her mother's decision to let her die. Meanwhile Fang Dan grows up as a slightly impetuous teenager who leaves Tangshan to find his own fortune in the neighbouring bigger cities with his friends. Even after Fang Dan returns a successful businessman with his wife and newborn son Mom refuses to leave her Tangshan home she believes that she needs to guide the souls of her late husband and daughter back.Unfolding over a period of 30 years Feng leads his audience closely into the parallel lives of Fang Deng and Fang Dan until the Sichuan earthquake of 2008 which brings them back together. The events of their lives in between these 30 years aren't particularly remarkable Fang Deng or Fang Dan don't become some national heroes after their ordeal and very often it feels like they feel like they could have happened to any other person. But it is precisely because of their unassuming quality that makes them all the more credible and poignant.Indeed the film portrays Fang Deng and Fan Dang as no more than ordinary citizens trying to regain a sense of normalcy in their lives albeit forever imprinted with the trauma of the disaster. Theirs is a story of resilience and a call of hope not just for the people of Tangshan who survived the quake that year but also for the people out there whose lives and families have been wrecked by disasters to stand up and stand strong. Of course coming two years after the even more devastating Sichuan earthquake its voice is especially resounding for a country still reeling from the magnitude of the calamity.Feng's film needs to be seen in this light it is a fictional story set against real events and therefore threads a tightrope between fact and fiction a tightrope of wounded hearts and lives. Kudos to Feng for accomplishing a film that is respectful but never condescending empathetic but never manipulative so that while the subject matter may be heavy handed his film always finds the right balance to give the proceedings both gravity and optimism.Still one can't help but feel that Feng better known for his hit romantic comedies like If You Are the One is slightly out of his league. Despite generous help from visual effects experts including Lord of the Rings' Weta to recreate the quake Feng lets these scenes unfold with little continuity so the raison d'tre for this to be China's first IMAX film becomes non sequitur. He also films the aftermath of the quake with mistyeyed sentimentality using slowmo shots and a mournful score that threatens to become overly maudlin.It is therefore a good thing that Aftershock soon moves away from being a disaster film to a film about the people moving on from the disaster. Feng Xiaogang has always displayed a careful attention to the characters and their relationships in his films and once again demonstrates that flair here in creating characters that his audience can not only identify but also empathise with in their joys and sorrows trials and tribulations hopes and anxieties. When Fang Deng and Fang Dan are finally reunited in a tearful reunion only the hardest of hearts will not be moved".

	schema:headline " A heartrending story not quite perfectly told";
	schema:reviewBody "This isn't a perfect film but its story is so moving that any shortcomings in the telling can easily be overlooked. When an earthquake hits Tangshan in the Hebei Province China in 1976 at about 330 in the morning a married couple is ... well they are having sex in the back of their truck but that's not important. The couple rush home to rescue their sleeping children. When the mother attempts to run into the collapsing building the father throws her aside and rushes in and the building falls on him and kills him. The children are alive but buried beneath the rubble in such a way that saving one of them would crush the other. The mother has to make a choice. After much weeping and wringing of hands she chooses to save her son. Her daughter hears her mother make the choice. Ouch! The daughter is left for dead but miraculously survives. She's so hurt by her mother's decision she refuses to identify herself and is taken to an orphanage where she is eventually adopted by a young couple who were part of the People's Liberation Army's rescue team.The first twenty minutes of the film are all about the earthquake and CGI. After that it becomes pure drama spanning thirty two years with some haphazard scenes cutting in from time to time. The young boy grows up to be a successful businessman and the young girl grows up to almost be a doctor but marries a foreigner and moves to Canada instead. The boy doesn't know his sister is alive and the girl despite the urgings of her foster father has no intention of reuniting with her brother or her mother. But the film is less about them and more about the mother. She is the film's emotional centerpiece.The mother suffers long and hard for the decision she made and for the loss of her husband. She refuses to leave Tangshan because she wants to be there when the deceased return to her. She lives in a tent for a while and moves into a modest apartment when the family home is not rebuilt. Every year she visits a ceremonial site of mourning and gives her husband and daughter directions to her new place of residence.The film builds to a crescendo culminating in 2008 with the devastating earthquake in Sichuan. The brother and sister both go there and join the Tangshan Rescue Team as volunteers. The film drops into a low gear and downplays the moments when they meet each other and the daughter goes home to see her mother. Then there's all this tension about who should be more sorry the mother for her decision or the daughter for condemning and causing her mother to suffer thirty two years for that decision.All of the performances except the guy who plays the daughter's foreigner husband are top notch especially Xu Fan the director's real life wife as the mother. There are all kinds of wonderful and heartbreaking scenarios touching on the nature and loyalties of family. The boy's paternal grandmother wants to take custody of him because now that her own son is dead he is her last bit of male family blood. When the boy becomes a successful businessman he wants to move his mother into a nice new apartment partly for his own notion of her happiness and partly for not wanting to be perceived as someone who is not taking care of his mother. What loyalties and affections should the daughter have towards her foster parents when she becomes an adult? And of course what about the daughter's decision to not let her blood family know she survived the earthquake? I was moved to tears several times during the film but more from just thinking about the scenarios than from any melodramatic presentation. Aftershock has a disjointed narrative from time to time and could probably be improved with a second round of editing. Several scenes appear to be part of something larger that got cut out and a few seem irrelevant. The director's decision to downplay the climax as long as he can is a little disappointing but it fits with the repressed emotional level of the rest of the film after the initial earthquake sequence which as we are reminded of in a slightly awkward memorial ending that closes the film is supposed to be its heart.Aftershock is the first iMax film produced in China and I have no response to that fact. It has structural weaknesses but it's a magnificent and heartrending story with a lot of legs. Highly recommended to those who like that kind of thing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Aftershock a film that marries Chinese dramatic storytelling and Western digital visual effects is one of the most expensive films to be made in China. And it is shaping up to be a disaster epic worthy of inclusion into the top tiers of the genre. Feng Xiaogang whose recent works include A World Without Thieves 2004 The Banquet 2006 Assembly 2007 and If You Are the One 2008 directs a capable cast including Xu Fan and Zhang Jingchu to quite fine performances.Aftershock is a disaster film with a heart. That is quite an anomaly since disaster pictures are mostly soulless exercises in visual effects filmmaking. Think Deep Impact 1998 The Core 2003 2012 2009 to name just a few. Nonetheless the anomaly that is Aftershock is welcome. Not since Cameron's Titanic 1997 has a genre meant to titillate the senses been known to force one to reach for a hankie.Aftershock tells the true story of the plight of a mother Xu torn between saving her son or daughter as a magnitude 7.8 earthquake hits Tangshan in the early morning on July 28 1976. More than 240 000 perished under the rubble in less than a minute with more than 160 000 severely injured statistics taken from About.com 20th Century History. The mother could only save one child as lifting one side of the heavy slab of concrete to free one would mean crushing the other. She makes the heartbreaking decision to save her son which is overheard by her still alive daughter.Feng's film is not so much about the tragedy of Tangshan 1976 but the consequences of that one decision forced upon a helpless mother. Unbeknownst to her and her son the daughter miraculously survives the sequence in which she wakes up from the dead and wanders about seeing death and devastation all around her pays homage to the girl in red in Spielberg's Holocaust drama Schindler's List 1993 and is adopted by a couple from the People's Liberation Army. It is not until another deadly earthquake at Sichuan 32 years later that fate brings the son and daughter together again in a chance meeting during rescue efforts. And in the film's most tearjerking sequence the daughter returns to Tangshan to see her mother again.It is almost a given that to see Aftershock is to allow your tears to flow. Weep for the faceless victims of Tangshan and weep for the separation and reunification of a family whose story Feng has sufficiently but not quite masterfully told. There is no doubt that Feng's film has touched me as it will continue to touch many others. However it remains conventional with the director's trademark wry humor lost in the mire of sadness.Furthermore the performances by Xu and Zhang especially toward the very end with the cemetery sequence seem slightly exaggerated losing the naturalistic tone of the last two hours. The expected melodramatic conclusion turns into an overly theatrical expression of guilt and regret in which each shot lingers on for a few seconds too long.Aftershock is a decent film and an excellent one by genre standards. Even though Feng's handling of the film may feel at times artificial and devoid of creative input it remains to be a film that retains its power because of its historical significance and its symbolistic portrayal of the psychological and emotional struggles of a family or for that matter any family that has been torn apart by a natural disaster.SCORE 7.510 www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com All rights reserved!".

	schema:reviewBody "From the start of the movie the audience is introduced to the soontobe unfortunate family of four. Then the earthquake strikes and the family members' lives are changed forever.Mother NatureFate is raw and unforgiving a fact shown to perfection by each of the actors who portray the family members. The 1976 Tangshan Earthquake is a tragedy that has destroyed the lives of many both directly and indirectly. As the film's opening sequence the excellent special effects are not only spectacular they also make the audience emotionally connect with the chaos that the protagonists are facing. Unlike 2012 here one will wince and cringe at the unfortunate circumstances that these people have faced.But wait there's more. In the aftermath of the chaos the father is dead and their two children are pinned under the rubble. The mother is forced to choose for in that dire situation only one can be saved. The boy is chosen however he loses his left arm. Hours later after most of the people have evacuated the disaster zone the girl awakens miraculously but to no mother nor father nor brother. She is all alone until she gets adopted by two of the rescue soldiers sent to assist the evacuation.This is NOT a disaster movie it's a poignant emotional and epic drama. As soon as the second arc takes off the film becomes even more emotionally drained. The mother can't forgive herself for letting her daughter die she won't move out of her new house as respect to her dead husband and supposedly daughter as well. You can look in the mother's eyes to find them cold dead and remorseful. The boy on the other hand chooses not to college and wants to become a travel agent. The daughter has nightmares about the earthquake and she had a promising medical career ahead of her that was shattered due to an unexpected pregnancy. The choices that they make are influenced by the disaster. Tragedy or joy fear or sorrow we all make them but there has to be one reason WHY we make them. The grownup boy even says that one need not worry of a small earthquake and there's no point of escaping a large one with nonchalance.Spanning a time period of more than three decades Aftershocks delivers in the emotion. Almost every actor save for the horribly bland Canadian are perfectly cast in their roles. The script also is cleverly and beautifully written and not in a cheesy soapopera style. It is gripping it is depressing and it may shake you to your core. The ending where the family is reunited is not tacky or corny but it delivers a huge emotional satisfaction to the audience.The cinematography is arrestingly sweeping and the production design is top notch. The music is also grand and beautiful and Feng Xiaogang's direction is outstandingly focused.In short this is a definite early contender for a Best Foreign Film Academy Award next year. I can see it sweeping the Chinese Film Awards no doubt and I hope people see this beautiful film for its frankness and honesty of life's mysterious and sometimes depressing ways.Overall rating 910".

The 1976 Tangshan Earthquake is a tragedy that has destroyed the lives of many both directly and indirectly. As the film's opening sequence the excellent special effects are not only spectacular they also make the audience emotionally connect with the chaos that the protagonists are facing. Unlike 2012 here one will wince and cringe at the unfortunate circumstances that these people have faced.But wait there's more. In the aftermath of the chaos the father is dead and their two children are pinned under the rubble. The mother is forced to choose for in that dire situation only one can be saved. The boy is chosen however he loses his left arm. Hours later after most of the people have evacuated the disaster zone the girl awakens miraculously but to no mother nor father nor brother. She is all alone until she gets adopted by two of the rescue soldiers sent to assist the evacuation.This is NOT a disaster movie it's a poignant emotional and epic drama. As soon as the second arc takes off the film becomes even more emotionally drained. The mother can't forgive herself for letting her daughter die she won't move out of her new house as respect to her dead husband and supposedly daughter as well. You can look in the mother's eyes to find them cold dead and remorseful. The boy on the other hand chooses not to college and wants to become a travel agent. The daughter has nightmares about the earthquake and she had a promising medical career ahead of her that was shattered due to an unexpected pregnancy. The choices that they make are influenced by the disaster. Tragedy or joy fear or sorrow we all make them but there has to be one reason WHY we make them. The grownup boy even says that one need not worry of a small earthquake and there's no point of escaping a large one with nonchalance.Spanning a time period of more than three decades Aftershocks delivers in the emotion. Almost every actor save for the horribly bland Canadian are perfectly cast in their roles. The script also is cleverly and beautifully written and not in a cheesy soapopera style. It is gripping it is depressing and it may shake you to your core. The ending where the family is reunited is not tacky or corny but it delivers a huge emotional satisfaction to the audience.The cinematography is arrestingly sweeping and the production design is top notch. The music is also grand and beautiful and Feng Xiaogang's direction is outstandingly focused.In short this is a definite early contender for a Best Foreign Film Academy Award next year. I can see it sweeping the Chinese Film Awards no doubt and I hope people see this beautiful film for its frankness and honesty of life's mysterious and sometimes depressing ways.Overall rating 910";

The earthquakes were really realistic. I watched this movie with my family last week and we loved it. I experienced a minor earthquake once last year on December 19 in Taiwan so I know how it feels like when someone dies in an earthquake. I was sobbing throughout the entire show. There were many touching scenes in this show and the effects of the earthquakes were extremely real. This movie tells us the lives of two siblings which parted after an earthquake and get adopted by two families. The shaking collapsing of the debris in this show is done very well. The director even took note of the time when this earthquake took place. The Tangshan earthquake really took place in the morning. This show depicts very well how peoples lives are lost in an earthquake and how their family members feel and how just one earthquake could cause a huge difference in their lives in the future. Though there are a few flaws in this movie The movie is slow pacing at times and at times it really does fall into a snail's pace. There was one part in the show which they dug the books from the ground was ridiculous. Wouldn't the books be eaten by the termites? I also could not understand the emotions of some of the characters during some parts of the show. All in All this is a great movie and is extremely touching Score810".

This is about a family torn apart by one of nature's most devastating disasters.

The acting was superb and the visual effects when the earthquake hit was some of the most impressive I've seen. It showed how brutal and deadly an earthquake really can be. From there the film was emotional and tugged at the heart strings. It was a beautiful depiction of loss love and keeping memories alive and a mother's grief that lasted more than three decades.If you're into disaster films you might not appreciate the film but if you're into drama movies this is perfect.".

It tells the story of a simple but happy family consisting of a father a mother and two twins a daughter and a son. When the earthquake hits the father dies when he tries to rescue his children. The young kids are trapped under a large slab of concrete. Lifting the slab to save one child would mean to probably kill the other one as well. The surviving mother who just witnessed her husband die must make a quick choice whether she wants to try to save her daughter or her son. She feels unable to take such a decision but doesn't have any choice and ultimately chooses to save her son.The son is saved but loses his arm. Ridden by guilt and unable to turn the page his mother lives as a recluse and refuses to get married again. She is afraid to let her son go away from home when he is older because she knows she will be all alone at that moment. He becomes a rickshaw driver and eventually the boss of a successful travel agency. He tries to leave his difficult past behind. He gets married and has a son but his mother doesn't want to live with them or move to another place which leads to conflicts debates and discussions between the mother her son and her daughterinlaw as old emotional wounds are opened again.On the other side the daughter has miraculously survived the earthquake as she wakes up next to her father's dead body. Traumatized by the events she first lives in a military camp before she gets adopted by a couple that doesn't have any children of its own. In the beginning she refuses to speak and accept her new family. While her foster father is very gentle and patient with her her foster mother is quite emotional and severe because she always wanted to have a daughter and is afraid of losing her. As she grows up the girl studies medicine but gets pregnant in the last year of her studies. When her boyfriend tries to convince her to abort the child she is unable to do this because of her childhood memories. She is shocked leaves her boyfriend doesn't finish her studies and moves to another town where she earns some money as a private English teacher. She tries to forget about her difficult past but when she meets a Canadian lawyer and decides to move to Vancouver she has to go see her foster father again who is bitterly disappointed that she left town and didn't even bother to call or contact him.The twins meet again by chance thirtytwo years after the Tangshan earthquake when both volunteer to rescue the victims of the Sichuan earthquake since they know how terrible such an earthquake can be. The young woman accepts to finally meet the mother that decided to let her die twentytwo years earlier. A broken family reunites and has to deal with sorrow loss and despair but ends up finding forgiveness hope and optimism.Aftershock convinces on many levels. The acting performances are very authentic. The movie touches many philosophical topics and exposes numerous ambiguous difficult and lifechanging decisions and situations. The story has epic proportions and remains yet profoundly human. The movie shows all characters with their flaws and strengths which makes the viewers feel empathy for them.On the other side the film's extremely emotional vibe gets a little bit overtly melodramatic at times. The movie is also at least half an hour too long and it's quite tough to sit through a series of tearjerking events for far over two hours. The movie loses some momentum towards the middle when the prodigal daughter mourns the death of her foster mother or when the handicapped son argues with his wife. On the other side the moment when the two twins talk to each other for the first time in thirtytwo years isn't shown. This would have been one of the climaxes of the movie and I can't understand why the director didn't emphasize on it.In the end Aftershock is a very philosophical drama. It convinces with authentic characters and great actors and an overall gripping story that convinces both emotionally and intellectually. On the other side it has an overlong middle section and is quite hard to digest at times. Fans of Asian cinema and profound dramas should watch this movie but it isn't as essential as some critics claim the film to be.".

The acting performances are very authentic. The movie touches many philosophical topics and exposes numerous ambiguous difficult and lifechanging decisions and situations. The story has epic proportions and remains yet profoundly human. The movie shows all characters with their flaws and strengths which makes the viewers feel empathy for them.On the other side the film's extremely emotional vibe gets a little bit overtly melodramatic at times. The movie is also at least half an hour too long and it's quite tough to sit through a series of tearjerking events for far over two hours. The movie loses some momentum towards the middle when the prodigal daughter mourns the death of her foster mother or when the handicapped son argues with his wife. On the other side the moment when the two twins talk to each other for the first time in thirtytwo years isn't shown. This would have been one of the climaxes of the movie and I can't understand why the director didn't emphasize on it.In the end Aftershock is a very philosophical drama. It convinces with authentic characters and great actors and an overall gripping story that convinces both emotionally and intellectually. On the other side it has an overlong middle section and is quite hard to digest at times. Fans of Asian cinema and profound dramas should watch this movie but it isn't as essential as some critics claim the film to be.";

	schema:headline " Well played Chinese film exploring the events born out of a disaster movie convention without needing to rely on such things to act as key elements to drama.";
	schema:reviewBody "Aftershock is a film that goes about exploring its characters after a terrific happening of both grief and consequence occurred in their lives in a straight up and in the most diligent of manners. There are few tricks no long nor drawn out nor overly expansive arcs nor are there masses of supporting acts coming and going and all having to go through rigmarole to make the same point  just sharp upfront and refreshingly honest portrayals of post traumatic stress disorders and that of grievances that tie together a mere handful of character  some people call it inadvertent melodrama I call it the refreshing antithesis to meandering pandering drudge such as The Curious Case of Benjamin Button or Magnolia. The film's sense of unavoidable gloom indeed impending disaster is present in the opening sequence a swarm of dragon flies seemingly uncharacteristically flocking away from a freight train yard and towards a level crossing pausing for one of those trains chugging by. Those exposed to the open air that is to say those not within the confines of an automobile or the cab of a lorry look on pensively caught in a situation that could escalate into something much more unpleasant by the barriers infront of them that prevent them escape. This is 1976 and the Chinese city of Tangshan a searing summer sees a family of four consisting of mother Yuan Ni Xu with her husband looking over their young children barely ten or so in daughter Fang Deng Zhang and son Fang Da Li. The family operate happily together the purchase of an item as simple or indeed as humbling as an electric fan for these hot summer evenings bringing about much joy Fang's victimisation at the hands of some equally young bullies whom he knows from here and there in stark comparison to his sister's empowered ability to stand up to them and effectively foil them so as to allow both their escape. Such a happening is symptomatic with young Fang Deng a fighter and a brave person whose attitude sees them thrust down onto a separate path as to what life would almost have certainly had in store for her had certain events not interfered. Then there is the item of that natural disaster a harrowing alarming and really rather affecting sequence of events treading a fine line between what makes for highend drama and just full on horror a sequence of events which in no way attempts to water down the scenario of death and destruction on a mass scale nor indeed eroticise content consisting of masses of buildings being torn down and people caught up in the midst of it. If criticism arose however many number of years ago citing a humanbeings' inability to outrun explosions and whatnot Aftershock is very much the antithesis to any Hollywoodised actioncomedisaster film feeding off of that suspended belief that humans can in fact out run natural disasters or fireballs born out of whatever hanging back to focus on what we can only speculate truly happens to those caught up and consequently perished amidst the chaos. One gripe which usually arises during said above filmic procedures comes in the form of characters often knowing precisely where to run or where to go in regards to being able to escape such a scenario Aftershock's emphasis on hapless Chinese citizens just blindly turning left and right in desperate attempts to escape the carnage is what particularly resonates. In effect the titular aftershocks are the events and revelations born out of this infamous truetolife Earthquake which went on to dramatically shape lives despite being an initial event grossly indebted to ending many others. These are aftershocks beginning in the aforementioned 1976 before broadening out across the 1980s and 90s each tiny event and happening very much character and action imbued in that the fallout from the earthquake has its own specific tremor or ripple on the lives of Yuan and her son as they live on with the presumption Fang Deng died that day. Her adoption following a series of unfortunate incidences by a married pair of rather loving Chinese soldiers from such an era of Communism oppression and whatnot sees her future foster parents watch on from within a makeshift orphanage through a small rectangular slat at Fang sitting on a crude stool eerily echoing that of hundreds of now parentless kids watching on in similar fashion at a film playing on a large screen in this a makeshift cinema. To a fair old degree Xiaogang Feng's film owes a great debt to that of Oliver Stone's 2006 piece World Trade Centre a film utilising a tragedy in doing so constructing the occurrence of which poignantly and dramatically in equal measure before going on to zero in on a handful of people whose lives are shaped in the aftermath of such an event. The films' timeframes are incomparably variable one spread out over a handful of decades with the other a mere few days at the most but the films are indelibly linked by a burning sense of everlasting tragedy born out of the break up of or potential of a family unit. Where both great terror and drama was wedged out of Stone's situating of his core characters underneath that of skyscraper rubble Feng's film effectively goes on to cover the lives of those under an emotional array of rubble a more metaphorical sense of being trapped under that of refuse and waste with what terrific happenings in the past having its effect down the ages. The results are resounding an engrossing character drama posing or perhaps sold as a disaster movie whose idea of great drama is not 'the event' itself but but how a broken family strive to survive their newfound new order in what is an amply played character drama.".
