Unfortunately it is a weird mix and while Leclerq obviously has a flair for aesthetics he would have been better off letting someone else write the script.Albert Dupontel better known as an actor and director of comedies continues his recent transition to more heroic roles. Here he has amazing presence and physicality playing David Hoffmann a hardnosed cop. Unfortunately the script is so bad the direction so poor that sometimes you just can't believe his lines or behavior.His character is not the only one lacking development and substance. Everyone surrounding him looks even more like a walking clich. Marie Guillard lacks credibility as Becker Hoffman's pretty rookie partner. Veteran actor Marthe Keller plays a doctor with an agenda and recites her uninspiring lines without conviction. Alain Figlarz is intensely physical as the movie's main goon but as a villain again the script doesn't sell him very well. There are many other characters we equally do not care about. Apparently in the future every woman in the police department will be a pretty girl who looks unfit for the job.So if the plot is terrible the characters uninteresting and their lines ridiculous why exactly does it deserve a 5 rating? Well for one there are martial arts scene in the pure tradition of Bourne. the context in which they happen is silly but their execution is actually flawless and they are pulsepounding. Kudos to Dupontel here. He delivers big. The rendition of a Paris in the notsodistant future is also beautiful. It's mostly interiors few outside shots but you do get a nice feel of what could realistically be the future. It's extremely stylish and European. Speaking of which the photography here is very good.What you're left with is a movie that combines elements of technothriller noir and scifi and takes itself very seriously. Unfortunately it's not done well enough. When your scenario lacks credibility a good way to save it is by injecting something else. Irony humor or romance. But Chrysalis never does that. And the action is sparse enough that we notice it's flaws.I hope Leclerq will pursue his career but I'd rather he directs and let someone write.".

The dualistic nature of the plot is well conceived and revealed sparingly there are some nice twists and surprises along the route and it never bogs down. Of course for myself I would have been content spending the entire 94 minutes happily watching only Mlanie Thierry's face but that's just me...  Seriously give it a spin  you won't consider it a wasted 90 minutes if you like crimescifi and great art direction in an intimate setting without loads of CGI just be aware it's not a major undertaking like the Terminator or Matrix series  but if you don't need quite that much excitement to be entertained  it's very satisfying .".

The director sought to create a future vision that's not quite dystopian yet definitely not full of rainbows  unicorns. It is a very claustrophobic psychological story that progresses on 2 levels. The first level is the straightforward actionthrillerscifi part a rogue Paris cop is hunting down the killer who ruined his life. The 2nd level is a very human yet equally tense story about a woman who is reconnecting with her daughter after a terrible accident which caused the girl to have amnesia. Confounding at first it is interesting to see how these two seemingly distant stories come together.A wellwritten story and good script give all the actors a chance to shine as each plays the role of a deeply complex character. We have the main hero a tough guy of few words who is coming to grips with his ruined life as well as the realization of what a monster he has become. His female partner is a rookie entering the story as a nave kid who got the job only because her uncle is a big honcho but ultimately she develops a forceful personality of her own. The mother in the 2nd story is very cryptic and you don't know what drives her or if she's a good person or bad person until the end. And the daughter whose confused  innocent portrayal of a person struggling to regain her identity had me riveted in every scene.So yes you could approach this as a straightforward scifiactioncrimethriller or you could also see it as a story of people findingor rather choosingwhom they want to be.

The movie opens on back to back shock you into the movie scenes that set up the parallel stories that will be played out. The cast is great. Albert Dupontel as David Hoffman is a total bad ass grim and tough as hell. There seems to be an ocean of emotion behind his stoic tough facade. Marthe Keller is also a stand out. Just an incredible actress to watch. None of the relationships in this movie are predicable which makes it very intriguing and though all these characters are familiar to this genre all of them come off as totally believable people. This is something that lacks in most American versions of the genre.The fight scenes rock. Simple staging no wire work. It's just tough sons of bitches beating the crap out of each other in some brutal future martial art. There are twists and great scenes throughout. And though I've watched it twice and am still not sure of exactly all that happened I don't care. I'm going to buy the DVD. Julien Leclercq is a Director and Writer to watch. I hope to see more from him. And a word of advice to the Director. Don't move to Hollywood. They would just ruin you. Look what happened to John Woo.Great Movie.Peace.".

Directors like Melville knew that they could not compete on special effects etcetera because of the smaller budgets. They took the only possible course do what Hollywood doesn't dare to do. Chrysalis breaks the Hollywood conventions as well and still stands firm in the French tradition. The pale colours remind us of classics like Le Samourai the Hoffmann character could have been played by Alain Delon in his heydays. Dialogues are minimalistic and therefor highly effective. The two story lines first are independent and gradually merge. Montage between the two is brilliant every scene makes you longing for the next one. Only halfway the meaning of the opening scene is partly revealed only near the end you will understand it fully. So some patience and a bigger attention span than average is demanded  and rewarded. The movie has two weak points. First of all there is the plot. Probably I am not fair but I find it hard to accept the plots of Robocop and Terminator as well. Never will movies like that get more than 8 stars. Second I find the Hoffmann character not that convincing anymore after his accident. Don't take my criticism too hard. Deviating from the Hollywood norm involves risks so should be praised. Chrysalis is highly entertaining and intriguing unless you prefer the standard brainless and predictable stuff. And never I have seen such cold scenery.".

First the story is so empty dull and finally stupid that it could have been told in 15 minutes max. But much worst is the directing style that is terribly boring. It starts nicely visually like for an advertising for any high end contemporary luxury product as if it was the only intention of the director to prove that he could do it nicely with tons of cash. But having to watch this commercial for more than 30 secs but a full hour and a half becomes very painful after just 15 minutes. The directing is terribly boring with endless very useless slow camera moves on cold architecture useless moving cars actors walking in or out for 20 secs or elevators elevating for a good 20 or 30 secs. What the hell?!? Mixed with fistfights with no visual interest a very dumb and not plausible shooting while running scene where one cannot shoot another from 2 meters and endless slow paced and useless scenes that should have been cut out or not even be shot to start with. Very soon it all appears very pretentious. Because when they finally talk foreigners might not hear it but the tone is often horribly false especially with the German accent of the blond actress. Her tone is SO wrong. It becomes a torture like with very bad amateur karaoke singers. I do not understand how a director cannot hear it when editing. like a musician without hears. Dupontel who I usually always love despite very strange bad career choices has no lines here and is only one color tinted making his character totally dull and boring after 20 minutes. Melanie Thierry is not bad but a bit transparent here despite extraordinary facial features. No characters has any interesting point besides the villain just because he remains a bit mysterious but we'll quickly discover that besides his strange eastern accent he has nothing more to deliver than pure brute stupid violence. Sublime former French model Estelle Lefbure took an honorable chance to show some of her unknown acting talents and truly did not fall in many traps and delivers as much emotion as the script allows her to maybe even a bit more. But of course there was not much to deliver from the script and to remember particularly to start with. Overall I had to push 2x faster button many many too many times to not fall asleep for a third time. This movie can only be an excellent berceuse something to go to sleep in 1015 minutes if you don't mind having to start over the next day to this where it goes. And there is no spoil here in telling that it leads NOWHERE. Good Luck. pass your way. PS On this same SciFi topic of memory manipulation I just watched Paycheck from P.K. Dick and John Woo and that was way much better even if really not good neither. Mandchurian Candidate seems to keep staying one good reference.".

	schema:reviewBody "CHRYSALIS is that rarest of things a French SF film. It's about a cop in the near future who hunts for the man who killed his partner cum lover only to stumble across a medical conspiracy. It's a glossy but ultimately unrewarding thriller which feels longer than its short 90 minute running time for the simple reason that the characters are opaque and the plot predictable I guessed the end twist around the halfway mark. Unsurprisingly the richest and most bourgeois white character is the villain. The shiny aesthetic minimal dialogue stock characters and brutal fights are effective in their own genre fashion but the absence of heart humour and humanity leaves it feeling empty.

	onyx:emotionText "CHRYSALIS is that rarest of things a French SF film. It's about a cop in the near future who hunts for the man who killed his partner cum lover only to stumble across a medical conspiracy. It's a glossy but ultimately unrewarding thriller which feels longer than its short 90 minute running time for the simple reason that the characters are opaque and the plot predictable I guessed the end twist around the halfway mark. Unsurprisingly the richest and most bourgeois white character is the villain. The shiny aesthetic minimal dialogue stock characters and brutal fights are effective in their own genre fashion but the absence of heart humour and humanity leaves it feeling empty. The cast is a fabulous collection of handsome skinhead coppers sleekly pale women and brutish apelike Eastern European criminals but they all have too little to do. Watching the documentary features makes the failure understandable the director was so intent on creating complex highly technical shots that he simply paid no attention to the writing.";

That combination of elements seemed too much for some viewers. 'Chrysalis' has a very interesting central concept and is well written directed and acted. It is not the usual mindless fodder that gets pumped out in genre pics. It requires you getting engaged in whats unfolding. The future that is created is believable and doesn't overwhelm the story. There are great stylized fight scenes in this. They appear to to be a combo of Aikido and Krav Maga. Albert Dupontel is a total badass as the main detective. Melanie Theirry is very good as is all the rest of the cast. The movie stays focused on the characters and the story and never lets spectacle or 'big concept' drive the action. There's a fully developed subtext to the film about the perils of living in the past. The film works on many different levels but requires some effort from the viewer. The movie is smart without being clever and has a message though it doesn't preach. If you like good SciFi you will enjoy it. I liked it so much I had to add it to my DVD collection. The whole thing reminds me of a very well written Heavy Metal comic.".

What made this film SO very effective was not only it's technical brilliance excellent writing and story line but also that the set design was amazing. Any Sci Fi elements were very subtle and not overwhelming. It comes across more as a SLIGHTLY futuristic Crime Thriller. Nothing overt or heavy handed this is definitely NO STAR TREK or STAR WARS although I very much DO appreciate those kinds of 'heavier' Sci Fi too... Whenever Sci Fi elements are used they are very understated and well integrated into the overall design and concept of the story.I REALLY liked the tone and look of this film and I'm NOT one much really for French films per se   Most of them especially older Classic ones I find deliberately vague and pretentious for the most part. But this one had EVERYTHING nicely and tightly arranged and was put together in such a way so that after seeing it you come away feeling that you just watched a DAMN good film!I also very much enjoyed the sound used in the movie. Nice touches in the background especially the songs used during the sequences showing the various floors of the medical facility and during the virtual operation were quite effective.There really isn't much more to add except that if you don't mind reading subtitles and you like a very clever well thought out and intriguing Crime Thriller and you appreciate nice set design then you should by all means find this film very fun and entertaining.".

	schema:reviewBody "French director Julien Leclercq who also coscripted this film set in 'the near future' has produced a marvel of style and menace in this tale riddled with ambiguities. There are identical twins people who switch identities people who forget entirely who they are others who remember being someone else and general questions of identity. The film is a tease and is extremely thoughtprovoking. The colour film stock has been flashed so that it is very faded and the scenes have then been tinted blue by shooting through a blue lens which sometimes is removed when focusing on the people. In fact there seem to be several tones and shades and whether this was done while shooting or in the film processing I do not know. At times it is nearly 'blanc et noir' as the French call black and white or should I say 'bleu et noir'. The art direction is superb. Some of the acting is intentionally stylized with the secret villains remaining aloof calculating and showing hypocritical and unconvincing warmth to the people they are manipulating in the story. The Bulgarian villain is convincingly psychopathic and really he is the best example I have seen why Bulgarians should be restricted in their right to travel within the EU. We just don't want to run into him or his brother! There are some grisly but mindboggling scenes of intense individual combat and martial arts at close quarters in confined spaces here and I cannot imagine how many weeks or months it must have taken to rehearse all those moves. The film has some deeply disturbing aspects of technological innovation as applied to human mind manipulation and there are numerous stressful scenes which sensitive souls would do well not to watch. If you have a low stress level do not buy this DVD as you really will not be able to sleep afterwards. But for those who can tough it out it is well worth watching and studying carefully. Leclercq is above all a master stylist and perhaps he should be a designer. There are several excellent performances in this film and it does not matter that the dialogue is rudimentary for the silences and ambiguities are all the more effective as a result of the lack of verbal exposition. As is usual in all modern French thrillers a sense of deep paranoia about the French state pervades the tale and the security services are the ultimate villains. And now that the French state is run by what they call 'the Bermuda Triangle' Hollande and his two feuding women the fact that people disappear and reemerge memories vanish into black holes and are then summoned forth again seems part of the surreal political landscape of today as if it had been anticipated by Leclercq in 2007 and premonitorily evoked. Instead of the women and girls being called Manon and Clemence as in this film one expects them to be called Segolne and Valrie. Or would that be too much for the nerves to bear? And at the controls of the new technology in this film is the eerie Marthe Keller who plays a German immigrant to France thus reminding us of 1940 and all those charming Germans who came to France at that time with similar intentions to make people disappear. The warnings about mind control implicit in this film should be taken seriously. Mind control projects have been going on for half a century or more and they only get worse so watch and learn.".

Absolutely loved it and have pretty clear recollection of most of it it's amazing! I was a bit blinded by some of the homoerotic content and had no idea that Jarman would go on to make a number of arthouse films many also dealing with homosexual texts such as Carravagio a painter I absolutely love as well as Edward the Second film version of Christopher Marlowe's play of the fay king of England. The acting in Sebastiane may seem stilted but that also might be due to the fact that many of the actors were amateurs the Latin for me also lent an aura of authenticity since I studied Latin in highschool for five years. The historical accuracy of the life of Sebastian the saint was more correct than most of the hagiographies of his life. The settings were perfect the depictions quite accurate the drunken scenes were real because they really were drunk. The hand held quality of the film was a pioneering method of filming that also lends to the realism of the period. All in all a wonderfully creative even innovative stylised film that I remind to those who enjoy auteur and arthouse plus homoerotic movies. The sound track was done by Brian Eno and was released separately as Music for a Movie. This is the only part of the film that strikes me as incongruous but somehow the moody style set by Eno's pioneering electronic music does work. Needless to say that Jarman's short filmography is to my mind very impressive.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's surprising more comments haven't been posted for this production which at the time of its original release created quite a stir. Perhaps the film's failure to create a continuing subgenre of imitators is to blame but then that makes it a oneofakind effort and efforts of this sort deserve remembering as well.Looking back on the film from more than a quarter of a century it seems clear that normal criteria concerning story dialog and character simply don't apply here. Instead one must simply view it as a feverish almost hallucinogenic fantasy drenched with homoerotic sadomasochistic imagery that is played out against a sundrenched dreamscape on the Sardinian coast. Think of it as a highclass photo shoot for an avantgarde fashion magazine specializing in loincloths and Roman military paraphernalia.Having the dialog spoken in Latin can be dismissed as a gimmick but actually it adds to the film's air of mystery and unreality. If only some of the anachronisms could have been avoided!Considering the possibilities there's surprisingly little sex here though it's a subject often discussed and indeed the whole film is imbued with an air of desire and yearning. On the other hand there's a plethora of bondage and torture. Leonardo Treviglio who plays the title character and who spends most of the movie in no more than a loincloth is hanged by his wrists and flogged burned with a flame staked out spreadeaglestyle under the scorching sun and finally shot full of arrows. Curiously his most memorable torment is also the simplest. Barney James playing the commanding officer who's torn by conflicting emotions takes a handful of sand and grinds it into Treviglio's bare torso blurring the lines between pleasure and pain between lust and longing. It's a memorable moment in a movie that is now halfforgotten ... like one of those dreams which fade from the mind after you awaken even though you try to recall the details.".

Seeing it now I can understand how in the mid80s or when it came out in 1976 this would have been one of those films so controversial even the act of lifting the sleeve off the video shelf meant if you weren't out you first had to look to the left to the right and over your shoulder to make sure no one was looking. Such is the power of a film like this no disguised theme no hints of the other sexuality  this is homosexuality at its frankest and cruelest.The story of the lovehate relationship between Sebastiane and a Severus a Roman centurion and its consequences. It's shot in an entirely realistic setting even when it bears a loose plot thread but this is Derek Jarman's tendency to focus on style over substance. While there were times when I wondered what would the purpose of such a story be the theme of unrequited lovelust wasn't lost on me Sebastiane is an outsider with brooding looks and an aura about him that sets him apart from his fellow comrades who spend their time engaged in trivial hedonism. Severus is smitten by him lusts at him from a distance and then decides to submit him to torture after torture because of the indifference then rejection he suffers. This is a reflection of a dance sequence seen at the start of the film in which a dancer is sacrificed to the lust of a group of dancers. Derek Jarman's movie seems to be less a straightforward narration instead of a contemplative poem of a homosocial society where women are absent and men are allowed to engage in intimacy with one another. It's on occasion a slow movie because of this and by today's values could even be considered a little cheesy here and there especially in the slowmotion sequence when Severus observes Sebastiane take a shower. Is Sebastiane provoking him by showering like that or is this Severus' gaze taking in all of Sebastiane's body? One wouldn't know had it been for another scene that of Anthony and Adrian lovers in the open again observed by Severus's point of view. These two scenes make Severus less a flat villain and closer to a man desperately love with a man he cannot have a man who is essentially a tease.Not a movie that will appeal to everyone but one that has due to its release and presence in video stores and due to its director's prominence opened the doors to more films of this kind which have their own audience and acceptance whether they are contemporary classics or exercises in homoerotic cheese. Derek Jarman accelerated conscious gay filmmaking by decades at a time when a gay presence was little more than a shadow or something to be laughed at or pitied as with the advent of AIDS and AIDSthemed films. You have to admire a man who having died of the disease decided to get up and do something instead of wallowing in maudlin. There hasn't been anyone quite like him but hopefully that will change.".

But Jarman is a visual artist and his film has more in common with the many paintings of Sebastian than it does with factual storytelling. Jarman's ornate decor can sometimes feel dull and bland  his films can seem lifeless bogged down by the set decoration. This calls to mind Velvet Goldmine a complex film I didn't care for even though I love Todd Haynes I want to like Jarman  I love his books  and this is the first film of his that I've been actively enthusiastic about. It has much more to do with sex than history and it's apolitical and political at the same time.Consider the film's approach to homosexuality. No one is defined as being a homosexual so that at first seems like a depoliticization of sex  all there are are acts and acts are not political. But at the same time it's acts that are disdained and made illegal and without the political approach to defining and thereby defending people as homosexuals it leaves the acts open to censorship and condemnation  politicization. As a film itself though it is not pedantic or accusatory  in fact Sebastian is killed it seems because of the lust of Severus who he refuses. Like the Christian God who Sebastian loves and sees as more beautiful than Adonis Severus wants Sebastian. But it isn't just condemning lust either  Anthony and Adrian are openly lovers and the abundance of male nudity and the eroticism of it by Jarman could hardly be called prudish. In fact there is a scene at night of the men grabbing each other their darklit bodies and the soldier pressing his nearnaked muscled body on his lover that still seems shocking in its passion today.It's more like a lyrical tone poem and Brian Eno's New Agey score goes well with that. Jarman isn't a bully and when the crucifying comes around he doesn't bludgeon us  first we see a closeup of his face as arrows pierce through Sebastian's skin silently with the exception of the wind and Jarman gives us one final distorted image to meditate on the death of the one we can't have. 910".

The story runs in a smooth way as if someone with a camera perhaps thanks to a Time machinewas hiding to catch those moments. I can't find the scandalous issue here. I find quite natural that between a bunch of men exiled from the city of Rome violence and desire could rise. Love and love resistance and violence and non violence. These are the arguments. I think Jarman made a beautiful movie sensible of religious meaning in the case of Sebastiane and of love and frustration in the case of the Captain. The film reminds me absolutely Golding's Lord of the flies as the situation is similar. The film probably lacks passion or interior force but this was only Jarman's first movie. I recommend this movie as I would Pasolini's Edipo I think both movies or perhaps the two director's sensibilities are in touch here.".

	schema:reviewBody "While not his strongest film Sebastiane is classic Derek Jarman. The movie captures the potential for violence and lust in a small group of exiled young soldiers. As with all Jarman the visuals here are more important than any dialog and they wash over the viewer in waves of longing and fearinducing power. The film meditates on intersections of longing desire faith and obsession especially as they play out between Severus and Sebastiane.Sebastiane's obsessive Christian faith rivals the lustful obsession of Serverus for this unattainable man. The movie doesn't flinch from showing how brutal desire can be it is a hard master for both Serverus and Sabastiane. What I came away from the film with is the powerful question What horrors and debasements will we all put ourselves through for the object of our lust?".

	onyx:emotionText "While not his strongest film Sebastiane is classic Derek Jarman. The movie captures the potential for violence and lust in a small group of exiled young soldiers. As with all Jarman the visuals here are more important than any dialog and they wash over the viewer in waves of longing and fearinducing power. The film meditates on intersections of longing desire faith and obsession especially as they play out between Severus and Sebastiane.Sebastiane's obsessive Christian faith rivals the lustful obsession of Serverus for this unattainable man. The movie doesn't flinch from showing how brutal desire can be it is a hard master for both Serverus and Sabastiane. What I came away from the film with is the powerful question What horrors and debasements will we all put ourselves through for the object of our lust?";

The film explores the myth behind St. Sebastian whose paintings and imagery have always been linked to queerness as he was one of the only male figures to be sexualized a rare occurrence with his naked arrowed chest. Sebastiane a Christian is exiled to a remote sort of military camp. The emphasis as has been said is clearly on the visual.The air permeates and oozes of sexual desire and longing. Soldiers are half naked throughout often wrestling joking and talking a lot about sex. Sebastiane stands apart because of his Christian beliefs and the film explores the sado masochism inherent in martyrdom the pleasure the pain brings further strengthening his convictions. Sebastiane believes strongly in a higher power and the film itself seems em bused with a spirituality in its slow contemplative shots of nature. The film also deals heavily with unrequited love both Justin and Severes have an eye for Sebastiane but express it in very different ways. There is also a gay couple among the soldiers whose love is tender and natural. Jarman has a distinct voice his films and imagery feel deeply personal and are generally in my opinion fascinating to watch.".

Certainly not one for homophobes.Visually striking as is typical of Jarman this film is best known for being the first film to be filmed entirely in Latin The Holy Office from Spain in 1975 had some dialogue in Latin but also Hebrew and also for being Jarman's debut feature he had worked on three pictures beforehand including Ken Russell's The Devils but this was his first directing job. As with most of Jarman's work Sebastiane is very arthouse and will rarely be played on television Channel 4 here in the UK last played it a few years ago in a Jarman season.

In his most striking appearance he comes while Sebastian is delirious arguably after a sunstroke about God's love exemplified by the sun's caresses. I don't know if the text he recites is some sort of quotes I am not informed on Sebastian's sayings and doings but his sensuous Christian speech strikes an uncanny note with the fact that the man in the leopard skin is a common depiction of Dionysus is this a Nietszchean shortcircuit between Apollo who Sebastian names as the sun and Dionysus or a farewell to his preChristian past? We do not get an answer and this is poetically just.The second is the more lighthearted and sly one. The gladiatorwithoutanose seething with repressed homosexual feelings apart from serving as a catalyst for Severus' own feelings gets an unexpected treatment in the scene where he babbles about Fellini's Satyricon and DeMille's decadence and this is the actually pure and queer sensibility of the film we sense Jarman makes a short circuit between garrulous filmgoers interested in a gossipy manner in films and repressed gays. This is accurate and hilarious.These two instances evacuate the film from any easy sense of queerness or what actual side if that matters its maker is on. Is it on the side of lust? No as Sebastian himself says and exemplifies Do you think your drunk lust will equal the love of God? This is eloquent enough. But then is it some sort of apologia for Christianity among deviant bored querulous soldiers? The Billy Budd turn does not elucidate matters either. For all it being obviously borrowed from Melville's story it makes sense when we add it up to Max's the gladiatorwithoutanose seething repression perhaps because he is the spineless spine of the film. Even the notorious slowmo of the two lovers playingfighting in the water is not that sensuous but has an odd generic quality about it as if they were lovers out of being bored soldiers. I argue so because that scene was also patterned on a previous model namely the groundbreaking A very natural thing appearing two years before Jarman's film with the same aquatic play between lovers only there it had a sense of paradise regained not that suspending ambiguity note also that these two lovers are dumbly obedient in performing Sebastian's tortures.It is Sebastian himself that I take as Jarman's misstep and by that I do not mean in casting that specific actor as much as directing him into to put it that way passivity. He is too passive in order to validate his ordeal we do not connect actively with him. Recalling Pasolini's naturals but not as engaging he also has the wrong physique to convince us he is a lover of the sun.On the other hand even if it smells a bit too metaphysical jumping a bit on our backs the final distorted shot is a masterstroke in the best tradition of Mannerist painting and succinctly says what it has to now that Sebastian has died we can look at everything at a 360 degrees angle and see nothing now that his spirit is gone Jarman conflates it with the gaze as object to borrow a phrase from current film studies. Looking at everything at once is inscribed with a distortion a grimace of the real. This distortion coincides with us looking from his position and it is the conflation of the gaze and the holy body that gives the film its richness.Eno's soundtrack with its spare evocative tintinnabulation is apt punctuation for the film's genuine gesturing spirituality.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film is a gem in the global history of LGBT cinema partly for the reason it doesn't promote selfshaming. While the life of St. Sebastiane is portrayed in a partly fictitious manner certain traditions and beliefs ingrained in the culture of the Roman Empire are honestly depicted. Samesex love was still prevalent during the Early Christian Era of Rome. It was not perceived to be an act against religious faith for at the time even aristocratic men who were married were still respected if having been discovered to partake in sexual intercourse with male servants. Women played a submissive domestic role. They were thus regarded as merely a means to produce male children. There was no religious scripture condemning homosexuality or samesex love at the time. Society had not evolved to the point in which it would began to shame itself for possessing natural tendencies until polytheism became extinct in the Early Medieval Era.The military culture in the film is rustic aggressive bold and hyper masculine. All scenes contain soldiers wearing a loincloth or nothing at all. The climate of the region is very hot. No character is modest in displaying combat skills love and affection for another. The troop's constant disdain for any traditionbelief contrary to their own is a recurring theme. Sebastiane becomes the target of the troop's aggressive nature willingly embracing his persecution. It comes across as a Christian being devoured by a lion in the Roman Colosseum. The troop stationed in a desolate spot on the coast of the Italian peninsula ridicules tortures and eventually executes Sebastiane for refusing to relinquish his chastity and adherence to the new faith. It may be perceived that he was mistreated for rejecting his station in life though at the time anyone who joined the military did not think twice about giving up arms for a peaceful life. Sebastiane would have participated in warfare if the Emperor commanded it. In 3rd Century Imperial Rome Christianity and Polytheism were in conflict resulting in reigns marked by global adherence for polytheism or peace between different religious communities. During Sebastiane's life Christianity was still a minority religion. It was treated as a threat to the security of the Empire. Anyone who openly practiced the faith was executed. Churches built were destroyed for the construction of temples. The Emperor was unwilling to show leniency towards anyone who contested his divine authority. There is only one soldier who regards Sebastiane as a friend Justin. Even though they don't become lovers they are bound to one another through mutual trust and compassion. Justin is willing to listen to Sebastiane's viewpoints and knowledge of Jesus Christ. When watching his friend dance he is enraptured by graceful movement. He acts as a barrier between Sebastiane and the troop. Without Justin's diligent protection Sebastiane would have been executed early on in his punishment. It is somewhat of an irony that despite Commander Severus' multiple attempts to subdue his defiant soldier he appears indifferent to Sebastiane's devotion to Jesus Christ. He threatens to kill him if he does not reciprocate his advances. He is after all a mere man stranded in an area far from civilization. Alcoholism ruins his self restraint though Sebastiane does not succumb to anger or hatred. He takes this injustice in stride for his faith teaches him to show compassion towards the flaws of a person. The film equates nudity with misery. When someone is miserable a person can easily see it. His life is consuming him mercilessly so no effort to hide it is made. The men are nude for their violence internal conflict masculinity and love for one another are the interlocking factors of the story. Nudity emphasizes the relationship between these things. It gives the audience a message that human nature in Imperial Rome is truly understood if one takes away the subtlety and ambiguity redundantly utilized in the artistic portrayal of this historical period.It would be amiss to not mention that that nudity in a Mediterranean climate was considered reasonable during the summer season amongst cloistered men. Being fully clothed was just foolishness. If no woman is in sight a man would not feel uncomfortable in taking his clothes off. He is surrounded by friends whom he trusts and shares a bond with. I commend the late Director Derek Jarman for instructing his entire cast to speak in Latin. There are only a handful of films in Post modernist Cinema that are entirely produced in classical language. Latin much like Sanskrit is viewed as a dead language thus Derek Jarman's effort to present Imperial Roman culture as accurate as possible is dignified.".

Society had not evolved to the point in which it would began to shame itself for possessing natural tendencies until polytheism became extinct in the Early Medieval Era.The military culture in the film is rustic aggressive bold and hyper masculine. All scenes contain soldiers wearing a loincloth or nothing at all. The climate of the region is very hot. No character is modest in displaying combat skills love and affection for another. The troop's constant disdain for any traditionbelief contrary to their own is a recurring theme. Sebastiane becomes the target of the troop's aggressive nature willingly embracing his persecution. It comes across as a Christian being devoured by a lion in the Roman Colosseum. The troop stationed in a desolate spot on the coast of the Italian peninsula ridicules tortures and eventually executes Sebastiane for refusing to relinquish his chastity and adherence to the new faith. It may be perceived that he was mistreated for rejecting his station in life though at the time anyone who joined the military did not think twice about giving up arms for a peaceful life. Sebastiane would have participated in warfare if the Emperor commanded it. In 3rd Century Imperial Rome Christianity and Polytheism were in conflict resulting in reigns marked by global adherence for polytheism or peace between different religious communities. During Sebastiane's life Christianity was still a minority religion. It was treated as a threat to the security of the Empire. Anyone who openly practiced the faith was executed. Churches built were destroyed for the construction of temples. The Emperor was unwilling to show leniency towards anyone who contested his divine authority. There is only one soldier who regards Sebastiane as a friend Justin. Even though they don't become lovers they are bound to one another through mutual trust and compassion. Justin is willing to listen to Sebastiane's viewpoints and knowledge of Jesus Christ. When watching his friend dance he is enraptured by graceful movement. He acts as a barrier between Sebastiane and the troop. Without Justin's diligent protection Sebastiane would have been executed early on in his punishment. It is somewhat of an irony that despite Commander Severus' multiple attempts to subdue his defiant soldier he appears indifferent to Sebastiane's devotion to Jesus Christ. He threatens to kill him if he does not reciprocate his advances. He is after all a mere man stranded in an area far from civilization. Alcoholism ruins his self restraint though Sebastiane does not succumb to anger or hatred. He takes this injustice in stride for his faith teaches him to show compassion towards the flaws of a person. The film equates nudity with misery. When someone is miserable a person can easily see it. His life is consuming him mercilessly so no effort to hide it is made. The men are nude for their violence internal conflict masculinity and love for one another are the interlocking factors of the story. Nudity emphasizes the relationship between these things. It gives the audience a message that human nature in Imperial Rome is truly understood if one takes away the subtlety and ambiguity redundantly utilized in the artistic portrayal of this historical period.It would be amiss to not mention that that nudity in a Mediterranean climate was considered reasonable during the summer season amongst cloistered men. Being fully clothed was just foolishness. If no woman is in sight a man would not feel uncomfortable in taking his clothes off. He is surrounded by friends whom he trusts and shares a bond with. I commend the late Director Derek Jarman for instructing his entire cast to speak in Latin. There are only a handful of films in Post modernist Cinema that are entirely produced in classical language. Latin much like Sanskrit is viewed as a dead language thus Derek Jarman's effort to present Imperial Roman culture as accurate as possible is dignified.";

I have had to consult a saint's dictionary to find out exactly who the saint was what he did and why he's revered. The facts have little relevance to this film.Jarman's Sebastiane seems to be an imagined back story of how homo eroticism might have come to be associated with the saint's imagery. The story's framework gives Jarman an opportunity to incorporate big themes into the film persecution alpha males authority love unrequited love devotion loyalty idealism morality and group dynamics. Religion not so much. These themes are not editorialized necessarily other than being woven into the daily lives of a small group of Roman soldiers living in an isolated outpost.While Sebastiane's Christianity is the reason he is persecuted by his comrades Sebastiane does not evangelize. His Christianity in the few instances he articulates it seems to be a jumble of spiritual and erotic love for the Christian god and the god Apollo. Sebastiane's ideals also seem to be somewhat muddled. After a lengthy group training session with mock sword fights he throws down his weapon and declares that Christians don't fight. His participation in the practice fight and his sudden refusal to continue don't make any logical sense perhaps the scene is meant to be a metaphor for a gay man refusing to act straight any longer.The whole movie is of course somewhat of a rumination about what it means to be a gay man and outside of the mainstream of male sexuality. It acknowledges that being male includes same sex activity but it also makes it clear that exclusive same sex activity especially if there is sentiment attached is considered aberrant. In other words it's okay for straight males to screw each other but it's not okay for them to love each other.The film is often cited as an exercise in selfindulgent eroticism and I'd agree it leans in that direction. The naked men are not hard to look at especially the extraordinarily sexy Ken Hicks. There is a long slowmotion scene of him frolicking with his lover that would not be out of place as an introductory sequence in any '70s gay porn movie. I can understand intellectually why it deserves to be included but I think the film would have been strongerand taken more seriouslyif those kinds of scenes had been minimized.I found the end of the film somewhat unsatisfactory. Sebastiane's martyrdom looks more like target practice than an execution. I think that Jarman's having each soldier in turn shoot Sebastiane with an arrow was meant to symbolize something but whatever it was eluded me. By stretching it out the scene lost its power. I suppose it was done that way to emphasize the origin of the familiar homo erotic imagery of the saint but it didn't feel right to me.This film is required viewing for any student of gay cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is not a religious film. But this film is not an anti religious film. This film is about the rejection of a group of men banned out of society to some outlandish deserted area and what happens among them who have nothing to do and are under the command of an officer who is banned exactly the same way. First they are obsessed by sex since it is the main human activity they cannot have at least in a normal heterosexual way. So they live that sexual obsession in jokes in some brutality in some dreams or some homosexual surrogate activities. But even so hunting a wild pig and killing it having fake fights with wooden weapons are definitely not enough to satisfy their frustrations and their desires. If you are the officer you can order one simple soldier to satisfy your sexual impulse but otherwise we are in a plain case of playing or raping. The film apart from showing the homosexual relation between two soldiers reveals the fact that there are two Christians in the group and they are taken as scapegoats. One of them is Sebastian and he is tortured by the officer and by the soldiers because he refuses to fight because Christians do not fight. The officer takes a great pleasure in whipping him torturing him day and night tying him down in the sunshine for hours trying to force him to accept to let him make love to him and strangely enough he does not rape him though Sebastian refuses to service him. The soldiers do not touch him because he is the officer's prey toy possession. But they get even with the second Christian they torture physically just because he is a Christian. That is segregation and racism hostility based on pure and simple religious rejection. The person who is not like you who is different from you is a natural prey to your frustrations and compensations of these.Then the killing of Sebastian the way it is known in Catholic and Christian folklore is of course staged by the officer who makes each man shoot one arrow at Sebastian and even the second Christian is forced to shoot his own arrow and Sebastian is abandoned to die of his wounds in the sunshine. But the film is targeting a far more important and universal theme. Anyone who is different is the potential victim of such persecution and Derek Jarman is of course speaking of men who are gay in our society at least in his society in 1976 and how they were rejected ostracized violated raped brutalized and even persecuted by the police. And beyond this sexual segregation the human species hence humanity has always cultivated segregation persecution and apartheid against those they classify as different. The human species hence humanity is a segregative species. This is a deeply pessimistic vision but the evolution on such a subject is slow very slow and can take two steps forwards and three or four backwards just afterwards. The most fascinating and strongest aspect of the film is the way Derek Jarman show suffering as being a beautiful experience. Sebastian transforms his torture into a direct contact with Jesus and God. He transforms the sun into the kiss of God. He finds his love in his being tortured but his love goes to Jesus and God because his suffering is the proof of Jesus's and God's existence they exist because he believes in them and because he is made to suffer because of this belief. His suffering casts his belief in bronze and Jesus and God in gold. Then the plastic beauty of these bodies mostly nude or quasinude is just the mirage that Derek Jarman sends into our minds and our eyes the mirage that the film is only about the beauty of male bodies these bodies that are nothing but vanity because the only important thing is not the bodies of these men but their moral or ethical integrity and then life and death are like the two sides of the same coin when you are a Christian. Life is dedicated to longing for death to rejoin the company of Jesus and God. And death is the escape door from the limited and locked up physical life into the eternal life of the soul in communion with God and Jesus in absolute union with them. When we finally reach that understanding that deep communion with man's spiritual dream and project the fact that they are in the nude undressed does not count any more We do not see it any more or we do not feel any appeal in that nudity.That's the real project of Derek Jarman to make us reach beyond erotic or pornographic voyeurism to lift our souls and minds to the contemplation of purity in the midst of total perdition and sacrilege perdition of human integrity and sacrilege of human perversity. This film should thus not be restricted because it is the most beautiful lesson of visionary enlightenment.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU".

	schema:reviewBody "Derek Jarman's feature film debut is an impressive effort that is as steamy and homoerotic as a biblical tragedy can get. Filmed entirely in what is referred to as vulgar Latin 'Sebastiane' inserts into the classic Bible story heavy overtones of homosexual love and lust something not too shocking for a filmmaker like Jarman to do considering the rest of his career.  The opening sequence is definitely the highlight for me. It's definitely the strangest moment in the film it is very Felliniesque and has an eyepopping and colorful quality that is not returned to later in the film. It is broadly bizarre stuff but very funny and mildly humorous. And speaking of humour I will have to bring myself to comment upon how unexpectedly funny this film is. It's awfully sad too of course by the end it is a straightup tragedy but throughout there are funny moments. Much of them come through the ribald and overthetop senses of humour some of the characters possess and express wgreat enthusiasm and energy. Some scenes made me genuinely laugh out loud helping add to the watchability of this really slow and for the majority of its runtime somewhat uneventful film.  The film is at its strongest in its earlier and later sections. During the middle of the movie it is still well crafted and still carries many great elements but it's also occasionally somewhat boring and I was only halfpaying attention during a few scenes. However the film is soon able to pick up speed and by the end it has had an actual emotional impact. It is beautifully shot too despite its shoestring budget essentially all technical aspects of the film are gorgeously done the cinematography and score especially. The score is by none other than Brain Eno and his synthheavy sounds here contrast wthe historical setting brilliantly adding even more atmosphere to a film already heavy on atmosphere.".

Filmed entirely in what is referred to as vulgar Latin 'Sebastiane' inserts into the classic Bible story heavy overtones of homosexual love and lust something not too shocking for a filmmaker like Jarman to do considering the rest of his career.  The opening sequence is definitely the highlight for me. It's definitely the strangest moment in the film it is very Felliniesque and has an eyepopping and colorful quality that is not returned to later in the film. It is broadly bizarre stuff but very funny and mildly humorous. And speaking of humour I will have to bring myself to comment upon how unexpectedly funny this film is. It's awfully sad too of course by the end it is a straightup tragedy but throughout there are funny moments. Much of them come through the ribald and overthetop senses of humour some of the characters possess and express wgreat enthusiasm and energy. Some scenes made me genuinely laugh out loud helping add to the watchability of this really slow and for the majority of its runtime somewhat uneventful film.  The film is at its strongest in its earlier and later sections. During the middle of the movie it is still well crafted and still carries many great elements but it's also occasionally somewhat boring and I was only halfpaying attention during a few scenes. However the film is soon able to pick up speed and by the end it has had an actual emotional impact. It is beautifully shot too despite its shoestring budget essentially all technical aspects of the film are gorgeously done the cinematography and score especially. The score is by none other than Brain Eno and his synthheavy sounds here contrast wthe historical setting brilliantly adding even more atmosphere to a film already heavy on atmosphere.";

Like MAKE WAY FOR TOMORROW and its descendant TOKYO STORY this movie touches on how we treat our elderly. But it adds an element that neither of those films could address sexuality. Marco Ferreri himself in his mid60's at the time and surely starting to think about these issues makes a stand for a senior citizen's right to intimacy privacy dignity and vanity. It's a warm and funny film done with great sensitivity and sharp humor. Occasionally the comedy gets a little broad but I loved touches like the contrast provided by the silly lurid soap opera on the television. Ingrid Thulin in her final on screen role and what an inspired bit of casting and Dado Ruspoli make a charming couple Thulin especially is an absolute joy to watch. I also loved the African immigrants who provide our protagonists with their only safe haven. And such a bittersweet melancholy to the ending. Another win for Ferreri.".

Like MAKE WAY FOR TOMORROW and its descendant TOKYO STORY this movie touches on how we treat our elderly. But it adds an element that neither of those films could address sexuality. Marco Ferreri himself in his mid60's at the time and surely starting to think about these issues makes a stand for a senior citizen's right to intimacy privacy dignity and vanity. It's a warm and funny film done with great sensitivity and sharp humor. Occasionally the comedy gets a little broad but I loved touches like the contrast provided by the silly lurid soap opera on the television. Ingrid Thulin in her final on screen role and what an inspired bit of casting and Dado Ruspoli make a charming couple Thulin especially is an absolute joy to watch. I also loved the African immigrants who provide our protagonists with their only safe haven. And such a bittersweet melancholy to the ending. Another win for Ferreri.";

No one understood the craft of filmmaking silent or otherwise better than Chaplin. He never compromised his artistic vision perfectionism or his integrity. Charlie literally made his films up as he went along rehearsing on film and discarding whatever didn't work. Such techniques would prove too costly and time consuming today. This documentary consists of some of Chaplin's best experiments  some of which he reshot and much of which he ordered burned. Like many a magician Chaplin didn't want his secrets getting out. Luckily many of his best tricks are revealed here for posterity. It's all lovingly narrated by James Mason. And the scenes that were cut from THE CIRCUS CITY LIGHTS and MODERN TIMES are as good as anything that ended up in the final releases. I wish this was available on DVD as my tapes are beginning to wear out.".

They did this by collecting outtakes that had been saved by Mutual Studios as well as through photos and even home movies. At first I thought this all sounded very dry but as the film continued I realized what a great treasure this is. What I liked in particular was how they took two of his earlier nonKeystone comedies and analyzed the many many changes the film underwent thanks to Chaplin's obsessivecompulsive film style. Considering what a gift he had for making films this lengthy style of constructing films is forgivable and even understandable.In addition to analyzing his shorts the documentary also chooses to analyze CITY LIGHTS as well as THE GOLD RUSH and provides many behind the scenes insights. I really liked this since GOLD RUSH might just be my very favorite silent film though it's hard to say for sure considering some of the great films of Lloyd and Keaton.Allinall this is an absolute must for serious film students historians and lovers of silent comedy. Considering all the pain and trouble they went to in making this film it's no surprise that it earns a 10 of 10.FYIFortunately while this is a nearly perfect film about Chaplin there are also two wonderful similar documentaries about Harold Lloyd American Masters Harold Lloyd The Third Genius and Buster Keaton Buster Keaton A Hard Act to Followboth written by the same two writers who made this wonderful film. See them all if you get a chance!!Also FYIOn the DVD is a 12 minute segment on how they assembled all the footage for the documentaries.

	schema:reviewBody "Unknown Chaplin is a three part television series produced from outtakes and film clips edited from most of Charles Chaplin's wellknown films. The first part focuses primarily on the Mutual period when Chaplin made twelve films in sixteen months. The film covers how Chaplin formed his own stock company to make films with much in the way John Ford would do a couple decades later. The film focuses on The Floorwalker The Count The Cure and The Immigrant while including clips of The Pawnbroker and The Adventurer. The film indicates how Chaplin rehearsed on film by viewing daily rushes and reshooting scenes multiple times how some gags worked by exploiting the variances in camera speed and how Edna Purviance was not a trained actress and had to be shaped by Chaplin's direction.The second part of the film focuses on The Kid The Gold Rush and City Lights. It includes interviews with Jackie Coogan Lita Grey Georgia Hale Robert Parrish Virginia Cherrill and Sydney Chaplin. A great deal of time is spent on the location shooting for The Gold Rush and the many highlights from that film. Most interesting is the initial introduction of the tramp and the flower girl scene in City Lights. Chaplin had to solve the dilemma of how to make it plain to the audience that the blind flower girl thought the tramp was a rich man. It took a year and a half of patience and countless retakes for Chaplin to solve it.The third part of the film focuses mostly on The Circus and the uncompleted film The Professor but it also includes tidbits from City Lights Modern Times The Great Dictator and Limelight. The third part showcases mostly scenes which were cut from Chaplin's final edit of his films influences some of his earlier silent pictures had on his later more famous films. The film shows how Chaplin played an important role in the development of early cinema combining his own artistic vision with the unbridled mayhem of his Mack Sennett days at the Keystone Company. Many of Chaplin's stock company get substantial screen time including Edna Purviance Eric Campbell Albert Austin Henry Bergman John Rand and Loyal Underwood. Major disappointments are the film's omissions of Chaplin's postLimelight work Monsieur Verdoux and A Woman Of Paris a box office failure upon its release now regarded as one of Chaplin's most important films and an adult film ahead of its time. James Mason narrates the film with appropriate earnestness. 12 of 4 stars.".

Since most silent extras are gone it's rather amazing they were able to find all of this stuff which really puts a face on the rumors surrounding Chaplin's work methods. It is known he was a genius but no one ever saw how that genius came to be. Some said he was sadistic and others said he was a terror to work for. With these outtakes we see why people would feel this way as Chaplin takes little scenes and runs off fifty to one hundred takes. But we also see the genius this creates especially during outtakes of The Immigrant where the same scene is shot over and over using different actors clothing and other things to pull the scene off. This was part one of a three part series.Unknown Chaplin The Great Director Part two of Kevin Brownlow's documentary about Charles Chaplin this one taking a look at the making of The Kid The Gold Rush and City Lights. Once again you get a perfect idea of who Chaplin was and how he was able to create the masterpieces that he did. The alternate ending and footage from City Lights is certainly the highlight here.Unknown Chaplin Hidden Treasures Final segment in Brownlow's brilliant documentary is a real treat for fans as it contains to deleted scenes from The Circus both of which are among the best stuff Chaplin has done. Also included is the deleted opening sequence to Modern Times which was also quite nicely done. Home movies and other goodies are scattered throughout this part as well. Overall this is certainly a brilliant documentary and highly rated to those who enjoy Chaplin's work.".

And the production is breathtaking at times  it shows just what can be achieved with a little money but plenty of intelligence. George Robey three decades past his Prime Minister Of Mirth heyday was perfect in the main role of Ali Baba. Just in case you ever wonder even when young he never had a singing voice it was his down to Earth silliness playing with words that endeared him to British Music Hall audiences.It's the story of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves and his sudden rise to wealth and power from the finding of their cave and robbing the robbers of their treasures. The magnificent Chu Chin Chow of the title and his coterie travelling to Baghdad are reduced to dust in double quick time leading to the imposture by Abu Hasan and his Thieves at the court of Kasim Baba. The sets are astounding probably gossamer but believable. Fritz Kortner as Head Thief is suitably savage and Anna May Wong again playing the treacherous insider as in Fairbanks' Thief Of Bagdad as his  slave is in a difficult position for the entire film. Along the way are some lovely songs The Cobblers Song the incredibly romantic Corraline sung in the sparkling moonlight to every camera angle imaginable I Love Thee So languid and atmospheric photography but especially the gorgeous Any Time's Kissing Time. Robey and Thelma Tuson gave it their all and succeeded in creating the most delicious idioticromantic 2 minutes in film history  just look at the slaves laughing in the background!It's one of the best British films from the decade even so I don't expect UK TV to ever show it again but it's one I trot out on video to watch every few years with no loss of enjoyment. It might have been better in Technicolor because a lot of people who might have liked it today could be put off by the black and white photography. But if you can sink into the first 10 minutes or so you'll find a little gem worth the taking.".

Checked it out on Amazon and there it was on DVD it arrived this morning and I have watched it in full. I'm not disappointed. It is hard to believe that this was a British production because it is way up there with the best of the Americans of the era. George Robey is great and Anna May Wong a gem.

	schema:reviewBody "CHU CHIN CHOW 1934 is one of the best films from Anna May Wong's British period.  Disappointed that her career had been stuck in a succession of oriental vamp roles she went to Europe and accepted an invitation from E. A. Dupont director of VARIETY with Emil Jannings to do PICCADILLY.First filmed in 1925 with Betty Blythe CHU CHIN CHOW is the Arabian Nights story of Ali Baba And The Forty Thieves with musical numbers as you might expect to see them in a British music hall of the eraincluding some preBusby Berkeley choreography.   It was London's longest running musical and is given an elaborate screen adaptation.    The production boasts sumptuous sets and lush cinematography meant to suggest the Western view of the mysterious orient and has a lavishness usually missing from the films of depression era Britain.    The choreography while interesting as a record of the time period gave Busby Berkeley few sleepless nights.An international cast with wildly varying accents lent CHU CHIN CHOW an odd otherworldly flavor which fit nicely with the Arabian Nights fantasy. Besides the very beautiful and American Anna May Wong the role of Ali Baba is played by comedian George Robey known in Great Britain as the Prime Minister of Mirth.Austrian born Fritz Kortner brought a malicious enthusiasm to the role of Abu Hassan the bandit chief.   Kortner plays the part with his usual overthetop expressionist stylealmost as if he were a very wicked little boycruel and murderous one moment cuddly and boyish the next.  It was only in his American films that he approached a role with anything like restraint.   He had been something of a popular curiosity in Europe for staging eccentric versions of Shakespeare.  His right hand man in the film is Dennis Hoey best known to American audiences as the baffled and longsuffering Inspector Lestrade opposite Basil Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes.Pearl Argyle one of the most beautiful leading ladies in British films has the romantic lead of Marjanah but is best known for her appearance as Katherine Cabal opposite Raymond Massey in THINGS TO COME.  The part of Abdullah the singer with the very low voice is the famous Mr. Jetsam Malcolm McEachern the deeper half of the popular singing duo of Flotsam and Jetsam.Most amusing of all though is Francis L. Sullivan who specialized in comically pompous and officious types playing the Caliph toward the end of the film.  The famous story told about him is from the early days when British television was still live.  He was reputedly playing a passenger on a plane in flight but had evidently forgotten his lines.  On camera he blithely adlibbed to the passenger next to him Excuse me this is my stop and left the set.  But whatever his eccentricities he and his broad girth gave an immensely enjoyable performance in one of the most fondly remembered British films of the 30's.Jay F.".

It does a good job for its time of blending everything together with a consistent pace and without any dull stretches. It makes good use of the Arabian Nights' story setting while not taking itself too seriously.The plot is based on the wellknown story of Ali Baba contending with Abu Hasan and his cave full of thieves and cutthroats. George Robey as Ali Baba and Fritz Kortner as Hasan both seem to be having a good time and they give pleasantly exaggerated performances slightly overemphasizing their expressions and their characters' traits.But the star of the cast is Anna May Wong who plays a slave girl who spies on behalf of Hasan. The role offers little challenge for someone of Wong's considerable acting talents but it gives her a chance to grab numerous scenes. She gives her character a formidable presence and a very attractive appearance that make her the center of attention when she is on the screen.Overall it's nothing to take seriously but it is very good escapist entertainment for those who enjoy the movies of the era. There was also an American release Ali Baba Nights which cut out the musical numbers and some other material giving it a quicker pace but a less lavish style without quite as much atmosphere.".

The current title is rather misleading as it gives one the impression of being set in China  and especially since the character of ChuChinChow himself a Chinese merchant is only a minor one. Besides being a British film from the early Talkie era I fully expected it to be a stodgy affair  merely a curiosity as Leslie Halliwell called it. However I found it an enthralling and highly enjoyable piece of work  and still pretty much a unique entertainment after all these years.Incidentally prior to viewing the film I reread DVD Savant's review if anything to ascertain myself that it was fitting Christmas fare  I was quite intrigued by Glenn Erickson's comments sharing his view of the ornate sets as being a particular standout but also ended up disagreeing with his opinion about the static quality of the cinematographyas I actually felt that Max Greene's camera was reasonably mobile throughout. Being undeniably archaic by today's standards the songs Busby Berkeleyish dance numbers and the comedy and romance elements are all a matter of taste  in fact they constitute the film's main source of longueurs if still intrinsically charming ingredients of the whole package. On the other hand it turned out to be surprisingly bloodthirsty for what was essentially popular entertainment! The plot has been opened up from the traditional story while also making Ali Baba a coward  but this is the still the most satisfying version I've watched certainly the most fascinating for various reasons.The villain is played by Fritz Kortner looking like a flabbier less handsome version of Douglas Fairbanks at times and a Wallace Beerylookalike at others but with a voice sounding uncannily like that of Otto Preminger! gives an entertainingly ripe performance  witness his orgasmic thirsting for Ali Baba's blood as he lays out his plans for the final assault he's even made to don a number of clever disguises throughout. The formidable Anna May Wong has a relatively small role but is quite impressive nonetheless. George Robey's Ali Baba then is accompanied by a comically somnolent theme tune every time he appears I'd only seen his brief performance in Laurence Olivier's Shakespearian adaptation of HENRY V 1944 but I can see how the actor's amiable brand of fooling would be lapped up by audiences of the time  incidentally I need to pick up his DON QUIXOTE 1933 on DVD a film directed by German migr G.W. Pabst with whom Kortner himself had made the seminal PANDORA'S BOX 1929. Lovely Pearl Argyle isn't the typically bland damselindistress but rather a resourceful heroine Dennis Hoey Inspector Lestrade of the modernized Basil RathboneNigel Bruce Sherlock Holmes series is Kortner's secondincommand Francis L. Sullivan is very amusing as the perennially bored Caliph who's then overjoyed when Abu Hasan's plans are foiled in his presence  thinking that it was all part of the evening's entertainment as prepared by Ali Baba! Malcolm McEachern  billed simply as Jetsam!  is the burly majordomo with a baritone voice who acts as Chorus throughout.Curiously enough a full 19 years later it was reissued in the U.S. by Robert Lippert in a much shorter version reduced from 102 minutes to 76! retitled ALI BABA NIGHTS  this version is available on Disc 2 of VCI's surprising 3Disc Set of CHUCHINCHOW and accompanied by the Popeye ALI BABA short I viewed recently. Ironically this reedit is presented in a betterlooking print than the 'original'  but the image has been zoomedin somewhat many of the songs have been dropped making the few that remain feel somewhat incongruous though not the various dances the romantic subplots are diminished and so is the role of Robey's elderly wife and plump lover ditto the allusion during the final banquet to The Caliph's vindictive treatment of disappointing hosts some of the edits however are clumsily done  especially the death scene of Robey's brother which is interrupted halfway through!One last word Fritz Kortner followed this with another exotic melodrama the even betterregarded ABDUL THE DAMNED 1935  which has been thoughtfully included by VCI in this set see below for my comments about that film.".

Sullivan and Frank Cochrane reprising his role of the Cobbler from the original stage show keep things hopping.There are lots of complaints about British musicals but considering MGM was about to enter on a series of stolid and very successful operettas starring Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy the following year this lively example of the genre is a lot of fun.";

Of the songs used in the musical only the Shoemaker's Song was catchy enough to survive outside the musical and was covered by all kinds of musicians from trad jazz bands to Paul Robeson.As others have said the musical is set in Baghdad and is a variant of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves. The costumes are exaggerated with grotesque turbans and fezzes.What is unusual for a British film is that the background music is almost nonstop. Often the background music has nothing to do with what is happening in the scene and is thus more like Muzak in a supermarket or an elevator. This was sometimes done in early thirties films by First NationalWarner Brothers. This is the first time I have encountered this in a British film. The orchestration is adventurous and the higher pitches feature unusual instruments. These include domras that tremolo in the string section and  soloing in the woodwind  are a sopranino recorder and even an ocarina to accentuate clownishness. As big jars each containing a thief are rolled into a pit we hear the timpani making a thunderous noise  inappropriate due to the size of the jars but unbelievably effective.With one exception the singers are not very good. The exception is the Australian basso profondo Malcolm McEacharn who is billed as Jetsam because he was a member of the Flotsam and Jetsam duo. An exceptionally rich and powerful voice that can reach down down down to depths that a basso cantate like myself can only dream about. I have never seen anything quite like this in a British film of the period.".

The uncut 102 minute version is available from VCI Entertainment  it's a very good print. For me the major reasons for seeing this film are that it is of such historical importance and that it features Anna May Wong. It was nice seeing her in such a prestigious film. That said some of the acting was overdone and not really suitable for film although undoubtedly fine for the stage. It's purely a matter of taste but I didn't find the story interesting or the music memorable or enjoyable. I think the movie is too long and slow going.

	schema:reviewBody "Danny Kaye's films with Samuel Goldwyn established him as a leading movie comedian  singer from 1944 through the late 1940s. For a number of years after he continued his popularity without Goldwyn in films like Knock on Wood The Court Jester and Merry Andrew. It is likely that The Court Jester is his best film but The Inspector General is close to the top. Based on a 19th Century satiric play by Nicolai Gogol Kaye plays Georgi a decent fellow who works for the bullying Yakov Walter Slezak. Yakov and Georgi travel around the countryside selling Yakov's elixir which is supposed to cure all kinds of illnesses that Kaye sings in a tonguetwisting song by Sylvia Fine his wife. But they are forced to flee when Georgi tries to stop an elderly woman from wasting her money on the elixir. Naturally Yakov is upset and sends Georgi away until he learns to be crooked. Yakov has been using a fake official document signed by Napoleon as a come on in his sales pitch. Georgi is carrying it. He is arrested by the town constable Alan Hale Sr. for vagrancy but the latter reads the letter. As the Mayor Gene Lockhart and his cohorts are awaiting with dread a visit by Napoleon's Inspector General to check their records they have been feathering their nests they think that Georgi is this Inspector General. When Yakov comes to town he quickly grasps the situation and pretends he is the Inspector's servant. Slezak knows that there are real opportunities here.The funny thing is that Gogol's play is not quite like the film. First of all Gogol was writing a critique of government corruption in the Russian Empire under Tsar Nicholas I 18251855. Gogol was a religious mystic and satirist best recalled for his unfinished novel about serfdom Dead Souls and his novellas The Diary of a Madman and The Overcoat. Normally Nicholas was a humorless despot who hated intellectuals. But he liked THE INSPECTOR GENERAL which attacked the worst aspects of Russian local government corruptions that the Tsar did want to see eradicated. Because he approved the play was a great success and became one of the few 19th Century plays that became part of the permanent world repertory.But Gogol's targets were Russian not French. Napoleon is not a background figure in the play. The Inspector General actually the title is The Government Inspector in Russian is from the Tsar. They have heard rumors of the corrupt practices and are checking them. Georgi's character is not such a wellintentioned type in the play as he is in the movie. He is as willing to feather his nest as Yakob is and they prove to be a highly successful team.This is because the Mayor and his cohorts are quite willing to bribe their way out of the current investigation. This includes selling the Mayor's wife for sex and paying out much in bribes and gifts. And in the end after Georgi and Yakob leave with their loot the Mayor thinks he will be called to St. Petersburg for some really important post. But months later they hear of a letter circulating in the capital from Georgi boasting of how he fooled the Mayor and his cohorts. Then just as things couldn't get worse a servant announces the arrival of a Government Inspector to review the books. Everyone freezes in terror as the curtain falls. The film softens Georgi's character leaving Yakov as the greedy one although Slezak does redeem himself at the end. The Mayor and his cohorts who do things like collecting for a church bell but pocketing the money themselves do try to kill off the Inspector General  there is a funny sequence at a party where Georgi sings a song about sing Gypsy dance Gypsy and keeps on just avoiding drinking his doctored drink during the song. Georgi's guardian angel protects him. He also meets Leza a servant Barbara Bates and falls for her. He debates how to appear before her as a General  should he be elegant like an Englishman arrogant like a Russian or smart like a German. In some ways Soliloquy for Three heads may be the best of the numbers in the film. Although watered down from Gogol's stunning comic play enough entertainment value remains in the film to make it worthwhile viewing and a highpoint in appreciating Kaye's movie career.".

Look at him rolling like a dog a scene so touching or imitating a fish in the beginning or singing 'drink gypsy' later on. An institution in himself. The movie can be hilarious very touching delightful and thrilling at the same time. It's a treasure.".

A tramp Danny Kaye is mistaken for the Inspector General by the corrupt mayor and his equally corrupt officials.I find Danny Kaye one of the best performers of our times and he has given one of his best performances here. Look at him rolling like a dog a scene so touching or imitating a fish in the beginning or singing 'drink gypsy' later on. An institution in himself. The movie can be hilarious very touching delightful and thrilling at the same time. It's a treasure.";

It was fun watching the crowd get into it. I'd guess that scene was mostly adlibbed. He clearly was in control. I bought the DVD public domain just for that scene.The supporting cast did a great job too. Slezak nearly stole all of his scenes and Hale Sr. was perfect in support. And the costume designer deserved at least a nomination for the Oscar. You can't take this one seriously. But then Danny Kaye lived to entertain. And few did it better.".

Be it the silly patter songs slapstick at its purest his quick timing his wideeyed innocent reactions to the corruption of the councilmen or his heartwarming moments of honesty and warmth. He will send kids and adults alike into fits of laughter with his antics and makes a lovable and memorable figure out of what could have been a very dry character. It seems as though the director took Gogol's character and rewrote it specifically for Danny Kaye a common practice in those days.But Kaye is not the only one in the movie that shines. The other characters may serve as foils to Georgi but they in themselves are funny. Maria's constant overtures to Georgi the poor councilman that is trying to resign but no one will let him poor Kovatch who can't seem to hang onto a uniform the twins who are constantly confusing Georgi and especially wily Yakov. Yakov in himself is a great character because he is a villain but in his despicably you can't help but admire his clever ways of keeping Georgi from getting caught. The obligatory love story is weak yes but in this case it is a good thing because the real humor resides in this classic tale of mistaken identity not in the love story. I rate this a nine out of ten because I really feel that the love story was unnecessary although the love story does lend itself to a lovely song true.Above all this is Danny Kaye truly living up to his reputation as a superstar of his era almost like the Chaplin of his time only better since most of his talent shows in the patter songs and lines. He is supported by strong actors and overall it makes a wonderful classic film for the entire family.".

This is partly because his partner shows up at the same time. Walter Slezak does a fantastic job of contrasting Kaye throughout the movie but more of that later.Danny Kaye's performance here is not quite as seamless as many. He does not seem to have the same audacity he displays in later movies such as The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and The Court Jester. It is also different in that although it includes the usual confusion plot twists and multiplicity of plans going on at once these elements are not executed as beautifully as in for example The Court Jester. Thus these scenes become comedic background still enjoyable to watch but not the masterpiece one may have become accustomed to. However the movie was far from terrible. There were moments which as I watched them made me think That's so Danny Kaye. He has many of the same mannerisms and little twitches that make him so much fun to watch along with an array of songs that would tie a normal tongue in knots. He looks quite dashing in his military uniform and his character's innocence is just so much fun to see in Danny Kaye's brilliant blue eyes. His character Georgi is also contrasted masterfully with Slezak's Yakov making this movie a success. Yakov is so mean to poor Georgi as well as everyone else that the viewer simply must fall in love with the poor boy. Kaye plays a young man very nearly a boy while Yakov is so jaded and immoral. It is Yakov's cruelty to Georgi that endears Kaye's character to the viewer.To sum up The Inspector General is a lighthearted movie involving superb writing excellent juxtaposition and a wonderful star and supporting villain.".

	schema:reviewBody "The InspectorGeneral1949 remains an irrepressible children's classic and a scrumptious fairytale musical. It's a cinematic adaptation of Nikolai Gogol's ascerbic 1842 satire of Russian feudal society and is so definitive that it's never been remade. Naturally mores have moved on blunt brutality and gallows humour are no longer funny but its datedness is mostly just requisite atavism.The carnival musicians who may have invented modern beatboxing! are a standout especially their lackadaisical Hey guy. Their comical Gypsy music conveys the story's shrewdwily cynicism and serves to skewer provincialism as Gogol intended.Transposing the setting to Hungary introduces newer audiences to the story of an illiterate carnival entertainer mistaken for the Emperor's emissaryalthough referencing Napoleon gets problematic.The Mayor of Klimenti Nestor Paiva of Zorro serials fame d.1966 kickstarts the plot riding madly into his cousin's town of Brodny. I must go even now he the InspectorGeneral may be here in your midst he blurts breathlessly amidst gulps of brandy. You almost feel sorry for himuntil you see WHY his cape bulges.

	onyx:emotionText "The InspectorGeneral1949 remains an irrepressible children's classic and a scrumptious fairytale musical. It's a cinematic adaptation of Nikolai Gogol's ascerbic 1842 satire of Russian feudal society and is so definitive that it's never been remade. Naturally mores have moved on blunt brutality and gallows humour are no longer funny but its datedness is mostly just requisite atavism.The carnival musicians who may have invented modern beatboxing! are a standout especially their lackadaisical Hey guy. Their comical Gypsy music conveys the story's shrewdwily cynicism and serves to skewer provincialism as Gogol intended.Transposing the setting to Hungary introduces newer audiences to the story of an illiterate carnival entertainer mistaken for the Emperor's emissaryalthough referencing Napoleon gets problematic.The Mayor of Klimenti Nestor Paiva of Zorro serials fame d.1966 kickstarts the plot riding madly into his cousin's town of Brodny. I must go even now he the InspectorGeneral may be here in your midst he blurts breathlessly amidst gulps of brandy. You almost feel sorry for himuntil you see WHY his cape bulges. His Cousin BiroGene Lockhart biro in Hungarian means judge is in no less troublethe InspectorGeneral's incognito technique would trap Brodny's Mayor just the same.Director Henry Koster's genius is in revealing Brodny as only seemingly less corrupt its apparent civil order repressed obedience is exacted through institutionalised classbased petty violence.

	schema:reviewBody "It's a little difficult to grasp the notion of Danny Kaye one of his era's premier farceurs being the lead in a story from the 1840s by a Russian dramatist. We all know those Russian plays had more clouds of gray than any song by George Gershwin could guarantee. But though I haven't read Gogol's story he was one of those gloomy Russkies who happened to have a sense of humor sarcastic and cynical though it might have been.It's the Napoleonic era in Middle Europe. Every town in the regime is corrupt in varying degrees and Napoleon has sent an Inspector General to clean things up. The Inspector General has Napoleon's power of attorney. He generally enters a town in some humble disguise  a tinker a salesman an utter nobody  then snoops around until he uncovers the miscreants who he then promptly hangs. Nobody knows what he looks like.Kaye is a shill for a snake oil salesman Walter Slezak in the most outrageously villainous badguy make up since Mack Swain Chaplin's gorilla. When Kaye tries to stop an old lady from spending all her money on Slezak's cureall to save her dying husband  it's really furniture polish  Slezak overhears the conversation and kicks Kaye out.Kaye then turns into a starving tramp. He wanders from town to town trying to steal bits of food from dogs. But in the village of Brodny misleading evidence comes to light that he is the Inspector General in disguise. So instead of being hanged for a thief he's feted by the terrified corrupt town officials. He spends most of the movie strutting around in resplendent garb trying to imitate a selfpossessed pal of Napoleon or alternatively trying desperately to have his real identity hidden from the public. This spoiled identity becomes especially problematic after Slezak shows up recognizes him for the buffoon he is and manipulates him to extort bribes from the officials.Kaye handles the role pretty well actually as unlikely as it sounds. Well why not? So it's a farce. I doubt that Gogol's original play had the fake Inspector General singing gibberish songs but somehow it fits. Kaye's usual cowardly and neurotic persona is imposed on what I imagine to have been an amusing but relatively grounded story. If W. C. Fields could play Mr. Micawber in Charles Dickens' David Copperfield why not Kaye as a jiggling and stuttering Inspector General? The plot is too logical to allow for many of Kaye's set pieces. The gibberish songs by his thenwife Sylvia Fine aren't as funny as some of his earlier ones. The gags though muted are imposed on a narrative that is funny in itself and this makes up to some extent for our watching a Danny Kaye who is in harness to the plot.There isn't as much mindless sentiment as there were in some of Kaye's lesser vehicles  no sick children or any of that crap. Barbara Bates as the housemaid is Kaye's love interest such as it is. Bates an exquisite young woman of modest talent was the underhanded highschool girl Phoebe who shows up at the end of All About Eve. Here in period wardrobe she's just another pretty face but it doesn't matter because her part isn't particularly important.Anyway I kind of enjoyed it. Kaye does a lot of jumping around and shuffling of objects and there are some laughs in it desperately needed in these toolaughless times.".

He spends most of the movie strutting around in resplendent garb trying to imitate a selfpossessed pal of Napoleon or alternatively trying desperately to have his real identity hidden from the public. This spoiled identity becomes especially problematic after Slezak shows up recognizes him for the buffoon he is and manipulates him to extort bribes from the officials.Kaye handles the role pretty well actually as unlikely as it sounds. Well why not? So it's a farce. I doubt that Gogol's original play had the fake Inspector General singing gibberish songs but somehow it fits. Kaye's usual cowardly and neurotic persona is imposed on what I imagine to have been an amusing but relatively grounded story. If W. C. Fields could play Mr. Micawber in Charles Dickens' David Copperfield why not Kaye as a jiggling and stuttering Inspector General? The plot is too logical to allow for many of Kaye's set pieces. The gibberish songs by his thenwife Sylvia Fine aren't as funny as some of his earlier ones. The gags though muted are imposed on a narrative that is funny in itself and this makes up to some extent for our watching a Danny Kaye who is in harness to the plot.There isn't as much mindless sentiment as there were in some of Kaye's lesser vehicles  no sick children or any of that crap. Barbara Bates as the housemaid is Kaye's love interest such as it is. Bates an exquisite young woman of modest talent was the underhanded highschool girl Phoebe who shows up at the end of All About Eve. Here in period wardrobe she's just another pretty face but it doesn't matter because her part isn't particularly important.Anyway I kind of enjoyed it. Kaye does a lot of jumping around and shuffling of objects and there are some laughs in it desperately needed in these toolaughless times.";

	schema:reviewBody "I had just finished reading the play by the Ukranian playwright Nicolae Gogol and I decided that I would have a look through Youtube to find out if somebody had uploaded a performance but what my search ended up throwing up me was well this movie and I believe that it may be public domain since it is up of Youtube and if a movie is not public domain or not allowed on Youtube then I suspect that it will be pulled down pretty quickly. The play is about how a group of corrupt officials on a small Russian town in the 19th century hear that somebody is coming from St Petersburg the then Russian capital to perform a audit on the town's accounts so they end up rushing about in a panic to try and cover up their nefarious deeds. Then enters a lowly clerk on a holiday and they immediately believe that he is the auditor and go out of their way to soften him up and offer him bribes.The movie differs from a play a little and is a little be more slapstick but then again I have not seen it performed so I cannot comment on that aspect of it in that the clerk is replaced by an out of work conman because he does not like deceiving people and the play has a much happier ending. In fact the clerk in this film is a much more honest individual than the original in the play who scampers out of town quick fast when he is discovered. Also the clerk for want of a better word because in the movie he is actually homeless and destitute and wonders into the town having not eaten for two days.The movie is also set in some vague European Village in some vague empire because at one point it is suggested that the Emperor if Napoleon and at another point it is said that the capital city is Budapest which is a huge continuity error because Budapest was never the main capital of the AustroHungarian empire and Napoleon never had his capital in Budapest he was French so it was always going to be Paris. However putting aside that minor problem and the fact that the main character is much much nicer in this movie than in the play it is still a pretty good rendition and enjoyable to watch.".

Also Williamson is unintentionally hilarious in this film walking around with a cigar in his mouth thinking we are supposed to think that is cool. Maybe one day you will start watching this movieenjoy it for what it is worth and remember that some guy on the IMDb data base wrote about it. Just don't go looking for this movie your better off catching it by accident.";

	schema:reviewBody "Mack Derringer Fred has an awesome name and used to play football. His partner Lenny is also an expro player and now they're private eyes in South Beach Florida. And that if the movie's tagline is to be believed is the world's deadliest strip of sand. Mack's latest adventure involves his exwife Maxine Vanity who now runs Maxine's Services which seems to be some sort of phone sex operation. When a mysterious voice on the phone who calls himself Billy starts making threats Mack snaps into action. As if his partner Lenny wasn't enough Mack calls on the services of Jake Fonda to help him find his way through the South Beach underworld. But Det. Coleman Forster doesn't trust Mack and seems to be following his every move. But at least Mack's mother Mama Sanford is proud of him and doesn't hesitate to tell anyone who will listen. After getting a tip from a rapper named Too Kool Ross Mack gets to the real heavies such as Santiago Silva and a man named Billy Jones  but is it the same Billy that's been harassing Maxine? Mack Derringer will have to use all the power of his name to get to the truth behind this web of crime and deception. Can he do it? If the above plot description sounds like a confusing mishmash that's because that's pretty much what South Beach is. Fred is able to get amazing casts for his movies and in finding a place for everyone sometimes forgets about coherency. South Beach also has somewhat of a sillier tone than a lot of other Freds we've seen and the end result while not bad is likely to not really satisfy anyone except diehard fans of anyone involved with the production and only viewers familiar with Fred's style of filmmaking will be able to glean anything from this movie.Fred's array of great jackets is noteworthy as is he and Busey's round of what can only be described as Zany Golf at the beginning of the film. As in the later Night Vision 1997 Robert Forster plays a cop who yells at Fred. It's basically the same thing here. There was very minimal Henry Silva  by the time his part in the movie rolled around he was squeezed out by all the other actors in this broth. And after we were finished pondering why Peter Fonda as well as his ponytailmustache combination were involved in the first place we got to the rapper Too Kool not to be confused with Too Short and another brief Sam Jones appearance. But at least with Jones there's a fight instead of him standing around awkwardly as he does in fellow Fred film Down 'n Dirty 2001. But all the names in the cast distract from the amazing goons in this movie. We don't know their names but we all should. They outshine most of the cast and they do it in their own lovable way simply by being humble men overweight men squeezed into tweed jackets with mullets and Vuarnet sunglasses. God bless the goons the unsung heroes of the crime movie world.As for the DVD we viewed it's one of those cheapo gas station jobs and is of very low quality. It's actually blurry and we were told in the late 90's DVD's would never be blurry. The VHS is of far better quality. However this particular disc is a double feature with the Mario Van Peebles film South Bronx Heroes 1985 and clearly this DVD company was catering to movie fans just clamoring to complete their South movie collections. But in direct contradiction to that according to the menu screen the movie is called Sonth Bronx Heroes. You read that right. SONTH. How you screw up the title of the movie on the menu screen of your own DVD we'll never know especially such an easy word like South. Either that or the movie is referring to the heroes of an area of New York City that we've never heard of before.South Beach is kind of a weird outing for Fred yet also oddly typical of some of his other work. As Survivor once sang when they were surely referring to this movie It's the paradox that drives us all.For more action insanity drop by www.comeuppancereviews.com".

The voice of the robot made my skin crawl for weeks very creepy indeed especially as it wasn't meant to be!

When it finally got a distributor the result was very spotty. So it's a rare movie. I am amazed any of your viewers saw it! Maybe they found a videotape lying around in a sale bin somewhere. The movie is actually pretty amusing if you don't take it so seriously. The problem is more one of classification It's not a kids movie despite having a featured role for the son. It's too adult to be for a teen or preteen audience. Maybe college kids can dig it along with adults with a tolerance for some silly business and satirical plot elements that may hit or miss. The auteur here was a real amateur when he made this film so it's akin to a midbudget student film. But remember all Indies have to start somewhere. David Lynch and Quentin Tarrantino have come a long way from their first efforts. If you see this movie please suspend critical disbelief relax and enjoy its better qualities. It's like if the film were a spoof or camp even if maybe it wasn't intended to be. On that level it succeeds better than some intended spoofs that fail.".

The auteur here was a real amateur when he made this film so it's akin to a midbudget student film. But remember all Indies have to start somewhere. David Lynch and Quentin Tarrantino have come a long way from their first efforts. If you see this movie please suspend critical disbelief relax and enjoy its better qualities. It's like if the film were a spoof or camp even if maybe it wasn't intended to be. On that level it succeeds better than some intended spoofs that fail.";

This movie is a combined AmericanPolish effort. The main hero is American with Polish roots and the action of the almost entire movie takes place in Poland. It felt very refreshing  since action movies usually take place either in USA or more exoticpopular countries.I'm from Poland  so I had great fun watching familiar places and faces appear on the screen. However outside of that there isn't really that much to say about this movie. The acting is very OK especially Davies is truly charming  the plot makes sense and the dialogues aren't bad. The problem is this is genuinely forgettable movie. The plot isn't anything different you haven't seen before in thousands of cop on revenge movies  the characters are one dimensional  the budget is obviously low and the action is very anemic. It's your typical undemanding straight to VHS straight to DVD nowadays 90's action flick. Maybe I'm too harsh for it  because I have seen MUCH worse movies and if you want some undemanding movie to kill some time it's not a bad choice.Action junkies should be satisfied. People with higher standards should look for something else. I give it 210.".

Although this runs counter to everything I've ever read or heard about him you'll have a great time watching the Marquis torture and humiliate a few great looking women who eventually fall in love with him of coursecrack a bunch of great jokes and be just an allaround great guy as he makes his mark in history in the France of that time period.";

Dark Prince examines both the Marquis himself and the social milieu in which he lived France during the French Revolution.  What Dark Prince reveals is that the real monster during this dark period of French history was not the Marquis himself but the forces which fought to silence him i.e. the aristocracy and its supporting forces the courts and other institutions of the law.  I hope I don't make this film sound too dry and analytical cause it's quite an entertaining albeit dark and sometimes disturbing look at the life of the Marquis De Sade.  After watching this film you won't look at the Marquis De Sade in the same light again.".

This movie actually made the depraved aristocrat a likable guy! Yes it was low budgetreal low but it was worth every one of it's 90 minutes.Great movie...really fun!".

This filmmaker's treatment of history resemble's that of Winston's in the correction room at the ministry of truth in  Orwell's 1984.  This film approches the nadir of the continuing misunderstanding of genius right along side Mickey Rourkes portrayal of Charles Bukowski as Snagglepuss the Effeminant Beatnik Lion in the otherwise enjoyable movie Barfly.

Well when I put it in my VHSplayer expectations were high but I could almost immediately see that this movie was a total turkey. But it had some redeeming qualities.The Good Ron Perlman was great as the evil Dr. Ramsey Krago who's trying to infest the world with his evil virus which only he has the antidote to! Although he looks quite bored in most of the scenes he's still the most fun actor to watch in the movie. But I couldn't really tell if he had Grey or blonde hair though.. The Bad The hero Ken played by stuntmangoneleading actorgonestuntman again Matt McColm finds out about Dr. Krago's evil plans and wants to stop him using every skill he possibly knows! That is looking really smug and trying to seduce every woman he meets and attacking bad guys with his amazing doublekick midair split that would almost make JeanClaude Van Damme jealous. He's not really interesting and his attitude was annoying throughout the whole film.The Ugly In a totally redundant part we have the always entertaining Clint Howard as Ken's accountant Hutch. He doesn't do anything to the movie other than say a bunch of stupid things to Ken and then follow him around on stakeouts and Ken also uses Hutch's wife's car during a carchase where infamous stuntman Henry Kingi Predator 12 flips Ken the bird right before getting blown away. Classic scene. Hutch also fumbles around with a hand grenade with a SKULL painted on it so you know that it's dangerous on the backseat of the car which almost kills them both. The drivers of the two evil Ateam trucks are apparently very stupid because they have no idea of how to avoid hitting parked vehicles that are in their way. But that's just how henchmen are in these kind of movies. DUMM.The Bonus In the beginning of the movie we see John RhysDavies as a disgusting slimeball who Ken is working for and believe it or not he has a sexscene! So if you ever wanted to see Gimli wearing nothing but filthy underpants and an open bathrobe then this is the movie for you! He also forces a girl to go down on him a fantastic scene.The Rest Well there's a bunch of women who runs around looking real tough although they're not. Only one of them was important to the plot but I can't remember her name because they all looked alike. Then there's also a bunch of stupid henchmen who likes to stick their gunholding hands out in FRONT of the heroes so that they can grab them and throw them to the ground. That's great henchmenwork. I also think I saw Kane Jason Vorhees Hodder as a henchman who runs out of a door right in front of one of the heroes just to get gunned down immediately like all the other lame henchmen.Conclusion Well this movie has a stupid plot a boring male lead boring female leads but great supporting actors and good stunts especially during carchases and in the final showdown I can assure you that it is hot stuff!. The music is tame and the cinematography isn't worth mentioning either. But overall I enjoyed it somewhat since I'm a semibig fan of some of the supporting actors and the stuntwork was also very good for a movie of this ultralow caliber. So if you have nothing better to do then watch this movie but don't expect anything good.".

	schema:reviewBody "My husband Clay McBride was the screenwriter hired to pen a 'Page One' rewrite of DELTA FORCE ONE THE LOST PATROL not my husband's title choice by the wayand HE hates this movie. Hired over thephone by longtime friend seasoned director Joseph Zito who was already en route via jet to the location in Israel Clay was given seven days to create a toptobottom new script from an existing disaster already 'locked in' for production. My husband's version was a COMPLETE 'first line to last' new creation. His only creative limitations were existing sets and contractually predetermined casting. Accepting the assignment from Joe Zitowho my husband continues to think of as a friend and solid professionalClay jumped into the project often working twentyhour days. He faxed each new batch of pages straight to Director Zito in Israel. My husband had been promised a respectable rewrite fee by Producers Yoram Globus and Allan Greenblatt for his efforts. In the end Clay was paid only 50 in an 'up front' fee. To this day despite Director Zito's attempts to rectify the injustice Clay has still been cheated out of his remaining 50 fee! Amazingly DESERT FORCE ONE THE LOST PATROL continues to make money. Clay McBridethe SCREENWRITERhas not been paid a single penny of his remaining fee. Having seen the finished film I have no doubt you will find the following statements impossible to believe. However I can tell you the final film shares virtually NO similarity with my husband's originaland genuinely entertainingwritten draft. Though hammered out at a hellish pace Clay's script was truly clever. It featured a logicalyet surprisingnarrative. It sparkled with witty tight dialogue. It was a inspired solid piece of screen writing. I can tell you Clay and I were quite excited at the prospect of his draft seeing production. How my husband's crisp creative script was ever turned into the finished TRAVESTY of a film you've all seen I cannot even begin to imagine. I DO know director Joe Zito was plagued with production and budget nightmares from 'Day 1' of the shoot. The film was hideously underfunded and frankly it is a testament to Joe Zito that he succeeded in delivering anything even remotely resembling a completed feature. Having acknowledged the crippling production circumstances however my husband is still at an utter loss to explain the complete BUTCHER JOB done to his script. I sat at the screening with my husband. I can tell you actual TEARS spilled down his cheeks as he watched this nightmare unroll before his eyes. And when the film reached its utterly bizarre endingfeaturing that awful freezeframe sequence a sequence my husband had absolutely NOTHING to do withI could actually feel Clay's fingernails digging painfully into my palm. The astounding tragedy of the entire experience was this prior to the start of production my husband received numerous overseas calls from the 'above the line' powers praising his excellent and exciting script. Clay was told repeatedly that his script had saved the production from disaster and that words did not exist to convey the gratitude of the entire company for reviving the production. We still own the recorded phone calls on cassette tape. From one and all Clay McBride is the savior of the film! Your guess is as good as ours concerning how Clay's script was so celebrated before shooting beganand damn it it DESERVED to be celebrated!and then it was utterly DESTROYED during production. All I can do is defend the marvelous talent of my husband and weep over his shuddering embarrassment at the finished product. Clay McBride wrote a sharp fastpaced and entertaining screenplay for director Joe Zito and producers Yoram Globus and Allan Greenblatt. How it came to such a miserable end is a tragedy only THEY can explain. And when you ask Globus and Greenblatt remind them that they still owe the talented and professional Clay McBride the remaining 50 of his screenplay fee! Thank you for your patience in giving me a chance to tell the truth regarding my husband's efforts and clear his good namemost importantly the truth that this does not reflect his tremendous talent. Best wishes to you all.".

So what if cousin Menahem isn't on for the ride? So like the action fan girl shmuck I am I decided to skip Delta Force II since I think Billy Drago's crowning moment was in The Untouchables playing the sadistic cool cat Frank Nitti brandishing a nickelplated pistol by the by I saw it on Ebay for around 400 but those white suits Armani had him in made him look like the lovechild of Ed Gein and Cab Calloway. But it looks like once again video covers are deceptive great marketing strategies BTW and you think well that Brit took his cockney accent for Aussie has some impressive biceps Norris' son MIGHT have picked up a few pointers from dad and Mitchum's grandkid looks like someone I could bring home to mom and after 90odd minutes you're left wondering why the fck I wasted my 3.50 on this when I could have had some HaagenDazs. Not even John RysDavies was able to woo me to say this bit of drek was mediocre! The characters were as developed as paper dolls won't even get into the Greek actress playing the medic the script was probably thought up after somebody finished reading Bravo Two Zero and it makes you wonder if this is Globus' pathetic hackney attempt to bridge the gap between Arabs and Israelis and lure Hollywood to the hellish Mid East. Nearly ALL the Arabs were portrayed by Jewish people my BF is Jewish so I know what I'm talking about. Also you have think about these actors I mean they must be destitute or something to take lead roles in movies like the DF and U.S. SEALs series. Or Bentley and Mike's acting attempts are that sincere wo having to lean on their famous father and grandfather. As for our leading man I know he's got a wife and 5 kids but don't all California martialarts champs open up their own dojo chains and get hired by the studios to choreograph stunt sequences? All I can say is the nuclear missile looked like the cardboard boxes it was built from the pyrotechnics were borderline the CGI was something a 12yearold can put together on a PC and the most expensive thing in the whole production had to be John RysDavies chess set. Also I'm confused was this action or comedy? Because the postbattle bios made little sense to me.".

	schema:headline " Warring nations in the Middle East";
	schema:reviewBody "Delta force One promotes itself as another 80's style mindless action flick so surprisingly this turns out to be a more serious even thoughtprovoking film. Warring nations in the Middle East are the reason that the Delta force Patrol is brought together soldiers from different lands working together to locate and deactivate a missile aimed at one mid east Nation. The highlight of the film is the tale of a young Arab boy who upon witnessing the brutal death of his father embarks on a journey of revenge he will find and kill the people responsible for his death. The story follows him effectively through rough desert terrain through mosques and crowded Bazaar's in search of a way to fulfill his destiny of vengeance. Meanwhile the Delta force who consists of a couple American officers A British officer and Isreali female medical officer and an Arabic tour guide aka desert tracker work together while they are beset upon by angry warring tribes from all different directions. For me the quality of this film came as quite a surprise effectively and sometimes beautifully filmed on location throughout Isreal and featuring dazzling sets and authentic traditional Arabic clothing this is a very polished film. Some attempt at comic relief is used successfully but mostly this one has a sombre and serious tone. Delta Force One will most likely disappoint action fans as there really isn't a whole lot of action until the films climax. instead we get a fascinating look at conditions in the mid East and whether or not this is an accurate portrayal it is always interesting. Gary Daniels makes for a strong and handsome leader and mike Norris provides a lighter mood with his over wound secondincommand and their Arab desert tracker who eventually confesses that he has no idea where he is leading the team is extremely likable. But the one who steals the show is young Tamil the Arab desert child played by Orr Malka. For a young actor Malka plays his difficult part with an impressive and believable level of bloodthirsty fury. Judging by the ridiculously low rating here this one was obviously seen by the wrong audience. Delta Force One is actually a wellmade little film both technically and artistically.".

For me the quality of this film came as quite a surprise effectively and sometimes beautifully filmed on location throughout Isreal and featuring dazzling sets and authentic traditional Arabic clothing this is a very polished film. Some attempt at comic relief is used successfully but mostly this one has a sombre and serious tone. Delta Force One will most likely disappoint action fans as there really isn't a whole lot of action until the films climax. instead we get a fascinating look at conditions in the mid East and whether or not this is an accurate portrayal it is always interesting. Gary Daniels makes for a strong and handsome leader and mike Norris provides a lighter mood with his over wound secondincommand and their Arab desert tracker who eventually confesses that he has no idea where he is leading the team is extremely likable. But the one who steals the show is young Tamil the Arab desert child played by Orr Malka. For a young actor Malka plays his difficult part with an impressive and believable level of bloodthirsty fury. Judging by the ridiculously low rating here this one was obviously seen by the wrong audience. Delta Force One is actually a wellmade little film both technically and artistically.";

It takes the whole vampire myth and returns it to it's rightful owner. Vlad Tepes was the basis of Stoker's Dracula and the vampire myth started in Romania and it's surrounding countries. I really liked how this movie didn't have the cinematic bloodsucker that we are all too used to but instead had a tortured spirit that was doomed to wander the earth. The photography and locations are impressive shot in the Carpathians and the characters are believable. I'd definitely recommend this intelligent vampire story to anyone who is a genre fan into historical pieces or even just needs something to watch on a Friday night. I think that anyone who comes into this movie looking to see it for what it is not some hack and slash horror film but a look into the historical Vlad mixed with a modern day adventure element will enjoy the movie.".

With all the build up about Vlad I was hoping for a more original plot. However I don't think that because the movie failed to be original that it should count against it I just think it shouldn't be praised for it either.Besides the plot the movies did have a pretty good production value. I'd say that it was a bit better than a madeforTV movie but obviously not a big budget film. Just because it's an independent movie doesn't mean that its great.

It has almost nothing in common with the typical vampire movie and moves further in the Gothic fantasy genre horrorfantasy would be a better term. Far away from typical clichs of the genre this movie presents us a twist in the well known history of Count Dracula as it removes any link to Bram Stoker's novel and focuses on the myths that inspired Stoker's novel. This movie is a tale of Romanian vampires.The plot is a bit confusing but at its core it is about four graduated students who are selected by a Rumanian organization that will fund their research for their final thesis as their projects deal with Rumanian folklore andor Vlad Tepes the legendary ruler of Valachia who inspired Stoker to write the famous novel. The organization lead by Radescu Brad Douriff is in fact a facade for an ancient order created by Tepes centuries ago and their purposes will reveal when one of the students Linsey Monica Davidescu reveals her secret Her family had stolen a medallion from Vlad's grave.The secret powers of the medallion will create chaos as the members of the order try to find it for different purposes everyone and the students are in the middle of the struggle aided by Adrian Billy Zane a loyal agent of Radescu who tries to avoid the rebirth of Vlad.Now the plot is for once very clever and quite interesting. The writers really did a great research when they wrote the story as it includes pieces of real history Romanian folklore and Vlad Tepes' biography. Of course spiced with fantasy and horror elements. Nevertheless this is also its big problem the movie tries to accomplish many tasks and this creates a confusing script. Certainly a bigger budget would have resulted in a longer movie and a longer movie would have fixed the confusion.Depsite that huge problem the movie works at its level with an incredibly looking visuals thanks to the beautiful Romanian locations and the amazing camerawork. It's indeed surprising how much they could make with so small budget.Sadly the budget hurts the SFX and they look as if they came from a cheap TV series. This indeed decreases a work of good quality but fortunately they focus on acting and not in SFX so it is not that notorious.The acting is very good and the young actors show promise. While some of the characters were not very developed the actors did a good job with the little they had and the result is pretty good. Again a bit more of care in the script would have resulted in outstanding performances but yet the actors carry the film with grace.Last but not least the most remarkable feature of this movie is without a doubt the music. It is an outstanding work and it is a shame that the movie had not been more known because the music is really outstanding. Few times a bmovie has a score this good and the movie really makes the most of it.While probably this movie is not Oscar material it is certainly among the best vampire movies of this decade. Or at least among the most original. A great fantasy movie. 6.510".

Kam Heskin is a hottie and carried her part well.  Francesco Quinn makes your skin crawl in this horror genre tale admirably making the role of Vlad the Impaler come to life and chilling you down to your socks! He looks a lot like his dad Anthony Quinn in some of the scenes  The Romanian actress whom I've never seen before did a great job of looking terrified  sexy. I wonder if she speaks any English? If not she did a great job of handling the wordy role. The musical score really punches up the terror in the scary scenes and sounds like a score from a Hollywood major film. This movie was filmed on location in Romania with the major horror parts actually filmed in the Carpathians at Vlad's real castle. The Dracula character takes on a new  completely different direction which in no way mimics former Dracula movies.  I enjoyed this one....".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd like to make a few points to einherjer9. First of all it's obvious by his review that he didn't see the movie but instead read the synopsis and made a judgment... Second this is a fun movie to watch that does delve quite a bit into the historical Vlad Tepes more so than any other fantasyhorror film ever has. If he wants to see a historical film about the actual Impaler then he should check out Dark Prince The True Story of Dracula 2000 which I'm sure he would trash too. Last... This is NOT a Hollywood film in my opinion. Hollywood films are the big studio movies that are cranked out without care for much more the making money. Vlad was made by an independent production company in the vein of when independent meant something not in the sense of independent like Miramax and Dreamworks. Vlad was made for what studios pay one actor to appear for five minutes in a Friends episode... Yet it looks better than most 50 million dollar movies. So all I can say to our friend einherjer9 is that before he trashes the independent film maker he should at least have the courtesy to see the movie.".

The group begins a two day 50 mile hiking trek through forests and mountains to a little known and inaccessible set of crumbling ruins at Poenari a fortress built by the historical Vlad Tepes.

Because it's not just another vampire movie or even a restless tragic spirit movie. Vlad is an intriguing blend of historical fact and supernatural fiction. It's a movie with both a brain and a heart the script believes its audience is at least IQ 80 and it doesn't treat the viewer as an imbecile or an ADHD bloodandguts freak who needs some lamebrained pseudoaction sequence every 7.5 seconds in order to stay interested in a film. Don't get me wrong there's action and there's plenty of supernatural trappings to Vlad. But there's also knowledge to be gained from the literate script and heartstrings to be rightfully tugged by the backstory and plight of the tragic eponymous character. Good acting superior writing and a marvelous grace note ending make Vlad a film that will stay with you long after you've first viewed it and that only improves on repeat viewings. It's certainly not for everybody but if you enjoy a film that doesn't insult your intelligence whilst telling you a fascinating story then Vlad is the film for you. It could well become a classic if only more people were to take that chance and give it a try. It's really that good.".

We're shown glimpses of his past and quickly empathize with his pain even as we're terrified by his brutality.The love stories woven into the film and the pace at which it's told keep you emotionally invested and on the edge of your seat. The tone and feel of romance aided by the beautiful backdrop of the Carpathian mountains is undeniable and moving.The film carefully balances love and anguish while merging past and present worlds. Even though it's set in modern day the film shows how we as people face the same struggles throughout our history. Vlad is incredibly well thought out and acted and should be enjoyable to a wide range of people. The nudity and violence in the film is done with taste and purpose and I'd recommend this film to anyone that wants a romantic saga about one of the world's most notorious monsters.".

What attracted me was first I love horror movies and the actors who were in it such as Kam Heskin Francesco Quinn Billy Zane and Paul Popowich each of whelm played their roles very well.I love Dracula movies that give you a back story as to how he became who he would become. It helps the viewer to understand why he is who he is and that he is not just a one dimensional villain.Circumstances beyond his control were the reason he would become Vlad Dracul. Francesco Quinn portrays Vlad very convincing as well as give you the person as well as the demon he has become. One can't help but feel empathy for him.Kam Heskin from Sunset Beach plays Alexa Meyer who becomes the object of Vlad's desire and he obsession to possess her which he does. She plays her role well as Alexa goes from being scared to being Vlad's slave. The viewer believes the transformation. The seduction scene was very well done. Not too much or too little. It was just right. On the DVD they have an alternate ending which shows that Alexa still under Vlad's control and that she is no longer who she once was.After Vlad kidnaps Alexa her brother Jeff played by Paul Popowich goes to rescue her from Vlad's clutches. Along with him are the other companions who went along with them on this trip to Europe.The fight scenes were very good and not at all cheesy as some horror movies can be. You could see the characters fighting to the death.The other actors were just as good at playing their roles. The priest who tried to empathize with Vlad by understanding him was good even thought it did not work as he had wanted but he tried all the same.It was a wonderful movie and I would recommend it to anyone who liked horror movies or Dracula.".

The four students do a good job of portraying their different characters and motivations and the progression of Justin's character from a somewhat caddish Englishman as a Brit I was highly amused into a protective sensitive and undoubtedly more courageous soul was well done. I'm not sure yet whether Justin and Ilona's meeting in her own time was a clever nod to fate destiny and reincarnation the two of them felt they were always meant to be together or whether it was an unnecessary 'happy ending' for the two of them.As I own the DVD I have only seen the open ending where it is implied that Alexa is still possessedunder the influence of Vlad and that was a fitting twist if not an entirely unpredictable one.I think allowing arguably one of the more wellknown actors Billy Zane to play a lesser role and die! was a wise move and he linked the story well although his occasional random bouts of Da... Yes or agreement to prove he can be Eastern European were unnecessary.This is a film that combines history with myth and it is an extremely good mix. The flashbacks and history of Vlad's family and his own problems give him a human edge and Francesco Quinn is amazing in the role. Perfectly judged. The use of subtitles to translate Ilona's middle English speech was also inspired as technically it's not a 'foreign' language only an old one.No film could ever be perfect but this is a very good addition to the Dracula saga. It is easy to see how the legends of vampires spread from stories like this one. It's also more intelligent than the usual bloodfest. In fact there are only odd moments of violence in it. This is a film that lets characterisation dialogue and implications tell the story and its all the better for a lack of excess gore every five minutes.Give it a look I doubt you'll be disappointed.".

The fact that this has the vampire aspect about it could have made it just like all of the other hundreds of vampire movies out there. But I was pleasantly surprised when I saw VLAD. The story gives the viewer a little history lesson about how the whole Dracula phenomenom started. I for one had no idea that Dracula is based off of Vlad the Impaler a real life terror to people during the 15th century. This wasn't a movie about a bloodsucking monster but rather about 4 students who go to Romania to research different aspects of the myth that surrounds Vlad. Without giving away too much of the story I'll just say that it was a very different and interesting take on the vampire myth. The first thing I noticed about this film was how breathtaking the cinematography was. Shot in the Carpathiean mountains the outdoor scenes are absolutely beautiful. Between the scenery and the musical score alone I found the film to be very haunting and realistic. This film is the first for the director and was independantly done which means lowbudget. I'm amazed because it looks so beautiful and better than some bigbudget features that are out in theaters right now. I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to see a unique and different approach to a film that isn't about vampires but about a myth that has love devotion and ultimately vengeance.".

	schema:headline " It shows something not revealed in other movies AT FIRST!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS In the first moments of the movie I thought Well it starts well shows something not shown in other movies! I refer to the sequence where the father and Mircea the eldest brother of Vlad were having a gruesome end! But from this moment on the touch with the reality is absent.First of all Vlad Tepes' father Vlad Basarab was known as Vlad Dracul not because he was part of a secret organization as it was suggested in the movie but for the following reason He received from the emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg the highest Order that was given to a knight in those troubled days  higher than The Teutons' Order The Order of the Maltese Knights or The Order of the Knights from Rhodos. That was The Dragon's Order. In Romanian Dracul means The Devil. And from Dragon to Devil was only a small step.Than Vlad and his brother Radu The Handsome weren't even there when their relatives died. They were forced guests at the Sublime Porte as a pledge that their father wouldn't have risen again against the Turks.Another weird thing in this movie is that misinterprets an old Romanian tradition. When a young girl dies at the age of marriage she is buried dressed in a wedding dress as a sign of her purity. She is not wedded with her fianc as Linsey says in the movie. But I guess the one who wrote the script was after the sensational at any costs.And what was that blur with the rambling English lass and the wannabe knight Justin?! Vlad Tepes now known as Draculea or Dracula has punished very harsh the thieves liars and the enemies. And that scared people as hell. Yes he was harsh even for those days. But efficient!!! While he ruled the country nobody dared to still something!!! LOL! That's why in my country HE is a national HERO!!!!And the verses recited in the movie wroted By Mihai Eminescu shows it very clear Why aren't you coming back our Lord Tzepesh to seize themTo divide them in two packs  in insanes and crooksAnd by force hoard them up in two large prison housesAnd set the jail and the cuckoos house ablaze.So in conclusion if you want to see a movie about vampires that doesn't scare not even a cat well... you might watch this one. But if you would like to see a REAL movie about Vlad Tepes I suggest Vlad Tepes aka Vlad the Impaler The True Life of Dracula 1979.".

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS In the first moments of the movie I thought Well it starts well shows something not shown in other movies! I refer to the sequence where the father and Mircea the eldest brother of Vlad were having a gruesome end! But from this moment on the touch with the reality is absent.First of all Vlad Tepes' father Vlad Basarab was known as Vlad Dracul not because he was part of a secret organization as it was suggested in the movie but for the following reason He received from the emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg the highest Order that was given to a knight in those troubled days  higher than The Teutons' Order The Order of the Maltese Knights or The Order of the Knights from Rhodos. That was The Dragon's Order. In Romanian Dracul means The Devil. And from Dragon to Devil was only a small step.Than Vlad and his brother Radu The Handsome weren't even there when their relatives died. They were forced guests at the Sublime Porte as a pledge that their father wouldn't have risen again against the Turks.Another weird thing in this movie is that misinterprets an old Romanian tradition. When a young girl dies at the age of marriage she is buried dressed in a wedding dress as a sign of her purity. She is not wedded with her fianc as Linsey says in the movie. But I guess the one who wrote the script was after the sensational at any costs.And what was that blur with the rambling English lass and the wannabe knight Justin?! Vlad Tepes now known as Draculea or Dracula has punished very harsh the thieves liars and the enemies. And that scared people as hell. Yes he was harsh even for those days. But efficient!!! While he ruled the country nobody dared to still something!!! LOL! That's why in my country HE is a national HERO!!!!And the verses recited in the movie wroted By Mihai Eminescu shows it very clear Why aren't you coming back our Lord Tzepesh to seize themTo divide them in two packs  in insanes and crooksAnd by force hoard them up in two large prison housesAnd set the jail and the cuckoos house ablaze.So in conclusion if you want to see a movie about vampires that doesn't scare not even a cat well... you might watch this one.

	schema:reviewBody "I was much impressed with Vlad and quickly voted it the best vampire movie I've seen this decade. Now before I go on let me apologize in advance to all the fans of Wes Craven for what I am about to say. I did not like Dracula 2000 or it's sequels. Vlad is a movie that gives me what I want when I watch a vampire movie. It has all the elements I like crave about the spooky Gothic style of the classic vampire. This includes sex which in a vampire movie is not gratuitous but part of the allure and mystique of the vampire. But where Vlad really delivers is in how well it maintains the constant atmosphere of mystery and apprehension. The music was perfect. Big points for spooky atmosphere. Also big points for including the historical Vlad Dracula and best of all the location what is it realtors say about location? which is in his home country of Romania and includes dramatic views of Bran Castle. For a B movie this does exceptionally well. I was impressed with the special effects of the face transformations which was subtle yet effective. It is indeed impressive how much work was put into a film with such a budget and how fortunate they managed to film it on the historical grounds of Romania and even include the people who live there. Anyone who can find fault with the acting knows nothing about acting. Did it have enough plot? Hell yes! And who can say the photography was not excellent? With apologies to Wes Craven fans I say Vlad succeeds where Dracula 2000 fails. As a fan of Bram Stoker I am aware that this author's novel has NEVER been accurately told in filmThis includes the so called Bram Stoker's Dracula and that I must respect the right of an artist to make his own interpretation. But to make Dracula to be Judas Iscariot I say is taking too much liberty with artistic license. Not to mention that it lacks the Old World Gothic and darkly romantic mystique. For those who appreciate what a good vampire movie is I say Vlad delivers.".

None of that was in the movie.The direction was totally miserable the acting much worse and even the camera work was just appearing semiartistic to me. The storyline was supposed to be a 'nightmare' and it really turned out to be one but not as intended by the tended viewer. I found it to be boring and uninspired there was no redline visible due to weird and unconnected turns of the story and also a lot of dead end plots.Since the story and characters did not work out there was not even a little bit of tension noticeable. What was e.g. all that talking about all these weird symbols at the site of crime about? Why was it in the movie at all? Just to give this silly intransparent and unnecessary hint to the murderer? How dull can it get?It really looks like somebody has been trying to take 'all the cool content' from other movies but surprise it did not fit together and nobody wanted to play it with a 'soul'.Allison Eastwood in fact was acting so badly that every little bit of atmosphere was immediately destroyed with the first word of hers. She was not into her character at all trying play that tough woman. Is Clints daughter supposed to be like that? If so it certainly did not work out at all. She would be good as a newsreader though keeping her voice that neutral and unemotional. Sorry Allison no movie with you again. Even John RhysDavies was surprisingly bad but with a set of so boring and flat characters even good actors are only able to fail.I am willingly to forgive that the movie was totally unrealistic since I personally don't expect that necessarily from a Hollywood making. But at least good cinematic handicraft and some passion of the actors I would have expected besides that uninteresting story.Stay away from this movie it is a waste of money and a shame in my eyes. You will watch your clock more than the movie in the hope that it will run faster so you can do something nice instead. It was a total waste of time for me.".

The script by star Celozzi  director Logthetis which takes itself very seriously is as bland  workman like as they come basically the film revolves around a series of murders with a religious slant  the cops who are trying to solve them. Seriously if I was giving points out for originality then The Lost Angel would get minus 10 not much focus is given to the murders or the religious significance other than it's some sort of rite the character's are terrible especially the lead cop Billie Palmer who I really wanted to die  as a result it was impossible for me to get into the story or care about what was happening. I was pretty much on autopilot sure I was watching it but it wasn't making any impression on me at all. Then there's the fact The Lost Angel tries to be many things it wants to be a scary horror a tense thriller a teenage coming of age story a heartfelt tale of cops finding redemption for earlier problems a romance  it also tries to be clever with a lame twist ending which doesn't work.Director Logthetis turns in an OK looking film but it feels more like a cheap madeforTV detective show with slightly more swearing  a bit more blood. I have to mention the opening credits here which are of a CGI computer animated drain the camera speeds along the pipes with the cast  crews names dotted around the place before the camera emerges from a plug hole  into the film proper it's a nice idea I suppose but the animation looks terrible  it's just so at odds with the rest of the film which is as bland  forgettable as they come it's frankly bizarre. Forget about any decent gore there are a couple of bodies with some blood on them  a few gunshot wounds but nothing to get excited about.Technically the film is OK even if it doesn't have any sort of style or visual flair it has average production values  is competent but nothing more. Allison Eastwood if you didn't know happens to be the daughter of Clint so it's surprising to see her in junk like this couldn't her dad fix her up with a good role in a big budget Hollywood flick? John RhysDavies plays a deaf priest  C. Thomas Howell is here somewhere.The Lost Angel is one of those films which tries to be several things but ends up as nothing in particular a below average cop thriller that really isn't worth wasting your time on.".

That would explain him dropping out of the sky for no apparent reason as an FBI Priest. FBI Priest? It would also explain why his character was clueless each time he appeared and seemed purposefully written to have no impact on the plot at all he was like the ghost of a dead career haunting this movie.This movie has an almost artistic way of leading you on to think its going to get better. A secret ancient ritual with a nude killing each day? Let's stick around! Is the ritual ever mentioned again? No. Weird cuneiform writing? Must be something weird! Lets stick around. Was it? No. Start out with babe victims and then move to old friars and old ladies. Blah. Why are these bad guys mutating into some other guy? Must be supernatural lets stick around. Was it? No. It's weird but its a fairly watchable pointless mess.Need to explain why the Priest heard nothing...lets make him deaf. Need to have the Friar not say what he knows....lets make him a mute. Need the sister grabbed at school but the bad guy can't do it because he would be recognized....have a random guy do it who is never seen again. Need a way into a building.....create a secret tunnel and give a lame oneoff explanation that has nothing to do with the plot.The acting was not that bad except at the start. In fact the movie was starting to drag me in a little until Judd Nelson suddenly dropped out of the ceiling into the movie and jarred me back to my senses. If you want to see a watchable exposition of bad writing this will do.Why is there snow in one part of town and not elsewhere? The secret tunnel goes to the East Forest.....but this church is downtown is it not? Why is the first bad guy washing out bloody cloth with gasoline?".

Besides the BAD acting and the BAD directing for cinematic effects it would slowmo the drama... a lot this movie at it's end just made no sense.I have to say that you know it's bad within the first five minutes but the majority of the criticism I can give comes having seen the ending waiting to tie loose ends up. So the majority of my critique will be listed under SPOILER! I will give Kudos for the fact that the movie keeps you guessing as a whodunit. Unfortunately the end result is cockamamie.AS WELL I thought C. Thomas Howell's character though over the top was actually quite entertaining. For just a few minutes I was entertained.So onto the Spoiler... the culprit was someone who at no point in the movie even seems capable of being the killer. He never shows signs of oddness or mental illness at any time. Nor does he seem capable of having the necessary knowledge of cuneiform. The two people with star power have a total of 10 minutes of film time between them. There is no explanation of why there is a priest FBI guy on the scene and he just appears in and out of the film inexplicably. The police department is completely shoddy and crooked and shields their detectives from investigation BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST DOING THEIR JOBS! vilifying the process of internal affairs investigations.There's even a secret tunnel into the church where the murderer goes in and out of and when the police find it they never post anyone to watch it. The priest hides the secret of the tunnel because he doesn't feel it's important. Huh? What the hell? Bad writing bad acting I think with a better director the actors could have performed better and definitely bad direction. And of course a requisite sex scene that does nothing to further character or plot simply because it's a B horror movie.IF YOU WANT TO SEE AN EXCELLENT AND UNDERRATED B HORROR FILM try Close Your Eyes with Goran Visnjic from ER and Shirley Henderson Moaning Myrtle.I KNEW I should have avoided this film but I was in the mood for cheesy horror but I got just cheesy.".

So I expected a bad movie. Surprise surprise! I liked it a lot. Yeah there are certain elements you have already seen in other movies. Which movie today does not have elements already been used? It's unavoidable. I found the movie very exciting and not predictable at all. As a matter of fact I suspected many of the characters to be the murderer. I was looking for the clues in everything they said and did and I enjoyed it a lot except for this stupid and overlong love scene it's not that love scenes bother me I actually like them when they fit in but this one did not fit in at all it was simply pointless! But then there came the end. I don't know how one of the other people who wrote a comment was able to predict the ending. Because I did not see it coming at all. For me it was simply unexpected and pointless. It ruined the movie for me. I would have given it a 810 if somebody else did it. But this way...510 and I'm being very grateful here!".

It also has a bit of a love story weaved in thanks to the talented Augustus Prew who I didn't know could do airballet! It was actually really cute and a well done film the whole family can enjoy. Maybe I am just biased because August Prew could recite the phone book and keep my attention! One big problem I had with it was the ending. Spoiler Sophie ships Sheba back to her home of Africa. I thought this was inconsistent as her parents own a zoo and thus she is saying that all the animals in her parents zoo should be shipped back to their home too. I am not sure why this film is so underrated I think it is just as good as any other animal movie and had a fresh story.

	schema:reviewBody "First review here forgive me if it's not the greatest. I became an Augustus Prew fan after discovering him in Animals by Maral Fors. Unfortunately some of his roles are from films in other regions and Sophie is one of the few I could get my hands on. Brittany Bristow does a good job playing the outspoken Sophie whom will stop at nothing to help her beloved friend Sheeba the elephant. Following her to the circus she had been sold to she makes a deal with the new owner work in exchange to earn Sheeba back. While everyone performed well Sophie's mother has a hard time convincing me that she has acted for awhile. She just annoyed me for some reason. Bristow does a good job although at times a little cheesy with her lines and the same goes for Erica Durance playing a silks performer when she sort of yells at someone. As a former dancer I wished that Bristow would've done so a little more. She is very talented in this regard and I enjoyed watching the few moments that she did. Her interaction with Sheeba was great and it is obvious that the two developed a bond while preparing before filming began. She states this in an interview as well. The soundtrack also had some cute songs in it. I don't know why this film has received such low ratings. Don't get me wrong it's definitely no masterpiece but overall I found it to be pleasant. Animals stuck in a circus or a zoo make me a little depressed but the movie ending and message is redeeming. I could've done without a certain sad moment in the film but I understand it was needed for drama I guess...I have a feeling we will be seeing a lot more of Mr. Prew in the future and for this I am VERY excited.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sophie is a teenager whose parents run a zoo. The location is never specified although the film was made in Canada and the TV reporter has a C on her microphone. But Sophie plans to go to the American Ballet Theatre so the film might be set in the United States.Since she was four years old Sheba the elephant has been her best friend. So Sophie is devastated when her parents dealing with financial problems have to sell the elephant to Winston Family Circus. Sophie offers to give up her dream of ballet if that's the problem but that doesn't do any good. Sophie heads to the circus hoping to get the elephant back.Once there Sophie witnesses trainer Magnus mistreating Sheba and demands that something be done about him. Alistair Winston who runs the circus his grandfather founded is being interviewed on live TV and Sophie's rant interests the reporter but Winston keeps trying to stop her.Having been accused of animal abuse which of course Winston's circus would NEVER do Winston must hire Sophie as Sheba's companion. he demands Sophie earn her keep which she is willing to do. Magnus has a real problem with Sophie being there. In fact he has a problem with Sheba. It's not just that Sheba is untrainable though Sophie could do it. He hates elephants and there's a reason for that. And Magnus CAN train animals he does a wonderful job with Caesar the black jaguar and genuinely cares for the animal. Magnus actually believes Sheba will put an end to the circus he will be the next to inherit.Winston disagrees that Sheba is a problem and when he sees Sophie and Sheba work together he sees a great opportunity to entertain people. Still it is not true that he genuinely cares about anyone there even though he appears to. He does care about the circus that his family started but also about making money. His best friend now and when he was a child is his ventriloquist dummy CW named for his grandfather Cornelius Winston so he has to admit he knows what Sophie is going through.Sophie's human best friend is Natalia a perky acrobat whose hair color changes daily. Natalia can be sad though and she does have a terrible incident in her past. Blake was once her partner in the act but now he is the pooperscooper. He might be a potential romantic interest to one of the girls.So will Sophie get her elephant back? Will she join the circus permanently? Will the various problems of the other circus performers be solved?Brittany Bristow is a wonderful actress following in the proud tradition of Murphy and Snow at least for this type of film. She can dance quite well too and we don't get to see nearly enough of that. As Sophie she has an adorable personality when that is appropriate and a strong determination and intelligence. Or what Winston calls being a manipulative minx. And someone probably not her since the face isn't visible is quite an acrobat.Erica Durance gives her usual good performance. I like her best perky but she shows she is capable of more. She doesn't really show her full range here but that's okay.John RhysDavies makes a wonderful villain. He's totally convincing when he seems to care about the various people in this film and I'm not quite certain they should be so suspicious of his intentions. Sure Winston has a greedy side but he genuinely shows he is good when he has to.And of course Sheba is quite talented. I don't know the elephant's real name or how many there were or even if some of the acting was animatronic or CGI but Sheba is talented.This being a circus we get to see lots of talented performers. Most of them are only on screen for ten seconds or so but they are very good. There is one little person whose name I don't remember who has plenty of dialogue and seems to do a good job with it.I wasn't happy with most of the music but this is what young people like. It wasn't really all that bad. Sophie's best dancing though was not to classical music but something like Once Upon a Time in Mexicostill good.This is a family film but not necessarily for younger or more sensitive children. There are a few moments of terror and mild violence as might be expected with wild animals and with people with the wrong attitude. Nevertheless Sophie's claim of abuse is an exaggeration. It's easy to see how Magnus could have abused Sheba as frustrated as he got but on screen he never reaches that point. After seeing Cold Mountain the same day I saw this I say what little violence this has is absolutely harmless.It's not perfect. This is one of those formula films even including the line That went well and while it's not overly preachy the film does seem to take the position that animals don't belong in circuses.It's definitely worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "I highly recommend this to everyone especially for our youth to partake and see the supreme true story example of what it is to stand for something for a vastly larger purpose beyond themselves. Corrie ten Boom's story is one in a million. Nearly every life that has been touched by the 1975 The Hiding Place and it's stunning reality of the message of forgiveness worked into the framework of the plot of her rare and untouchable example causes the viewer to thirst for more information on this dreaded and difficult time in history of WWII. When I learned that Return to the Hiding Place sequel to her story was to be released it was a delight to know that more of the story was to be revealed concerning the underground work of Holocaust and the resistance to the German Occupation. To see the details of work of her youth army led by Hans Poley and Piet Hartog  young and brave men they were gives this film a position that would challenge any youth of today to question their own maturity level compelling a natural introspection to do something for a greater purpose and cause. Only a masterfully executed direction and production by the Spencer Team could pull this off in this beautiful and rich example of what few may know took place with the younger generation of the 1940s. With the reality of Human Trafficking and Bullying that Hitler was notorious for inciting no one can argue with ANY merit that this work in time wouldn't touch the viewer and place into the mind a self evaluation for a life impacting take away. Dr. Spencer worked DIRECTLY with Hans Poley and heard the story first hand working diligently to preserve the miraculous details of the truth of what actually took place. Nothing can quite measure against the passion behind why this film was created and completed for an eternal purpose. Acting location shots editing and final product are par exellence.".

Nearly every life that has been touched by the 1975 The Hiding Place and it's stunning reality of the message of forgiveness worked into the framework of the plot of her rare and untouchable example causes the viewer to thirst for more information on this dreaded and difficult time in history of WWII. When I learned that Return to the Hiding Place sequel to her story was to be released it was a delight to know that more of the story was to be revealed concerning the underground work of Holocaust and the resistance to the German Occupation. To see the details of work of her youth army led by Hans Poley and Piet Hartog  young and brave men they were gives this film a position that would challenge any youth of today to question their own maturity level compelling a natural introspection to do something for a greater purpose and cause. Only a masterfully executed direction and production by the Spencer Team could pull this off in this beautiful and rich example of what few may know took place with the younger generation of the 1940s. With the reality of Human Trafficking and Bullying that Hitler was notorious for inciting no one can argue with ANY merit that this work in time wouldn't touch the viewer and place into the mind a self evaluation for a life impacting take away. Dr. Spencer worked DIRECTLY with Hans Poley and heard the story first hand working diligently to preserve the miraculous details of the truth of what actually took place. Nothing can quite measure against the passion behind why this film was created and completed for an eternal purpose. Acting location shots editing and final product are par exellence.";

But because he plays his role so well you'll notice that other actors in the movie are not so talentedexperienced. Sometimes you see some actors just standing there like they don't know what to do until it's time for them to say a line. Also the director could make some more cuts. The story is too slow here and there. The story is good but maybe the screenwriter could focus more on how the resistance could stop the 'rabit hunt' on Jewish children and keep some parts that didn't have anything to do with that out of the story to keep the movie going. But nevertheless it's a fine movie with historical value. It's about the Christian resistance in the Netherlands during the second world war and how they fought against the evil nationalsocialist empire of Adolf Hitler.".

Return to the Hiding Place is a truly uplifting historical film depicting young people who put themselves in harm's way to help others. I enjoyed the dramatic story line the sprinkles of humor but most of all the constant refreshing theme of hope.

This movie works. It has some flaws for sure. For example parts of it drag out and it is kinda unclear who the main character is for awhile but it still grabbed me. There is heart in this film that keeps it from being too preachy like many Christian films most of which I don't even see. Ouch. What I typically don't like in Christian films doesn't apply to this one  they show their lives and what they stand for instead of just talking about it. There is genuine emotion played out in this story  the confusion heartache fear... Mimi Sagadin who plays Corrie ten Boom portrays her with a sweetness I haven't seen in other films. Her sister Betsie  whoever played her can't remember is fantastic. My favorite is Max Van Bel and his role was so minor but how he played it hit me hard. The acting overall struggles at times but it is not at all what others wrote  it isn't horrible. That is a huge exaggeration. You do need to be in the mood to see it. Also they don't show extreme violence but do a pretty good job at showing reality as much as they probably felt able to do with that rating. I do feel like things got tired in certain scenes that they didn't really know what to do with it but they generally wrapped it up well. I will agree that the love story was a little confusing I couldn't tell if something was going on with those in love or not. Discretion in a love relationship on screen is good but taking it too far can be confusing to people.I love the motto of this film and that teenagers and young adults are the focus and the heroes of the story. What they did amazes me and what they risked amazes me as well. I like that this film shows Christians with some balls sorry if that offends you just trying to be real. This is how Jesus lived not wimpy and annoying like he's often portrayed. What people are capable of in greatness through selfsacrifice is the focus of this film and I think they succeeded in touching that. Could it have been done better? Yes. But would I see it again and recommend it? Yes again.".

There are many lessons in life that can be learned from this movie. The sacrifice made by these young men and woman for people they did not even know was inspirational. They did not do it for glory recognition or money  they did it for the glory of God and the goodness in their hearts to help others. This is something I feel is lost in today's society. This movie was made on a minimal budget against unforeseen obstacles and still looks like a highdollar movie from Hollywood. Great cinematography directing casting  acting. Incredible job to all involved and a mustsee for anyone that has not had the goodfortune to see it yet! No matter how many times you see this movie it always leaves a tear in your eye!!".

	onyx:emotionText "Amazingly touching movie! I particularly liked the pictures and interview at the end proving how real this story was. There are many lessons in life that can be learned from this movie. The sacrifice made by these young men and woman for people they did not even know was inspirational. They did not do it for glory recognition or money  they did it for the glory of God and the goodness in their hearts to help others. This is something I feel is lost in today's society. This movie was made on a minimal budget against unforeseen obstacles and still looks like a highdollar movie from Hollywood. Great cinematography directing casting  acting. Incredible job to all involved and a mustsee for anyone that has not had the goodfortune to see it yet! No matter how many times you see this movie it always leaves a tear in your eye!!";

	schema:reviewBody "irstly the story follows the lives of students and their involvement with the Dutch resistance. For me I felt mixed emotions from the film. The storyline appeared to have great potential for a big blockbuster that could have sat nicely next to Defiance and Winter In Wartime on the movie shelf and while I enjoyed the film sadly there was much left to be desired. The German Colonel Stass Klassen by far led the film in the acting department. His performance was solid and at times comparable to Christoph Waltz's performance in Inglourious Basterds but sadly he was alone in this department. John Rhys Davis held his own but really too brief a role to help the film. David Thomas Jenkins Craig Robert Young and the beautiful Rachel Spencer Hewitt made their presence felt but I felt their characters lacked depth and consistency needed for them to truly grow on you and take you into their world which I put mostly down to the next part. The directing and screenplay seemed to prove the greatest inconsistency and biggest let down with the film. Maybe due to low budget. At times characters were not clearly introduced or very briefly which left me as a viewer putting 2 and 2 together a lot throughout the movie. Also the story pace was up and down like a rollercoaster sometimes dragging slowly but then moving so fast that the scene changed to hoursdays ahead and left me wondering where it was at until once again putting 2 and 2 together. For me this is what hurt the storymovie the most.There was a strong element of religious notion in the film. Religious values were incredibly important during those times and quite often determined where ones stance lied with regards to helping the Jews.But having said all this and it will really depend on the individual I think overall wanting to watch for the storyline itself and to see the evil Colonel Stass in action kept me glued enough. But you will leave the seat having watched this with the feeling it could have been so much more in paying homage to those brave souls portrayed in the film.".

It is a film that seems to reach across the decades to our time and issue the same challenging question that its characters faced What would you risk to defend the truth and the innocent? The way this question is answered by the members of the Polish Resistance and what it brings about is sobering inspiring and something not easily forgotten. The film is based on historical facts not someone's invented story and I believe this is where the films impact mainly lies. These people their choices and the time the lived in were real. This film reminds us that each generation has choices to make for good or for evil and the consequences are not small. As far as film quality the main actors are well chosen and very convincing the visual quality is superb and although the film is long it keeps your attention. Personally I think the film's music could be improved a little for example some deep bass tones missing in places where it could've been useful and make the scene more vivid and deep. Overall I highly recommend The Return to The Hiding Place and I really wish they'd release it in theaters so I could take all of my friends to see it!".

Overall I was not disappointed but it was not exactly what I expected. The lead male roles of Paul C. Thomas Howell The Amazing Spiderman and Malcolm JohnRhys Davies Raider of the Lost Ark were played convincingly by both actors but the acting of Anory Lyn as Paul's wife Joanne was wooden and weak. The story tells of two men from very different walks of life who are kidnapped by human traffickers in Thailand. Paul is a doctor who along with his wife has come to Thailand after the loss of their daughter. Malcolm is a wealthy retired executive remarried after a failed first marriage. The music is superb as is the cinematography and direction. But this is not your usual kidnapping movie. What it is is a religious vehicle for Christianity which turns out to be the focal point of the story. Despite the thinlyveiled proselytizing Escape is still an enjoyable film with a message. But it's probably more on the level of a madefor TV movie than a major box office production. Rainy day? Nothing else to do? Open your mind and your soul and enjoy it.".

The villains are quite scary too. The scenery is absolutely gorgeous and complimented by photography that looks like a lot of effort went into it. The music is stirring not once losing pulse or overbearing the drama or the dialogue. The dialogue is audible at least and is actually worth listening to it does make sense and does stir some suspense and emotion without getting too overwrought. The story is imperfect of course but it had a good idea to start with and at its best it's emotionally charged and suspenseful with appropriately measured pacing and decent action. The direction is efficient enough and the characters while not fully developed are likable enough as well. The message is wellintended and while not exactly subtle it does make its point.In conclusion Escape does fall short of being great but it held my interest and was a decent movie. 610 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Screwball comedies have been around for decades. There are many good ones and it stands to reason that there are as many if not more bad ones. I'm not particular fond of them I don't dislike them but I do think they're certainly hard to pull off with a winning script. And when you don't have a winning script? Well then you spin it like you do and that's largely what you get with something that's as banal and predictable as CONCRETE BLONDES  it isn't a total failure but it probably won't win many converts to the careers of the involved talent.That's a shame too because it could have. Perhaps if it hadn't been in the hands of such an inexperienced writer AND director  one who may've seen the other's weaknesses in time to salvage this. I think everyone  audience included  deserved better.NOTE The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot andor characters. If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoilerfree then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment. If however you're accepting of a few modest hints at 'things to come' then read on Daytime accountant Kris Connifer played by Carly Pope can't quite catch a break. At work she's struggling with clients who can't pay for her services in cash while at home she's torn between the antics of her liveingalpal Tara the always lovely Samaire Armstrong and their sexy roommate Sammi Diora Baird. But when Tara and Sammi stumble across a drug deal gone bad they find themselves in possession of a suitcase with over three million dollars. Could it actually be the answers to all of their money woes or will it drive the girls to do unspeakable things all in the pursuit of untold riches?What hampers CONCRETE BLONDES the most is that fact that it never establishes a quality tone from the getgo. The opening scenes play like a bit of farce and not much later  once the three ladies are thrown together  it vacillates between drama and downright screwball lunacy. Then  in the final act  it goes full bore farce once more before eventually succumbing to an almost dystopialite urban crime thriller. Simply put BLONDES wanted to be more than it was ever capable of being and that's logically the fault of writerdirector Nicholas Kalikow. Instead of trying to embrace all elements of perhaps the films he most likes andor respects he should've dialed back all of the influences kept it simple and then gone for broke.Of course putting all of the blame on Kalikow's shoulders would dismiss the relatively inadequate performances he manages to eek out of these players. In particular Armstrong is the only one I think far more capable of giving more than she did here I've seen her in a handful of projects so I trust she did the best she felt possible with the material and veteran character actor John RhysDavies served as little more than a functional 'heavy' for the purposes of the mildly convoluted plot. As for Pope and Baird? Meh. Thankfully all of the ladies are easy on the eyes so much so that a tighter edit or a more tightly delivered tale would've given this a greater chance to find an audience.Unless I miss my guess here BLONDES is exactly the kind of film most regular folks want to like especially when it comes to crime capers. You've got goodlooking ladies  each with a different version of the classic heart of gold  who've all been wrong by that big mean world outside. You want them to get their acts together. You want them to succeed even if that means taking it on the lam and heading south of the border where no one will ever find them and their suitcase of stolen cash. Had it all started and stopped there then I suspect this one would've had a greater chance to win hearts and minds. Unfortunately that isn't the case and we're all left  like the girls  wishing for something most will never have.It's a disappointment but it's not awful. Just a disappointment.CONCRETE BLONDES 2012 is produced by CB Films North and Sacred Bull Media. DVD distribution is being handled through Inception Media Group. As for the technical specifications this indiestyle feature boasts the same quality sight and sound you'd find associated to practically any other indiestyle feature. As is often the case when these smaller films find eventual release there are no special features to speak of save for the theatrical trailer I'm not sure much is lost by having nothing extra as there was little here of any great substance.MODESTLY RECOMMENDED as more than a 'curiosity' than anything else. CONCRETE BLONDES isn't a bad attempt at trying to do something a bit avantgarde with storytelling it has an interesting crisscrossing and outofchronologicalorder narrative and it tries to mix a contemporary twist on screwball comedies with the gritty crime caper kindasorta like Quentin Tarantino likes. Sadly it doesn't do either all that successfully  performances aren't quite manic enough when they need to be nor are they 'screwball' enough when it's required of the players  and it's all edited together with an almost 'who cares?' motif. Sadly it could've been a tight little gem if someone had paid closer attention to what makes these uniquely twisted films work instead of going for the workmanship grade. Better luck with a remake. In the interests of fairness I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Inception Media Group provided me with an advance DVD copy of CONCRETE BLONDES by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.".

	schema:headline " Not much more than a continuation but still a worthy sequel.";
	schema:reviewBody "I think I liked Child's Play 2 more than most people given the reviews that I've read and the movie's low voter rating on the IMDb. A cute kid's doll is once again the unlikely home of Charles Lee Ray notorious serial killer again feeding off of the surrealism created by seeing a kid's doll screw it's face into expressions of the purest rage and spouting all manner of profanities. By now Ray is becoming more and more desperate to get out of the body of the doll because as we were informed in the first film if he spends too much time in that body he'll gradually become more and more human until one day he'll be stuck in it forever. Needless to say Ray's a lot more interested in starting life over as a 6yearold and who wouldn't? rather than spending the rest of his life as a plastic doll.Although given that he becomes more human the longer he is in that body how human will he eventually become? Will he ever reach full humanhood? My guess is that he'll gradually approach being a real human being in a sort of half life where he gets closer and closer and closer but never actually gets there kind of like computer generated actors. There is currently much talk about how close computers can ever get to animating convincingly real people into the movies and the leading theory seems to be something akin to my theory of Chucky turning human. He'll always get closer but he'll never get all the way there.At any rate Andy's mother has landed in a mental institution and Andy has been taken in by a foster family with appropriate mental vacuity to be a horror movie surrogate family. When Andy becomes frightened and runs through the house his foster father grabs him and says 'Rule 1 no running in the house!' OK 'dad' but not even when I open a closet and find myself confronted by the doll that landed my mom in the nuthouse and almost cost me my life and my very soul? My God man what the hell is this guy doing with a Good Guys doll in the house in the first place? It's difficult enough trying to figure out why it's even there WITHOUT having to watch this mental giant grab Andy by the arm and ask him what on earth is the matter.There are some funny moments in the film such as when Chucky smashes the head of the innocent Good Guys doll buries it and takes its place in the house and my favorite when Chucky is later addressed by a doting adult Chucky responds by saying in his cute doll voice 'Hi! I'm.Tommy!'The stockholders in the Play Pal corporation are distressed over the suffering that the company has endured due to the negative publicity of the events of the first movie provide the premise for the movie's rather impressive finale. In order to generate a more positive image for the company and the doll they have decided to reintroduce it into the market. The original Chucky doll was collected by the company and examined by toymakers who decided that there really was nothing truly wrong with it it was not really a demonpossessed toy so they decided to melt it down and remake it. Why they didn't just throw it away I'm not really sure but who cares. Waste not want not I guess.At any rate Chucky comes back in a fresh plastic body too bad he can't be transferred to a human as easily as he can be transferred from one doll body to another and once again resumes his quest for Andy's soul. I've heard complaints about why Chucky had to go after Andy and couldn't just find a bum on the street or something but you'll remember in the first movie the conditions of his plastic entrapment stated that he could only transfer into the body of the first person that he revealed his identity to once he was inside the Chucky doll.Jarrett Friend writing for HorrorWatch made the above suggestion having forgotten that little stipulation but also smartly suggested that the plot should have involved a huge number of Chucky dolls since the original doll was melted down and whose plastic conceivably should have infected much more dolls than just the one that we saw in this movie. This would have made the movie much more interesting and added another level of originality my guess is they just didn't have the budget for something that big.Nevertheless even though the first sequel in the Child's play series comes dangerously close to falling into that sophomore sequel chasm of falling flat because of obviously feeding off the success of its predecessor without having much of anything to add to the story Child's Play 2 escapes into the world of moderately acceptable horror sequels kind of like Psycho II which had no hope of matching its predecessor but at least was able to justify its own existence. I think it's easy to be put off by the conclusion of Child's Play 2 but I was pretty impressed with the toy factory setting if only because it created such a great atmosphere for Chucky to make his hunt and Andy and his foster sister Kyle to try vainly to escape. There was some pretty clever stuff in the final act of the film not including however the scene where Kyle and Andy run around completely lost making the factory seem like a maze by editing together a lot of clips of them clearly running around the same corner half a dozen times or so. A bit trite but nothing compared to my biggest gripe of the film which is the final scene one of the goofier things that I've seen on an otherwise at least moderately competent horror movie. Odd for a movie to try so hard to live up to its expectations and then belittle itself with something like what I'll just call the air hose scene. I do however think that the movie was successful and good enough to deserve a better DVD than it got. I can't stand it when the only extra features on the DVD for a successful film are nothing but some foreign audio tracks and cast and crew history that is nothing more than a brief biography and a list of film credits. What do you think the IMDb is for?".

Waste not want not I guess.At any rate Chucky comes back in a fresh plastic body too bad he can't be transferred to a human as easily as he can be transferred from one doll body to another and once again resumes his quest for Andy's soul. I've heard complaints about why Chucky had to go after Andy and couldn't just find a bum on the street or something but you'll remember in the first movie the conditions of his plastic entrapment stated that he could only transfer into the body of the first person that he revealed his identity to once he was inside the Chucky doll.Jarrett Friend writing for HorrorWatch made the above suggestion having forgotten that little stipulation but also smartly suggested that the plot should have involved a huge number of Chucky dolls since the original doll was melted down and whose plastic conceivably should have infected much more dolls than just the one that we saw in this movie. This would have made the movie much more interesting and added another level of originality my guess is they just didn't have the budget for something that big.Nevertheless even though the first sequel in the Child's play series comes dangerously close to falling into that sophomore sequel chasm of falling flat because of obviously feeding off the success of its predecessor without having much of anything to add to the story Child's Play 2 escapes into the world of moderately acceptable horror sequels kind of like Psycho II which had no hope of matching its predecessor but at least was able to justify its own existence. I think it's easy to be put off by the conclusion of Child's Play 2 but I was pretty impressed with the toy factory setting if only because it created such a great atmosphere for Chucky to make his hunt and Andy and his foster sister Kyle to try vainly to escape. There was some pretty clever stuff in the final act of the film not including however the scene where Kyle and Andy run around completely lost making the factory seem like a maze by editing together a lot of clips of them clearly running around the same corner half a dozen times or so. A bit trite but nothing compared to my biggest gripe of the film which is the final scene one of the goofier things that I've seen on an otherwise at least moderately competent horror movie. Odd for a movie to try so hard to live up to its expectations and then belittle itself with something like what I'll just call the air hose scene. I do however think that the movie was successful and good enough to deserve a better DVD than it got. I can't stand it when the only extra features on the DVD for a successful film are nothing but some foreign audio tracks and cast and crew history that is nothing more than a brief biography and a list of film credits. What do you think the IMDb is for?";

The animatronics have improved and a lot of Chucky's character comes through in his wild facial expressions.Director John Lafia shoots the film with a bright playroom color pallet with most of the location footage done in Los Angeles with only a few key shots done in Chicago as if the Windy City was ever this sunny. Despite the autumn setting it does feel like a rather Xmasy film. He's also fully aware of how silly the killer doll concept is and seizes the opportunity for some of the selfaware sarcastic humor seen in the later films. Graeme Revell usually does the most generic horror scores especially in recent years but surprisingly he gives Child's Play 2 the best score of the series with a full orchestra at his disposal he doesn't hold back on the action cues and even delivers a couple of pretty good themes. So much better than the rotten score to the first film and probably one of the best horror scores of the 90s or even of all time. It really is that good and elevates this sequel to a higher level than most snobby critics would consider it deserves.There isn't much of a story to Child's Play 2 however. It's just the same as the first with Chucky going after Andy who is now staying with a foster family once more. The body count is higher and there are some good kills but I wish that the running time wasn't so anorexic and that it held back on the lurking in the dark scenes.The slick quality and silly nature of Child's Play 2 is probably what prompted Universal to stick with the franchise for good and 23 years later the Chucky films are still coming out. To think that if MGM held on to the rights we may never have had them.".

Alex Vincent is right on the mark in his role as Andy Christine Elise is terrific as his foster sister Kyle and Jenny Agutter adds a touch of class as their foster mother Joanne Simpson. Gerrit Graham plays her strict husband and Grace Zabriskie is good in her role as the career at the orphanage. Beth Grant steals the moment in her small role as Mrs Kettlewell however.

The officer notices Chucky and asks his name and Chucky replies in his normal voice Chucky.. The movie perfectly filmed. The movie is fun to watch. It gets a 1010. Child's play 2 is great.";

The second movie in the series isn't as good but it's not real bad either. However the filmmakers took the gory route for this one. All the graphic violence makes it less effective. The first movie worked so well because it kept the violence down to a minimal. Oh the first film was violent but not as violent as this one. But it's stylish look somehow makes it watchable. And like the original it's entertaining to watch. Young Alex Vincent reprises his role from the original as Andy Barclay the boy who in this movie goes to live with foster parents while his mother seeks psychiatric help from the events in Child's Play. Andy himself still isn't all together and when Chucky the killer doll reenters his life again watch out! Child's Play 2 may not be as good as Child's Play but it sure is better than the next movie in the series Child's Play 3 which I thought was awful. I haven't seen the fourth movie yet Bride of Chucky so I can't voice my opinion on that one at the moment.12 out of four".

The only other member of the cast of the original film to return is the young Alex Vincent as the boy Chucky must kill so as to not permanently be imprisoned in the body of the doll.  Brad Douriff is back as the maniacal voice of the pintsized murderer.  What you would expect from a sequel of this caliber is pretty much what you get.  Little plot little characterization lots of killing lots of blood lots of gore effects and a Chucky that comes back comes back comes back comes back and comes back.  I got so tired of watching Chucky come out of situations where he was supposed to be 'dead that it was like a test of endurance for my common sense.  Vincent does a good job with his role but the film really lacks from the freshness and individuality of the original film's characters.  I don't know why people that make horror sequels always think it is just the gore and blood which makes the first film popular.  They are integral parts but the film probablynot always has other elements that appeal to people over 15.  This sequel eliminates those elements and makes it very clear that its intended audience is between 1519.  Pity because I found the first film very effective and slightly intelligent on one level. This film is really nothing more than one killing after another until we get to the factory where other Chuckies are made and the real nonsense begins in what has to be one of the most ridiculous finales of a horror film I have seen in some time.  Now it sounds like I am really bashing this film...and I am...but one small concession on my part is that the film moves by quickly and is entertaining on a bad its good level.".

Credibility really is strained by the time we get to the schoolroom scene where Chucky has followed the boy to school lands magically in his classroom and manages to start trouble between the boy and the teacher who subsequently gets killed by Chucky after the boy has climbed out a window.

Especially good are the effects toward the end when Chucky holds the spunky adopted girl and boy captive as the story speeds toward an ending in the toy factory. The factory sequence has some grotesque chills as one of the workers gets caught up in the doll machinery and Chucky himself suffers quite a few happenings at the toy factory before he's liquidated by the boy.Entertaining nonsense despite the strain on credibility.".

Instead of the icy cold Chicago downtown setting this time Mancini decides to go suburbia on this foray. While it's clich bound and everything about this one looks plastic. It's commendably made production with a glossily bright tinge to the set designs like the surreallike toy factory. The slick photography by Stefan Czapsky is lithely orchestrated and Graham Revell's ominous sounding music score hits all the right chords. Kevin Yagher's animatronics creation of Chucky has advanced a little more with refined detail and zeal developments. The face and body movements seem a bit more flexible.Who gave this doll life was the ultracool and memorably wicked vocal performance of Brad Dourif as Chucky. It became Dourif's definite trademark role. Alex Vincent returns and isn't particularly that convincing in a stiff performance as Andy. Gladly it doesn't do any damage but only enhances the traumatic angle they are going for. Having the same person playing the role added some continuity though. Adding a professional touch to this bgrade fluff were the likes of the always elegantly classy Jenny Agutter and ripely formal Gerrit Graham were likable as the foster parents Joanne and Phil Simpson. Christine Elise is fittingly strong as the delinquent teen Kyle. Also there are minor but decent performances by Grace Zabriskie Beth Grant and Greg Germann.The novelty isn't a complete waste but if you take the unbelievably illogical premise and the unpleasant nature with a grain of salt.

	schema:reviewBody "Okay some people say this movie is a very cheesy sequel to Child's Play and I can't disagree with them. But in some cases cheesy is exactly what you want from a movie. Especially if it features a redhaired freckled doll possessed by a serial killer. Come on people of course this movie was going to be cheesy. The first one just about managed to keep it together with some suspense but once you've done the big reveal there's not a lot of credible scares you can wring out of this premise. What's left is having fun with it and Child's Play 2 does that very well. From the opening scene in which Chucky is reconstructed by the original toy factory for a nonsensical reason but who cares? it has this obvious sequel quality to it. The thing that could not be destroyed but was is back and he's angrier than ever! The clich of the cynical company bosses is played out and then we're on our way. That first scene sets the mood really well you really get everything you need to get an idea what this movie is going to be like. Over the top campy set in its own reality. There really was no other way to go after the over the top ending of Child's Play 1 with the melted barely recognizable Chucky dragging himself to his victims for a final scare. So we get some enjoyable oneliners from old Chuckles and I definitely got some chuckles out of his killer lines. Literally because most of his oneliners are accompanied buy an equally funny kill. About those kills well they're maybe not even extremely creative but they're sure as hell effective. In the beginning of the movie all of the people Chucky kills really deserve to die in horrormovie terms that is obviously no one really deserves to die. I'm rooting for Chucky when he kills the underling of the company director who brought old Charles back in the first place and who's just a slimy little weasel. Then Chucky manages to kill Andy's horrible teacher with a ruler in the classroom where she locked Andy. And even when foster dad Phil is killed on the way to punish little Andy for misbehaving you're still sort of rooting for the doll. But no horror movie can thrive on just murdering bad guys so from that point on the movie takes a more actiondriven mood which is done quite nicely. In the end we go back to real sequel territory when we return to the good guy doll factory for an ultimate showdown set to a background of thousands of good guy dolls in various stages of being manufactured. That just works brilliantly. The acting in this movie never strays into academy award winner territory but it's sufficient and especially little Andy and his stepsister Kyle play their parts pretty well. Of course the real star is Brad Dourif who serves his cheesy lines with a side order of ham. The effects are again nothing mindblowing well... one effect is but that's not a description of its quality it just literally blows Chucky's mind apart but they're not bad. Add to that a pretty good score decent camera work and editing and you have a nice little brainsnack. I don't think it was anyone's intention to make this a great piece of art. It's pulp entertainment. Ultimately pointless but a great watch when you're bored. I can't rate this higher than a 6 objectively but in my heart I would have given it a 7 or 8 just because it's so unpretentious. Horror sequels that try to artificially invoke the same terror the original had to offer are usually horrible to watch. Child's Play 2 although it is of course nowhere near as good as the first movie made the right choice to take a different approach.".

It seems that the creative team behind Child's Play 2 sought to not only create an effective sequel but also build the character of Chucky into the sort of thing that legends are made of. This is a big bombastic wild ride of a film constrained within the guise of being a standard slashersequel.But there's something important to think about. A key question. Does it work?And the answer to that question Sort of I guess.Following a wild opening in which Chucky voiced by the fantastic Brad Dourif is reconstructed in a way that I actually found quite intriguing he escapes and sets off to find his old target young Andy Barclay Alex Vincent who is in the process of being placed into a new foster home. With his new body Chucky hopes to finally be able to transfer his tormented spirit into a human host once and for all. And so a sortof deadly game begins as Chucky infiltrates Andy's new home and toys with him causing him distress and picking off the people around him leading up to a final confrontation that I can only describe as epic in scope and quite satisfying.Returning screenwriter Don Mancini seems more at home this time around after some apparent drama with the first film going into rewrites and relishes in the chaos of the storyline. You can feel a writer just having fun with the material when you watch this film. Everything is bigger. Stakes rise to new heights. Setpieces are more encompassing and wild. And there are new ideas being explored left and right.John Lafia's guidance as director is quite good. While the original film was slick and grounded Lafia here goes for stylized visuals that lend a unique quality to the film making it feel more akin to a fairytale. And I really enjoyed that aspect of the production. Although at times it does take you out of the movie because things are a little TOO stylish. A scene where a character has to run around a maze of boxes while suspenseful will probably make you chuckle and exclaim Who stacks boxes like that?!I found the performances admirable. Alex Vincent grows quite a bit as a young performer. Though I didn't mention it in my review of the first film I never found his acting organic or believable. He was just a little too young and a little too cute for you to believe the emotions he was trying to convey. But here he knocks it out of the park. He's a bit older as had more experience acting and is able to give a really remarkable compelling performance for a childactor. Supporting roles by the likes of Christine Elise and Jenny Agutter are also quite good. Particularly Elise as Kyle Andy's older Foster Sister who becomes the person he connects with most in the story. She has a lot of heart in her performance and comes off well on screen and along with Andy is the one person you really care for.And of course there is Brad Dourif. He IS Chucky. His role is a perfect blend of different elements combining to create a nearideal slashermovie villain. Dourif's voice is commanding and threatening yet also oddly endearing and amusing when it needs to be. His delivery is spoton in every scene. And he is able to take charge of every scene he's in.All of this being said I do think there are a lot of fundamental issues with the film. And I do believe that despite rampant strengths it just doesn't quite gel together as it did in the first movie.Despite the more grandiose scale and qualities of the film I thought it didn't do quite as good a job at forging human connections. With so much chaotic content the smaller moments just seemed to become lost in translation which is a pretty big issue. This is a film of style over substance.I also felt that the film lost me at a few times. Some of the performers aren't up to snuff despite the main cast being great some of the deaths are bizarre and weak and some moments just seemed silly or went on for far too long.If the film could have gone through just a little bit more trimming and reediting I think it could easily have matched the quality of the original.But still as it stands Child's Play 2 is highly enjoyable albeit flawed. And I think that in the grand scheme of things it's definitely worth checking out for all fans of horror. If the story doesn't win you over the crazy mythical style just might.I give it an average 6 out of 10.".

It's almost halfbelievable how Jason kept coming back if you suspend your disbelief to the max but how Chucky is resurrected from the definite end in 1 is downright hilariously bad. But if you can overlook that you get horrible camera wideangles that are annoying clichd characters predictable kills and props and literal overkill. And Andy? The actor Vincent though probably pleased to return seems like he sleptwalked through this movie especially the closing. Here's the socalled synopsis Chucky's Back as some of the titles indicate. He's back to transfer his soul into little Andy so he doesn't have to stay a doll a position he put himself in in 1. But will anyone believe Andy now in foster care since his mother in 1 Hicks refused to return? Probably not. This movie is seriously a nobrainer or the writers were. Either way it should be skipped. Thankfully it's a short release but the little substance it has hardly make up the 84 minute running time. Honestly I can't say much nice but maybe the girl Kyle who seemed like a character pulled from 'Friday the 13th part V' was a tiny bit interesting but unfortunately the foster dad who seemed like a character pulled from 'Friday the 13th part VII' was anything but. Yes Chucky is fun to watch but not young kids smoking which seemed real. Skip. In fact watch part 1 jump to 'Bride of Chucky' and quit the series. Of all 5 so far those are the only valuable ones.".

	schema:reviewBody "After the success of the Child's Play 1988 writer and creator Don Mancini knew that a sequel would be on its way. And of course the smart thing to do would be to continue the story from the first movie. And for the most part the sequel stays faithful to the story line. It does have a few areas that need to be addressed but all around it pretty much matches its parent. After the torturous event of Charles Lee Ray The Lakeshore Strangler attacking the Barclay home it was time to move on. Sadly things didn't get better for Andy Barclay. Andy's mother is sent to a psych ward for help and Andy is put into a foster home. Making matters worse is the Good Guy Doll company somehow acquired the burnt dismembered parts of Chucky and decided to clean him off and put him back together. Unbeknownst to them once reassembled Chucky comes back to life and begins his rampage of violence to find Andy again. And that's all there is to this. It is just another set up to have Chucky voice by Brad Dourif killing people to get to the boy that he told his secret to. Is it bad? No it actually can hold its own as a good sequel.The weakest area is Mr. Mancini's writing. For example very few audiences are familiar with voodoo and it's never explained to why Chucky came back to life after being reassembled. Was that apart of the voodoo spell? Besides in the first movie wasn't it shooting Chucky in the heart the only way to kill him? That's a big loophole. However it's also forgivable because a lot of people like Chucky so it's obvious a lot of people will not care too much. It's crazy though how similar this sequel is like Hellraiser II Hellbound 1988. The director of Hellbound was a crewmember for Hellraiser 1987 and then directed the sequel. Same goes for John Lafia the director of this film. He too was apart of Child's Play 1988 and then went on to direct the sequel to this franchise. And both sequels are decent and have good continuity but suffer from weak reasoning for the logic behind the continuity. A very similar parallel that is interesting to think about.As for actors it's obvious that Brad Dourif is needed to play Chucky and his performance is always the best. Next is Alex Vincent whom fans should be happy to see because he's a key part of why Chucky exists and his performance is just as likable as he was from the first movie. Lastly is Christine Elise who plays another foster child named Kyle who befriends Andy. At a point she develops a strong will to fight and it's good that she wasn't written in as a scream and do nothing girl. But as for the rest of the cast they aren't much to talk about. The foster parents and every other individual are the same. They don't believe a killer doll exists and right fully so IF this were a reality. Oh well their loss.The last couple of elements that viewers should enjoy is the cinematography by Stefan Czapsky and music. Unlike the first movie which contained grittier and darker colors this movie has brighter more elementary colors which give something new for fans to look at. Plus the music produced by upcoming composer at the time Graeme Revell did a much better job than the score from the first movie by Joe Renzetti. Here Revell actually uses an orchestra and not just synths. And Revell even gives the Child's Play franchise a motif theme and some creepy tunes. A well developed horror score. Does it top its predecessor  no. Is it a good sequel  yes.Like other horror sequels it lacks clarification on logic but it still amounts to a decent sequel. The score has improved as well allowing to sound more like a horror film.".

If you have actually seen the film you may say that 'Child Play 2' surpasses the cult classic original in 3 ways. first it skips the murder mystery not saying that the mystery is bad in the original its just that the cover shows Chucky with a knife and all the sequels tell you he is real and gets strait to the horror. Second it has a nice foster sibling sub plot that is not just interesting but something you nearly never see in films especially horrors And thirdly the creative one liners and weapons propel Chucky into the slasher big leagues and are blue prints for the One line spouting Chucky we all know and love today. With interesting characters Quotable quips A good child actor Brad Dourif's Haunting voice and a satisfying bloody end to Chucky. 'Child's Play 2' is truly a cult classic.".

One thing was for certain the world of children's play things would never be the same. Chucky the killer doll would haunt the dreams and nightmares of children and adults everywhere. His red hair and blue bib would become infamous. His laughs and cackles would become haunting and his signature vulgar vocabulary would become a siren of terror for all those around!After the success of the first Child's Play Hollywood was ready to cash in on the success and not too late. It would be a year and a half before that good guy that everybody fears would grace the silver screen again to cause terror and mayhem. The sequel to the the terrifying .The script was written by Don Mancini the writer of the original script and the concept of the films. The main script for the secret was written mainly by Mancini but a small portion of it was written by the director of the sequel John Lafia Man's Best Friend. The film stars some old faces and some fresh familiars. The main star is Alex Vincent Cult of Chucky who played the same character Andy Barclay in the first Child's Play. Another cast member is Christine Elise Body Snatcher's 1993 who plays Andy's loyal friend and companion Kyle. Once again the great and wonderful Brad Dour if is back as the titular voice of Chucky the doll.The cast also includes some wonderful character actor's. Gerrit Graham Terrorvision Phantom of the Paradise plays Phil Simpson the jerk off of the film. Then there is Jenny Agutter An American Werewolf in London plays Joanna Simpson Phil's Wife who are both foster parents. Next we have Grace Zabriskie Galaxy of Terror plays Grace poole the local orphanage manager. Then we have the real wench of the movie Andy's 3rd grade teacher Ms. Kettlewell play by Beth Grant Too Wong Foo Donnie Darko.The film also stars many wonderful practical animatronics by the master of puppets Kevin Yagher Tales from the Crypt A Series of Unfortunate Events. The chucky doll is back and looks better then ever. There are a few new modifications to the look of the doll. The puppetry is amazing and makes the doll seem almost lifelike. The eyes on the doll alone are haunting and ominous. The music was composed by Graeme Revell Sin City Pitch Black The Crow. The Music in the film has that haunting childlike tone that made the first film haunting and creepy. The score is great and bigger in scope compared to the first.The film is very well done and still holds up. The film to me personally is one of the greatest sequels to a film ever. Unlike many sequels to not only great horror films but films in general this sequel works a lot. I love the acting Its very 90's. Brad Dourif does a wonderful job voicing Chucky. The music within the film is creepy and wonderful. The music is wonderfully composed. Overall the film works. The movie is great and true sequel Now i cant say that about Seed but we'll leave that for another review.Two Poly Urethane Rubber Thumbs Way UP!!!!".

Friday the 13th had the Jasonless fifth installment Halloween the Michael Meyersless third entry and A Nightmare on Elm Street the silly first sequel. For many fans Child's Play 3 is the embarrassment of the Chucky saga. But why?So many reviews of this film express exacerbation even confusion over the sudden shift eight years into the future. What's so hard to understand? We had already had two movies with Chucky chasing a little kid. It was time to move the story along hence our hero Andy Barclay Justin Whalin is now a teenager at a military academy. This change of scenery was the breath of fresh air the series needed as it opens up all kinds of new options to the murderous doll which he fully exploits paintball guns loaded with real ammo anyone?.Other reviewers complain this just isn't scary. There they have a point but how many gorefests actually bring our hands up to our eyes? Scariness is a great complement but that doesn't mean the whole project goes down the tubes without it. Child's Play 3 has a smooth storyline a touch of suspense and a truly memorable original climax at a carnival though it doesn't quite surpass the doll factory finale of the the previous film. Chucky's foul mouth begins to be a liability rather than an asset but we can cut him some slack  he's certainly never looked better or more realistic.Child's Play 3 does have its ups and downs however. The romance between Andy and a fellow cadet is a distraction and there are times when our plastic star just seems brushed aside in favor of more serious moments. Chucky's desire to swap souls with someone other than Andy is a welcome change but his new target young Tyler is one dimensional and uninteresting. He's unable to carry his scenes like Alex Vincent who played child Andy in the first two films.As far as I'm concerned this was the last of the true Child's Play films. Once this one was done the series became a shameful hokey parody of itself. This entry is by no means perfect and it's certainly not up the caliber of Child's Play 2. Yet it's not the piece of trash so many would have us believe. In fact it may just be one of the most underrated theatrical horror films of the early '90s.".

Andy is now a teen and has been sent to a military academy. And guess what Chucky decided to tag along. This makes for a great story. Chucky really shows his true colors and sick twisted sense of humor here. We also have an interesting group of characters here who are actually worth mentioning. We have Andy of course we have Tyler a young cadet who catches Chucky's eye as a replacement of Andy there's DeSilva a tough girl who has a soft spot for Andy we have Whitehurst an outspoken nerdy type who quickly befriends Andy we have Shelton a militaryloving tough intimidating young man who has it in for Andy and we have Botnik an older guy the barber who loves his job just a little too much. Together with these great characters is a great setting. There are some very interesting kills here which I have not even thought of or seen in any previous film. I do not understand why this movie is so underrated. Is it because of the time lapse? Maybe because Andy's not a kid? New setting? No matter what the reason this movie deserves much more than a 4.1 rating as of 3708. I say it gets 910. Fans of the first 2 films will not want to miss this.".

Chucky's plan changes when he meets a younger boy named Tyler he tried taking over his soul but Andy will do whatever it takes to stop Chucky before he transfers his soul into the innocent Tyler.After hearing about Child's Play 3 long time ago I thought that they were going to recast Alex Vincent in this one when he became a teenager because Alex Vincent always shined in the originals. We wanted to see the story continue with Alex Vincent but after seeing Child's Play 3 it was too bad. The film had great performances by Justin Whalin who starred as Andy and Jeremy Sylvers was great starring as Tyler. The film was another Horror hit classic and Brad Dourif did great again playing the voice of Chucky.The film had different plot points and all new cast. Child's Play 3 was good into The Child Play Series. I recommend this one to everyone as well. Child's Play and Child's Play 2 with Alex Vincent amazing horror classic.

	schema:reviewBody "this is one of the films that u see when u are a kid n then you never forget it... u get nightmares and never forget the face of that notorious killer dollChucky. This is in my personal opinion the best of the Child's Play series 123... Bride of chucky was pathetic with its more humorous approach on the whole killer doll idea as well as being the more violent and macabre hence the '18' certificate. From the funnycool oneliners such as Presto... your're dead nothing like a strangulation to get the circulation going and the one above in online summary to Chucky's violent killings and chilling laughs you know this is gotta be better than 1 and 2. the music goes alongside the most chilling scenes well such as Chucky's resurrection in the factory and scenes of death. His death scene at the end is also quite funny as he is flapping his arm and legs around before he hits the large fan and gets ripped 2 shreds! I personally regard this movie as one of my favourite films of my life hey I'm only 14 as I watched when I was 4. I'm now looking forward 2 'Seed of Chucky'!".

This is in my personal opinion the best of the Child's Play series 123... Bride of chucky was pathetic with its more humorous approach on the whole killer doll idea as well as being the more violent and macabre hence the '18' certificate.

The springs of Lourdes never had so much healing power! This revives Chucky and he instantly becomes his mean killing machine of old and wants to find Andy Barclay to take his soul. Andy played by Justin Whalin is an older teenager now and enrolled at a military academy. Well not to get too bogged down in a script that doesn't really merit such an intense analysis  Chucky finds Andy and continues to basically do what he did in the two earlier films. Lots of killing. Lots of wisecracks and that cackling laugh. Lots of the same. I did like this film more though than the second installment. First of all the director did NOT repeat the problem of an overly long seemingly neverending death scene. The military school makes for an interesting backdrop to the story. The young actors do credible jobs. There are some interesting  quirky characterizations from the rest of the cast with Andrew Robinson stealing his scenes as a barber who really enjoys shaving the heads of the cadets. In fact I loved the little ponytails hung on the walls of his salon. A neat little addition. The story is nothing special though and the film is very formulaic. It is entertaining if you  like me  have limited expectations.".

Aside from one scene where Catherine Hicks checks the doll for batteries the film failed to scare not to mention having a few plot twists that were just plain bad. Nevertheless the film was a modest hit which led to two sequels which were actually better.Six years after his last confrontation with Chucky the possessed doll Andy Barclay has been sent to a military school. At the same time the Play Pals toy factory has restarted its manufacturing of Good Guy dolls. Chucky's soul possesses the first one built  after killing the Play Pals' president mails himself to the military school. Andy must now try once again to defeat Chucky before he can regain human form by possessing one of the cadets.Like I already said the series has lost its spark which is actually a moot point since the creativity that made the first two films was running on used petrol fumes. Child's Play 3 has the exact same plot as its predecessors with Andy Barclay trying once again to foil Chucky's plan to regain human form by possessing a human child although this time around Andy is no longer the target. While the original film offered a twisted commentary on the popularity of large lifelike dolls  the second delved into the life of a foster family this third film looks into life at a military school. Thus we have scenes where Justin Whalin arrives only to be thrust into a harsh life being singled out for abuse by the local sociopathic cadets. As is usual with these films it's the Chucky show. This time the doll kills his victims in ways that would make Freddy Krueger laugh. The first scene where the president of the toy company is attacked by remote controlled toys slipping on some marbles  finally strangled with a yoyo string is quite creepy at first then turns routine how does Chucky learn computer skills?. The other kills are milked for all the dark humour they contain  Chucky crushes one victim in a garbage truck slits the throat of the demented hairdresser  kills the school's leader by scaring him to death saying You've got to be  kidding me as he watches the man die of a heart attack. Plus the way Chucky sabotages the war games by switching the paintball rounds of the rifles with real bullets is positively original.The acting is decent enough for these sorts of films with Justin Whalin playing the outsider with a troubled past quite effectively. Perrey Reeves  Dean Jacobson provide adequate support while Brad Dourif the only actor to star in all three films is hilarious as Chucky once again proving to be the star of the show.".

Revell fortunately returned for Bride of Chucky.Child's Play 3 is no more than a competent sequel. Writer Don Mancini said he wasn't even ready to do a 3rd movie but Universal forced him to before the second was even released.

That's enough to make this movie more serious than the previous two.And that's the feeling that you get. Seriousness. Andy not only has to deal with Chucky but also with the army guys in a very unkind way. There's a feeling of pressure and anguish throughout the whole movie and there are no funny moments.

I did hear that Alex had no desire to appear in this movie which is probably why it was set up the way it was.

CEO Mr Sullivan Peter Haskell decides to get rid of the memory of Andy Barclay and his killer Good Guy Doll story to bring back the Good Guy doll on the market for the 90s at his company thus it's reopened and he receives a Good Guy doll that is actually Chucky brought back to life as now the little terror discovers that Andy is at a military school. Andy Justin Whalin is 16 years old as he wants to get on with his life to forget those fantasies of killer dolls as his mother is still in psychiatric care even fail to cope to live in foster homes and the place is ran by Colonel Cochran Dakin Matthews who is in charge of the place. He befriends new friends like Tyler Jeremy Slyvers Whitehurst Dean Jacobson and Kirstin Desilla Perrey Reeves whom he develops romantic feelings for. Chucky has used the company's computer records to find where Andy is at and sends himself to Kent Military School yet meets Tyler as Chucky finds out he has a new body and hasn't told anyone his secret and makes friends with Tyler as he wants to use him for a vessel to take over his soul. Andy must hunt down the little killer from taking over the boy's body.A weak sequel to the first 2 movies and considered inferior to the second movie but very enjoyable and the last truly good Chucky movie worth a damn. After the success of Child's Play 2 Universal greenlighted a third movie and was rushed into production for a summer of 1991 release and Don Mancini wrote the script in a week. Jack Bender who did TV movies made a theatrical release here and his direction is fairly OK at best and Mancini's writing is OK but has some good lines like when Chucky says Don't F with the chuck or Presto Your Dead when he murders the barber. Andrew Robinson from HellraiserDirty Harry costars in this one as Sgt. Botnik and Travis Fine as Lt. Shelton as this sequel is not as bad as some people made out to be. But for me personally i think it's the last Child's Play movie worth a damn before it went all down hill no thanks to Mancini. The film did became notorious in the UK for 2 murders it supposedly spawned like the murder of 3 year old James Buldger back in 1993 by two 11 year olds whom the Tabloids blamed this movie on the murder but neither saw the film before the murder and saw it only afterwards. There was also the Suzanne Capper case which 23 were involved by demented killers who tortured her listening to recordings of Hi i'm chucky wanna play before burning her alive and killing her. That's awful what happened but you can't blame the movies for those insane psychopaths who committed such horrible murders like Scream says Movies don't make psychos.The puppetryanimatronics by Kevin Yagher feels a step down from the previous film and is OK at best yet the gore effects are quite good especially when Chucky gets half his face sliced off to look like Pizza with no cheese to the death of the barber. Originally Jonathan Brandis was suppose to play teen Andy yet the role won to Justin Whalin who did a good job playing the character well. There is a fun climax set in a theme park which is quite thrilling i gotta say.".

	schema:reviewBody "Released just 9 months after it's predecessor Child's Play 3 opened to very abysmal reviews. Understandable because this is definitely the weakest one in the series but it is one of those movies that I like but everyone else hates. Does this movie have flaws? Yes but that doesn't mean that you still can't enjoy it.The film starts as Chucky voiced by Brad Dourif is rebuilt againwhich you think they would've learned after the first two movies 8 years after the events of Child's Play 2. He is raging mad and wants to find where Andy is. It turns out Andy now played by Justin Whalin has been sent to a military camp to straighten him out after his killer doll story. One night Chucky comes across a young boy named Tyler played by Jeremy Sylvers and Chucky decides that instead of chasing after Andy again he can transfer his soul into Tyler who is friends with Andy.The problems with the film. The first being the doll effects which I consider to be the weakest of the franchise and thankfully they were vastly improved in 1998's Bride Of Chucky. The second being the acting which feels very stale with Whalin. He doesn't have the charm that Alex Vincent had in the first two movies. The third and final one being the tone of the film. This film is very dark compared to the first two. Now the second film went about 10 darker than the first but knew it's limits. Here they go full force especially the last 15 minutes which take place in a carnival. This film was the sort of start of making the films more of a horror comedy.The good of the movie. The first being the voice acting of Brad Dourif which I have praised before and I am going to praise again. he is just that good however he is best in Child's Play and Bride Of Chucky. He is the perfect one for the role and should be nominated for an award for his voice work which I am surprised has not happened... yet.The next are two things. The first is that the doll effects sometimes can manage to be creepy and scary when a scene calls for it. Next we have the army setting which I find very clever that Chucky is running around an army camp and I really do like that his main focus is not his main priority which is good at least for me because if Andy was portrayed by Alex Vincent again I would be saying the exact opposite.Lastly we have the climax which is like the last film is the best part of the film. The climax takes place inside of a carnival specifically in a haunted house ride which actually takes apart of Chucky's skin and has a very bloody look on his face. Effective yes. Realistic no.The Final Verdict for the film Child's Play 3 is 3 Stars Out Of 4. The film has good effects great voice work and a cool climax but is held back by stale acting by Whalin and too much of a dark tone. I suggest watching it because you can have some fun with it.Rated R For Horror Violence And Language.1hr 30min90min.17 uses of the Fword.Cost 13000000.Box Office 20560255.IMDb Rating 4.610.Rotten Tomatoes Rating 23 Rotten.My Rating ".

	schema:headline " Masterpiece to Crap Just Like That";
	schema:reviewBody "Its almost unbelievable that a franchise can go from two close to masterpiece Horror films to one film that just spits on the entire franchise. Childs Play 3 is the obvious third installment to the doll killer franchise and its undoubtedly the worst to come. Its a poorly acted odd Horror film that you consider yourself lucky to see because of the awful darkness of the movie itself. Screenwriter Don Mancini confessed to completely and totally running out of ideas for the series which is no doubt why after this one there was a seven year gap until Bride of Chucky and then a six year gap until Seed of Chucky was made. Seems like ideas for killer dolls that need to find a human soul were hard to come by.This is a weird one to explain The Good Guy Doll Factory has reopened and reassembled Chucky which still has the soul of Charles Lee Ray in the doll. Andy is now 16 and has been shipped off to Military School and apparently has been in more foster homes then just the Simpsons' and has failed in all of them. Ronald Tyler a younger recruit takes the Chucky doll to Andy but in a failed attempt to get possessed goes on a killing spree again to find Andy and try to transfer his soul. Its the same movie in a different environment but just unrealistically stupid.What bothers me is two things. One its so dark in this carnival military camp trying to see whats going on is harder than understanding it. Most of the time Im clueless and just assuming what is happening. Another thing is we get no mention to what happens to Kyle Andy's foster sister in CP2. We get zero information. At least in the second one they say that the mother is in psychiatric therapy. So overall this is shockingly the worst Horror film I've ever seen. There's no adrenaline pumping scenes and everything is just dark quite literally. This still amazes me that a franchise can go from excellent to awful in just three movies. If a franchise makes it the third film they should put a lot of effort into it not just throw some back ass movie together with almost no sense made. Maybe around 1991 they were learning movie sequels attract a lot of money no matter the plot. At very least we get Brad Dourif's excellent voice talents.Starring Justin Whalin Perrey Reeves Jeremy Sylvers Peter Haskell Dakin Matthews Travis Fine Dean Jacobson and Brad Dourif. Directed by Jack Bender.".

	schema:reviewBody "I loved this film for its artistic beauty its romance rooted in realism for its characters and story and for the lovely acting and cinematography. After sculpting a perfect elephant relief in a panel of one of the colonnades of Pisa Cathedral which their family is restoring twin brothers Andrea and Nicola temperamental and emotional but talented and artistic stonemasons find themselves without jobs as the restoration project finishes their father retires and they fall out with their five brothers. They decide to try their luck in America and after a descending series of menial jobs they throw caution to the winds and join a group of Italian artists travelling to Hollywood to create scenery for the infant film industry. Luck now favouring the brave they end up working for D.W. Griffiths the maestro of early Hollywood albeit in dogsbody occupation. However their burgeoning relationships with two likely girl film extras Mabel and Edna make their lives more interesting and then hearing Griffiths wants elephants for the stageset of his new project 'Intolerance' they create a brilliant elephant effigy. This is burnt by a jealous bureaucrat in Griffith's employ but fortunately they and friends had filmed the elephant and found an opportunity to show the film to Griffiths who commissions the brothers to make him 8 elephants for his film. Fortune shines on the brothers as they ascend into prime popularity with Griffiths for their marvellous elephants marry the two lovely girls and look set for a great future. Unfortunately Edna dies in childbirth and Nicola heartbroken decides to join the Italian forces fighting the Germans in the First World War. Fortune's wheel turns full circle as Andrea also joins the army and finds his brother dying on the battlefield. Nicola had taken up the army cameraman's job and the brothers film themselves before dying in the hope that someone will find the film and take it back to show their sons.The film works as a fairy tale a combination of romance comedy and tragedy. On one level the deceptively simplistic story is a metaphor for the destruction of war fictionalising the making of with actual footage from Griffith's antiwar film 'Intolerance' and the death of the brothers at the end in a surrealistic montage of battle with an image of an Italian church similar to Pisa Cathedral in the background. But on a parallel level the film is a delightful story of two imaginative and ambitious brothers who achieve an impossible dream. The vivid settings are historically interesting from the restoration of one of Italy's finest cathedrals to the depiction of early Hollywood. Edna's death and the death of the brothers in the war add tragic grandeur to the film's Italian operatic style. The wonderful acting especially from the two brothers but which includes an excellent performance from Charles Dance as D.W. Griffiths and a lovely early performance by the beautiful Greta Scacchi contribute to the 'Commedia del Arte' bravura of the whole film scheme. Metaphors abound and the directors' attention to detail the double wedding of Andrea and Nicola to Edna and Mabel is just one example makes this a meticulous piece of film craftsmanship echoing the craftsmanship of the stonemasons which the whole film is about. The final scene the brothers filming themselves emphasises the power of film and celebrates the art of filmmaking as one of the world forms of artistic expression up there with painting sculpture and music.The film is one of my favourites and I was delighted to see the fictional story of the creation of elephants for Griffiths' famous film recreated in the giant elephant replicas in the new Mall in front of the Kodak Theatre where the Oscars ceremony is held in Hollywood. Viewers may also like to note that the backdrop for the title sequence is part of the Pisa Cathedral complex the wall of the burial ground. One could continue to comment on the layers of metaphor filmic reference and artistic quality of 'Good Morning Babylon' but I will end by simply thoroughly recommending this film. It is a period piece and deserves to be remembered.".

Given their pedigree as artisans it's little surprise that they are attracted to the gaudy and slightly wacky Hollywood in its infancy.Enduring but escaping crude bigotry wops is the strongest epithet in the film the brothers get to meet and be hired by D.W.

That was and is the great Intolerance and brief scenes from this masterpiece of the early days of cinema are provided. If you haven't seen Intolerance shame on you!An unfortunate but not uncommon for the time domestic problem clouds the relationship of the brothers who then separate in anger winding up later in The Great War on opposite sides.  Somehow they fortuitously meet on the battlefield and resolve their differences in a denouement that challenges the warhating viewer not to laugh.Intentionally or not the war scenes are a caricature of early cinema's depiction of combat.  Audiences that are used to the dynamic protorealism of say Saving Private Ryan where real amputees were used as extras so all got the point that having a leg blown off hurts may find these scenes very plasticized.  But we didn't live in the age of D.W. Griffith.Well worth renting.  The score is interesting halfway between Puccini and an organ grinder's playlist.610.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a quite open metaphor for the attitude of many leftists in Italy and elsewhere in the 70s. It's about Fulvio a man who left his house and loving and wealthy family and also an illegitimate son in order to free the poor and oppressed and to become a fulltime revolutionary agitator and who  after only 3 months in prison and the suicide of a comrade  decides that it was all a mistake and that he should go back and live with his brother and sister in their villa where he is pampered by old mamalike servants seeking happiness in family life. But his past thwarts his project first when his exlover an emancipated passionate Hungarian revolutionary woman beautifully played by Lea Massari appears at his home mocking his family and shocking the servants with her manners then when the whole bunch of revolutionary Utopian friends of Fulvio tries to involve him in a crazy plan initiate a revolution in poor backward oppressed Southern Italy. Fulvio gets involved in the plot against his will. The more he tries to get away from his former comrades the more  ironically  he gets deep into the plot till the sad grotesque end. Taking place during the Restoration which followed the fall of Napoleon and seemed to mark the defeat of ideals created by the French Revolution the movie is a bitter reflection about the fact that in everyone even in the most revolutionary and idealist persons there is a part which is counterrevolutionary and antiidealistic. Fulvio is willing to betray his friends and comrades in order to live a quiet life having lost every interest and hope in fighting injustice and oppression. It's a movie about political engagement and the following delusion about a suicidal courage in pursuing ideas which are absolutely unrealizable and the cowardice of those who just want to enjoy life as long as they are on the sunny side of it... about individualism and blind dedication to THE cause and to the partygrouprevolution etc. It's a sad movie in which the main figures oscillates between appeasement with the existing injustice Fulvio's private inner Restoration and empty finally pointless revolutionary beau gestes like his comrades. We follow Fulvio and his friend from a lovely rich Lombardy with its villas lakes hills in which men and Nature seem to harmonize perfectly to a bare sun battered countryside of Southern Italy with its extremely poor towns in which the unnaturally red jackets of the revolutionaries stand out as something which do not belong there at all. When still in Lombardy Fulvio seeks villas and palaces but his friends force him always to go to abandoned places ruins warehouses. They offer him nocturnal bivouacs instead of well furnished dining rooms like the one he brings once his illegitimate son. But they act in the name of an ideal he in the name of his individual happiness. Is a conciliation of both motives possible? The ending of the movie seems to give a deluded cynical answer to the question.".

	schema:reviewBody "Allonsanfan is one of those rare foreign language films about which dedicated viewers know a lot without having gotten a chance to see it. It is rather unfortunate that this classic film directed by Taviani brothers has neither been shown repeatedly on TV screens around the world nor its DVD is as easily available as that of Braveheart.If we look closely at the productivity of Italian cinemawe will come to know that there is only an Italian film La nuit de Varennes directed by Ettore Scola which similar to it in terms of style and content.Allonsanfan is quite similar to a Hungarian auteur Miklos Jancso's film but with no nudityno brutality and no humiliation.At the core of this film is a detailed description of the tough life of a determined revolutionary.Sometimes he is trusted by his followers sometimes he is not.Family ties are of great importance for him as any other aristocrat.The only unusual aspect of his behavior is that he does not know how to maintain them.Betrayal is a repetitive element of this film as there are plenty of disloyal souls linked to our strongman.This is the reason why he fails to remain neither a true revolutionary nor a true aristocrat.The portrayal of incest is rather out of place for this film.It loses its credibility because of prevalence of dramatic situations.It is true that Allonsanfan is visually exquisite but it is somewhat difficult to follow the film's flow as not much of historical context is provided to the viewer.One can say that events happen of their own accord.It is only after reaching the halfway mark that viewers comprehend that Allonsanfan is one of the this film's important protagonists.A positive thing about it is its star cast with remarkable performances by Marcello Mastroianni.A must see for all the admirers of auteur cinema especially of Vittorio and Paulo Taviani.".

It is rather unfortunate that this classic film directed by Taviani brothers has neither been shown repeatedly on TV screens around the world nor its DVD is as easily available as that of Braveheart.If we look closely at the productivity of Italian cinemawe will come to know that there is only an Italian film La nuit de Varennes directed by Ettore Scola which similar to it in terms of style and content.Allonsanfan is quite similar to a Hungarian auteur Miklos Jancso's film but with no nudityno brutality and no humiliation.At the core of this film is a detailed description of the tough life of a determined revolutionary.Sometimes he is trusted by his followers sometimes he is not.Family ties are of great importance for him as any other aristocrat.The only unusual aspect of his behavior is that he does not know how to maintain them.Betrayal is a repetitive element of this film as there are plenty of disloyal souls linked to our strongman.This is the reason why he fails to remain neither a true revolutionary nor a true aristocrat.The portrayal of incest is rather out of place for this film.It loses its credibility because of prevalence of dramatic situations.It is true that Allonsanfan is visually exquisite but it is somewhat difficult to follow the film's flow as not much of historical context is provided to the viewer.One can say that events happen of their own accord.It is only after reaching the halfway mark that viewers comprehend that Allonsanfan is one of the this film's important protagonists.A positive thing about it is its star cast with remarkable performances by Marcello Mastroianni.A must see for all the admirers of auteur cinema especially of Vittorio and Paulo Taviani.";

On the whole I am not the biggest fan of Italian films and Marcello Mastrianni I always feel is his and miss. But actually Ansofan isn't as bad a film that many people perceive it to be although it essentially goes all over the place the film is somewhat entertaining. Mastrianni is certainly OUT there playing a member of a criminal gang. He wants to go straight but members of his gang keep showing up every time he's trying to go straight. He also has a son to think about! And his love life! Nevertheless the gang members seem to follow him like a bad rash even when he tries to kill the annoying pests. What this all is supposed to mean is rather confusing and the ending is pretty predictable if you've been paying attention to this lovehate relationship thing Mastrionni has got going. Not entirely boring but then again not entirely comprehensible either.".

	schema:reviewBody "Marcello Mastroianni's story is never simple. He is released from prison in hopes that he would lead authorities to the underground resistance but instead he finds himself torn between wealthy and a family he once had and the opportunity to help his brethren save others from the dreaded cholera. It is a tough choice and in the end Mastroianni as in previous films has done a great job of building tension within his character. The moral dilemma he is faced with is a tough one kill those he was once involved with  in essence betray them or forever be chased by his past sins. He chooses the latter and uses trickery and trust to break this small group of bandits. Allonsanfan can be spliced into three different distinct films each with amazing imagery but lacking the development needed to really bring the audience further into the film. The first is with Mastroianni heading home overcoming sickness finding his girlfriend and all the while plotting an ambush. Great scenes could have been a great moment but we know nothing about his family or girlfriend  outside of what they mutter or what the subtitles give us. We needed to see more of his interaction with these random characters. The second part involves his son good but was again cut short and strange because we knew nothing about it outside of the fact that he had a son. I can't even go further into the entire frog scene I am still trying to wrap my brain around that. The incident on the lake was another example of having a strong cinematographer but a apathetic storyteller. Finally there was the scene in the South where we see why this film is entitled Allonsanfan but by this point the excitement has died and we are just waiting for a finale.This film did involve hard work and dedication by the entire crew to make with that said I cannot just fully say that this film was a failure. There were those that worked hard on this project like the cinematographer and the amazing score by Ennio Morricone. These elements alone brought this film out of one that would make any viewer fall asleep into one worth viewing at least once. The story is where most of the trouble laid and again I cannot state that it was one of those cases where there were too many ideas and not enough time or conjoining scenes. We would begin a thought but end elsewhere in the story again see the segment with the frog. Perhaps some of it was done to try to bring sympathy to Mastroianni but it could have been done without the random acts of history  or perhaps more history. There was a moment in this film where I thought we could have used more history devoted to the story. That is what was missing from scene to scene. At times our characters were moving without a motive and history could have interjected to help the audience better see the motives and reasoning. Perhaps it was my lack of knowledge of what Italy was like at the end of Napoleon's era but more explanation could have been used do develop our bandits or the motives behind Mastroianni's deeds.On a small note if you decide to watch this film on VHS beware of the subtitles. I am very good at reading subtitles on a foreign film I hate the sound of dubbed voices but with Allonsanfan the subtitles were all over the place. There were several occasions where they were missing from conversations where one character would have a threeminute speech and the only word to come up in the subtitle would be yes or when half the words were missing from the side of the television. It was troublesome to read and watch at the same time so to get the full effect of the film I found myself turning off the sound and reading to the best of my ability. Probably lessoned the film but kept me in check with the meager characters.Overall I cannot say this was a horrible film but it won't be viewed again by yours truly. I may challenge myself to see it again on DVD if it ever is released but for now it needs to tighten up its story and used a bold marker on its characters. Mastroianni was superb in his role but nobody could keep up with him. They were all overacting overbearing boring or just plain unknown. There were other characters in this film but if you asked me to name one  well maybe Charlotte but that is it  I don't think I could. The Taviani's had some great ideas but the execution is where they lacked. There could have been more A to B to C structure with the story instead it was as if they built three separate stories and hastily glued them together. If you were forced to watch this film I think you could pull away by just seeing the end and knowing everything you missed. It is a sharp ending one wishes only that the rest of the film were that way. One viewing if you dare  if not  you are not missing anything. There are better Italian films out there.Whew this one took me back to when I watched Topol's Gallileo. Too stagy for my enjoyment.Grade  out of ".

Is the author moving his characters around the chessboard for fun so we can laugh at their foibles or is he in deadly earnest about the destructive effects of our strongest emotions? Or should we see a bit of both enjoying some of the comedy in the initial conflicts of love and duty to name just two but deeply sorry at the end over lives lost or blighted? It is a complex work of many layers too many to discuss here.A film can only show elements of the story and has to leave out much. Rightly in my view it is centred on the basic equation of the middle aged couple A and B inviting into their quiet lives the unmarried C and D. Sticking to the human trajectory that goes from innocent love through forbidden love to tragic deaths it can only hint at or has to ignore many other aspects of the novel social cultural scientific religious and philosophical. Perhaps this is why some viewers have not felt satisfied? Is there an appetite for doomed love affairs among rich people in Europe two hundred years ago?

Adelaide was shot 5 years earlier on a shoestring with breadcrumbs from the Italian State Film Funds and was directed by a Mr. Nobody. It too was inspired by a period Novel not Goethe but a 'minor' French Novelist I believe. Goethe wouldn't 'turn in his grave' over the Taviani's treatment to his masterpiece... Yes he WOULD turn over and go to sleep maybe muttering a German phrase of disgust. Darlings of the institutions it appears the Taviani's will continue to find funds for such lame efforts in the coffers of Italy's political parties. The film is a 'rip off'. It's French protagonist usually riveting is strangely absent a very pale copy of Assumpta Serna Adelaide's mesmerizing ageing beauty with a caustic brilliance. Gaudino's small jewel of a film is beautifully shot well acted and respects the 'feel' of the epoch.

It is an infinite debt which can only be discharged through all eternity. Carlotta represents Goethe's point of view.I would also like to note that this is not Huppert at her best.

	schema:reviewBody "'Eeny meeny miny moe is a children's counting rhyme used to select it for games and similar purposes.' WritersDirectors Paolo and Vittorio Taviani have reduced Johann Wolfgang Goethe novel Die Wahlverwandtschaften into a somewhat stilted pseudointellectual game and renamed it Le affinit elettive or Elective Affinities. The result if a stodgy and at times only semiinteresting twist on love affairs gone awry. In the 18th century Countess Carlotta Isabelle Hupert encounters her love of 20 years ago one Baron Eduardo JeanHugues Anglade. They reform their affinity and marry. One year later we find them happily at home in the Baron's Tuscan villa a home the Baron adores for its geometric beauty science and Carlotta loves for its artistic aura art. Eduardo wants to complete the buildings on their vast land holdings in Tuscany and convinces Carlotta to allow him to invite a famous architect Ottone Fabrizio Bentivoglio long a cherished childhood friend to move in with them to complete the architectural possibilities the site offers. Carlotta has premonitions of bad omens and decides to invite her somewhat neurotic asocial goddaughter Ottilia Marie Gillain to move in with the growing household and to be company to Ottone. After endless talking sprees there develops an affinity between Carlotta and Ottone and an equally strong one between Eduardo and Ottilia. Clandestine encounters become public when Carlotta discovers she is pregnant the baby is born looking very much like Ottone! and a tragedy occurs when Ottilia is caring for the baby the baby drowns. Ottilia return to her neurotic shell of isolation the affairs are discovered and tragedies continue. There really is no ending to the story it just stops. For those of us who admire the consistently fine work by actress Isabelle Huppert this film is a draw. But sadly even the gifted Huppert with her French spoken lines along with the other two French actors annoyingly dubbed into Italian is unable to make us care for anything or anyone in this experiment of love. But perhaps that is more the fault of Goethe 'Die Wahlverwandtschaften also translated under the title Kindred by Choice is the third novel by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe published in 1809. The title is taken from a scientific term once used to describe the tendency of chemical species to combine with certain substances or species in preference to others. The novel is based on the metaphor of human passions being governed or regulated by the laws of chemical affinity and examines whether or not the science and laws of chemistry undermine or uphold the institution of marriage as well as other human social relations.' Like the metaphor on which this film is based this is a laboratory experiment rather than a dissection of love gone awry. Grady Harp".

He made a living playing these type of roles. Slezak was the Shakespeare Biblequoting detective and Howard was a real hoot as an old lady trying to track down the killer of her young friend.This is film noir in all its moodiness and hard attitude.

Slezak was the Shakespeare Biblequoting detective and Howard was a real hoot as an old lady trying to track down the killer of her young friend.This is film noir in all its moodiness and hard attitude. If you find it a bit slow please give it a second chance. These characters grow on you!";

The story is hers luckily because she's ultimately admirable whatever her moral milkiness.The whole thing starts with a shock and then with a disturbing calm where all the pieces refuse to fit together. The lead male Sam played by Lawrence Tierney is a ruthless violent man with all the elegance and brains of a halftrack. He's a perfect problem for Helen and the movie only compounds and coils around a plot that never falters whatever its complications. The detective Walter Slezak is too perfect in his delicate selfishness and good old Elisha Cook Jr. is a surprising and also perfect good guy with too much tolerance due to his large heart.It isn't a surprise that a good script and some talented actors are put together with such smart fast panache by a young Robert Wise more famous for little tidbits like West Side Story and Sound of Music. It ends up taking some astonishing twists and some liberties with location shooting that are fabulous for 1947. After all is said in done we are back with Claire Trevor's performance which is large and nuanced and very convincing. It's a good thing she has a lot to work with. A great film. Even the third time.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was delighted when I saw that Quentin Tarantino had given a starring role in his debut film Reservoir Dogs to Lawrence Tierney. I had read somewhere a year or two prior to its release that he had been finding it hard to get roles that invariably he was involved in barroom brawls and  well that he was difficult. Of course the role didn't require any great acting ability and it couldn't be said that the big lug had grown old gracefully but I got the impression that it was in recognition of his services to cult filmdom that he was being rewarded by the new kid on the block.I first saw Born To Kill in the late 80's on one of those TV channels dedicated to old black and white movies and I was immediately wowed. It was my first sight of Lawrence Tierney and both in his presence and the enthusiasm he brought to his role he certainly made a huge impression. You could never accuse him of being a great actor but he had the perfect bad guy presence he had the physique and tough look about him that neither Bogart nor the diminutive Raft could touch and while his features were certainly handsome enough for Hollywood his smile was too disarming to make him a romantic lead it reminded me nothing so much as a shark at feeding time. And this role was perfect for him ruthless amoral his character Sam Wild was like a steamroller who mowed down anybody girlfriends men friends wives that stood in his way or upset him. It may well have been the closest to the big leagues that he got and for me its the best thing he's ever done and under Wise's economic direction the film could certainly compare favourably with Reservoir Dogs.The film sits well with all those minor noir classics  the late 40's and early 50's with apparent ease Wise's own The SetUp Anthony Mann's Raw Deal and the TMen Kiss Of Death and Ray's masterly debut They Live By Night.It's not specified just who the title refers to but it could apply equally and aptly to both Tierney's and his peerless costar's Claire Trevor for me the Queen of the noir femme fatalescharacters.In the UK it is titled Lady OF Deceit but in my opinion it does Tierney a disservice by apparently ignoring his contribution to the mayhem.The story is basically a simple one Tierney is an exboxer who is prone to violent fits of jealousy which erupts with fatal consequences when he spots a girl friend out with another man. Claire Trevor's character discovers the bodies but finds herself attracted to the excitement and danger which she sees Tierney providing for her while recognising his flaws.He uses Trevor to marry into family money while at the same time needing the thrill of an adulterous affair with her. Of course that could never work!.Perversely I found myself cheering for Tierney and Trevor and hoping that they would find true love maybe it's because the other loves are such drips but that could never be in noir. In addition to the stars it boasts wonderful performances by notorious scenestealers Elisha Cook Jr. and Walter Slezak while Esther Howard is a delight as a boarding house owner who realises that a beach is not always the safest place at night.Although Robert Wise acquitted himself well in his later big budget films its in films such as this the aforementioned SetUp and his Val Lewton horror classics that he showed himself to be an economic effective and underrated director. Not in the Howard Hawks league for versatlityfor sure but he always told a good story well which more highlytouted directors often found beyond them. While not quite major league noir its one I turn to regularly and it never disappoints".

	schema:reviewBody "Born To Kill is another of the superior film noires from RKO. This one was intended as an A list film and is different in that the traditional noire femme fatale meets her match in an equally ambitious and deadly male.The film opens in Reno Nevada as Helen Brent Claire Trevor is granted a divorce from an unnamed husband. She goes to the rooming house where she has stayed to pay her bill before returning to her home in San Francisco. At the rooming house we meet the boozy landlady Mrs. Kraft Esther Howard and her friend Laurey Palmer Isabell Jewell. Laurey tells the two that she is going to step out with another man to make her boyfriend jealous.That evening at a casino we are introduced to Sam Wilde as he plays craps. Helen and Sam lock eyes across the table. Just then Laurey and her date Danny Tony Barrett stop by the table. It turns out that Wilde is Laurey's boyfriend who turns out to be insanely jealous. Later as Laurey and Danny return home they are brutally murdered by Wilde. Helen discovers the bodies later but does not call the police. It is here that we realize that she may have her own agenda.As Helen goes to the train station to return home she is met by Wilde who himself is going to San Francisco. They talk on the train and Helen casually agrees to see Sam thinking that it will never happen when they get to San Francisco. Sam unexpectedly turns up at Helen's home where she lives with her foster sister Georgia Staples Audrey Long a newspaper heiress. We also learn that Helen is engaged to rich socialite Fred Grover Philip Terry. Learning of Georgia's wealth Sam woos and weds her. You see both Sam and Helen have high ambitions.Back in Reno Mrs. Kraft hires a sleazy blackmailing private detective named Albert Arnett to find out who killed her friend Laurey Palmer. This is when the double crosses begin. As Arnett gets closer to the truth both Sam and Helen get nervous. Sam's friend Marty Mart Waterman arrives in San Francisco and is invited to move in by Helen. Marty trees to murder Mrs Kraft but is himself killed. And then Helen and Sam..............................The sexual tension between Sam and Helen is evident although both are after money and power which they cannot give each other. The Production Code limited what could be shown so we have to imagine what is really going on. Also there is a gentle hint of homosexuality between Sam and Marty who have lived together for five years suggesting prison. There is one scene where both are on the one bed in their room. And Marty's devotion to Sam is a little more than just friendship I think.Director Robert Wise who learned his craft under the legendary Val Lewton gives the picture the dark shadows and atmosphere that make the drama more compelling. Lawrence Tierney gives an excellent performance as the hair trigger tempered Wilde. This film was supposed to be his jump to A features but due to his real life escapades he never really made it. Claire Trevor is cold evil and conniving as the femme fatale of the piece. Esther Howard almost steals the picture as the beer swizzling old landlady.Also watch for Ellen Corby and Martha Hyer in bits as maids and Tommy Noonan as a bellhop playing cards with Mrs. Kraft.One of the best of the film noires.".

The only remotely sympathetic characters are a pair of dupes and an old drunk everyone who's got anything on the ball is corrupt and ruthless.Sam Wilde Lawrence Tierney is a homme fatal as attractive yet deadly to women as any of a dozen femmes fatal in other films are to men. Unable to resist his glowering masculine wiles is Helen Brent Claire Trevor who is nearly as blackhearted as he is. All the other characters circle around them like moths around a flame. As is to be expected money murder and lust all have their parts to play.To be honest Lawrence Tierney's performance is fairly one dimensional but it is a hell of a dimension. He menaces scowls and swaggers through the picture always ready to attack like an alley cat that's found it's way inside. His character's bluntness is played for maximum effect wisely since Tierney is no Bogart. He does manage some good direct lines in response to Trevor's Oh I wouldn't say that... he tightens his lips and spits out No. You wouldn't say it but that's how it is. With Tierney turning up the heat it's up to Claire Trevor to sweat. She rides the moral seesaw much like Fred MacMurray reacting to Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity. Even without the benefit of a voiceover she pulls it off quite well convincingly playing a woman caught between her safe malleable and rich fiance and the exciting but untamed Wilde.There are three strong supporting performances. Elisha Cook Jr. is Marty Waterman Sam's friend who does his best to keep the lid on the pot and to deliver most of the lines in their shared scenes. Esther Howard is Mrs. Kraft a boardinghouse owner who is important to the plot. Especially good is Walter Slezak as the genteel detective Arnett.Born to Kill does have a few flaws the pacing is somewhat questionable and several of the important characters are either missing or blindingly stupid throughout most of the picture. But on the whole Tierney Trevor and the others deliver and there's enough tension to keep things interesting. The film is based on a novel 'Deadlier Than the Male' but given Tierney's looks and personality that title doesn't truly seem to fit the movie it's a rare case of the man luring the woman to her doom.".

	schema:headline " Perverse Impulses  Deadly Consequences";
	schema:reviewBody "Born To Kill is a disturbing drama in which greed jealousy lust corruption and murder all feature very prominently. Its main character is a psychopathic killer with no redeeming qualities and the story shows how his presence affects the people around him and also how he responds to their actions. Despite its rather grim subject matter this is an absolutely fascinating movie in which the perverse natures of some of its characters are a constant source of interest and life threatening danger.In a Reno boarding house Laury Palmer Isabel Jewell explains to the landlady Mrs Kraft Esther Howard and a resident called Helen Brent Claire Trevor how she likes to keep two boyfriends at a time because it keeps the one that she's really interested in jealous and this she believes makes his feelings for her more intense. She also remarks that her new boyfriend is the quiet sort and yet you get the feeling that if you stepped out of line he'd kick your teeth down your throat. She's obviously favourably impressed by this quality and Mrs Kraft agrees as she responds I never knew a man like that. My two husbands were just turnips.Sadly Laury's practice soon leads to trouble when one of her boyfriends Sam Wild Lawrence Tierney flies into a jealous rage when he sees her and another guy together. His fury drives him to murder both of them in the boarding house and a little while later Helen who'd been visiting Reno to finalise her divorce discovers the bodies in the kitchen but decides not to tell anyone. Having completed what she needed to do regarding her divorce Helen then goes to the train station to go home to San Francisco where she lives in her wealthy foster sister's house. On the platform she meets Sam who's making the same journey and the couple get talking and she finds herself attracted to him.Helen's a golddigger who's engaged to a wealthy businessman called Fred Phillip Terry and feels resentful about her foster sister's wealth and the fact that she's dependent on Georgia Audrey Long. Sam visits Helen in San Francisco and when it becomes clear that she's determined to marry Fred he concentrates on getting to know Georgia who he subsequently marries for her money.The alcoholic Mrs Kraft is determined to bring her friend's murderer to justice and so hires an eccentric and seriously corrupt private detective called Albert Arnett Walter Slezak to investigate. He follows Sam's loyal friend Marty Elisha Cook Jnr who eventually leads him to Georgia's residence.Sam's a physically imposing character with an air of menace about him and a man who'd like to fix it so's I can spit in anybody's eye. In Helen's eyes he's not a turnip he's someone who just takes what he wants and doesn't let anybody prevent him from doing so. These qualities fuel her desire for him but also disturb her because she realises that her impulses come from a dark place. Sam recognises that her roots come from the same place as his and their passion for each other becomes irresistible. Their dangerous relationship continues and there are further murders before the story reaches its violent climax.Born To Kill boasts some wellwritten dialogue which is mostly very direct and often funny. There are numerous twists and more than a few coincidences but it's the characters that provide the greatest interest. Helen is like a walking storm of emotions as she resents the fact that her foster sister was the sole beneficiary of the family fortune feels jealous when Sam and Georgia get married and is also driven by the greed which takes her into the arms of Fred. The power of her attraction to Sam is so strong that she can't resist him even though she recognises the dreadful dangers involved.Sam is more straightforward in the sense that he's a brutal man with a ferocious temper who says that he doesn't let anybody cut in on him. His confidence and singleminded determination make him attractive to women but his readiness to kill anyone who gets in his way and his complete lack of guilt make him incredibly threatening.Sam and Helen are two people with perverse impulses which ultimately drive them into self destructive actions and the way in which they're portrayed by Lawrence Tierney and Claire Trevor is both convincing and intriguing to watch.".

	schema:headline " Neither of us looks like a scoundrel";
	schema:reviewBody "Many of our finest pictures revolve around a single captivating performance and this is especially true of Bpictures which can less afford to rely on pyrotechnics. In the case of Born to Kill a dark little drama from RKO all eyes are on Lawrence Tierney. You know Lawrence Tierney  he is the bald mountainsized mob boss from Reservoir Dogs. Here fortyfive years earlier he is thinner and has hair but he is nevertheless just as menacing.The director of Born to Kill was Robert Wise. Wise cut his directorial teeth at Val Lewton's horror Bunit and although his only fulllength horror for Lewton The Body Snatchers was not brilliant he still carried with him much of the atmospheric technique that characterised Lewton films. Simple things like an open doorway in the background of the shot or placing the camera at waist height often more effective than low angles convey to us a sense of unease. And what is so great about Wise's formal style is that it is always subtle  he never calls attention to any shot but if you pay close attention his craftsmanship is on display. For this reason Wise is rarely remembered as a great director although he did leave a legacy of many great films behind him.Among Wise's greatest assets was his ability to define character and bring out the best in performance through space and framing and this brings us back to Mr Tierney. Tierney was not the best at vocal delivery but he had amazing presence. I sometimes think Born to Kill would have been even better if they had stripped out all his dialogue and just told him to look mean for ninety minutes. Take his opening scene at the casino there is no dialogue and in fact he barely moves. Wise cleverly emphasises Tierney's stillness by having a lot of bustle going on behind him. This wordless scene establishes Tierney's character better than any expository dialogue could and gives the brutality of his next appearance all the more impact.But Wise was not just a director who focused on looks and technique. He had previously been an editor and conscious of his lack of firsthand experience with a cast went to lengths to learn about acting and coaching. Apparently Wise often encouraged his actors to slow down their performances allowing time to bring out character and emotional weight. Sometimes this leisurely pacing would be lost in the editing of the cheap quickies he was making around this time but here and there you see it. Despite Tierney being at the centre of things he is not the only member of the cast to shine. Claire Trevor manages something very tricky  she convincingly plays a bad actress when her character unconvincingly acts nice. Walter Slezak  a supporting player who could successfully tread that line between character actor exaggeration and naturalistic depth  is perfect as a sleazy detective. Elisha Cook Jr. who is almost as much part of film noir furniture as Venetian blinds gives one of his more believable performances. Philip Terry on the other hand is a little wooden and Esther Howard is a little overstated but you can't always have a full flush of aces.Another weak link is Paul Sawtell's backing score which is at best mediocre and at worst inappropriate. He appears to have misunderstood the elements of the story for example playing sad romantic music when Claire Trevor's fianc walks out on her. Anyone who has been paying attention should realise her character and their relationship don't merit that  especially in a picture as cold and cynical as this.All in all though Born to Kill is a treat. It's probably Robert Wise's first really accomplished film and is actually better than many of his later Apictures. The script considering it's for a Bpicture adapted from a pulp novel is unusually intelligent and full of nifty dialogue. There are plenty of great little touches which may be from the script or ideas of Wise or the actors themselves such as Slezak carefully placing his halfsmoked cigarette between two bricks before entering a building. And you get to enjoy Lawrence Tierney when he was still handsome enough to be kissed albeit with his eyes scarily open and still lean enough to swing a blunt instrument. This picture is well worth discovering.".

Walter Slezak Albert Arnett followed him around and quoted from the Bible and at the same time was a crook himself.  Walter Slezak was an unappreciated great actor who gave a great performance in Wonderful Life '64 and unfortunately took his own life.  Claire Trevor Helen Brent Key Largo '48 could not make up her mind between lovers but deep down loved and identified with Sam Wilde.  Elisha Cook Jr. Marty Waterman I Wake Up Screaming '41  was Sam Wilde's henchman who did all of his dirty work and had a great deal of trouble on the sand dunes with an old lady.   In 1967 I ran into Lawrence Tierney in a bar on Broadway NYC and bought him a beer he was a construction worker at the time with a hard hat and was a great down to earth guy however you had to weigh your words with him.  Lawrence Tierney performed the best Dillinger film that ever came out of Hollywood this film is a great classic which will  be seen for many generations to view and enjoy!".

His choice in friends though  the Laurence Tierney character specifically  leaves a lot to be desired.Cook's character is quite well drawn. Tierney's is sketchy. The marriage of an heiress to him is not believable really She's not so plain that she'd jump at the first man to court her.Tierney was in some good noirs but he sure was a wooden actor.The two casting coups here were Walter Slezak as the intellectual but downandout detective. His wry sense of humor is entirely plausible under these circumstances and more pungent than a more stereotypical wisecracker would have been.Katherine Howard gives a performance that is also somewhat comic though it's very poignant. Her boozy crusader for the facts is fascinating  thought her agreeing to meet an obviously shady character like Cook in a deserted area of an unfamiliar city seems pretty implausible.To me the script is a little rough on the Claire Trevor character. Trevor is superb truly superb. And the character indeed is greedy and manipulative. But we lovers of noir have seen worse the Audrey Totter character in Tension for example who has no redeeming value whatever. Trevor is a troubled woman here and though she may have been born to assist killers the other characters and the plot seem to gang up on her a bit too much toward the end.The director Robert Wise has always been a mystery to me. He made so many fine movies in the 1940s and early fifties. And though I still dream of an uncut Magnificent Ambersons it doesn't look as if we'll ever get one. Cutting out the last reels was not his idea and he did mold it into what even though butchered is one of the greatest of all American movies.Yet in the 1960s particularly he turned to such bloated commercial junk  the absolute antithesis of cynical movies like this or The SetUp. Of course there was more money in them but there seems no discernible connection between the director of his noirs and that of his musicals and abominations like Two for the Seesaw in terms of style.".

The NYT called Wise's first noir not only morally disgusting but an offense to a normal intellect back then. So much about the high art of pushing the envelope.";

	schema:headline " Great film noir that is as intriguing as it is farfetched.";
	schema:reviewBody "When newly divorced Helen Trent Claire Trevor living in Mrs Kraft's Esther Howard Reno boarding house comes across a murder freshly committed by Sam Wild Lawrence Tierney she decides to bolt town immediately. But she happens to run into Tierney in San Francisco who infiltrates himself into her social circle with her foster sister Georgia Staples Audrey Long whom he marries. But Trevor getting wickeder and wickeder throughout the film can't resist the dangerous but sexy Tierney and they begin an affair. Upset by the murders in her house Mrs. Kraft hires a private investigator Walter Slezak who begins to put the pieces together. It is only a matter of time before the evil Mr. Wild is caught and Ms. Trent gets her comeuppance as well.There are more plot holes here than normal but it is presented with such fun and cunning that they are excusable. It is thoroughly entertaining. Ironically one of the victims in the beginning is named Laury Palmer played by Isabel Jewell. David Lynch used this name changing it to Laura for the victim of his classic film noir series Twin Peaks. Claire Trevor is not initially set up as a villianess She is a femmefatale for sure but it isn't until she is getting' some from Tierney now her foster brotherinlaw that she turns into one of film noir's best bad girls. We quickly learn of her resentment of wealthy foster sister Long who is as good as Trevor is bad. It is films like Born to Kill that lead to the sexual thrillers of the 90's like Basic Instinct and Body of Evidence. This film is way ahead of its time. The dialog is some of the best that you'll ever hear in a film noir spouted by both Trevor and Tierney with more acid than the monster in the Alien series.It is very interesting to see Trevor and Tierney's chemistry build. She knows he's bad for her yet can't help herself. Tierney is one of the best sociopaths in film. He can be charming and civilized one minute then a raving lunatic the next. The scene of the first set of murders is very gruesome and is an image that won't be erased for the remainder of the film. Two supporting characters make the film oh so very interestingElisha Cook Jr. as Tierney's creepy pal who shows up in San Francisco for Tierney's wedding to Long and finds himself embroiled in the intrigue and Esther Howard as Trevor's former landlady in Reno. Cook plays one of the smarmiest men ever in any film noir. Howard's character is a true movie original. I really thought she gave the best performance in the film and certainly was deserving of an Oscar Nomination. From the moment you see this drunken mouthy older broad you pity her. Then she shows up in SF involved in the intrigue and is the intended victim of her own murder. The scene with her being chased in the sand is more thrilling than anything I've seen in the greatest of film noirs and I was riveted. Kathryn Card who always mispronounced the name of her soninlaw as Mickey on I Love Lucy yes she is Mrs. McGillicuddy or Mrs. McGullicootie if you're imitating Desi is very memorable as Long's housekeeper. She has a lot more to do than most onscreen servants.I also really liked Walter Slezak as the P.I. from the moment he shows up trying to get a handout of food at Long and Tierney's wedding and gets Ms. Card to spill the beans about how Tierney came into the picture. There really is not a boring moment in this film. Of the other major film noirs that year only one other Nightmare Alley comes close to being its equal. Bogart and Bacall's Dark Passage is probably the best known of 1947 but while it is excellent it is overshadowed by the extreme darkness of BTK and NA. Of the major players only Philip Terry comes off as unmemorable not because of bad acting but because the character is not nearly as exciting as all of the others. Even goodiegoodie Audrey Long has her moments to shine especially in the thrilling finale that is as emotionally exhausting as the last hour of a dance marathon.It is ironic that the director is Robert Wise best known for his two Academy Award Winning musicalsWest Side Story and The Sound of Music. Every film he did was different in tone and at RKO he really had the chance to improve on his craft with each film. He was a true artist who knew how to hold the audience's attention in every film he did.".

Well just like with any film noir it gets more complicated with Tierney marrying Trevor's foster sistera wealthy woman in her own right and being tailed by sleazy literate detective Walter Slezak. Wise does a more than adequate job creating tension and suspense in this film and leaving no character's sense of good in tact. All of the characters it seems are of dubious natures with Esther Howard's rolypoly drunk with a heart of gold coming out as the most ethical! The acting by the leads and the supporting cast are firstrate. I am so surprised that Tierney a man I immediately remembered from a Seinfeld episode and from Reservoir Dogs was so good so long ago. He seemed to have dropped out of the public eye for so long but his acting definitely shows great potential. I believe I read that alcoholism was behind this. At any rate Tierney is very good Trevor plays one of the coldest performances on screenher lines to Howard were absolutely chilling Slezak is vintage Slezak  an oily goodhumoured man looking out for himself Elisha Cook Jr. gives another good turn as Tierney's buddy and Howards excels as the drunken woman. The scenes with her and Cook were wellpaced and effectively frightening. Born to Kill is nothing great in terms of plot or story  we have seen much of the same before  but under the adroit eyes of Wise and aided by big performances by talented actors and actresses  it rises above the mundane to be a vintage film noir classic.

	schema:headline " Immensely Powerful Psychological Noir a Chilling Masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the most profound noir thrillers ever made because the emphasis is on the psychology of two twisted characters and the script's and director's relentless focus on them takes a roaddrill to their psyches and what we see revealed is so disturbing it is darker than noir. Probably Lawrence Tierney never gave a more stunning and totally brilliant performance in his career. He is no stock psychopath he has explored and reveals the depths. Like the Chinese he preserves an immoveable face but the odd twitch here and there of an out of control facial muscle gives us what we need to know in powerful closeups. He seems to have an instinctive understanding of the paranoia of the perfect psychopath. Most people imagine that psychopaths rant and rave and behave in a scary fashion like in the horror movies. However a genuine psychopath and I have known several specializes in being undetectable and concealing his or her mental illness with all the skill of someone hiding a valuable treasure from graverobbers. It is the neurotics whom you can easily spot but the psychotics are often impossible to detect and are just as difficult to treat. A genuine psychotic is a psychiatrist's despair as their total lack of feeling or conscience their 'amorality' is nearly impossible to eradicate. Of all the film portrayals of psychopaths in murder mysteries and thrillers few have got it perfect but Tierney has accomplished this feat. Even more eerie in this film is the fantastically subtle performance by Claire Trevor as the woman obsessed with him who blurts out at one weak moment 'I was afraid of what I might do of what I might become'. Rarely has any actress portrayed so successfully on film so many shades and layers of the gradual descent into the maelstrom of her own weakness her own concealed vicious inclinations which she had disguised even to herself and the shocked and horrified selfrevelation that this brings as she progressively realizes that she is not the charming and socially poised womanincontrol that she imagined but that she is truly a ravening monster. As usual Claire Trevor's voice is a instrument deftly wielded in portraying her downward spiral her next film the following year was 'Raw Deal' 1948 in which she was equally potent. The most shocking scenes in this film are the ones of Tierney and Trevor together where their mutual sadistic excitement at blood and murder gives them sexual spasms of ecstasy so that they compulsively kiss with the passion of the damned. In these scenes they truly become Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. This film is incredibly disturbing at the deepest possible levels. Robert Wise's direction is superlatively brilliant. The supporting cast is spectacular Esther Howard as Mrs. Kraft helps carry the film with her shattering portrayal and Andrey long is magnificent as the good sister why did Long stop acting in 1952 the year Howard also died? Both were great cinema presences. As the doomed good time gal Lawry Isabel Jewell gives a ringing performance and Esther Howard's passionate devotion to her drives the plot to its relentless end. Eve Greene and Richard Macaulay's screenplay is perfect. Every shot is just right every glimpse of what lies beneath the surface is terrifying. Who needs Dracula and Frankenstein monsters in order to be scared? The worst horror of all is what we don't see at the moment we catch a fleeting glimpse of it here. Robert Wise Lawrence Tierney and Claire Trevor have here conspired to outHitchcock Hitchcock as masters of understatement and concealment with glimpses of evil flashed at us like a woman's skirt flicking up high in the wind. When will contemporary film makers learn the lessons of the past you must never actually show horror for artfully to suggest it is much more devastating and terrible.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is one of the most profound noir thrillers ever made because the emphasis is on the psychology of two twisted characters and the script's and director's relentless focus on them takes a roaddrill to their psyches and what we see revealed is so disturbing it is darker than noir. Probably Lawrence Tierney never gave a more stunning and totally brilliant performance in his career. He is no stock psychopath he has explored and reveals the depths. Like the Chinese he preserves an immoveable face but the odd twitch here and there of an out of control facial muscle gives us what we need to know in powerful closeups. He seems to have an instinctive understanding of the paranoia of the perfect psychopath. Most people imagine that psychopaths rant and rave and behave in a scary fashion like in the horror movies. However a genuine psychopath and I have known several specializes in being undetectable and concealing his or her mental illness with all the skill of someone hiding a valuable treasure from graverobbers. It is the neurotics whom you can easily spot but the psychotics are often impossible to detect and are just as difficult to treat. A genuine psychotic is a psychiatrist's despair as their total lack of feeling or conscience their 'amorality' is nearly impossible to eradicate. Of all the film portrayals of psychopaths in murder mysteries and thrillers few have got it perfect but Tierney has accomplished this feat.

Both men lacked the usual leading man charisma or the larger than life gangster style of the likes of Cagney or Bogartand this was a real plus because the killer seemed much more realistic and menacing. Both men thought nothing of murder.Now if all this wicked and amoral menace wasn't enough the film combined his strong performance by an equally awful character played by Claire Trevor. At first she doesn't seem so bad but later she reveals herself to be an ugly and greedy opportunist. While not violent like Tierney she was certainly an excellent femme fatale and was pretty wicked to the core. Combining her character with Tierney's was an excellent choice.The film didn't feature some of the amazing trademark camerawork though it's dialog was pure Noirwith lots of violence snappy comebacks and sparkling as well as steamy dialog.

Trevor is Helen Brent a recent divorce doing her time in Reno when she stumbles upon a woman's Isabel Jewell body while trying to return the woman's dog to her house. The victim was a friend of Mrs. Kraft Esther Howard the owner of the rooming house where Trevor was staying. Helen leaves the body  and town  without a word to anyone. The murderer is a jealous boyfriend Sam Wild Tierney who saw Jewell out with another man.On the train out of town Wild meets Helen whom he's already spotted the night before. When he pays her a visit at her home however he realizes she's already engaged to Philip Terry and goes after her beautiful wealthy sister Long and marries her. But the attraction to Trevor is still there on both sides. When a detective comes to town Slezak hired by Mrs. Kraft and starts nosing around Wild knows it's time to take action.This is a good noir but unlike some others the casting of Tierney was troublesome to me. Every woman in the film oohed and ahed over him. Now had it been Robert Mitchum for me it would have been believable. Tierney did not have the requisite charm to dazzle an heiress and a staff of servants or the handsome looks to this writer to pull off this character. On top of which it seemed rather obvious to me that he was wearing a rug.Well to each his own I guess. Trevor does a terrific job as a woman who loves her sister but who desires her husband in spite of herself. Cook turns in his usual good performance as a sycophant friend of Tierney's and Esther Howard is a Marie Dressler type and very good as the drunken Mrs. Kraft.Recommended but you have to buy Tierney as a charming and devilishly handsome killer  I didn't. I kept wanting to pull his rug off and wipe the smirk off his face.".

Instead it's got two good action setpieces one at the beginning and one at the end and some marvelously atmospheric cinematography by Robert de Grasse usually a glamor cameraman and a surprising credit for a noir but the rest of the film is pretty boring. Lawrence Tierney goes through his psycho kick but it's a strictly bythenumbers performance mechanically churning out what the audience expected from him after Dillinger an overrated movie but at least better than this. Claire Trevor's character is too stupid and unmotivated to have any audience appeal and the action such as it is stays so resolutely inside that damned house in San Francisco the film becomes claustrophobic instead of genuinely thrilling. It's one of those movies in which the supporting players  notably Elisha Cook Jr. whose character's homoerotic itch for Tierney's is one of the few subtleties in an otherwise pretty obvious script and Isabel Jewell  outact the leads. It also doesn't help that nearly half a century after Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins revolutionized the depiction of psycho killers on the screen in Psycho Tierney's is so gross and obvious he might as well have PSYCHO tattooed on his forehead. Also there's no indication in the film as it stands as to why the source novel was called Deadlier than the Male  but perhaps James Gunn made the female characters stronger and more interesting than they are in the film. Born to Kill is a real disappointment from Robert Wise who already had some quality movies under his belt and would go on to a stellar career.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Which We Serve is more than a story told for propaganda effect about naval heroism and based on Mountbatten's wartime experiences. As the English film critic Barry Norman has put it Aboard Coward's fictional HMS Torrin there existed forties British society in microcosm. Here everybody knew his place... The one thing they all had in common was the knowledge that each of them high or low was expected to show unswerving loyalty and devotion to duty. The relationships between the men on HMS Torrin and the lives they lead at sea and at home told through flashbacks portray a wartime society ordered by class and intentionally defined by the traditional British virtues of duty and sacrifice. It is a society in which understatement and the stiff upper lip reign supreme. Emotions go largely unspoken. They simmer under the surface of the screen in the silences and in the flickering effort of concealment on the faces of the major characters. Personal suffering is borne with quiet forbearance in the knowledge that it is borne in the service of a higher cause and that to bear it stoically is to set the right example to others. When the ship's chief petty officer is told of the death of his wife and mother in law in the blitz he first congratulates the sailor who brings him the news for becoming a father before going up on deck to bear his grief alone. The clipped style of speech of Captain Kinross played by Coward himself and the slightly shrill upper class accent of his wife played by Celia Johnson heighten the sense of feelings being stripped away from the words. Their conversation is a caricature of communication  the protagonists performing their dialogue in a choreographed ritual. Real communication is only hinted at  the underlying pain understood but never expressed. In In Which We Serve the captain and his wife are the models to which other men and women must aspire  in monologues they define the notions of duty and sacrifice to which each sex is bound. Both put duty before the pursuit of personal happiness a theme David Lean and Coward return to in Brief Encounter. When the Captain talks of the need for a happy ship he is not referring to the right of individuals expressed in the Declaration of Independence. Here happiness is a collective duty in the interests of efficiency.For the men and women in Coward's vision HMS Torrin is much more than a ship  it is personified as the object of their devotion and jealousy. Above all it is a powerful symbol of the qualities and traditions that unite and must protect their vulnerable island at war. Outdated though this vision may be  part of a world left far behind through postwar socioeconomic development and emancipation  it is nevertheless a compelling and entirely consistent vision which ensures the film retains a certain appeal to audiences even today and is a major reason why it can still be so highly rated as a piece of British cinema history.".

The simplicity of the story is one of the movie's key strengths but the most appealing aspect of the film is for me at least the way in which each scene reflects the preceding and suggests the subsequent one. The motivation behind this may have been to demonstrate the unifying elements of the various different characters and their individual stories but the skill with which this is done makes for a wonderfully satisfying experience. The film is excellently crafted moving from a semidocumentary style that would have been instantly recognizable to cinema audiences of the forties with the then common weekly news reviews and then moving into everything from lightcomedy to exciting action and pure drama. It is a film that for many will seem oldfashioned but only in some of its sentiments never its techniques or its wisdom. And the oldfashionedness of some of it such as the love scene between John Mills and his girlfriend on the bench by the water has a poignancy that is nevertheless almost painful in its innocence. Above all the film expresses one immensely important concern dignity. It is reflected in the words and actions of all the characters and shines through the film with the immense pride the filmmakers Noel Coward especially put into making this film. It is an important film not least because it is not afraid of expressing loss for many the thought of a film about a sinking British ship was a shocking risk to take in a time of war. And it is an entertaining film as well in the best tradition of British cinema. Like the other main CowardLean masterpiece Brief Encounter this film can be enjoyed on so many levels that it demands multiple viewings.

This film was something of a tourdeforce for Noel Coward as he produced wrote and codirected it with a young David Lean. Considering its age the film stands up quite well today. It obviously seems dated in some respects  the dialogue is quite clipped and stilted at times  but is saved by professional work all round and a clutch of strong performances namely by Noel Coward himself John Mills and Bernard Miles. Its also notable for the screen debut of Richard Attenborough it was screened over the holiday weekend as part of a celebration of his upcoming 80th Birthday.   While some may find it presenting an overly romanticised view of the Royal Navy at war it should be remembered that at the time it was made in 1942 victory over Germany was still far from certain. With that in mind it surely must have achieved its aim of boosting the morale of those who saw it. Over 60 years on it remains good solid entertainment and an intriguing glimpse into the mindset of the day.".

The story revolves around the Life and Sinking of a Royal Naval Destroyer HMS Torin and the gallant men that served on her.Loosly based on the story of HMS Kelly a real Royal Navy Destroyer commanded by Lord Louis Mountbatten it takes us back to the days when Britannia really did rule the waves.The ship is sunk during the battle of Crete and the main characters of the movie are then clinging to the life raft awaiting rescue. The film is a combination of flashbacks showing the effect that War has on the sailors and their families back home.Sir Noel Coward is brilliant as the upper class Captain that commands the ship and the respect of his crew. Sir Bernard Miles is equally as pleasing as the middle class Petty Officer and Sir John Mills gives a moviemaking performance representing the majority of the Royal Navy as the ordinary every day working class able seaman.I've noticed that a lot of reviews of this movie talk of the class divide between the three characters but I disagree entirely. First of all it is a true depiction of what the class structure was like in those days coupled with the fact that it was a message to say that in War time EVERYBODY is in the same stink regardless of Class. A prime example of this is when the ship sinks. At home these men may lead different lifestyles. but after having a ship blown from beneath them. they are all the same.Cowards film is a masterpiece and his score is haunting and beautiful. Sir David Lean's directorial debut under the watchful eye of Coward is something to be proud of and it's no surprise they were to team again.One the best moments of this movie is when the crew of the Torin rescue Coldstream Guardsmen from the bloody beaches of Dunkirk. On the dockside back in Blighty the Guardsmen disembark. Tired wounded and emotional. One word from an officer and these broken men SNAP to attention regardless of how they feel and in perfect unison are marched away. leaving John Mills to say If I weren't so tired I'd give 'em a cheer......and that's no error Incredible.This is a triumph for War time movie making and remains a milestone in British Cinema which also includes Lord Attenborough's movie debut.This Movie never fails to bring a lump to my throat. and the younger generation should be MADE to watch this movie. Who knows? it may help to restore this countries flagging patriotism.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this as part of a recent John Mills double bill with 'We Dive at Dawn' the two pictures are on the face of it remarkably similar both attempting to show the human face of war as well as mindless explosions and heroics and it is absorbing to try to pinpoint just why this one is so very much better than the other! For all its literacy and restraint 'We Dive at Dawn' is ultimately little more than a standard case of Our Boys Win Through Again aided naturally by the grateful oppressed peoples of Europe it is of course flattering that at least our propaganda films aimed beyond mere gungho status but the submarine movie clichs have been done better and to more stirring effect elsewhere. 'In Which We Serve' seems to be on an altogether higher level.Music and dialogue by Noel Coward naturally can't hurt and no more can codirection by David Lean. The opening montage would befit a silent movie in its allbutwordless narrative sweep and the film refers back to it in a complex flashback structure filling in moments around scenes that we recognise and then taking the story on... to the preordained ending that hangs over everything adding tension to every successive scene. We know almost from the start how the 'Torrin' meets her fate but not when.In retrospect the first combat scenes are an incredibly bold stroke first showing the destroyer shelling unarmed troop transports rather than engaging in an exchange of fire and then turning the tables the next day as she is caught helpless and sunk by flight after flight of divebombers. This is not the stuff of which moraleraising pictures are generally made and it gives an additional edge to every flashback scene as the doomed ship prepares to go to war.For ironically this is and remains a moraleraiser celebrating the quiet virtues of endurance humanity and loyalty in a time of senseless destruction. It is no coincidence that as part of her short history the 'Torrin' carries and salutes soldiers from Dunkirk. Her crew are drawn together from many different vessels and then the few survivors dispersed but in one of the most famous sequences  the three parallel Christmas parties  we are shown the bond that every one of them from the captain to the petty officers to the ordinary seamen feels for his ship.The film deliberately sets out to depict its characters as a microcosm of English society from the smokefilled third class compartment to the Great Western dining car with its dubious railway fish some things never change! and as a result it is a fascinating social document. But the handful of halfdrowned men soaked in fuel oil and filthy clinging to their float as the aircraft come back for the kill make no class distinctions. The script eschews both Hollywood schmaltz and confessional TV's bareall emotionality and the love and pain in the spaces between the words still ring true sixty years later.The chronological structure is ambitious but it works we are never in any doubt as to where the current scene in the jigsaw fits in. The detail is apt and acutely observed from the banter betweendecks and the blackedout ship's name on the wartime sailors' caps National Security to the prosaic nectar of Bovrilandsherry on the destroyer's bridge after the hell of Dunkirk. The style ranges from the almost newsreel staccato through the wavering vision of a drowning or semiconscious man to the simplicity of a kitchensink romance and the music while unobtrusive has a notable sophistication beyond most work of this genre. Like its companion piece 'This Happy Breed' 'In Which We Serve' demonstrates the hidden depths of Noel Coward's talent to amuse  and the versatility of John Mills. As wartime films go it's a highclass classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's ironic indeed that in Noel Coward's greatest screen role he played a part so atypical of what we expect from that most witty and erudite of artists. There's a lot good in In Which We Serve but if you are expecting Coward bon mots skip this film.Whatever else Coward was he was one patriotic British citizen who loved his country and wanted to do his bit in World War II. The incident in which In Which We Serve is based on what actually happened to the the destroyer HMS Kelly in 1941 off Crete which was sunk after taking a few of the enemy with her. The ship was commanded by one Louis Mountbatten of the royal family and a good friend of Coward's.Coward's character while not a member of the royal family is still of the upper crust of British society. Mountbatten when war broke out used his considerable royal connections to get into a combat assignment when war broke out. The sequences in which Coward's ship is sunk and the actions of Coward and the crew hews pretty close to what happened to Mountbatten and the men of the Kelly.While we Coward and his survivors clinging to life rafts and bits of wreckage the audience gets a series of flashbacks revolving around three men Coward CPO Bernard Miles and Seaman John Mills. We see them at peace and at war with the women they are involved with who are Celia Johnson Joyce Carey and Kay Walsh. This was total war for Great Britain something until 911 I don't think Americans could fully appreciate. While the men are at sea the women live under threat and fact of bombardment by air. Their scenes are every bit as important as the battle scenes at sea showing a people totally mobilized.In small roles you can find such people as James Donald Michael Wilding and Richard Attenborough all part of the crew. Attenborough in particular makes a vivid impression in his part.The Earl of Mountbatten made a series of televised memoirs in the early seventies that didn't reach American television until after his assassination in 1979. It was about 10 episodes and they dealt with all facets of his career. Before he retired in fact he became the First Sea Lord of the British Navy. But one episode dealt with the sinking of the HMS Kelly and the men of the Kelly who survived year after year got together for a remembrance. Some footage was shown of one of the gatherings. I wonder if they still do that and how many men are left from the ship survivors.In fact it's altogether fitting and proper that this review be dedicated to Lord Louis Mountbatten who not without controversy served his country well and faithfully throughout a long a productive life. And of course this review is also dedicated to the brave men of the HMS Kelly those that have passed on and those who might still survive. They and the other members of the Royal Navy kept their country from invasion for almost a thousand years and in the case of World War II kept the world from a totalitarian nightmare.And they couldn't have a better film than In Which We Serve to perpetuate the memory of their deeds.".

To be sure it veers maudlin once or twice and the whole production is suffused with the blood of righteousness  but not selfrighteousness. This is the kind of movie that makes me want to join the Navy I who get seasick in the bath.How does a middleaged homosexual songanddance man support the war effort?

Brutal tender horrible and full of hope IN WHICH WE SERVE sings the victory song of both shellfire and home fire without mention of glory or distinction. Noel Coward's acting is a marvel of disinterested conviction. Nobody could speak faster or with more precision and that with the stiffest of upper lips.No one wrote dialog at once so arch and comfortable either except maybe Kipling. Coward celebrates the most sophisticated level of civilization the blithe eloquent man of society who has managed not to become jaded. He embraces his England with a respectfully familiar pinch on the cheek and he kisses her with the most restrained of passions in front of the children. But he also loves with all his heart the simple proletarian bedrock and he allows the working classes to display as much humanity and emotion as he denies his own character.There is much stagelike not to say stagey in the production which shouldn't be very surprising given its principal antecedents. The film is sometimes expressionistic in design the angles and sets a terrifying collage of unsettling theatrical images in contrast to the reassuring tea cozy and the ramrodstraight captain on the quarterdeck. The symbols are profoundly simple and the effect is disarmingly true. As Coward says over a drink Perfect it's not a bit too sweet. Well it is rather but mix another pitcher of Bovril and sherry and don't complain there's a good chap.".

	schema:reviewBody "Naval men watch their ship sink as they cling to a raft and remember the lives they left in In Which We Serve a 1942 film starring Noel Coward John Mills Celia Johnson and Bernard Miles. The story takes place in World War II and shows how the war affected the British soldiers and their loved ones. Noel Coward also wrote and codirected this film with David Lean. Like Coward's Brief Encounter there are no glamorous movie star types. This is the story of the common man bound together by war and by their ship. Coward is Captain Kinross who has a wife Celia Johnson and two children. John Mills is Shorty a seaman who falls in love while on leave gets married and has a short honeymoon. Bernard Miles is Walter Hardy a happily married man whose wife hates having him go away. Each man reflects on his story in flashback. The impact of In Which We Serve must have been very powerful when it was first released. The announcement of war by the Prime Minister which comes over the radio is met with a chilling silence that the audience feels along with the men. The devastation of a blackout the impact of the bombs at sea are very real.In Which We Serve is the story of a ship the HMS Torrin but we learn quickly that a ship is about its people united in one cause and who share a special camaraderie. The captain's final speech to his men is highly emotional all the more so because it is so restrained.All of the acting is topnotch. Someone commented that Coward seemed stiff. I think his role called for a certain formality. Hard to believe John Mills was ever that young. Celia Johnson in her first film role is wonderful. Coward obviously had no problems attracting the best actors to the film as every person fits his or her role perfectly.Like many classics despite changes in film technique the core story remains compelling especially today with so many soldiers in Iraq. In one scene the camera falls on some of the seamen as they go to their stations to do battle. Each man was carefully chosen to show his extreme youth. It was a terrible time for the world but somehow the film is strangely uplifting. A nomiss.".

The lives of the different men interconnect in amazing ways in good times and during tragedy at sea.David Lean and Noel Coward shared the directorial duty in a film that is one of the best ones of the genre. It would appear impossible by today's egotistical standards that two men like Mr. Coward and Mr. Lean would even consent to work in a film project. The unity shown in the making of the film must have come from those trying days during the war days in England.The large ensemble cast put together for the film showcases some of the best talent of the British screen like no other of its kind. Noel Coward who was a colossal figure in the East End stage is seen as Capt. Kinross the man at the helm of the Torrin. His wife is played by Celia Johnson one of the best actresses of her generation and who later would go to collaborate with Mr. Coward in what must be perhaps one of the best achievements in the English cinema Brief Encounter.In supporting roles we see a young John Mills playing Shorty Blake. Bernard Miles is seen as the kind Walter Hardy. His wife Katherine is portrayed by Joyce Carey another excellent character actress who was always a welcome presence in any film in which she appeared. Kay Walsh Michael Wilding Daniel Massey seen as a young boy and the baby Juliet Mills also appear in the film.In Which We Serve is still a pleasure to watch because it shows the valor of the men called to defend their country.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Which We Serve 1942A curiously different and really moving film about World War II directed by two top British talents Noel Coward and David Lean. It's filmed in the thick of the actual naval war and so might be unofficially called a propaganda film. Though not made by the government there was a lot of influence and assistance.. It clearly has a sense of presenting the British war effort at its best. But it's also complicated filled with sadness alongside heroism and perhaps most of all selflessness. Both by soldiers and by their women left behind. The war in 1942 was not looking great for the Brits.Coward codirects but also is the leading man and he's an established actor from both film and stage at this point. Lean whose huge career as a director is all ahead of him is in charge of the action sequences and this is his first attempt at directingfor which he won awards. If there is a sentimental side to some of the Coward directed scenes it's partly because of when it was shot. Try to imagine the audience suffering from bombings and having their loved ones in battle. We see it now with very different eyes.In fact it is hard to imagine how a wife or mother could watch this at all. The basic structure is that the ship goes out to sea with a bunch of men and then disaster strikes and the rest of the movie is a series of flashbacks to the home lives of the men and to the women who are dreading seeing their men go off to sea. It's actually about the very sadness of the people sitting in the audience.The filming is rather different between the two directors. Coward understands a traditional kind of culture well with conversation and interpersonal nuance. Lean captures a more direct emotional energy and lots of vivid action. Normally two directors means problems but here it's divided naturally.Eventually the movie wears its formula back and forth with flashbacks pretty hard. But it's so well done you don't much mind. An emotional finely seen movie and surprisingly valid even now.".

We watch the Torrin from birth to death  a brilliant opening montage begins with a skeleton of the hull and ends with the champagne bottle striking it  and focus on the survivors in or clinging to one of the lifeboats. This is of course our old friend the Hollywood Bomber Crew syndrome but Coward's artistry and craftsmanship transcends the mundane and gives us a crosssection of fleshandblood characters spanning the social spectrum of an England at war.

	schema:headline " The life and death of HMS Torrin";
	schema:reviewBody "This film made at the height of the war follows the crew of Royal Navy destroyer HMS Torrin from its commissioning to her sinking in the Eastern Mediterranean. We know her fate from the start as the story is told in flashback as her crew cling to liferafts waiting rescue. The story concentrates on three main characters Captain Kinross Ordinary Seaman 'Shorty' Blake and his uncle in law Chief Petty Officer Hardy we also see how their families cope while they are away. During their time at sea they experience both success and tragedy we see the crew being brave under fire but we are also shown one man who cracks under the pressure we also see that the horrors of war also directly affected the people back home.As this was made in 1942 when the war was far from won one might expect a blatant propaganda piece showing 'our brave boys' battling heroically against a dastardly foe rather than a surprisingly realistic depiction of war where the protagonists are shown in a moment of defeat and loved ones back home are in danger too... of course people watching this at the time wouldn't have believed it if it as they were living through the war and knew it didn't always go well. Noel Coward wrote a fine story and also did well as Capt. Kinross not his typical role but one he was believable in other notable performances came from Celia Johnson as his wife John Mills as 'Shorty' Blake Bernard Miles as CPO Hardy and an uncredited Richard Attenborough as the young sailor who left his post in a panic. The action scenes are well handled and very believable there are also plenty of tense moments such as when the survivors get strafed by enemy aircraft while clinging to their raft and the scene were Shorty's wife and Hardy's wife and mother listen to the bombs getting closer during an air raid over Plymouth. It is no surprise that many of those involved in this film went on to become well known film stars and in the case of David Lean a famous director.".

	schema:headline " Great film of a culture a people and a time in war";
	schema:reviewBody "In Which We Serve is a great movie about World War II England's entry into the war the war's toll on people at home and sea battles and survival. As such it is a marvelous character study of the culture that was England at the time running the gamut of social classes. The film covers about three years from the launch of a new destroyer before Britain enters the war after Germany invaded Poland in 1939. The story unfolds in three ways. First through the eyes of several men assigned to the ship. The captain a chief a regular seaman and others survive the sinking of their ship during the battle of Crete in mid 1941. On their raft in the Mediterranean each has flashbacks to times at their homes with families and of loved ones. Second we see scenes of their families at home enduring the long waits and then the Battle of Britain and German bombings. Third we see the men in service on the ship in battle with enemy ships and convoys and in the rescue of British troops from Dunkirk in mid1940.This film has a fairly large cast of people with significant parts and all perform with excellence. In various scenes I felt right a home as though I were a member or welcomed friend or guest of the families or groups. Others have commented on the stiff upper lip of the Brits portrayed so well by all in this film. I only add that one can get a sense of the heroism in this in each person doing his or her part to help keep some sanity and not letting things fall apart. And the excellent script by Noel Coward and directing with the excellent acting only brings the audience more into the emotion of the moments so that we feel and care deeply for the people. What is dated if not history? One of the great values of film it seems is that it gives us a record of history. Any story put on film in the time in which it takes place is naturally dated. But that gives us a picture a few years later and decades into the future of what the life and times and culture and people were like at that point in history. And that only enhances the value of older films it seems to me in helping later generations better learn about and understand the past. At least for those people who don't mind watching enjoying and learning from films produced in the past about lives and times of the past.This film is a strikingly rich and seemingly honest portrayal of its period the war the life around naval families of the time and of British people and society. It was produced right in the middle of World War II when the outcome was far from certain. While it portrays the strength of the British people in persevering with their stiff upper lips it also shows the reality and horrors and loss of war. And it does all that at a time when it will be shown in theaters in England and abroad. We might call it real time today. In Which We Serve is a classic that will be around well into the future. I highly recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Noel Coward is usually associated with bright bubbly comedies and musicals but here as director and star in a flagwaving British war movie he plays it straight so to speak muting the plummier aspects of his elocution. But his splendid and reserved performance notwithstanding this isn't really his picture alone. Coward turned most of the directing over to his editor David Lean giving Lean's career a good punt.And this is an ensemble film from beginning to end. The cast both male and female is filled with familiar faces for 1942 or faces that would later become familiar. Sir Dickie Attenborough is a barely recognizable youth. Even Juliet Mills is in it as a neonate.It's nicely written too carefully weaving together the stories of multiple characters built around the birth and death of a British destroyer HMS Torrin during the early years of the war. There's action enough to keep a viewer interested though the Battle of Britain and Dunkirk are mostly off screen. And the ladies on the home front knit in a nervous frenzy while bombs fall about and kill some of them. A nice understated scene in which John Mills tells a shipmate Bernard Miles that the latter's wife and mother were killed in the Blitz. Miles thanks Mills excuses himself and goes on deck to look at the sky. He doesn't weep. Nobody weeps. It's called keeping a stiff upper lip.The fact is that men inducted into the service must learn how to act like soldiers and sailors. And in wartime civilians too must learn how to act as proper civilians. Servicemen see training films on such interesting subjects as how to disassemble an assault rifle and how to avoid VD or pardon sexually transmitted diseases. And in its own way In Which We Serve is a training film too. Civilians needed films like this one to learn their roles thoroughly too. Basically the lesson taught by In Which We Serve is that one of the best ways to cope with rationing was to make wisecracks about it that the two greatest and most important pleasures were supporting the war effort and enjoying visits home when they were available and when things got too serious you tried to keep your distress to yourself. Everybody knew what you were feeling because after all loss was common currency and was ignorant of differences in social class. The irony never to be forgotten was that the Germans were learning to bear the same kinds of miseries.Fine job even the inexpensive special effects. The splashes of machinegun bullets around the survivors were made by popping condoms just under the surface.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1940s were a golden age in British cinema. Not only did the circumstances of the war bring interest and therefore revenue from the American market but the earnest need to create moraleboosters lead to government emphasis on filmmaking pushing to the fore many of the creative talents that had been fermenting during the 1930s. One such talent was David Lean who was here brought on as codirector alongside writer Noel Coward although reportedly Coward soon took a back seat and the picture is around threequarters the work of Lean.But let's look at Coward first seeing as it's his story. Certain press critics had ridiculed the idea of this writer of gentle comedies doing a war film. However pictures of any genre rely upon great characterisation. Coward's characters tended to be stereotypes summations of types of people in society and yet they were always affectionate ones. This is of course great for a propaganda piece where the characters must be recognisable even if they are not believable and above all sympathetic. In Which We Serve is also a sprawling ensemble piece with numerous interwoven narratives and to make it comprehensible and engaging it needs welldefined characters whom the audience can immediately get to grips with and cannot be mistaken for one another.Lean was already known in the British film industry as the best editor in town and his work on such important British films as Pygmalion and 49th Parallel show his taste for hard cuts which jolt the audience with a sudden change in focus or pace for example cutting to a moving object. Now that he's behind the camera he continues to use the element of surprise to keep the picture moving although he finds ways to do it within the shot. For example in the montages of the ship being readied for battle he has the shells sliding towards the camera as they are loaded giving the montage a sense of dynamic urgency. When John Mills gets the letter saying his wife had the baby he suddenly leaps towards the camera so he is in a closeup when he reads it out. This method of attention grabbing is crucial to Lean's style and is responsible for some of the most iconic and memorable moments in his later pictures.But what is great about Lean is that he never allows these jolts to make us aware of technique. These sudden moments are always within conventional cinematic style and keep us in the film's world as oppose to say the quick zooms of Kubrick or the prowling camera of Hitchcock which remind us too much of the film's artifice. Lean also has the sense to slow things down for the more dramatic scenes and lets many of the more poignant moments play out in single uninterrupted shots to great effect. We also see an intelligent approach to the introduction and presentation of characters. For example in Bernard Miles' first flashback Miles is continually shown in profile to one side of the screen while his wife faces the camera at screen centre. This focuses us on her since we already know his character.Coward and Lean also had access to the cream of British acting talent. Coward himself plays the ship's captain another thing idea the papers scoffed at before they saw it after which they were surely scoffing on the other side of their faces as his performance is flawless. John Mills is also great and Bernard Miles really gets to act. Richard Attenborough is at his best in his screen debut although it went uncredited due to a ballsup with the cast list. Best of the bunch however is Celia Johnson a completely natural performer capable of making us forget we are watching an actress and believing we are witnessing the life of a real person.As a moralebooster In Which We Serve was popular and effective but it was also part of an upward trend in the scope and prestige of the British motion picture. Lean's dynamic style would eventually earn him respect on both sides of the Atlantic. His ability to keep the picture constantly visually engaging would create great cinema out of potentially static stage play adaptations and later on lengthy historical epics that might have been tedious in other hands.".

	schema:headline " Liked it first time loved it the second a great moving film and much more than just wartime propaganda";
	schema:reviewBody "First time watching In Which We Serve it struck me as a very good film though with some draggy moments in the first half some of the clipped dialogue seeming stilted and Nol Coward seemed a little stiff at first. Rewatching again as part of a David Lean marathon In Which We Serve held up much better on rewatch.It does drag still a tad in the first halfhour or so but the initial problems had with some of the dialogue and Coward at first weren't apparent this time. The script courtesy of Coward this time around was very nuanced and stirring the speeches could easily have been too preachy and instead what the film has to say is told in an intelligent poignant and sometimes uplifting way. Coward's initial stiffness struck me on rewatch as something that suited the character who was written as quite dour at first anyway and it is a very authoritative caring and moving lead performance on the whole his HMS Torin speech is a classic and if the lower lip doesn't tremble or more during his incredibly emotional farewell I'm not sure what will.Coward is wonderfully supported by the rest of the cast especially from the shimmering film debut of Celia Johnson a sympathetic Bernard Miles and John Mills in one of his better Lean film performances. Richard Attenborough who never looked so young than in this film also makes his screen debut and a memorably powerful one it is too. The story is riveting often thoroughly entertaining and immensely moving notably Coward's farewell and the men from Dunkirk being unloaded at portside. Who can't help love the values that it shows too? Coward was aiming to inspire and he definitely succeeds. His codirection with Lean works just fine with his more nuanced style contrasting well with Lean's more vivid action style.In Which We Serve is beautifully filmed in sumptuous black and white the Royal Navy details and settings being more than convincing and Coward also provides a stirring and hauntingly beautiful music score. Overall a great and very moving film and much more than just wartime propaganda a distinction more suited to something like Dangerous Moonlight. 910 Bethany Cox".

	onyx:emotionText "First time watching In Which We Serve it struck me as a very good film though with some draggy moments in the first half some of the clipped dialogue seeming stilted and Nol Coward seemed a little stiff at first. Rewatching again as part of a David Lean marathon In Which We Serve held up much better on rewatch.It does drag still a tad in the first halfhour or so but the initial problems had with some of the dialogue and Coward at first weren't apparent this time. The script courtesy of Coward this time around was very nuanced and stirring the speeches could easily have been too preachy and instead what the film has to say is told in an intelligent poignant and sometimes uplifting way. Coward's initial stiffness struck me on rewatch as something that suited the character who was written as quite dour at first anyway and it is a very authoritative caring and moving lead performance on the whole his HMS Torin speech is a classic and if the lower lip doesn't tremble or more during his incredibly emotional farewell I'm not sure what will.Coward is wonderfully supported by the rest of the cast especially from the shimmering film debut of Celia Johnson a sympathetic Bernard Miles and John Mills in one of his better Lean film performances. Richard Attenborough who never looked so young than in this film also makes his screen debut and a memorably powerful one it is too.

	schema:headline " A worthy piece of propaganda perhaps but still suffers from the weakness of that genre";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the story of a ship namely the HMS Torrin a British destroyer. After a successful campaign the Torrin is attacked by a squadron of German bombers and sunk with many of the crew lost and only a few survivors left to fend for themselves in the water. Around one liferaft a group of survivors try to keep their spirits up but some of them lapse into recollection  of the period before the war the families back home life upon the ship and the lessons they have learnt during their time in the war.First of all I have to make comment on those reviewers here who have made a massive song and dance about the propaganda aspect of this film they are correct but some have overdone it and suggest that they have not seen that many other films of the period. As propaganda films go this is comparatively restrained without the extreme flag waving of some more actionbased war movies. Of course this is not to say that it avoids falling into the usual genre traps because despite all its attempts at high standards it still reinforces all the clichs and viewed today often comes over as simplistic and occasionally a bit patronising in its portrayal of servicemen people and the class structure.The story itself is a nice try at an ensemble cast delivering all different stories as a way of looking at the struggles sacrifices hopes losses and victories showing us how the good IL' British keep together and find their blitz spirit in all situations. Of course this was all a long time ago and it may be I'm watching the film with the eyes of someone sitting in a time that has seen Britain lose that aspect of life but this all comes over as rather stiff lacking emotion and not as engaging as such a story really should have been. Although I suppose to show the struggle pain and horror of war would have not exactly helped and the film can't be blamed too much for not doing this although it is still hard to forgive its narrative simplicity. Perhaps now its most interesting aspect is capturing the image of Britain that was promoted as the ideal at the time  interesting because it may have been that way then but I wonder how much this very enforced class presentation was viewed at the time  were people really happy with the idea of the gentleman officercheeky chappy working man split or was it as others smarter than me suggested a factor in the election of a labour government after the war? The cast fit into the stereotypes reasonably well and it is not their fault that the material is aimed at creating these stereotypes rather than people. Coward fits into the role of nannying upperclass officer like it was a second skin  not that he makes it a person but he suits the role. Mills has an easier role because his character is more recognisable as a person than the others but still the same problems in regards making us care about him or his family. This is the same all the way down the cast  they all fit the stereotypes well enough but there is nothing to them beyond this.Overall this is a rather stiff and unconvincing film that is more interesting in getting the ideal stereotypes across rather than creating an engaging character piece. Given the period this is an understandable flaw but it is still a problem that really takes away from the film as it stands today. The cast are professional but the material limits what they can do making this a stiff snapshot of perhaps how we used to live rather than something that is the classic piece of cinema that some reviewers have suggested it is.".

Esha Deol is no Audrey and Zayed Khan in his debut film is no Gregory Peck but it's still an awesome film. Some elements are extremely corny for lack of a better term stereotypical of Indian films and at times so rawly raunchy you want to just cringe. But aside from that it is an excellent story great songs and superb acting on both parts by Zayed and Esha. They have amazing chemistry and the story line keeps you on your toes. Boys Are Best is my favorite song from the film it's light and airy reminding me of a Hindi reprise of a 60s Frankie Avalon movie. While Do you Love Me is too cute quirky and simply adorable. Mohabaat Hai Mirchi is exactly how it sounds HOT with the bad girl looking like she belongs in Indian Playboy for sheer silicon looking breasts and no dancing technique or talent along with her sixinchstripperheels  sure to make men sweat in their seats. This movie only proves further that Esha Deol is an excellent dancer see Naa Tum Jano Naa Hum and that Zayed Khan should make another one wait! he did Main Hoon Naa. Final comment  watch it!".

Fortunately I couldn't figure out which one so I could watch this movie with a completely fresh and objective view. And from a fresh and objective view it was quite refreshing. It's quite difficult to come across a Bollywood movie which has a good balance between romance and suspense. Churaliyaa I believe has managed quite well.POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!! The story starts off with a daring armoured car robbery. One of the thieves gets away with all the money leaving the others to fend for themselves... in jail. Three years later the jilted thieves look up their cohort and guess what... he ends up dead. But where's the money? The thieves believe that he somehow passed on the money to his niece Tina Esha Deol. But she doesn't seem to have it and certainly doesn't seem to have any knowledge of the robbery. As the baddies start chasing her and threatening her she comes to rely on her new boyfriend Vijay Zayed Khan. But can she really trust him? Can she trust anyone? And where is the money? Slowly we see the story unfold.Churaliyaa is an entertaining thriller. As with any Bollywood romancethriller the first part of the movie is focused on the romance and the second part on the thriller. The story now and then interrupted with a few mediocre songs at best. Aah... if only the producers could capture the beauty of the original Churaliyaa Hai Tumne song but alas... the quality of the golden oldies escapes them leaving them with nothing but titles for new movies.Churaliyaa does not offer anything new. Just 2 and a half hours of mindless entertainment like most Bollywood movies. The story is not bad but it's not exceptionally original either. The romancing offers nothing new at all. And the action is as always unbelievable and that is not a good thing. No matter how often a person gets beaten kicked stabbed or shot they manage to get up and still give it their best unless ofcourse they HAVE to die in the interest of the plot. The fight sequences are similarly unbelievable. Perhaps Zayed Khan is angling for the role of Keanu Reeves in a Bollywood Matrix remake. Nonetheless it's better than most but certainly no masterpiece.A final word on the acting. I cannot but speak positively of Esha Deol's performance. Not because her acting was outstanding because it was simply good which is also a performance to be proud of but because when I saw her laughing and dancing I couldn't help but be reminded of Hema Malini. She posesses that same charm and a certain je ne sais quoi which Hema also has. Star potential. This is why later I was not too surprised to find out that she is Hema Malini's daughter.5 stars".

Better captioning would have been nice as it seemed that a lot of the dialog was missing and sometimes the English they did speak didn't match the captions. It's about a girl named Rhea and a guy named Vijay who fall in love and meet with some unexpected intrigue with Rhea's uncle. Vijay isn't what he seems.

	schema:reviewBody "It's surprising how little known California Split is but even in a career filled with great movies such as Robert Altman's it deserves more recognition. It is Altman the auteur in top form his quirks and distinctive traits that separate him from all directors of his time emblazoned over every minute of this delightful mixture of comedy and drama.It's the handling of the subject matter that makes the difference. Sure this is not the first movie to be made about the compulsiveness of gambling and people trying to find meaning and pleasure in empty addictions but it is such a fresh and enjoyable movie one has to sit down and take notice. What makes it work so well? I'll say the success rests on a combination of three things the infectious chemistry between the two leads Elliot Gould in a hilarious role and George Seagal the fully realized world Altman creates for his characters and that overall the movie is capable of both bellylaughs and profound sadness but it is always subtle never says anything more than it has to leaving just enough for the viewer to participate. Even the bitter aftertaste of the ending is never expanded more than two or three lines and a look on Seagal and Gould's faces and it's then counterpointed with a spin of the wheel and a sweet jazz song as the end credits begin to roll.This combination of those three things ultimately achieves the most important and difficult thing for any director to master to make the camera disappear. This is not the first time Altman succeeds in doing so but California Split is still a very good indication of the craftsman at the top of his talent.The gambling world here is not the glitzy and glossy Las Vegas of Ocean's 11 or Four of a Kind  not it is for gambling movies what The Long Goodbye was for neonoir. A look inside a crummy cheap world without prospects and the rent's running. It makes perfect sense then that the last act takes place in Reno and not Vegas and that the bleachy look of Paul Lohmann's cinematography no Vilmos Zsigmond this time reflects that there's no glamour to be had here.".

Great directing too and great places to shoot the story how clever to choose the depressing Reno instead of Las Vegas! Atlantic City would have been a good choice too. Gambling is what people do when they have anything else left to do. Gambling is all about losing feeling sad and loneliness. And it's the same if you win or if you lose no difference. Other films usually show winners when they solves their common life problems through gambling or losers when they ruin their own common life trough gambling. What is shown by California Split is that if you are a gambler then there's no space for anything else say life love or hope. And that's both for winners and for losers.".

George Segal getting down to the oldies may date the film along with his sweaters but this is an enjoyable and surprising movie that exposes the hollowness and joylessness of compulsion without getting all holy about it.  The younger working girl's search for feeling with her endless succession of tricks is a more easily noticeable parallel to what emerges as the film's core George Segal's character finding his capacity for change.  The shenanigan with Gould Segal and the cross dresser strays dangerously close to outtakes from MASH. The film's greatest moment aside from the surprisingly shattering denouement coming two minutes later is when Segal has run from 2000 to 82000. He's rolling everything right at the craps table when this little pea brained moron comes up and puts 1 on the seven.  Elliott Gould offers to throw a hundred dollar chip at her to make her go away if you don't know the seven ends the streak and betting on it in the middle of a streak should be punishable by water torture.  Sure enough Segal rolls a seven and the streak ends.  Everyone looks at the little moron and she says I don't care it's my birthday and I won! and picks up her 2.  That is classic. Looking at Segal's performance you can see shades of what Ben Gazzarra would do decades later in Todd Solondz's Happiness as another man who doesn't feel anything.".

	schema:reviewBody "California Split provides a couple of stellar performances through Robert Altman's direction. George Segal who is an actor I'm not too familiar with I never watched the TV show 'Just Shoot Me' or his other 70s movies but here is very believable as the downonhisluck Bill Denny a sometimes magazine writer who can be spotted at the track or in a poker room more often than in his office. He's befriended by Charlie Waters Elliot Gould a character who is at first seemingly just that a real 'character' kind of guy. Gould is terrific at playing Charlie as a fasttalking' smoothdealing kind of clever player who sometimes makes bets as arbitrary as the names of the seven dwarfs. He like Bill makes bets and usually wins but then still tries to talk down how much the mugger who robs him in the parking lot should take. He and Bill sort of go aimlessly around through most of the first half of the film with the only sort of conflict coming up as opposed to a driving force in the plot being that Bill owes a lot of money to his bookie which he has to earn up in Reno. By the end however there's something about the gambler's life that is left on a bittersweet note.The two lead males are contrasted against actresses Ann Prentiss and Gwen Welles who are not really elaborated on much as characters aside from being possible hustlers or prostitutes of some sort. There's even a touching ironic scene where Welles tries to seduce Segal but to no avail on either side. Even in the quiet scenes with the main characters Altman and writer Walsh are adept to make these characters seem always believable even in their seedy desperate mannerisms and leaps of thought. They know they mindset and lifestyle of the gambler both according to the press notes were affluent with not only card games but the nature of the gambling man and how he goes about his business. Sometimes the aimless quality about the first half is very funny Gould's performance especially as the opposite of Segal's straightlaced and highstrung character. Other times there's a scene or two that seem unneeded or a little oddly put in like an inexplicable scene where a transvestite comes to call at Charlie's place to proposition the ladies I think only to get swindled again by the Charlie and Bill. Such scenes though are meant for simple character lift albeit not totally satisfying when compared to other scenes.But to see an Altman film any Altman film is to see a piece of what Altman at the 2006 Oscars called one very long body of work. In viewing California Split I'm reminded as well of how substance in a matter of speaking trumps style. It's not that Altman doesn't have some kind of distinct visual style in general I mean it becomes truth be told more distinct in Nashville and 3 Women. But in several during his career like MASH or Prairie Home Companion his style doesn't go for being anything more than that of a straightforward practically objective storyteller getting the multicharacter scenes and layered spots of dialog and conversation without getting in the way. It's almost ironic for the sake of what's going on his style evokes Howard Hawks's knack of storytelling in the visual sense of being the unobtrusive sort. But it's in the substance that's different because Altman isn't really interested in the conventions of stories. He's after character mood the little moments in the midst of conversations. He's a great director of actors and of setting if nothing else.For the most part California Split is splendid at telling more about the nature of the mindset of the attitude and near existentialism of gambling than any specific story there aren't any real contrivances holding these characters to the necessities of the script. And the ending gives a few really good questions to ponder what does winning really mean after going through so much as a loser? Is there a catharsis or one worthwhile? Altman handles this mood and these characters like a pro with the end result being one of the most fascinating unconventional and entertaining films made about the small maligned world of gamblers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Altman returns to one of his favorite subjects  men behaving badly  in this rather slight 1974 effort. George Segal and Elliott Gould play chronic gamblers who meet by chance in a gaming room and embark upon a friendship founded entirely on each man's desire to seek out the next sure thing. They head to Reno where Segal falls into an amazing streak of luck and wins hundreds of thousands of dollars.....and then the movie just sort of ends not because the story itself reaches any sort of natural conclusion but more because Altman runs out of things to say about it.Like many of Altman's films California Split isn't as interested in telling a story as it is in establishing a tone and that it does wonderfully. The ending does feel anticlimactic and abrupt but then again this is the tale of a gambling addict whose whole existence consists of looking for and finding opportunities to feed his addiction. That Segal falls into a tired stupor after winning big and experiences a glum letdown instead of the euphoria any normal person would feel from winning that much money feels right for someone with an addiction. The obsession isn't with the catch but with the chase.I think Segal is the weaker of the two lead actors though he's got the larger role. He plays up the comic elements in the film too broadly whereas Gould feels more at home with Altman's sarcastic offthecuff sense of humour. The first time I saw this I thought there were distinct homoerotic undertones and I felt that again after a second viewing. Segal obviously has feelings of inadequacy that his gambling helps him overcome or at least forget. From where does that sense of inadequacy spring? Several moments in the film  mention of a failed marriage his reaction to someone calling him a faggot an aborted attempt at lovemaking with a ditzy hooker  suggest that Segal's character has homosexual tendencies that he's trying to suppress or at the very least that his shaky sense of his own manhood suggests to HIM that he has homosexual tendencies.This isn't really fleshed out in the movie but then nothing else is either. California Split feels like a warm up to Altman's masterpiece Nashville released a year later but it doesn't have that movie's sense of scope or amazing cast of characters so it feels underdeveloped and lightweight.Still it kept me interested for 105 minutes and it is a fascinating look into the chronic gambler's mind if nothing else.Grade B".

George Segal and the amazing Elliot Gould perfectly portray the ups and downs the manic lifestyle that masks the unhappiness of the degenerate gambler.

But most memorable are all the wonderful minor characters the girlfriends the bookmaker and even a thief. Most unforgettable to me are Barbara Ruick as the Reno poker game barmaid and Phyllis Shotwell as the quintessential Vegas lounge act.

The story is sad yet exciting the dialog witty and almost innocent and the direction is of course great.

	schema:reviewBody "If it takes a watermelon five minutes to water. How long does it take a sweetpea to pee?  Charlie Waters California Split is a surprisingly straightforward film by director Robert Altman. The plot Elliott Gould and George Segal play a pair gamblers who meet up one night at a poker game. They strike up a friendship and are soon gambling together.The film begins and ends with two images which perfectly capture the spirit of the picture. The first is of a chalk board with the words high and low stencilled in big white letters whilst the last is a innocuous shot of a spinning gambling wheel. These two images epitomise the style of the film. Filled with improvised dialogue and a very loose narrative California Split is a freewheeling gambling picture content to simply observe the highs and lows of its two central characters. It progresses in a very relaxed spontaneous manner until we reach the point where Gould and Segal suddenly split and drift apart.The film's style was a breath of fresh air back in the early 70s its loose narrative its overlapping sound design its reliance on improvisation etc. But what holds things together is Elliot Gould's infectious character. Altman was the only director to recognise the cool in Gould. With everyone else Gould was a gawky loser but Altman recognised Gould's charm wit and devilish line delivery.Gould's style of metaacting is such that he always exists outside of his films. He's a trickster always winking at the audience a trait which often lends his performances a sort of fiendish power.Thematically the film is fairly singleminded. Segal and Gould are both gambling addicts but respond to their addictions in completely different ways. Segal's addiction consumes him from the inside leaving him without the ability to feel whilst Gould views winning as a glorious excuse to keep on having fun.Like Thieves Like Us McCabe and Mrs Miller and Kansas City Alman's target is therefore America's economic model though like HealtH Altman instead chooses to narrow his focus and examine the way addiction money and desire become conflated under late capitalism. As addiction is a process which converts human pleasure into a kind of consumer dependency it's unsurprising that consumer capitalism is the economic system in which addictions have diversified and awareness of addiction itself has become commonplace. Capitalism encourages its users to become dependent upon a particular form of repetitive action the satiating of desires by working at buying and selling objects. And not only does the addict's primary relationship with the addictive object mirror the isolation or split caused by capitalism's emphasis on individualism and commodity consumption but it is in capitalism's interest to engender addictive dependency in its subjects to maintain itself and produce the illusion that there is no alternative.As such the film ends with both Segal and Gould winning a bundle of cash at a high stakes poker game. Though Gould views their victory with delight Segal feels only bitterness. He knows that there is ultimately no winner and that they will eventually lose their money and be sucked back into the same cycle of highs and lows. The wheel of fortune is always spinning. Sometimes you're up sometimes you're down but in the end the house always wins.810  Succeeds at capturing the day to day drudgery of being a small time gambler. Worth two viewings.".

The opening titles shots which are in widescreen and show Gould softly babbling to himself and watching a gambling instructional video are incredible  and it would be amazing to see the whole movie in proper aspect ratio. The interplay between Gould and Segal is  I think  deeper and more compelling than the takenforgranted warforced friendship between Gould and Sutherland in MASH.  Still I think almost nothing is better than Gould just by himself friendless and constantly disappointed in humanity the way he is in The Long Goodbye.

Elliot Gould and George Segal are at their finest as Charlie Waters and Bill Denny. They exemplify mid'70's cool hitting bars and casinos with sarcastic wit and a ready for anything attitude. Director Robert Altman doesn't force these performances out of his actors. He leaves the pace of the movie on a laid back scale open for an improvisation. California Split does have a message about how empty this life style can be but it doesn't shake a finger at its' protagonists.

It was a crappy copy the movie is sort of grainy looking anyway like a lot of early 70s movies but I was grateful to relive the experience and it pretty well lived up to my expectations especially the onearmed piccolo player scene which must be one of the most hilarious things I've ever seen. Anyway when it came out on DVD needless to say I nabbed it pretty quickly. However upon watching it on DVD I noticed at least one discrepancy from the original version  the absence of Phyllis Shotwell's rendition of Kansas City. Does anybody know why this was left out? I personally have no idea. I have not listened to the audio commentary yet but perhaps they might mention it. Anyway this minor criticism aside this is a great funny movie with possibly the most naturalisticfeeling acting and dialogue ever achieved and personally I find it better than M.A.S.H. in terms of humour and character depth. I don't know why this movie is so underrated. I admit I would have preferred a more upbeat ending but you can't have everything.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two guys meet in a California poker parlor. They did not know one another before and they don't know much about one another now yet they know all they need to know They're both compulsive gamblers and the extent of the universe of gambling match the extent of the universe they care anything about. It is an insular world and a flat one and they are always menaced with careening over the tipping point. They're the lions of this rambling nonjudgmental film by Robert Altman. Their names are Bill and Charlie and they're played by Elliott Gould and George Segal with candid realism and unadulterated fussy weariness. We don't require any knowledge about gambling to grasp the adventure they pursue to the tracks to the private poker parties to the bars to Vegas to the gallows of failure to the scene of triumph. Their obsession is so vigorous that it moves us along.The disparity is between the deadened nomad of George Segal as opposed to the hysterical burlesque that Elliott Gould drifts through to obscure his hopelessness. We're amused by their hangovers their bruises nursed with hot shaving cream the loopy parttime prostitutes who supply them with breakfasts of Froot Loops and beer. We coast smoothly through the racket of their friends nonchalantly presented through Altman's penchant for overlapping dialogue and downplayed visual openers so that we're not so much shown new characters as guided to suppose we were already familiar with them. And since Joseph Walsh's screenplay is amusing and Segal and Gould are genuinely engrossing we have a good time.However then there are scenes that assume darker implications like at one point at the craggy fringe of sleep inebriated conquer Bill and Charlie stick hopelessly to a bar and rather gravely bet with one another on the names of the Seven Dwarfs. And at another time trapped with their winnings in yet another parking lot by yet another mugger this one armed they hand over half their winnings and bet him that's all they have. As California Split rambles along we find that Altman has not made a farce about gambling. He's taken us into an American vision and all the people we met along the way felt and looked authentic. This movie smacks of a musty rotating fan.As always Altman stocks his movie with eccentric peripheral characters people who have by some means grown to parody themselves. At the exclusive poker game Gould stands at the bar analyzes the table and in a whisper sizes up each player. He's correct about them but he and we have never seen them before. We know he's right as these people bear their idiosyncrasies and fates on their faces. So do the hookers played with a sort of kindheartedness by Ann Prentiss and Gwen Welles. So does one of their customers who's a middleaged man who likes drag as much as he's frightened of the cops causing a scene painfully mixed of tragic and comic character. Altman's movies invariably appear brimming and abundant one way or another. We don't have the sense of a stationary screen into which painstakingly delineated characters are inducted singlefile as much as a camera delving into a simmering surf of berserk civilized commotion.I also saw The Long Goodbye just before this which looks like a noir sounds like a noir but it's not a noir. I don't know what California Split looks and sounds like certainly not a comedy but in its own weird subversive way it is a comedy. What Altman comes up with is occasionally a sense of naturalism. At the end of California Split we've seen something about organized gambling in this country we hadn't seen before. He draws his visual approach from a deeply conscientious soundtrack employing ambient sound with painstaking delicacy so that our ears inform us we're moving through these people rather than that they're taking turns talking to us. Indeed this is the first film ever to use eighttrack stereo sound that wasn't shot in Cinerama. It worked.Interesting Tidbit The Tongue of the Great Blue Whale Weighs More Than a FullGrown African Elephant.".

	onyx:emotionText "Two guys meet in a California poker parlor. They did not know one another before and they don't know much about one another now yet they know all they need to know They're both compulsive gamblers and the extent of the universe of gambling match the extent of the universe they care anything about. It is an insular world and a flat one and they are always menaced with careening over the tipping point. They're the lions of this rambling nonjudgmental film by Robert Altman. Their names are Bill and Charlie and they're played by Elliott Gould and George Segal with candid realism and unadulterated fussy weariness. We don't require any knowledge about gambling to grasp the adventure they pursue to the tracks to the private poker parties to the bars to Vegas to the gallows of failure to the scene of triumph. Their obsession is so vigorous that it moves us along.The disparity is between the deadened nomad of George Segal as opposed to the hysterical burlesque that Elliott Gould drifts through to obscure his hopelessness. We're amused by their hangovers their bruises nursed with hot shaving cream the loopy parttime prostitutes who supply them with breakfasts of Froot Loops and beer. We coast smoothly through the racket of their friends nonchalantly presented through Altman's penchant for overlapping dialogue and downplayed visual openers so that we're not so much shown new characters as guided to suppose we were already familiar with them.

Altman uses a gritty unobtrusive documentary style as he follows the fortunes of a couple of compulsive gamblers through real locations in Los Angeles and Reno. Quite many of the extras are obviously nonprofessional actors. This contributes to the movie's realism and helps to make its fantasy more believable. Director Altman and screenwriterco producer Joseph Walsh have also hung a few novel twists on the familiar plot. Walsh also plays the bookmaker who is hounding the Segal character. I thought this was the most memorable moment in the whole movie. True there are other scenes that are almost as good but the film does tend to become too talky. Many scenes are allowed to run far too long to justify the small point they are making. The Elliott Gould character in particular is allowed to alienate audience sympathy by giving him too much chatter and far too much scene and camera hogging. But despite these demerits the movie is often a fascinating expose of a particular way of life expertly photographed and often put together with an inspired use of sound and music to complement the action.".

Now I'm not a particular fan of the director since I'm partial to plot. Nonetheless CS held my interest as two compulsive gamblers Segal and Gould stumble through a life of poker craps racetracks and the Seven Dwarfs. For Segal gambling's like a mournful rut he gets little satisfaction from win or lose. For Gould nothing seems to faze his ditzy amble through life. Together they feed off one another Gould from Segal's knack at winning Segal from Gould's buoyant spirit. Trouble is they're obviously going nowhere though I'd like to have Segal's undemanding job that allows so much free time.Altman keeps things moving along with a steady supply of closeups and fluid camera. Thus we track the characters instead of a more conventional plot. There're also subtle moments of humor as when the guys obsess over the Seven Dwarfs' names. Or more obviously when an aging Bert Remsen appears in drag and soaks up phony compliments. Clearly Altman knows how to substitute both fluid style and colorful character for linear plotline. Nonetheless the fluid style is more akin to real life while colorful character supplies focal points of interest. And to say there's very little plot is not to say the movie lacks a point or is not about something. Here the point is poignantly expressed in the final shot. No doubt about it like his loose style or not Altman is a genuine movie auteur.".

Both Beery and Dressler have roles wellsuited to them and the two of them are thoroughly convincing in their relationship with each other.

But the team of Wallace Beery and Marie Dressler proved to be box office. It also proved that you didn't necessarily have to appeal to that all knowing youth market to have box office attraction. Min and Bill was definitely for the senior citizen trade.Director George Roy Hill created a real waterfront atmosphere for the telling of this story of an old woman who runs a cheap waterfront boarding house and the old fisherman who's her boyfriend. Min has a young girl living with her who was deposited on her doorstep by her mother who took off.Years later the mother played by Marjorie Rambeau comes back with a vengeance and wants her kid. The daughter is played by Dorothy Jordan who is now in a finishing school and about to be wed to a rich young man. Of course this sets up the final conflict. Marjorie Rambeau deserves some accolades as well for her performance as a waterfront tramp.Since the conflict between Dressler and Rambeau is what drives the film Beery is around but he's not central to the plot. Still even today he and Dressler provide a few good laughs.Marie Dressler who was in her sixties when she won her Oscar for Best Actress lived only four more years after this film was done. On the strength of this film she became a box office draw making something of a comeback from her days in vaudeville in the ragtime era where she was a star. She and Beery partnered again in the lighter Tugboat Annie.Min and Bill though a real antique from the early talkies retains a certain charm that still comes through for today's audience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Min and Bill 1930  out of 4 Marie Dressler picked up the Best Actress Oscar for her performance here as Min a waterfront rat who was given a small baby after its mother decided to run off. Min raised the kid to a young woman Dorothy Jordan along with the help of her friend Bill Wallace Beery but she is pretty much forced to throw her out to get her away from the trashy life on the waterfront. Then Min must do even more when the girl's drunken mother shows back up. The actual screenplay here by Frances Marion is pretty standard for the era as it really doesn't try to do too much but there are some excellent performances that make the film worth viewing. I've been rather hit and miss on my opinions of Dressler but there's no question that this film belongs to her and it's without question the best work I've seen from here. I guess this was a real coming out after apparently considering suicide only a few years earlier when she made her comeback in THE PATSY which eventually led to more roles and then this one which got her the Oscar. Again her look is just right for the film but I was amazed at how much heart and soul she pumped into her character and the film. This is a pretty dark little movie that doesn't take any comic turns or center on fake moments. The characters are shown as being ugly and trashy and it doesn't try to make them look good at any point. The film and Dressler's performance also makes it clear that ugly people can have good hearts which I believe is the real point of the film. I was surprised that the film took a few of the twists that it did but then again we're dealing with a precode era where happy situations weren't always forced on movies. Beery is also very good in his supporting role as his always plays the idiot well. I was also impressed with Jordan in her role and Marjorie Rambeau is fine as the drunken mother. Again the screenplay is pretty straight forward and simple and it was clearly written to fit Dressler and Beery but the two take it run with it and in the end deliver a nice little gem.".

Now of the age to attract men Jordan is the cause of woe for Dressler who desperately wants to keep her out of trouble. Sending her off to boarding school with the money she's saved up for her own old age Dressler then deals with Jordan's suddenly arrived mother and her own man the dump but loyal Wallace Beery. In the process Dressler gets a fast ride on a speed boat gets picked up after falling overboard by a giant ship's anchor beats up the philandering Beery and goes out of her way to protect her beloved Jordan all under the facade of a cold uncaring heart which is all along obviously a pretense.Dressler's big eyes expressing so much of what was underneath tells thousands of stories and this grand old scenestealer was definitely worthy of her Oscar for this film. With his Awe shucks attitude Beery is a worthy partner although in this case he wisely allows his costar Dressler to overshadow him just enough to deliver himself a delightfully subtle performance. Marjorie Rambeau's performance as the boozy mother is no match for Dressler's Mother Courage yet her performance is one that is never one dimensional or stereotypical. It is loaded with disappointment a living corpse filled with regret selfhatred and derivation. Jordan takes what could be a nambypamby heroine and instills it with many dimensions making her memorable as well especially among the pro's she's cast opposite.This is an early precode gem filled with MGM gloss inside the waterfront seediness of the Pacific North Coast and a perfect companion to the same year's Anna Christie in which Dressler perfected another memorable waterfront queen.".

Bill is played by Wallace Beery and he's basically a good natured drunk fisherman. Min is played by Marie Dressler and she's a very crusty lady who owns a combination barber shop bar and flophouse. Of the two Dressler is definitely the star and she spends a lot of time on camera behaving like a broken down old mule with a heart of goldbut she's very careful to hide that heart since it's taken her years to create her grumpy persona. For this sometimes funny and sometimes sad performance Ms. Dressler earned an Oscar for Best Actress. This is a tad surprising when you see the film. This isn't because she's badheck I'd watch ANYTHING with her in it because she was a wonderful actress. No it's more the type role she played and the fact that Marie was old and ugly by Hollywood standardsgenerally people earning Oscars are just prettier! Plus the type film a slight film at that this is seems pretty ordinary in many waysnot a big budget or high profile film.Now as for the plot itself is about a girl that Min has raised to her teen years. It seems that not only does the state want to take away the girl but the girl's selfish alcoholic mother tries to insinuate herself in their lives. To me though the plot was mostly secondary. You really see the film for the character Dressler plays and especially for the funny and amazing fight scene she did with Beery how the athletics in this didn't kill Ms. Dressler is beyond me.If you like Dressler in this film see some of her other films. She made many silent films such as TILLIE'S PUNCTURED ROMANCE with Charlie Chaplin as well as wonderful sound films like DINNER AT EIGHT and the very touching EMMA. Unfortunately when she finally became a firstclass star she was already in her 60s and died just a few years after receiving the Oscar.".

	schema:reviewBody "... we're still in the precode era when people were allowed to be hard living with the results of that hard living chiseled on their faces and bodies yet that didn't mean they were bad people. Min Marie Dressler runs a dockside inn and barber shop. She has what appears to be a boyfriend in old salt Bill Wallace Beery who is a tenant in the inn whenever he's not out fishing. Min is raising Nancy Dorothy Jordan who works all day at the inn. The funny thing is Dorothy Jordan was 24 when this film was made not 14 which is the age of the character she is playing when the film starts yet with her high pitched voice and rather child like looks she is believable.It is never said but Min probably works Nancy so hard so she doesn't have time to get in trouble. Min was probably a prostitute when she was younger because a prostitute gave her Nancy when she was a baby and she doesn't want Nancy getting into trouble like she did. Min has told her that her mother died not wanting the girl to know she was abandoned or to go looking for her mother because she is bad news.Min never sent Nancy to school because it just never occurred to her not because she didn't care about her future. When not only the truancy officers show up but so does some sailor who entices Nancy out to the back of the bar in the moonlight Min sends Nancy to live with a respectable couple to prevent Nancy from going down the same road she did.Then Nancy's mom shows up. The mother has told Min that she came looking for her kid so she could support her in her old age because she is a prostitute living on rapidly depleting assets and even though Min convinces her the child died years ago Min is worried. So she hands over her life savings to the couple raising Nancy on their word that they will use the money to immediately send her to a fancy finishing school far away. You know that money means something to Min because she had been talking about what she planned to do with that money in her old age. She completely lies about it to Nancy and tells her it was Nancy's mother's money.Then there is the fight of the century when Min catches Bill drinking and smooching with Nancy's mom in his room. She throws Nancy's mom out who is vowing revenge. And then Min turns her attention to Bill. Poor Bill. He is really fending off an attack more than he is fighting with her. He locks himself in a closet Min gets an axe! Not even the guy locked in the closet in Taxi who was facing James Cagney's bullets had more to be scared of than Bill at this moment. I'm not sure if it was because Bill was cheating on her or if it was WHO he was cheating on her with that caused this outburst but it is still very fun and very real today 86 years later.I will say this film ends with a homicide not Bill's a wedding and a final glimpse into Min's soul when she finally shows a mother's pride on her face as she looks on at Nancy all grown up facing a bright future even though the girl does not see her in the crowd.One thing I found very weird was how Min never showed any affection to Nancy yet Nancy thought the world of her. Maybe Min knew someday Nancy would grow up and didn't want her to be too attached when she had to send her away from the docks to save her from a future in prostitution. Maybe she didn't want to admit her feelings to herself because she always knew Nancy's mother could come back at any minute and just take her. We'll never know because she never says.All we know is Min is a good woman with a good heart who probably has nothing in her upbringing or in her past to show her the right way to raise a child she is just making this stuff up as she goes along but always has Nancy's best interest at heart. This should be shown on Mother's Day more often because it shows you don't have to give birth or be in the best or even good circumstances to show a mother's love and that giving birth does not necessarily make you a mother. Highly recommended.".

It is undoubtedly Beery's more restrained portrayal that finds a readier acceptance with modern audiences particularly as he is the victim in the film's wildest and most hilarious scene.Actually although he has more than a fair innings and is given almost as much of the lion's share of attention as Dressler Beery really has a subsidiary role to both Dorothy Jordan and Marjorie Rambeau. The movie should actually be titled Min and Nancy. It is Dorothy Jordan not Beery who partners Dressler in the film's main burst of story including the wellworked slapstick boat chase while Rambeau almost completely usurps Beery in the later stages of the scenario and so brilliantly provides the shattering climax. On the other hand though Jordan appears adequate enough in the film's metamorphosis scenes she seems a bit out of place though she tries hard as the kitchen slave.George W. Hill easily Metro's best director at this period handles both the savage comedy and the notears dramatics with equal skill and finesse. As in his previous movie The Big House he shows himself a master of both atmosphere and action.

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by George Hill with scenario and dialogue cowritten by the tremendously talented and not as well known as she should be Frances Marion this above average comedydrama features Marie Dressler's Oscar winning Best Actress performance. She plays a self sacrificing woman who raises her floozy friend's daughter as her own protecting her as a mother would a cub while employing a tough love style that goes part and parcel with the demeanor she's earned running an Inn on the docks.Paired for the first of many times with Dressler is Wallace Beery playing a sea captain fisherman who doubles as her friend and we're led to believe lover  together they are Min and Bill. Dorothy Jordan plays Nancy Smith the girl Min has raised for Bella Pringle played enthusiastically and wonderfully credibly by Marjorie Rambeau.Min must deal with a truant officer DeWitt Jennings as she employs Nancy in her dockside Inn while at the same time she tries to keep Nancy from another seaman Alec Johnson Russell Hopton who would like nothing better than to date the virgin Nancy. So Min puts Nancy in the care of Mr.  Mrs. Southard Frank McGlynn  Gretta Gould the school superintendent. She and Bill share an understanding he knows how much Nancy means to Min.However Bill doesn't know that the experienced woman he's just met over drinks in the bar is Nancy's real mother. After catching the two together drinking and playing cards in a room Min is furious. A fight like one you've never seen ensues. Seeing Bella again to whom she'd lied about Nancy saying that her daughter had died causes Min to hurriedly and secretly take her nest egg all that she'd saved through the years in a sock in her bedroom and give it to the Southards for them to send her abroad for her education.Two years later Nancy returns from school with plans to marry Dick Cameron Donald Dillaway the rich boy from town whom she and Min had earlier taunted when she'd been too ignorant and unattractive and not attracted to him. Ironically Bella had been on the same returning ship and had actually been put off by the couple's snootiness towards her having had a man in her cabin which wasn't allowed in those days!.Of course the truth will come out  Bella will learn that Nancy is actually her very much alive daughter  forcing Min to take drastic steps to protect her surrogate daughter's one chance for happiness. The film's last scene which has Min unable to save herself per the lure of seeing Nancy with Dick on their wedding day must have been on director King Vidor's mind when he staged the ending of Stella Dallas 1937 with Barbara Stanwyck watching her daughter Anne Shirley.".

She plays a self sacrificing woman who raises her floozy friend's daughter as her own protecting her as a mother would a cub while employing a tough love style that goes part and parcel with the demeanor she's earned running an Inn on the docks.Paired for the first of many times with Dressler is Wallace Beery playing a sea captain fisherman who doubles as her friend and we're led to believe lover  together they are Min and Bill. Dorothy Jordan plays Nancy Smith the girl Min has raised for Bella Pringle played enthusiastically and wonderfully credibly by Marjorie Rambeau.Min must deal with a truant officer DeWitt Jennings as she employs Nancy in her dockside Inn while at the same time she tries to keep Nancy from another seaman Alec Johnson Russell Hopton who would like nothing better than to date the virgin Nancy. So Min puts Nancy in the care of Mr.  Mrs. Southard Frank McGlynn  Gretta Gould the school superintendent. She and Bill share an understanding he knows how much Nancy means to Min.However Bill doesn't know that the experienced woman he's just met over drinks in the bar is Nancy's real mother. After catching the two together drinking and playing cards in a room Min is furious. A fight like one you've never seen ensues. Seeing Bella again to whom she'd lied about Nancy saying that her daughter had died causes Min to hurriedly and secretly take her nest egg all that she'd saved through the years in a sock in her bedroom and give it to the Southards for them to send her abroad for her education.Two years later Nancy returns from school with plans to marry Dick Cameron Donald Dillaway the rich boy from town whom she and Min had earlier taunted when she'd been too ignorant and unattractive and not attracted to him. Ironically Bella had been on the same returning ship and had actually been put off by the couple's snootiness towards her having had a man in her cabin which wasn't allowed in those days!.Of course the truth will come out  Bella will learn that Nancy is actually her very much alive daughter  forcing Min to take drastic steps to protect her surrogate daughter's one chance for happiness. The film's last scene which has Min unable to save herself per the lure of seeing Nancy with Dick on their wedding day must have been on director King Vidor's mind when he staged the ending of Stella Dallas 1937 with Barbara Stanwyck watching her daughter Anne Shirley.";

	schema:reviewBody "Until catching Marie Dressler in this film I'd never considered a woman would have been described as a curmudgeon. She's all that here though in her role as Min proprietress of a dockside boarding house saloon and barber shop. Her performance earned her an Oscar win as Best Actress against some formidable competition that year  Marlene Dietrich Irene Dunne Ann Harding and Norma Shearer. I haven't seen any of the films those actresses appeared in so I can't comment on that score but I didn't consider Dressler's performance to be that outstanding as it was pretty much a one note portrayal all the way as a grumpy old lady. I was waiting for the heart of gold to shine through at some point and there were hints but it never came across in a big way.Wallace Beery is Min's sometimes suitor in the story at first I thought they were a married couple but that was quickly proved otherwise. Their wild brawl about the middle of the picture looked like it was staged by a couple of WWE main eventers and I couldn't help thinking Jack Nicholson's role in The Shining might have been inspired by Min's taking an axe to Bill during the melee. Can you imagine if she had connected? At the center of the story is Nancy Dorothy Jordan a ward of Min's who's been with the innkeeper since abandoned by her prostitute mother at the age of six months. Since she appeared to be almost an adult I was taken aback a bit when the authorities came calling wanting to remove her from Min's keeping. A bigger eye opener however was when the creepy fisherman Alec Russell Hopton made a fairly overt proposition of prostitution to Nancy should he whisk her off to Seattle. Fortunately that idea never got very far.One would presume a happy ending here when Nancy realizes that her returning mom Bella Pringle Marjorie Rambeau was indeed a former hooker and had designs on cashing in on her marriage to a well heeled young man. Nancy's would be reconciliation with Min never gets a chance to take place though and in a fadeout reminiscent of Cagney in Angels With Dirty Faces Min is marched off by the cops to face the music for dispatching Bella.With their performances Dressler and Beery achieved renewed critical acclaim and when they placed their hand prints in cement at Grauman's Chinese Theater a year later owner Sid Grauman called them 'America's Newest Sweethearts'. I don't want to be too critical of that comment but from the perspective of eighty six years after the film came out as I write this that's about enough to make one gag.".

Unfortunately he doesn't get any help from Charisse who seems terribly out of sorts as if disinterest has taken over her whole body.Don't misunderstand Assassination in Rome is far from being terrible. In fact many of the set pieces work quite well. The final  of the movie does provide a few chills and a suspenseful moment or two.

I don't care if Cyd Charisse was getting a bit on in years in 1965 I know that those legs were still fantastic.

The effects werent that bad either.  Its classic to see when a killer uses his hand to grab the person into the room with the lights off in a dark hallway or when a person gets decapitated with an axe in a shadow like segment because its like watching an old who dunnit? movie.  Aside from all that I suggest you watch the film carefully and it will make sense to you like it did to me.  Rent it first but if your a die hard horror fan like Iam who loves horror films especially slasher movies then buy it.  LOVE the death scene of that teacher with the nails and scalpel in the dark class room and nice FX job on the bodies in the decaying dead classmates in the abandoned basement of the school!".

There are some good things about thisthe performances by Alex Rocco going WAY over the top Brendan Hughes as the babyfaced hero and Lori Lethin as the final girl are very good and there are a few funny moments.

The script meanders all over the place and the film within a film surprises got tedious real quick. Also the final search and showdown with the killer goes on for 30 MINUTES!!! Then there's multiple twists and turns at the end...but it's too little too late. Basically I was bored and the lousy murders were really insulting. Also there's a truly dreadful performance by Richard Brestoff it's so bad it's almost embarrassing to watch and Maureen McCormick and Vince Edwards walk through their roles.A lot of people find this so bad that it's goodbut I was too bored to enjoy it. Also there's a young handsome George Clooney in thisbut he disappears within the first 15 minutes.A rightfully forgotten horror film. I give it a 1.".

I've seen at least a few hundred from the era myself but try as I might I can't think of one less enjoyable than this wretched and useless pile of offal.It's to be expected that since this is an awful movie about a film crew making an awful movie coherence could potentially be an issue. But Return To Horror High doesn't even seem interested in making sense and the way the film jumps around from the aftermath of the murders to the the timeline of the killings to scenes from the moviewithinthemovie at times it seems like the filmmakers who made this film not the filmmakers we see making the film in this film are almost daring you to keep up with what's going on. One sequence even shifts into a dream in which one of the actresses in this film AND the film inside the film imagines her demise during a take. Yes friends this is a scene in a film that turns out to be dream about a scene in a film within a film. Obviously linear plot structure isn't on the menu here. Granted this isn't necessarily a requirement for an enjoyable B horror flick or an enjoyable B horror flick within a B horror flick for that matter... okay I'll stop now but if the only reason this film exists is to present a series of creative deaths it would definitely help matters if we could make sense of who's getting killed and why.It's clear that there is a big emphasis on comedy here but with only a couple of chuckleworthy lines and exactly ONE humorous sight gag Return To Horror High is the rare film that fails miserably at both genres it tackles. It's probably good that the film doesn't take itself too seriously but since a lot of the gore is played for unattained yuks the frequent murders lose any semblance of impact and ultimately become as annoying as the rest of the scenes in this trainwreck.Though he's billed first on the DVD cover and second in the IMDb listing young George Clooney only appears in the film for roughly five minutes. In fact his character in the movie walks off the set during filming because he's offered a better role elsewhere and one gets the sense that this is exactly what happened to cause Clooney's abbreviated presence since he doesn't even turn up during the finale when every other victim slain along the way makes a reappearance. At least those who are tuning in merely to catch a comical glimpse of prefame Clooney get off pretty easy since they can turn this miserable waste of time off 10 minutes in and save themselves the agony of enduring the 80 additional minutes that follow.Another noteworthy bit of casting is the presence of Maureen Marsha Brady McCormick who has a lot less to be embarrassed about than the rest of the cast. McCormick actually drums up a few funny scenes and she is by far the best thing in the film. I realize that's tantamount to being the best quadriplegic swimmer of all time but work with me here... I'm trying to find at least one nice thing to say about this movie.Of course in a film this convoluted it isn't too surprising that there's a twist ending within the twist ending the second part of which is about as wholly ridiculous and insulting to the audience as any ending I can think of in cinematic history. The filmmakers even have the gall to set things up for a sequel Return To Return To Horror High? but we can breathe a collective sigh of relief that no one was clamoring for a franchise thus we were spared the indignity of having to sit through a second installment.I love bad movies but this one is simply unbearable. I already sat through it but I implore anyone who reads this to avoid making the dreadful mistake I did even worse I BOUGHT this damn thing!. Anchor Bay is usually a reliable source for forgotten classics but wasting the time and effort required to give this film a digital remaster is a rare misstep in the company's stellar track record.This is as bad as they come. Please let any lingering curiosity you have about this film end with this review.".

Think that's confusing to imagine? Just wait till you watch this movie. Some filmmakers are trying to create a horror movie based on a few slayings at a high school. They're filming in the same high school stalked by the same killer no less. Now while the body count is building up you have two stories going on. The first is the keystone cop types investigating a murder while the movie and murdering is going on. Then you have one of the cast members and technical supervisors trying to figure out who the killer is. There's a lot of little fooled you moments but after a while it begins to get pretty agravating when you come to ask whether or not a killer exists at all and whether the killer is even human and consequently invincible...which then makes you wonder what's the point. This horror movie was so stupid it doesn't even deserve a PG rating. The special effects are simply laughable...people have made better student films in their own garages. In one scene Maureen McCormick who plays one of the investigating cops picks up an arm that is an obvious piece of foam. When she shows it to her supervisor he jumps back in horror and she follows suit. I kept waiting for the part where she says gotcha and tells him she picked it up from the prop department remember they're filming the movie at the school. I was ready to turn off the whole thing when it came to the Scooby Doo ending. And I can't even begin to figure out what the point was of the finale fakeout involving the film crew. And there's even an 80s romance sequence with an awful 80s song creating a scene that doesn't even seem in line with the rest of the mood of the movie. The whole movie was a mess of a bad story poor effects bad acting especially from the science teacher. And it wasn't even bad enough to be funny. It was just simply bad.".

More of a spoof flick than a horror film Return to Horror High pokes a little harmless fun at the horror genre. The title suggests that it's a sequel it's not. It's just attempting to spoof countless other slasher films. It would have worked too if the director could have made more sense out of the writer's material even though he had a hand in the screenplay I'm pretty sure the writer's were all high. Too many flashback sequences and movies within movies make it terribly hard to follow. So the film just falls flat by its twist ending within twist ending. Also hurting the film was the audience reaction. Most people don't get it it's not meant to be a serious horror offering. And those who do get it don't find it that funny. It's simply too muddled. I can't make much sense out of it either to tell you the truth. I don't know what this movie's about I don't know what the filmmakers were trying to do and I don't care. You know why because it's terrible and hilarious in all its glorious retarded splendor. If it had made sense I don't think I would have laughed so hard. Utter trash that's utterly hilarious. Some familiar faces include Marcia Brady Alex Rocco Brendan Hughes Howling VI and even a prefame George Clooney. Serious horror buffs shouldn't bother themselves with it. But if you want to see a flick that in no way can be pieced together and is near impossible to figure out check out Return to Horror High. Now if only someone would do a prequel they could just call it Horror High.".

It is strange though...some parts of the film work very well.  With a better script and director this film actually might have been good.  The idea is certainly original.  It deals with a lowbudget film crew who are making a film about a series of true murders that happened at a high school years before.  To top it off they are using the actual high school as the setting for the film!  That part is easy to understand.  Where the film becomes a mess is when it jumps from the past to present to the film being filmed to reality and so forth. When we think something is real it turns out to be part of the movie that they are shooting. Again there are some inspired moments in the film such as the disection scene and the creep room in the basement but even those are destroyed by the confusion of whether they are fact or fiction.  But none of that matters because the ending of this film is it's main downfall. What kind of police officers and paramedics were these people when they couldn't tell a real dead body from a fake one??!!  What was the point of the crew faking the murders??  Were there ever any murders to begin with??? What did any of the rest of the movie have to do with the final confrontation scene at in the basement??  So many unanswered questions and I find it hard to understand how this got released being as confusing as it is.  A total let down considering the description that the box gives.  A 3 out of 10 only because it was an original idea that could have been pulled of so well in other hands.".

As such I appreciated fully the significance of the cameo appearances of all those TV western stars. TV westerns were at their height at that time so anyone who saw this knew for instance that Ward Bond was Major Seth Adams of Wagon Train. Today I wager that viewers will recognize Bond as Bert the Cop from It's A Wonderful Life unless Wagon Train is being run on Hallmark at the time. Similarly Gail Davis as Annie Oakley or Hugh O'Brian as Wyatt Earp a show I wish some cable channel would pick up. Nice gag but dated now.Nevertheless its a very funny picture with the lovely Rhonda Fleming as Jesse's girl and beneficiary until she falls for Hope. So many smart women keep falling for Hope the schnook in his films. Wendell Corey is a crafty Jesse James with Jim Dallas Davis as brother Frank. And of course the obligatory appearance by Bing Crosby.".

There is nothing out of the ordinary here that we haven't seen before in most other Hope vehicles and as a huge fan of The Paleface and the even better Son Of Paleface I would point readers to those pictures by way of them being far better.

BOB HOPE of course takes the assignment and gets mixed up with the James brothers brother Frank James is played by JIM DAVIS.

About the only ones missing are Paladin Hopalong Cassidy  the Lone Ranger Tonto is there though...I think this was filmed during the time that Clayton Moore was in a salary dispute with his TV producers...maybe that explains his absence?. Gene Autry was in the theatrical release but was cut out of the version that plays on TV now...probably because his widow wouldn't give legal permission.

Wish I could get a hold of the soundtrack.There will never be another Bob Hope. Seems like comedy today is nothing but dirt. Bob's was clean and funny and adult.

If you like comedy westerns this is a great one.I can't get over the music though. Guy Mitchell had one of the best voices ever. And these original songs are classic. Wish I could get a hold of the soundtrack.There will never be another Bob Hope. Seems like comedy today is nothing but dirt. Bob's was clean and funny and adult.

With her singsong voice Ma comes across as a kindly old lady only to resort to the shotgun when Rhonda Fleming jumps ship in her wedding dress and flees with Hope.The plot is hilarious. The inept Farnsworth sells James an insurance policy and James in turn plans to have Hope dressed like him and killed so that he can enjoy the 100000 that the policy is worth. What's even funnier is that dance hall queen Cora Lee Fleming falls for Hope.The picture provides good laughs and was appropriate for the 1950s light comedies with Hope.".

	schema:headline " Another Comedy Western Spoof tailored to Bob Hope. It could be called THE PALEFACE III.";
	schema:reviewBody "If our recollections are correct there was an awful lot of buildup and expectation of this film. It was advertised and plugged quite a bit as being THE New Bob Hope starring vehicle attributing something special to it. Mr. Hope even made a seemingly serious remark about hoping that this ALIAS JESSE JAMES Paramount 1959 was Oscar material.It wasn't really that special but it was very good and probably a cut above most of the other movies of that period. It seems that there was a big change in screen comedy in those days. Dean  Jerry had parted company in 1956 after a decade together. Abbott  Costello had been inactive what with Bud Abbott first retiring then Lou Costello setting out on his own only to meet an early death in March of 1959.Even though Bing and Bob usually made gag cameos in each others' films there hadn't been any joint effort from them no Road pictures since ROAD TO BALI 1952. In the interim Mr. Hope's screen projects were all pretty much in keeping with the laugh standards previously established. Bob even ventured out of the usual with a couple of dramatic parts. In THE SEVEN LITTLE FOYS Paramount 1955 he portrayed vaudevillian Eddy Foy and turned in fine performance in the process. Two years later Bob took the role of New York City's colorful Prohibition Era bigger than life character Mayor Jimmy Walker Paramount 1957. Of course there were other film projects his Television Show and don't forget he always spent his Christmas Holidays away from home entertaining our Men and Women in the Armed Forces who were stationed overseas.So back we go to today's 'Mystery Challenger' ALIAS JESSE JAMES.OUR STORY..In the proverbial nutshell a tenderfoot Insurance Salesman Milford Farnsworth Mr. Hope sells a 100000.00 insurance policy on the Outlaw Jesse James to a man unknown to be Jesse himself Wendell Corey. Jesse then plans to collect on the policy by having another person killed and identified as Jesse. Of course you'd never guess just who that guy could be! That's it a very thin premise with which to make a movie. Yes we agree but that's really all that is needed. If put in to proper skilled hands of some veteran comedy gag menwriters and a capable Director of comedy it can be expanded. This certainly was the case here.It is the jokes the sight gags and the In humor of the ensuing situations' making up the scenes that propel the story forward that makes it all happen. We have the basic premise so often used of the Dude or the Tenderfoot if you will who winds up facing down all the henchmen before confronting the Big Shot boss. It has been the central theme of oh so many films.Our favourite gag involved Bob's running to a young bespectacled boy playing a piano in the saloon. When Bob asked him his name he replied Harry Truman! The film promised to have a big surprise in the finale giving it a little more punch as well as a carload of laughs. What it turned out to be was Cameos by a whole bunch of Western Stars from the Movies and Television. Remember this was the 1950's and the Western Series was the 'A' number 1 staple of the Networks' Primetime Schedule.As a result of this we have quick surprise appearances by James Arness Marshall Matt Dillon on GUNSMOKE Ward Bond Major Adams on WAGON TRAIN Gail Davis TV's ANNIE OAKLEY James Garner the brother Brett on MAVERICK Hugh O'Brian WYATT Earp Fess Parker DAVEY CROCKETT Roy Rogers Self and Jay Silver heals Tonto from THE LONE RANGER.It was a truly peculiar occurrence that the one Guest Star who we kids didn't recognize was doubtless the best known on the Big Screen as it was Gary Cooper! He even had a line of dialogue to say. It was Yup! Whether or not this was Oscar material for Mr. Bob Hope is strictly up to ones' own judgment and conjecture. It was certainly much better a vehicle for him than some of the other following projects such as CALL ME BWANA 1963 A GLOBAL AFFAIR 1964 and I'LL TAKE SWEEDEN 1965. As for teaming up with Bing it appeared that he and Mr. Crosby had gone to the well once too often with THE ROAD TO HONG KONG United Artists 1962.".

For some reason a helpful Indian princess shows up along the way. Preposterousness aside I had fun watching this film. The plot is really just an excuse for Bob Hope to entertain by feigning courage before comically sinking back into cowardice. While I mainly enjoyed Alias Jesse James as a Bob Hope fan the film also benefits from Rhonda Fleming as Hope's genuinely lovely love interest and western fans should get a kick out of the ending. I would advise those who are not yet Bob Hope fans to see Road to Morocco or another one of his more wellknown films first  you've really got to be a fan of Bob Hope and of corny screwball comedies to enjoy Alias Jesse James.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this move in 1959 as an 11yearold and thought it was the funniest thing I had ever seen. When Hope jumps into the back of the buckboard and falls through and can't climb out so he's forced to run to keep up with the horses his legs were a blur and I remember laughing so hard my ribs ached.I'm well past 11 today and I see things differently. The scene in question evoked not so much as a chuckle from me when I saw it recently though it was fun to reconnect with such a vivid memory from my childhood. It was the same sense of deja vu I got watching Gene Autry and the Phantom Empire.Even by the low movie standards of Bob Hope this is lesser Hope. He doesn't act in this movie he monologues. It's one oneliner after another. And really becomes quite tedious after awhile.The premise .. not that anyone cares .. Hope plays an insurance agent who sells a policy to Jesse James played by Wendell Corey who was terrible. James is a somewhat highrisk customer so Hope is sent out by his company to protect their investment by protecting James which puts him at risk from all sorts of people and goingson including Jesse James himself. The idea is Hope's character gets into one hopeless situation after another and comes through without a scratch oblivious even to what's going on then offers some awful oneline commentary on what just happened. Repeat for 90 minutes. Boring.There's a ton of cameos at the end of the picture from many of your favorite western stars Hugh O'Brien Ward Bond James Arness Gary Cooper Gail Davis Fess Parker Roy Rogers and many others. All these characters appear without explanation to side Hope's character in the climactic gunfight.My favorite was Jay Silverheels as Tonto who plonks one of the James Gang with an arrow in the back and in the denouement of the picture this same guy arrow sticking from his back gets up and walks meekly off to jail. If you're beginning to feel this was a live action LooneyTune you're getting the picture of what this picture was about.Rhonda Fleming was slumming and stuck in this disaster with Hope but she never looked lovelier. Lord but that was a beautiful woman! In addition to the cameos mentioned earlier this movie featured some of my favorite minorleague players Jim Davis as Frank James craggyfaced Will Wright as Hope's boss and the exoticlooking Gloria Talbot as an Indian princess.I loved it in spite of myself. 6 out of 10.".

Jesse made his beneficiary the lovely Cora Lee Rhonda Fleming and he plans to murder the agent Hope and make people believe Hope is Jesse James so the real Jesse can stay with the insurance money. Wendell Corey who played Jesse in The Great Missouri Raid 1951 is Jesse again and Jim Davis is Frank. Norman Z. McLeod  is the director he also directed The Paleface1948. I kept wondering when Bing Crosby was going to show up and the best thing about this film are the cameos unfortunately Gene Autry and James Garner Maverick had their scenes deleted. But we can't complain  there are Gary Cooper Bing James Arness Hugh O' Brian Gail Davies Annie Oakley Roy Rogers Trigger Ward Bond Iron Eyes Cody Jay Silverheels Tonto Scatman Crothers Fess Parker and others... isn' that plenty?".

But smiling also is pleasant and so is this film with the incredible story of a an insurance agent who sells a policy to Jesse James. Jesse made his beneficiary the lovely Cora Lee Rhonda Fleming and he plans to murder the agent Hope and make people believe Hope is Jesse James so the real Jesse can stay with the insurance money. Wendell Corey who played Jesse in The Great Missouri Raid 1951 is Jesse again and Jim Davis is Frank. Norman Z. McLeod  is the director he also directed The Paleface1948. I kept wondering when Bing Crosby was going to show up and the best thing about this film are the cameos unfortunately Gene Autry and James Garner Maverick had their scenes deleted. But we can't complain  there are Gary Cooper Bing James Arness Hugh O' Brian Gail Davies Annie Oakley Roy Rogers Trigger Ward Bond Iron Eyes Cody Jay Silverheels Tonto Scatman Crothers Fess Parker and others... isn' that plenty?";

So he ends up in a western town that resides one Jesse James Wendell Corey. Guess who Milford ends up selling his insurance to? There's also a lovely lass named Cora Lee Collins Rhonda Fleming in tow. I'll stop there and just say that I liked many of the wisecracks that Hope did but what I really found funny was some of the visual gags like Hope's hat changing shape when drinking whiskey him accidentally using a rattlesnake to beat a ferocious creature or seeing a brawl in slow motion after Bob spiked a punch with mushrooms that last bit was a big surprise to me since I thought drug humor didn't appear in mainstream movies until the late '60s. There were also some amusing cameos of mostly western TV stars at the end though one of those was actually of a wellknown costar of Bob's that I won't dare reveal here if you don't know what I'm talking about. Oh and one more thing the reason I watched this now was because I have been reviewing many movies and TV episodes of the stars of the original Dallas in chronological order since midJune when the new version premiered on TNT. So when I found out Jim Davis appeared here as Jesse's brother Frank I had to check this out. He has a funny scene with Hope when they're playing cards. So on that note I recommend Alias Jesse James.".

Although Alias Jesse James was produced 15 years before Mel Brooks Blazing Saddles  it is still an equally enjoyable westerncomedy.Mel Brooks plays Milford Farnsworth an insurance salesman from New York whose career is failing.  Farnsworth unknowingly sells a lifeinsurance policy to Jesse James Wendell Corey at a bar. When his employer finds out that Jesse James is a policy holder in the company he sends Farnsworth to the west to try and get Jesse James to cancel his policy and if he won't he wants Farnsworth to protect his life.  There is an ironic scene on a train where Jesse James robs Farnsworth of his own premium return.  Farnsworth is then left to protect Jesse James at all costs.Farnsworth meets Cora Lee Collins Rhonda Fleming Jesse James love interest and mistakingly falls in love with her.  Throughout the rest of the movie Farnsworth fears for his own life while protecting the life of Jesse James.  The best scene in the movie is the shootout at the end where Farnsworth never hits anyone but thinks that he does because there are citizens hiding in doorways and windows doing Farnsworth's job for him.If you are in the mood for a clean comedy with an enjoyable plot this is the movie for you. It is a nice break from the comedies today that rely on sexual jokes and pure stupidity. I saw it on AMC but I definitely plan on buying it and adding it to my library.".

Hope's character is a hapless insurance salesman who's latest client is the notorious outlaw who figures on cashing in by having his alterego Martin Farnsworth Hope replace him in a pine box.In hindsight I guess one could question the choice of Wendell Corey to portray Jesse James since he doesn't have any significant Western movie or TV screen credits. By contrast Jim Davis starred as Matt Clark Railroad Detective in the early Western TV series Stories of the Century and also appeared in a passel of movie Westerns. Corey did portray Frank James in 1951's The Great Missouri Raid so maybe flipflopping their roles here might have made more sense but Corey did a pretty good job anyway.As saloon gal and Jesse's fianc Cora Lee Collins Rhonda Fleming seemed to get prettier throughout the picture but falling for Hope's Farnsworth character seemed a bit of a stretch for me. But let's face it it would have meant a one way ticket out of the Dirty Dog saloon so I guess you can't blame her.Say did you catch the bit with Milford Farnsworth's horse pushing him along to his showdown with Snake Brice? Back in 1952's Son of Paleface Bob Hope was upstaged by Roy Rogers' horse Trigger in a bedroom scene that was just hilarious. You read that right but I won't give it away here you'll just have to look it up yourself.Getting back to my earlier tease  the final shoot out with Farnsworth and Jesse's gang was a veritable trip down memory lane for long time Western fans. Making cameos in order of appearance were Wyatt Earp Hugh O'Brian Major Seth Adams Ward Bond Marshal Matt Dillon James Arness Roy Rogers Davy Crockett Fess Parker Annie Oakley Gail Davis Gary Cooper and Tonto Jay Silverheels. Each one shot a bad guy only to be upstaged by the Bingster who told the viewer Hope could use all the help he could get. Actually I think he got it.".

And this is one of those films.There are three basic attitudes toward Bob Hope and most actors  you're a fan you're at the opposite end of the spectrum or you take each film or project on a casebycase basis. There are times I can remember watching a Hope film and laughing out loud. Then there are those times I simply smile. This is one of the latter.This film was produced by Bob's own production company and perhaps that is one of the reasons is has a sort of cheap television look to it although it is in color. For example using exactly the same shot of a train rolling through the western countryside in two different spots in the film. Was it the train to nowhere? A couple of things about Hope's character in this film didn't quite make it. Instead of playing the coward who redeems himself...which he was so good at...he was actually rather brave though foolish in this film. I don't feel that went over so well. As was true in so many of the later Hope films he was sort of a ladies' man here. Again a lot less funny than his earlier personas. And as it seemed to me as in The Seven Little Foys a much better Hope film which was produced four years earlier that Hope was sort of walking through this film. His oneliners weren't so snappy here...a talent he had once honed to perfection. Had Hope been spoiled by his success in television by this time? I'm not saying there aren't some fun moments here. There are. Particularly the main gunfight when there are cameo appearances by stars such as Roy Rogers Bing Crosby very funny one liner Gary Cooper and several stars of television westerns.I have several Hope movies on my DVD shelf as well as a couple dozen of his television shows. This film will never find a place on my DVD shelf. If you want to see a really funny Hope in a western comedy try The Paleface  Hope much more in his prime.".

His oneliners weren't so snappy here...a talent he had once honed to perfection. Had Hope been spoiled by his success in television by this time? I'm not saying there aren't some fun moments here. There are. Particularly the main gunfight when there are cameo appearances by stars such as Roy Rogers Bing Crosby very funny one liner Gary Cooper and several stars of television westerns.I have several Hope movies on my DVD shelf as well as a couple dozen of his television shows. This film will never find a place on my DVD shelf. If you want to see a really funny Hope in a western comedy try The Paleface  Hope much more in his prime.";

Both men have a similarly nutty knockabout comic sensibility with a touch of the surreal and this wacky farce about a motley crew of Miami citizens embroiled in a race to recover an atomic bomb seemed like the perfect vehicle for them to pool their talents on.  Well it was! Hubby and I had a grand time  but alas we seemed to be among the very few moviegoers who even gave the flick a chance!  I guess it didn't help that BIG TROUBLE's originallyscheduled December 2001 release was delayed due to worries that a plot involving smuggling an Abomb through laissezfaire airport security would seem more disturbing than funny after the horrific events of 9112001.  Maybe most audiences are still too spooked right now to appreciate the satiric possibilities in Sonnenfeld  Co.'s cynically funny Billy Wilderesque treatment of these elements  but I hope that down the line folks will give BIG TROUBLE a chance because really it's like what might have resulted if Billy Wilder had ever had an opportunity to direct The Marx Brothers.  We were laughing throughout!  The ensemble cast is superb from Patrick Warburton and Janeane Garofalo as members of Miami's Finest to Tom Sizemore and Johnny Knoxville as dunderheaded crooks to Tim Allen and Rene Russo's chemistry as single well unhappily married in Russo's case parents who get drawn into the shenanigans when their respective teenage kids Ben Foster and Zooey Deschanel both delightful  I wouldn't be surprised if these two became big stars someday! accidentally foil a hit on Stanley Tucci hilariously obnoxious as Russo's dreadful second husband by Jack Kehler and Dennis Farina spoofing his earlier role in Sonnenfeld's GET SHORTY adaptation.  Everybody gets a moment to shine even Jason Lee as a hippydippy drifter and Sofia Vergara who looks remarkably like a Latina Denise Richards as Tucci's putupon maid. C'mon give this unfairly underappreciated gem a chance when it hits home video!".

It recognises that the audience doesn't want a film as a fashion statement but merely as a form of entertainment. The makers also recognise that they don't have the material here to entertain and inform at the same time so they just concentrate on making the best comedy that they can. It is for this reason most of all that they succeed.The strengths of this film are actors like Tim Allen Jason Lee Dennis Farina and Tom Sizemore. I never thought I would say that about Allen but it appears that when you give him decent material he can actually make something out of it. Jason Lee is a pleasant surprise as the unwashed hippie who seems to just magically appear in a tree you have to see it to believe it. Tom Sizemore however really steals the show as the thug who just doesn't quite seem to have the brainpower to do anything correctly.Put simply this is a crime caper that was intended for families who want to be able to take their preteen children to something with this kind of plot and not be worried about the content. Whether you agree with this marketing philosophy or not it does allow for success of a different kind namely that it succeeds because it is so unreal that the viewer can laugh without getting disgusted by some of the characters.The things that detract from this comedy are some weak supporting actors. Zooey Deschanel even gives the camera the old stunned mullet look at times while Patrick Warburton only seems to know one expression. Stanley Tucci can't give us anything to sympathise with his character over and Sofia Vergara seems completely doomed to be a bit player for whatever little career she might have. The running length is a bit of a twoedged sword  on one hand it makes sure that the film is never boring and no scene goes on for longer than its welcome. On the other hand possibilities for interesting subplots are often passed over.In the end I gave the film a seven out of ten. It's not rocket science but if you sit back in your chair with a beer and some popcorn preferably with some friends to share your disbelief with it makes a good piece of entertainment that won't make you wish you could have those 85 or so minutes back. Recommended for those in a lighthearted mood.".

We begin by finding out that a nuclear weapon has found its way into Miami. After a several scenes a couple of stupid excons hijack the weapon and make for the Bahamas. Its up to the good guys to stop the dummies from blowing Miami and yours truly skyhigh.While this movie is sidesplittingly funny I found most of the humor as a big inside joke. This movie parodies many of the more annoying aspects of Miami. For instance when Tim Allen's character calls 911 he is greeted by a woman speaking in SPANISH rather than ENGLISH. The security people at the Airport with that personality that only THEY have. But most hilarious of all the way Florida Gator fans are portrayed because when the Gators lose they really do have nothing to say because the GATORS SUCK! BTW I'm an FSU fan.Anywho this movie is funny for practical reasons and for me personal reasons. But whatever the reason it deserves more respect than it got from critics.

I have enjoyed both of Dave Barry's humor novelsthis and Tricky Business. They made me laugh out loud as did this movie. I think it captures the spirit of the book perfectly. For those that have laughed at Dennis Farina from his roles in Get Shorty and even Snatch he has never been funnier as a hit man who encounters unexpected roadblocks literally on his trip to do a quick sniper job. Tom Sizemore is also excellent as the dumbest crook you'll ever see. Sonnenfeld's touch and a good soundtrack contribute to this madcap misadventure where a hallucinogenic toad a subcompact car and a 'garbage disposal' bomb make for an outrageous race to save a corporate embezzler's stepdaughter.

It's the most logical sequence of ridiculous events I have ever witnessed. Everything makes perfect sense.Not only that but there are a ton of characters and each one has a distinct personality each one is funny in their own way.There are some tough choice in life.

There weren't any huge belly laughs but there was almost a constant stream of chuckles.  The plot of a Russian arms trader working out of a small Miami bar gives the opportunity for a group of characters including a drifter a maid few high school kids a couple of hit men the fbi the local police a corrupt business exec a couple of small time crooks and an ad man to all become entangled in the same search for a stolen weapon.  The story is told in kind of a merrygoround fashion with no one really stealing the show.   You get to know a little about each character when another story line comes along to merge with the one before it.  I enjoyed the light hearted nature of the film and the humor.".

	schema:reviewBody "This Fireman certain misfires. The script was originally intended to surface as an Abbott and Costello picture but fortunately for AC the studio had second thoughts and decided to use the script as a vehicle for Spike Jones and his City Slickers instead with Buddy Hackett in the Costello role and Hugh O'Brian as a Bud Abbott substitute. It didn't work! Only the musical numbers were successful. The best of them was a loony rendition of In a Persian Market which had the double advantage of being out of copyright and didn't cost Universal a cent.

The script was originally intended to surface as an Abbott and Costello picture but fortunately for AC the studio had second thoughts and decided to use the script as a vehicle for Spike Jones and his City Slickers instead with Buddy Hackett in the Costello role and Hugh O'Brian as a Bud Abbott substitute. It didn't work! Only the musical numbers were successful. The best of them was a loony rendition of In a Persian Market which had the double advantage of being out of copyright and didn't cost Universal a cent.

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers belowAmbush Bay is the posterchild of how to make a war film based solely on clichs. Regardless the result is a very entertaining look at espionage in the Pacific Theater.Days before MacArthur's fleet is to return to the Philippines a squad of Marines is dropped on Mindanao with a risky assignment penetrate enemy territory and contact a spy named Miyazaki who operates out of a Japanese rest camp. They spy has information vital to MacArthur's intelligence department. They are experts in the field of killing except for Grenier Jim Mitchum a PBY radio man who was assigned to the team at the last minute when the original radio operator got sick. Grenier doesn't fit in with the veterans especially the macho Sgt. Corey Hugh O'Brian.The piece is clichd from start to finish  in what movie have we not seen the characters setting or mission before? Director Winston handles this nonsense seriously  so seriously that despite the flaws it's very easy to enjoy this movie even in a tongueincheek sort of way. O'Brian gives a passionate performance even if his character is anything but original and personal. His Sergeant is virtually a superhero as Sgt. Wartell Mickey Rooney! reveals to Grenier by describing a series of Corey's early exploits on Guadalcanal and Tarawa. Rooney looks to be thoroughly enjoying himself as he scales cliffs and mows down Japanese infantry by the dozen although he looks way too old and simultaneously boyish to be a believable career marine. Although he gets third billing Mitchum's is the most developed and believable character. He's a person any viewer can relate to thrown into a situation beyond his control Grenier is forced to adapt to everchanging conditions  and fast  because his life may depend on it. He wants to do his job well but doesn't have any natural talent and therefore his peers look down on him with contempt. His performance never strikes a false note and he even gets to lapse into some voiceovers to keep things fresh.The onlocation photography is stunning from beginning to end. Had this film not been shot in the Philippines any credibility would have been totally lost. The exteriors are appropriately lush and beautiful. Winston and cinematographer Emmanuel L. Rojas don't just take us into the steamy jungles we get to venture into rice patties across streams and down rushing crystal clear blue rivers. I absolutely hate it when producers try to make ridiculous locations like North American forests The Green Berets or rocky plains of Spain 1964's The Thin Red Line pass for Asian or South Pacific jungles. The technique just doesn't work. Kudos to Winston for choosing to shoot this film in the actual locations it is said to have occurred at.Although the movie runs nearly 2 hours the time flies by. The pace is kept fluid in two ways. The characters are constantly on the go. The only reason they stop is rest and we're treated to discussion revealing something of their character. For example we don't get to know Corey as a person until late in the film when he develops a relationship with Tisa Chang's character. When the men aren't hiking or resting they're engaged in some sort of combat with the enemy  patrols tanks and indigenous cannibals constantly hamper their progress. Winston doesn't dwell on the supporting cast at all most of them are nonessential characters that he kills off in a few early encounters with the enemy. We constantly ask ourselves Who is going to get killed next? This curiosity keeps us engaged right up until the climactic battle inside a fortified Japanese radio installation.All of that said it's necessary to point out several technical flaws which make the proceedings difficult to take seriously. The members of the squad are introduced quite extensively as masters in the art of warfare but by the halfway point almost all of them have been killed by Japanese draftees. Their detailed introductions are a waste of viewer time and engagement since Winston seems to want to kill all of them off as quickly as possible. The death of one key character involving baked potatoes has got to be an example of some of the worst screenwriting I've witnessed. Some of the special effects namely the destruction of a tank are very below par even for a lowbudget film from 1966. Outdoor sets are used multiple times to represent very different locations. The film's climax is packed with unlikely heroics but by the time it arrives viewers have dispensed with realistic expectations. The ridiculous baseballstyle caps look like something a Green Beret or Navy SEAL might have worn in the 1960s but are totally out of place in a World War II movie. I took flak for this comment elsewhere. I don't care if Baseball caps are the headgear of choice for Marine air crewmen  these are Marines on an important mission and the last thing they'll be wearing in a green jungle is a bright red cap which yells HERE I AM! SHOOT ME! Perhaps the unbelievable overstated corny parts of Ambush Bay make it such an entertaining film maybe it's more sincere performances of Mitchum and O'Brian that make it stand out from the deluge of jungle patrol stories out there. Whatever the reason it's thoroughly enjoyable has been a favorite of mine since I caught it on cable as a kid. Now that it's available on DVD a whole new audience may have opened up.".

The DVD image and sound transfer are however surprisingly good.Since I first saw 'Ambush Bay' on latenight TV in the Age Before Cable and many times thereafter I've always loved the cheesy scene of the wounded Mickey Rooney sassing his Japanese interrogators before he grenades them along with himself. It's one of the cheesiest bravado scenes ever to have been captured in celluloid  and yet it's the chief reasons I watch this almost painfully cheesy movie every few years or so. That scene indeed the entire film is like a 1960's censors'toneddownformachobluelanguage echo of men's pulp magazines which usually bore fullcolor cover illustrations that depicted bosomy Nazi women whipping bare chested virile Yanks or inscrutable sloeeyed Japanese women bent on seducing squarejawed and always Caucasian G.I.s of the 50's and 60's see James Lileks's website for amusing samplings thereof. I might add that a man of Rooney's abbreviated stature may not have met the marines' minimum preWWII height requirement which thus casts doubt on the script's revelation that his character is a career marine all I know is that I've NEVER seen a Gunnery Sergeant so short as Rooney's  so diminutive is Rooney that the Thompson gun he brandishes nearly equals his gnomish height. Yet he gives a good effort despite the script's winceprovoking haplessness.Though the marines in the film speak the most lines it's the Filipino actors the ones playing Filipinos not the ones badly playing Japanese who achieve something like verisimilitude. Plainly some of those actors and many of the Filipino extras retained vivid memories of their pitiless WWII subjugation and occupation by the Japanese.The storyline isn't worth recounting at all except to say that it's nearly as improbable as that of 'The Guns Of Navarone'  but at least 'The Guns Of Navarone' profited from its nearly highcamp capacity to again nearly lampoon itself as it plays out. But 'Ambush Bay' neither has nor attempts any such wittiness overt or underlying and thus its worst thoroughgoing flaw is that it takes itself much too seriously. The other inherent flaw is in the plot the notion that a fixed minefield could have somehow defeated or deflected the massive 1944 U.S. invasion of the Philippines is beyond risible.At least the prop crew got all the personal weapons on both sides and those beach camouflage that's what the pattern was officially called gyrene uniforms right. We even see some Japanese troops toting and firing U.S. M1903 Springfield rifles which is factual since the Japanese captured large numbers of these when they took the Philippine archipelago in 1942 along with considerable stocks of the proper ammunition for them.Hugh O'Brian  never a contender for acting awards  is stiff stolid and wooden almost to point of petrification and it doesn't help his performance that he was given awful dialogue to try to speak convincingly in a few instance in 'Ambush Bay' though it seems he would have been a perfect casting choice had Hollywood decided to adapt DC Comics' nighsuperhero Sergeant Rock character to the cinema. James Mitchum inherited precious little of his father's superb talent here as Grenier he's just gawky awkward sorely unconvincing every time he recites a line his only  and scant  saving grace here would seem to be appears to have been a natural relaxed athleticism.On the whole however viewers knowledgeable about WWII history will find 'Ambush Bay' historically lacking and anyone familiar with the canons of scriptwriting and production technique will find its flimsy plot hackneyed dialogue and ginsu special effects almost unendurable. But watch it for the Classic Cheesiness in that one Mickey Rooney suicidal bravado scene for the lovely location photography and for some serious and fairly impressive acting by the Filipino actors whose performances one can't help construing benefited from their having had their hearts in this story that purports to tell at least obliquely of the ordeal they endured and the feats of sacrifice and fortitude they achieved throughout Japan's WWII tyrannization of them and their islands.".

	schema:reviewBody "U.S. Army General Douglas MacArthur is about to return to the Philippines as he promised before the Japanese ran him off. In 1944 an amphibious Navy aircraft lands a Marine commando force near the island of Luzon and they paddle ashore to obtain valuable information from a source deep within enemy territory. As First Sgt. Steve Corey Hugh O'Brien of The Brass Legend is toughasnails and Mickey Rooney is no slouch as career Gunnery Sgt. Ernest Wartell who totes around a .45 caliber Thompson submachine gun almost as big as he is. The youngest member of the unit is Private First Class James Grenier Jim Mitchum of Moonrunners who has never seen combat. It doesn't take long for Sgt. Corey and Pfc. Grenier to get to dislike each other. Corey makes it clean in no uncertain terms that Grenier is supposed to cradle the radio set that is their lifeline to Allied command. Indeed Grenier is the member of the team is chosen at the last minute to fill in the regular guy. He provides the voiceover narration that introduces us to the commando team at the beginning of the film and concludes it at the end of the movie.Our grimfaced gyrene heroes in camouflage fatigues learn from their contact Miyazaki Tisa Chang of Year of the Dragon that the Japanese have prepared an unusual minefield for the U.S. Navy. These mines are radio controlled and are anchored to the bottom of the bay. They are released and rise to the surface to blow up whatever they come into contact with.

He tells them that he will share his potatoes with them and they can have them with the jackets on and then hurls them at the Japanese as they beat a quick retreat. Ambush Bay is nothing special as far as behindenemylines combat movies go. Essentially this is a traditional war movie. The Americans are good guys and the Japanesewho shoot women in cold bloodare the bad guys. Good performances standardissue heroics and lots of green scenery keep Ambush Bay from being too dreary. Incidentally no sooner do our heroes immerse themselves in combat than their officer is attacked by a Japanese soldier and stabbed to death. This is a traditional World War II movie because the Americans aren't trying to kill their leaders like they did in Tawara Beachhead or Attack. Composer Richard LaSalle's orchestral soundtrack sounds as if he listened to Malcolm Arnold's music The Bridge on the River Kwai because LaSalle incorporate a similar melody. No I'm not talking about Colonel Bogey's march. Scenarists Marve Feinberg and Ib Melchior have penned a screenplay that amounts to an anthology of clichs. Ambush Bay represents Feinberg's only screenplay while Melchior earned a reputation writing scifi films such as Robin Crusoe on Mars Angry Red Planet and Journey to the Seventh Planet.".

	onyx:emotionText "U.S. Army General Douglas MacArthur is about to return to the Philippines as he promised before the Japanese ran him off. In 1944 an amphibious Navy aircraft lands a Marine commando force near the island of Luzon and they paddle ashore to obtain valuable information from a source deep within enemy territory. As First Sgt. Steve Corey Hugh O'Brien of The Brass Legend is toughasnails and Mickey Rooney is no slouch as career Gunnery Sgt. Ernest Wartell who totes around a .45 caliber Thompson submachine gun almost as big as he is. The youngest member of the unit is Private First Class James Grenier Jim Mitchum of Moonrunners who has never seen combat. It doesn't take long for Sgt. Corey and Pfc. Grenier to get to dislike each other. Corey makes it clean in no uncertain terms that Grenier is supposed to cradle the radio set that is their lifeline to Allied command. Indeed Grenier is the member of the team is chosen at the last minute to fill in the regular guy. He provides the voiceover narration that introduces us to the commando team at the beginning of the film and concludes it at the end of the movie.Our grimfaced gyrene heroes in camouflage fatigues learn from their contact Miyazaki Tisa Chang of Year of the Dragon that the Japanese have prepared an unusual minefield for the U.S. Navy. These mines are radio controlled and are anchored to the bottom of the bay. They are released and rise to the surface to blow up whatever they come into contact with. Grenier loses his radio with which he was entrusted. They have no way of contacting the Admiral Halsey's task force and MacArthur plans to land in 48 hours! Consequently Ambush Bay is a thriller with a deadline. Instead Corey and Grenier have to slip into the Japanese base shoot their way into the radio control room and detonate the mines.

	schema:reviewBody "Ambush Bay is directed by Ron Winston. It tells the story of a Marine unit on a Japaneseheld island in the Philippines that tries to hook up with local Filipino guerrillas. The film sees Hugh O'Brian star as Sgt. Corey. Mickey Rooney as Sgt. Wartell and James Mitchum as Pvt. Grenier. In terms of acting they all do a decent job. However their character development rarely goes beyond typical war film clich.The direction is nothing to get excited about it mainly consists of steady cams that point and shoot. The score is one of my biggest gripes with the film. It's incredibly loud and obtrusive which kept pulling me out of the film. On a positive note the film has some good action scenes and it was nice to see a specialist unit that deals in stealth remain stealthy through most of the film.Whilst the film becomes Increasingly dull in its second act. The film does start too pick up when it enters into its third act. The team have too infiltrate a Japanese base then subsequently fight off overwhelmingly large enemy forces. These scenes are well shot and the action is enjoyable if somewhat predictable.With it's paper thin plot and poor characterisations Ambush Bay is an inconsequential B movie that fails in every respect to elevate itself above the limitations of it's genre. If you want too relax on a Sunday afternoon this film will do its job. However there are other films like The Wild Geese Dirty Dozen that are more deserving of your attention.".

Their mission to make contact with a Japanese spy who has vital information regarding the landing of American troops on the islands. The group is commanded by 1st Sergeant Steve CoreyHUGH O'BRIEN.Taciturn and rugged Corey refuses to reveal the objective of the mission much to the irritation of the young and nave radio operatorPFC James GrenierJAMES MITCHUMwho does not yet take war or their mission seriously.Howeveras members of the group ate killed in bloody skirmishes with the occupying Japanese even Corey begins to doubt his judgement and Grenier finally begins to accept the brutal realities of war as well as the task that he must carry out.I'll be straight to the point AMBUSH BAY is certainly not the most spectacular war film but it certainly is fun and satisfactory. I can't resist any of these Dirty Dozen style war film that were cranked out by United Artists in the late 1960s.I find the scenarios and situations created for their characters somewhat appealing this is the case with this film. The storyline is fine although it's nothing new but the main selling point for the film is the 3 main characters Steve Coreyplayed by HUGH O'BRIENGunnery Sergeant Ernest Wartellplayed by the late MICKEY ROONEYand James Grenierplayed by JAMES MITCHUM.All 3 are robust characters and are portrayed fantastically by their actors. A strong as well as an intelligent script allowed both Corey and Grenier to have both meaningful and interesting backstories. Corey is the roughtoughheartless warrior who's seen it all. He's the polar opposite to Grenier who is the innocent young recruit confused as to what's going on around him. His character narrates the film which I thought was a great touch as his monologues are made up of some sharp dialogue. Under the pressure of the situation he slowly makes the transition from boy to man which I found rather compelling. This is demonstrated brilliantly in the final scenes. Mickey Rooney's performance as Wartell was the one that stood out the most for me as he brings a little dash of comedic colour to an otherwise dark film. He regularly comes out with humorous wisecracks whilst remaining serious but positive. The scene in the jungle in which he stall a Japanese patrol using Baked Potatoesor Hand Grenadeswas quite amusing but sad at the same time. It is in this scene that Rooney's experience as a comedian shines through. The other characterslike the other Marines were rather boring as they were killed off before they could really develop.The action scenes are exciting and tense they're nicely peppered throughout the whole film. They comprise of small skirmishes in the jungle and one battle at the Japanese base at the climax. Although they were well shot I found them rather dry and most of them looked similar. The director could have raised the roof a little more with the final battle maybe by including a few more deaths and explosions. That being said I did find that sequence very exhilarating as Corey guns down oncoming Japanese soldiers with a Machine gun and bombards them with Hand Grenades in true action hero fashion. I was biting my nails as Grenier detonates the sea mines using the base's radio control system in the midst of the fighting thus making the final battle even more taut. The film ends on a heart wrenching but uplifting note with Greniernow hardened by his experience sitting alone on the beach as General Macarthur's victory I have returned speech blasts out of the radio.Director Ron Winston who up until this film had worked only in TV makes a staunch attempt at the film. Although it's boring in parts and drags on from time to time AMBUSH BAY is an above average war drama and an engrossing character study of men in combat. It's definitely worth watching and is also an awesome way to kill a couple of hours on a dull Saturday afternoon.710.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hollywood simply did not make enough of these great color letterbox format Pacific Theater WW II films! Director Ron Winston did a fine job with this one which is one of the best I've seen. Baby Boomers in particular will be hot on this one.A young James Mitchum talented brother of Robert and John Mitchum holds the starring role here over Hugh O'Brian and Mickey Rooney. Mitchum plays Private Grenier a smartaleck rookie U.S. Marine who has gotten himself shanghaied into a top secret special operation in the Phillipines during the Japanese occcupation. All the other marines about a dozen of them are highlytrained and experienced specialists in their respective fields. Mitchum the radio guy was grudgingly brought along as a lastminute replacement for the regular top communications specialist who came down with illness just prior to this imperative guerilla operation.They are secreted to the island by floatplane at night. Soon after entering the jungle the Captain of the operation is killed during a desperate scuffle with some Japanese soldiers at their campfire. Hugh O'Brian playing the Lieutenant takes over command and he doesn't much like Mitchum viewing the Private as trivial and immature. Mitchum is eventually told the purpose of the operation A Phillipine guide will take them across the jungle island to the Japanese base where their contact person a covert Allied agent will provide information that is critical to MacArthur's immanent Allied reinvasion of the Phillipines. Thus it will eventually fall on Mitchum the most important member of the team in terms of duty to convey this critical intelligence by radio.In yet another early confrontation with a small platoon of Japanese infantry who are also equipped with a very cool little army tank more Marines are killed and this also sets the Japanese hot on their trail through the jungle. Just before their destination is reached the Marine's native guide the only person who knew who the identity of the contact agent is killed  Hugh O'Brian is forced to sneak into the Japaneseinfested village and ferret out the contact agent at great risk. I'll have to stop here to avoid a SPOILER! One of the best features of this movie is the superb filmscore composed and conducted by Richard LaSalle. It's one of those atmospheric sixtyish scores reminiscent of those fine soundtracks previously conveyed by Hugo Friedhofer and Les Baxter. It really adds to the suspense and to the ambiance of this fine film.The abundance of tropical flora great locations and sets the super cinematography and the great casting additionally support the superb quality of the movie. Compare this film to yet another of these singular film treasures Never So Few It's all really just firstclass. If you enjoy World War II films especially those concerning the Pacific Theater you'll love this terrific 1966 entry. My highest recommendation!".

I first saw the picture in about 1970 on NBC Saturday Night at the Movies and loved it. I was very young. 'Nuff said about that.2. It's not available as a DVD on Netflix for some unknown reason but is available for streaming there and is available free on YouTube somewhat altered darkened to avoid copyright issues. 3. The music by Richard LaSalle sounds very much like Kwai except not as good. LaSalle scored many films in his career all of them destined for second billing at driveins.4. The stars are mediocre. Hugh O'Brian the poor man's William Holden is palpably bored andor wooden to the point of parody. O'Brian had quite a career going for himself in the 1950s but by the time of this production was C List. He was a good man though inspired by the great Albert Schweitzer he founded a charitable foundation that seems to do good things. James Mitchum son of Robert looks just like his old man as he undoubtedly heard every day of his life but has very little of daddy's talent yes nepotism does get your foot in the door in Hollywood. His role here as written is actually somewhat subtle and complex involving emotions like ambivalence he just ain't up to putting the stuff on the screen. 5. Two supporting actors do well here Tisa Chang as Miyazaki and Mickey Rooney as Ernie. Miyazaki is tough earthy sexy real. Ernie is full of vinegar and has a couple of funny lines. The film's director Ron Winston should have seen that Rooney brought his A game to this production and was worthy of a lot more screen time. 6. Re James Mitchum  what a burden to be the notverytalented son of a really famous father and look just like him. I think of Dhani Harrison son of George in this context. Difficult to have one's own life. I really think Dhani should turn his back on all those millions of dollars coming in every year and the endless parade of luscious 20yearold groupies and strike out totally on his own. Easy for me to say right.7. The heart of the film is the teahouse sequence followed a bit later by the village sequence. These are reasonably interesting  maybe worth six stars. 8. There seems to be a modest Vietnam connection here. My guess is this is why the film got funded it was made in 196566. Several lines of dialogue suggest Vietnam including Who's the enemy? Anyone. That kind of thing.9. As various reviews note these commandos aren't very good at their jobs thanks to the film's writers. Examples abound. For instance during their first encounter with the enemy three Japanese soldiers eating supper they open fire much too hastily i.e. they don't wait to see if any enemy soldiers are off in the forest taking a dump or watching birds or whatever. This tactical failure gets the head honcho of the commandos killed. Handy for script purposes but absurd for believability. 10. Watchable for Mickey for Tisa for the teahouse and village sequences and for the Philippines locale and if like me you love war movies and are willing to put up with a lot of mediocrity.".

People get desperate when their means of livelihood's cut off and I was no exception. I'm Gary Brannon my Dad and me ran a freight outfit.There's a reoccurring saying that often crops up when viewing most of Audie Murphy's Westerns that of them being unassuming afternoon entertainment. Pour yourself a jug of beer or a glass of wine and enjoy the handsome Murphy going about his Oater business with energy and a straight forward willingness to entertain.Drums Across the River is a goodie in that context it also boasts some lovely photography by Lipstein out of California locations that include Barton Flats San Bernardino Mountains Burro Flats and Red Rock Canyon. The Technicolor is gorgeous TV print I saw was very good with the blues and greens very striking and the story is interesting as Murphy plays a bigoted young man who finds himself trying to avert a war with the Ute's whilst being framed for robbery himself. Bettger Union Station is a more than capable villain as is the black clad O'Brian The Lawless Breed Corday and Gaye are underwritten but a treat for the eyes and Brennan is the class act that he mostly always is.Juran Gunsmoke directs without fuss or filler proving to have a keen eye for action construction as the film is flecked with a number of hand to hand fights shootouts and horse play and prolific Western scorer Gershenson offers up another in a long line of undervalued genre compliant flavours. The stunt work is also of a high standard with one particular leap of death truly worthy of high praise and the story rounds out to put a smile on your face as the last sip of beverage trickles down the throat. Few surprises narratively speaking and the odd B Western budget error shows its face but this is a colourful Audie Oater and it's all about enjoying without having to think too hard about it. 710".

It's fastpaced full of action and features a host of lively character actors including some great villains.Audie plays a wagon freighter in a Colorado mining town who is initially a witting pawn in a plot by a group of Denver mine bosses to stir up trouble with the local Ute Indians in order to get gold concessions on their land. Audie's dad Sam Walter Brennan is a friend of the Indians and following a shootout with the Utes in which Sam is wounded Audie meets with the Ute chief Morris Ankrum and his son Taos Jay Silverheels and negotiates a temporary peace. Unfortunately the hired guns working for the mine bosses continue to stir things up and force Audie to aid in a stage robbery by abducting his dad and threatening to kill him. When Audie is charged with murder after the robbery he has to keep quiet to insure Sam's safety.

Lyle Bettger who had one of the most sinister smiles in movie history specialized in corrupt western capitalists ranchers miners saloon owners railroad men who could be utterly smooth and charming one minute and murderously evil the next. Here he's the miners' lead troublemaker and is joined by a great rogues' gallery made up of future TV star Hugh O'Brian as the blackclad Morgan who also smiles a lot and a quartet of thugs played by frequent heavies James Anderson George Wallace Lane Bradford and former Bwestern star Bob Steele. In addition there's Mara Corday as a voluptuous and very attractive saloon girl who does some of Bettger's dirty work.Walter Brennan is very good in a rare turn as an upright authority figure and father. Jay Silverheels plays a sympathetic Indian and leads a band of Utes who appear to be played predominantly by actual Indians rather than the usual paintedup white extras. The Technicolor film was shot partly on the Universal backlot with some fine location work at key California western sites including one dramatic desert spot representing the Indians' sacred burial ground.

	schema:reviewBody "Drums Across the River concerns freighters Walter Brennan and his son Audie Murphy trying very hard to prevent a full scale Indian war which Lyle Bettger and sidekicks seem bound and determined to start.There's some rich mineral deposits on Ute land which is separated by a river boundary. Lyle Bettger plays on the greed of the white folks to invade the Ute treaty land so the government will send in troops to move them.Brennan sees the game for what it is but it takes Murphy a while to come around. When he does he's the heroic Audie we know in most of his B westerns.Lots of action and a really nice performance by Jay Silverheels as the young Ute chief. Silverheels was on hiatus from the Lone Ranger and he ought to be remembered for more than just playing Tonto. There's also a nice performance by Mara Corday who is Bettger's squeeze and does quite a bit more for him than the usual moll.Despite that the film probably suffered from some poor editing and a script in which the character's motivations in doing certain things are a bit vague.Nevertheless Drums Across the River has enough action to satisfy any western lover.".

	onyx:emotionText "Drums Across the River concerns freighters Walter Brennan and his son Audie Murphy trying very hard to prevent a full scale Indian war which Lyle Bettger and sidekicks seem bound and determined to start.There's some rich mineral deposits on Ute land which is separated by a river boundary. Lyle Bettger plays on the greed of the white folks to invade the Ute treaty land so the government will send in troops to move them.Brennan sees the game for what it is but it takes Murphy a while to come around. When he does he's the heroic Audie we know in most of his B westerns.Lots of action and a really nice performance by Jay Silverheels as the young Ute chief. Silverheels was on hiatus from the Lone Ranger and he ought to be remembered for more than just playing Tonto. There's also a nice performance by Mara Corday who is Bettger's squeeze and does quite a bit more for him than the usual moll.Despite that the film probably suffered from some poor editing and a script in which the character's motivations in doing certain things are a bit vague.Nevertheless Drums Across the River has enough action to satisfy any western lover.";

Jay Silverheels and that always Recognizable Voice has a Small but Important Role as an Indian Chief.It is quite Striking just how much Plot was Woven into these 80 Minute Westerns it's just a Treat to Watch it Unfold at a Blistering Pace. The Action Never Lets Up and the Story Layers are Simple and Significant.The Movie features that Glorious Technicolor that Drips from the Screen a Look that has been Lost in Time. Overall this Cowboys and Indians Movie is the Stuff that made Saturday Matinees the Favorite Spot for Kids of the Fifties. Downtown at the Movie Palace there were Western and SciHorror Entertainment along with Color Cartoons and Short Subjects and the Kids were there because that was where it was at through the 1950's.".

	schema:reviewBody "As this film opens with Gary Brannon preparing to lead a group of men in to the San Juan Mountains the mountains are the territory of the Ute Indians but with no other gold left near the mining town of Crown City people are prepared to take a chance and cross the river into the San Juans. Gary's father tries to persuade him not to go but he ignores him shortly after the group leaves his father is attacked that doesn't stop him heading after the group though. They don't get far into Ute territory before they get jumped and one of the group is captured. Gary captures an Indian and thanks to his father's negotiating they trade him for the captured man. This wasn't what Walker the man who hired Gary wanted... he wanted to ferment a war with the Indians so that the army could be called in to force them off their land and into a reservation. To this end he and his men open fire on the departing Indians killing many of them. A war seems inevitable but Gary goes to the Indians alone and talks to the new chief it looks like he has established a peace but Walker hasn't given up yet. He has a second plan that will frame the Brannon's for a robbery and make it look as though they were working with the Utes... Gary will have his work cut out if he is to save his father avoid getting hanged and prevent a war!This is another solid western staring Audie Murphy as usual he does a fine job as the hero. His character is given a bit of depth by the fact that he can't forgive the Utes because one of them killed his mother we later learn that the killer was the chief's son and the chief had him killed for his crime... of course Gary comes to see that he can't judge a people by the actions of one man and comes to respect them. The bad guys are suitably villainous Lyle Bettger does a decent job as the devious Walker and Hugh O'Brian is menacing as the hired gun Morgan. Director Nathan Juran kept the action going nicely with fistfights shootouts and villains being dragged behind Indian horses. Filmed in California as were so many B Westerns rather than in Colorado the film still looks good with some spectacular scenery shot in vivid Technicolor. While this isn't a classic I'm sure fans of the genre will enjoy it.".

Gary Brannon Audie Murphy is on the side of the miners and wants to see his town survive along with it's citizens. But father Sam Walter Brennan has been able to maintain an uneasy peace with the Utes and their Chief Ouray Morris Ankrum even after the death of his wife at the hands of a drunken Ute brave. Gary finds it harder to forgive and forget and would rather consider all Indians his enemy based on the actions of a few.Heavy Frank Walker Lyle Bettger leads the mining faction and insists on creating havoc with the Indians finding ways to undo the truce established with the Utes by the elder Brannon. He brings in a black clad gunman named Morgan enthusiastically portrayed by Hugh O'Brian in an uncharacteristic role. The future TV Wyatt Earp plays his part with gusto until brought down by Gary.Ouray's son Taos Jay Silverheels becomes Chief when the elder Indian dies setting the stage for what will figure in the movie's finale. With young Brannon present for the Chief's burial on sacred ground Taos warns him never to return at the risk of death. Knowing this and having been framed for murder by Walker Brannon leads Walker and his men into the sacred mountain area to be ambushed by the Utes thereby risking his own neck in order to save it.In 1954 Jay Silverheels was still in the middle of his costarring role as Tonto in the Lone Ranger Television Series. In this film though he's brought to more regal bearing as the Indian Chief Taos and looks particularly impressive in full war bonnet. For his part the young Audie Murphy looks a bit out of his element among the heavies of the film though he manages to prevail against every henchman presented. The film ends with the Utes and the Crown City citizens exchanging mining rights for hunting privileges on each other's side of the mountains a reasonable enough compromise that probably could have been worked out without the bloodshed but then there wouldn't have been a story.".

The locations in the movie are beautiful as the airline crew and passengers travel throughout Europe. The perspective is almost unique nearly the entire movie is filmed aboard plane.But the charm of the movie is by far the biggest reason to watch it. One can view and enjoy it with the same suspension of disbelief as was possible with many of the musicals of the 1940s and 50s. The movie is predictable and not a critical success. But in view of the fact that the movie's title tune was later covered by Frank Sinatra also considering that Come Fly With Me was Dolores Hart's last movie before religious life it is a shame that this movie is not available on VHS at least. How could it have been overlooked?! Come on guys! You can do better than that!! Give us what we're asking for!!".

Her hair is done in manner that makes one wonder if Catherine Zeta Jones and her stylists keep a loop of this film running in their salon. There is a definite occasional resemblance. Hart is quite a revelation. For someone who was about to become a nun in real life she is surprisingly hardedged and mouthy here. She may even swear once and she smokes incessantly. It's great to see a lesser beauty but still a talented actress like Nettleton get a featured role. She creates a sympathetic if a bit overly difficult character. Poor Maxwell Miss Moneypenny of 007 films barely even got in a word edgewise. O'Brian is his usual suave and macho self as a voraciously skirtchasing pilot. Cruelly he keeps his shirt on at all times and never goes swimming. Malden does an okay job as a lonely businessman. German actor Boehm is a bit of an annoyance with his thin voice and heavy accent. There's a love song sung by a Parisian street chanteuse that will have many folks wretching and screaming for her to stop. All in all a pretty easy souffl of a film with just enough color and wit to hold interest up to a point. A midair trauma or an appearance by Joan Crawford.....something to punch it over the edge may have been welcome though. Nary a moment of it is believable the same as it was for similar films like Three Coins in a Fountain The Best of Everything and The Pleasure Seekers.".

Of course in her role as stewardess Donna Stuart in the film she does this scene to mark her separation from Baron von Elzingen played by Karl Boehm but it has far greater significance as far as the actress' own future was concerned.

	schema:reviewBody "By the 21st century air travel had become so common that it was almost pass. Flying somewhere for business or to visit relatives had become hohum. While vacation flights may still carry a little excitement for the most part air travel is now so common that there's nothing special about it. And considering the changes and difficulties with travel today modern folk can be excused if they don't know about a time when air travel was fun relaxing exciting and even romantic. But there was such a time indeed. The glamor days of air travel were the late 1950s to the early 1980s. Air travel grew by leaps and bounds after World War II as jet airplanes cut flight time to a couple hours between airports in most countries. In America cities large and small had multiple airlines serving them. People enjoyed travel for business pleasure and family visits. Vacation packages frequently included air travel or were built around it by the airlines. And security measures were simple and quick to get through. Many airlines flourished during this time. I have flown on every major carrier in the U.S. since 1962 and on several foreign airlines. And I've flown on most of the U.S. regional or trunk lines as well and smaller airlines in Europe and Asia. The first three decades of jet air service were the halcyon days of air travel. Airlines then competed for passengers with service. The cream of the crop of the Americanbased airlines were Pan Am Pan American World Airways Braniff International and TWA Trans World Airlines. Running close behind them in service were United American and Eastern airlines. Other national carriers were Delta Northwestern Continental and National. Travelers will recognize that all but three of those were gone within a decade into the 21st century and that some new airlines have been added. The cream of the regional carriers back then was Alaska Airlines  today one of the major carriers in the U.S. So why do I bother giving this brief history of U.S. airline service? I think it may help younger movie fans especially to get in the mood of this film Come Fly with Me. This film shows a little of the meal and drink service on the airlines of the past and that international flights still provide and the hospitality of the airline employees. In those days women were stewardesses and men were stewards. Today they have no gender distinction and are called flight attendants. But it also is an example of a type of film that was popular for that period when many people associated flying with romantic getaways or just plain romance. So in the style of the day three of the flight hostesses are friends who enjoy travel to foreign ports and hope to meet welltodo men. And the copilot has a role that was typical for films of this period genre  as a flyer with a girl in every port. Enough said on that. Come Fly with Me puts a different twist on the usual fare for the women and the copilot. Dolores Hart Pamela Tiffin Lois Nettleton Hugh O'Brian and the rest of the cast play their parts well. I especially enjoyed Karl Malden as Walter Lucas and Lois Maxwell as Gwen Sandley. Watch for the misadventure involving Hart's character and a traveling baron who catches her eye. This is a light comedy romance that is worth watching besides just for its historical view of the travel culture of the time.".

Or read on if you want to use your valuable time on something more worthy that this excuse for a film.Firstly I'll begin by saying that I do enjoy a good piece of vintage romantic fluff Doris Day with Rock Hudson or James Garner for example. Of course times have changed since those old films were made. So anyone who'd take offense at women whose main aspirations in life were to catch a man and clean his house skip all of these films. Personally I enjoy them in the context of their times  mostly. I recorded it from TV one night and looked forward to sitting down and watching it while my husband was away he hates these corny old movies. So I sat down got comfortable and pressed Play. The premise was fine  three pretty young stewardesses looking for love and all that stuff. But my word how desperate were these women?Pamela Tiffin was good in her role as the annoying naive young newbie but jeez all that swooning over the first officer was ridiculous! And when he later condescendingly stuck a handkerchief in her mouth to shut her up in front of his colleagues she didn't even attempt to remove it just sat there with it between her lips! Lois Nettleton again very good as the oncebitten and loveshy Bergie. The fact that she ended up with a man who was essentially a bully used to getting what he wanted who chose her because she reminded him of his late wife I didn't get. She was so put off by him shouting at her calling her by the wife's name and being used as a substitute  then she suddenly had a change of heart when he continued to throw his money around to pursue her? That would be OK if she were a statusandmoneyhungry person like Dolores Hart's Donna but she wasn't.As for Donna it's not hard to work out why Dolores Hart became a nun after films like this.Her character first rebuffed a flirty 1st Class passenger then did a 180 degree turn on butt kissing when she discovered he was a baron an impoverished one but she didn't know that. I'll make a long story short by saying that he used her for something unsavoury and illegal without her knowledge which could have cost her many years in prison. During this he supposedly fell for her yet continued to use her  and this was enough devotion for her. When he was caught she decided that she would wait the years for him to get out of prison. How the most hard boiled of the three women could fall for someone like this I have no idea. How did she suddenly become so weak? As I said to begin with times were different and most women had different expectations of life than they do now. But even back then these three characters lacked any selfrespect and were weak and sappy enough to really annoy me.".

It's a hark back to the carefree 1960's when noone in the west at least had much to worry about and the time was right for romance and love ! My favourite person in the film is Karl Malden it's nice to see him in a role different from the Police of San Francisco and I like the guy's face it's original and unforgettable. My preferred scene is the one where French singer Simone Langlois one of my favourites sings the Yves Montand song La Chansonnette  curiously enough translated into English as the Paris Love Song  to Malden his girlfriend stewardess and the ever so funny street urchin who accompanies them this boy is listed as Bibi Morat but I have no idea if he is still an actor today as I have never heard this name outside the film. The onlocation shooting in Paris and Vienna gives some kind of authenticity to the film and I just loved the stewardess' costumes when they dressed up to go out for the evening  they were superb. Indeed the more I watch the film the more I enjoy it !".

Since it was made before the women's movement got serious about equal rights it's no wonder women of a certain age were confused in how to approach the opposite sex maybe it's just mein my courting years I wavered between wanting to be like these women or to be a liberated take charge kind of gal. Anywho this film is a mild diversion that certainly won't change your life but at the same time is kind of fun with a little drama thrown in to make it a more serious movie. The plot is simple3 stews and their lives and loves while flying all over Europe. What I couldn't figure out is why the Hart character was so cynical and why Nettleton was so scared illegal marriage notwithstanding. It seems like a lot was left on the editing room floor that would explain some of the plot points.I agree that Hart was a pretty good actress and added something to any film she was in. I had no idea this was her last movie before becoming a nun considering her character seemed like a gold digger with a bad cigarette habit.I had to come here to find out who the 4th stewardess was. I kept thinking I'd seen her somewhere before but couldn't put my finger on who she was. Now that I found out she was Miss Moneypenny I'm embarrassed because I've seen her a thousand times in the Bond movies.I recommend this movie to those who like the early 60's films about relationships before feminism changed everything. It also has some great shots of Paris  Vienna another reason I like to watch non American films from an earlier timeto see what it use to be like.".

Murder? Accident? Suicide? The movie never delivers a satisfying answer because the body on the beach turns out to be simply a flashy introduction to the story of a troubled marriage among the idle rich. Even this aspect of the story isn't well handled because the movie doesn't seem to realize that Cliff Robertson is or at least should be the main character. He's the exbeach boy who's now married to the wealthy Lana Turner but whose sense of decency causes him to feel guilty about living in her world of privilege. Perhaps not surprisingly he finds himself drawn to the youthful innocence of Stefanie Powers the girlfriend of the bodyonthebeach who's come to Acapulco to investigate the situation.However though Robertson is the character in the compelling position the character who undergoes the greatest degree of growth and change the movie understandably keeps turning its attention to Lana Turner. After all she's the topbilled star and it's with her name that the movie hopes to attract its core audience of Sundaymatine women. Turner certainly looks good all things considered and she's dressed and jeweled with all the requisite glamour but her character never comes to life and the attempt to give her depth and sympathy through the revelation of a shocking secret from her past simply doesn't work. The revelation seems too pat too contrived and the fact that it's delivered through a monologue Turner implausibly shares with her maid doesn't help matters.Interest starts to ebb away in the second half and an effort to re charge the movie with a bullfight sequence seems more silly than exciting. Still there's enough of a glow to this oldfashioned star vehicle to qualify it as one of those guilty pleasures whose charms can't adequately be explained to the uninitiated.Cliff Robertson does what he can with the material but seems glum and uncomfortable and one never really accepts that he loves Lana Turner. For her part Turner strikes the right poses but fails to become anything more than a lookdon'ttouch pinup. Acting honors actually go to Hugh O'Brien who's usually seen in nothing more than a variety of crotchbulging swimsuits and whose hairy sunbronzed torso seems the very distillation of raw male sexuality. Robertson has only two bare chest scenes one of them quite minor and while he still has an attractive physique his beefcake appeal is put on better display in the 1959 Gidget. Ruth Roman adds some peripheral interest to the proceedings and one wishes more had been done with the character of reluctant gigolo Ron Husmann.".

Perhaps the lack of a strong film director TV veteran Alexander Singer hurts this as does the unbalanced script. A bullfight subplot dominates the last quarter and that slows this down to the pace of a TV golf tournament. Turner is beautiful but her character is one dimensionally shallow.

The use of Apatows two daughters  non actors they are  was as annoying as the obvious lack of a script  and the fact that a lot of the movie seemed to be ad libbed  and really had nowhere to go and basically wasn't the least bit interesting  or funny  just annoying. The movie went on and on for over two hours  weaving it's little plot of this annoying self absorbed little family  the plot was about How Paul Rudds' record label was struggling  how Leslie Mann  playing his wife ran a store which was losing money from a possible thieving employee  and how their daughters were driving them crazy with their daily demands.

	schema:reviewBody "You may recall a major hit a few years ago entitled KNOCKED UP by Director Judd Apatow. You may also remember the other couple in that film the secondary characters the characters that the main characters played against for dramatic exposition. Well Director Apatow for reasons that are less than clear decided to not only do a followup film to that hit but to base said film on the second couple the couple most viewers who saw the first film have likely forgotten. Wait it gets better. The actress who played the wife in the original film ie in the second couple is Leslie Mann who by coincidence is Apatow's wife in real life. And ergo the star of the current film. See? And  if you like coincidences you will love this  Mann herself turned 40 years old the same year that this film was made. So  let's sum up for those of you having trouble with all this which should be most of you  Apatow took the secondary characters from a hit film and made a brand new film about middle aged married people casting his very own wife. In other words he decided to do a film about his own marriage. The reviewers have so far been less than kind about his film  one major reviewer suggesting that all the characters are so horrible he wanted to sell the bunch of them to white slavers  but one suspects Apatow could care less. This is the film he wanted to make and he made it. Deal with it. Comments...  if you are married you will get a lot of the set pieces in the film. If you are not you won't. In fact if you are not married this film may possibly damage you for actual marriage and should be avoided simply on the grounds of public policy.  Leslie Mann is one of the most photogenic actresses in Hollywood and under different circumstances probably deserved an entire film of her own just like this one. In fact she steals entire scenes from Meghan Fox. However all things considered these are NOT those circumstances...  overall a forgettable film. Unless you actually are Judd Apatow".

I guess people went into this expecting a sitcomlike snappy feel good film like 40 Year Old Virgin? Or goofy happygolucky characters such as Seth Rogen's posse in Knocked Up? Did these people not see Funny People? I am all in favor of letting Mr. Apatow develop as a director. To be clear here this film follows Pete and Debbie's story arc from a few years after the events in Knocked Up. The are both turning 40 and neither is handling it particularly gracefully but they weren't handling their lives and relationships particularly well in the earlier film. I found this movie to have a Larry David Show quality to it however irrationally and offensively our protagonists behave there are always others who will go them one better or worse. Yes Debbie and Pete are defective human beings but so I would argue are all the people inhabiting this world excepting the very gentlemanly Graham Parker and Billie Joe Armstrong. Such is the stuff of comedy. Are these caricatures? Surely and yet they are caricatures of realities which I see every day. Is the teenage daughter given to histrionics? You bet but that is what teenagers are like and the fact remains that teenagers turn their parents into equally irrational and histrionic characters in that relationship I actually found it refreshing to find a teenager in a movie played by a teenager who isn't a wisecracking savant commenting on the follies of her elders.To sum up this felt to me like a mature work from a good director. There are moments of farce slapstick and outrageous humor surrounded by moments where things just happen. For people who can't handle that kind of pacing you are welcome to stay out of movie theaters and sit in front of your TV sets the networks are sure to have plenty of nonchallenging sitcoms that are specially designed to pander to you.".

There was so much potential with this story line and i felt it could've been so great and hilarious but they just didn't get there. I felt like there should've been a bit more drama to their marriage it felt as if they were trying to make it seem so realistic that it came off fake. a lot of the problems they were experiencing does happen to real life middle aged couples but not to the extreme like they portrayed it. There were some familiar faces and others were just random megan fox lol but i also think a little bit more development for the new characters and maybe the old would've been nice as well. I wanted to like this movie so much because it had so many good parts where it could've been great. Maybe if they added a small portion towards the end of the movie interviewing real life 40 something year old couples and had little exerpts that would have also made the movie a bit closer to home.All in all i do feel pocket hurt for spending 11.50 to see this movie because i was simply disappointed.

	schema:headline " This Is 40 is horrible from the minute we remeet Debbie";
	schema:reviewBody "Marketed as a comedy this is film just try's to be a moving drama about a very unlikeable couple that make no sense about the actions they do and the conclusion of the film made no sense to what the aim of the film was In 2007 Knocked Up was released and like most people I found it enjoyable so with this film Judd Apatow decided to take two characters from that film and stretch them out to try make them more fuller characters. Pete Paul Rudd and Debbie Leslie Mann are both celebrating their 40th birthday's in the same week even if Debbie does not want people to know her real age. During this week we see their daughters who tend to scream at them a lot as well as both Debbie and Pete's businesses failing and neither one of the two able to be true to themselves blaming everyone else for their problems.This film from minute one was insufferable for me because of how annoying Debbie was as soon as she was on screen. She seemed to act insane about being 40 which is not that old but that is just how the character is written to be. The film is way too long for the story that is being told because two and half hours is way too long for a comedy that is set in one week as we see all these events happen in the main characters life's. The film talks about the family having many problems so them spending money on an expensive trip makes no sense to the story. The ending of the film was not a good conclusion to the story because so much stuff in the film did not get a full story but also Debbie and Pete staying together made really no sense to how the two had treated each other throughout the whole film.Leslie Mann plays Debbie and Mann as an actress just cannot act in my mind. In almost everything Mann has done she is trying to make me like her but I just do not because she never really stretches herself. The character she is given is horribly written as a shrill women who complains so much that I do not know why anyone would like her. Mann try's to be dramatic with a blank stare on her face and I could not help but laugh at how unbelievably bad she was in every scene. Paul Rudd plays Pete and he has been great in small smarts but even though he is not as bad as Mann he is not much better then she is. His character is also written badly but at least Rudd knows how to play this man because he always plays the same character which is fine but I wish he would try at least shake it up. These two are the only leads and there are way too many supporting characters by some of my favourite comedic actors who are wasted and when some are given funny lines they got no laughs from me at all.The film tried to be funny and heart warming but nothing that the film did worked for me at all. The female characters in the film were very one note and even Mann's character was written badly as if no women had any input into the female characters. The film did not seem believable to me because this couple just did not belong together which made me hate this film even more then some of Apatow's produced efforts which are so much better then his directedwritten films.MOVIE GRADE F MVP Paul Rudd".

Far from a dysfunctional family nonetheless Debbie and Pete struggle to rekindle the attachment and mutual fulfillment that this marriage has brought forth. Pete is a loving father despite the fact that Sadie was never planned he affectionately tries to perform his duties even if his love for rock music places him as somewhat of a family outsider. Coupled with his ailing music label dedicated to the old timer music lovers Pete is increasingly left alone.In turn Debbie owns a clothes store womanned by the alluring Desi Megan Fox and the troubled Jodi Charlyne Yi one of them guilty of stealing profound amounts of money thus further increasing the family financial crisis. Sadie hot on the heels of her first period is an avid Lost fan and is going through a period of teenage angst which spitfires as an open rebellion to the actions of undeniably immature parents later on in the movie. In the background we have the star of the movie Charlotte Iris an 8 year old with wit to die for and a knack for a short but pinpoint summary of events.Much in the vein of 40 Year Old Virgin Judd Apatow gets in deep with an odd mix of slapstick vulgarity toilet humour and the rampant Tarantinesque meandering dialogues. Nonetheless where it works in other movies the lowbrow humour felt markedly out of place for the majority of this family drama jaggedly deflating tension and dramaturgy in order to force a cheap laugh. On top of that Apatow attempts to overdose on sideshow primarily unfunny jokes which derail attention and exacerbate running time. Nonetheless the movie has a pretty decent flow but I found myself distinctly uninterested as to where the drama is headed which questions how effective mix of comedy and social commentary actually is. One of Apatow's weaker scripts isn't helped by its predictability and overly sexual innuendos.".

This time around the movie did only one thing for me it made me thankful for my family. Leslie Mann's character was even more of a raving bitch than in Knocked up. I told my wife that I would have shoved her head in the toilet when she was trying to inspect it to see if Paul Rudd's character was really taking a crap or just avoiding her. He was probably defecating on paper so he could help make this film. Actually only Paul Rudd really brought anything to the picture unless you count Megan Fox as a hot boutique worker. The film showcases a small part of the miserable lives of Pete and Debbie as they spiral into unhappiness and misery. Into the mix are thrown several more characters who are equally miserable. I was looking forward to this movie big time and when I realized that it was going south I couldn't wait for it to be over. Unfortunately its over two hours long. So if you are looking for a way to spend a few hours in the dark lock your self in a closet or just close your eyes but do not go see this filmit sucked!".

However if you're looking for a meaningful plot that gets neatly wrapped up that's not gonna happen. Like porn the plot was just there as an excuse for the many 'money shots'the consistently funny gags about typical 40ish couple's lives.Rudd's character is suffering a struggling business and also maybe a little of 'struggling business'if you know what I mean. Mann's character has a business also that is suffering. Their kids are dealing with various modernkid issuesFacebook bullies trying to devour entire seasons of Lost in a matter of days etc. The parents fight the kids fight Rudd  Mann each have issues with their own parentsone with abandonment issues the other with what might be the polar opposite of abandonment.And the gags and issues that arise I can tell you are all based in realityit's a good composite of the issues that this demographic actually facesonly depicted with the cinematic equivalent of the Photoshop saturation slider cranked to 11. A special mention for Leslie Mann and Judd Apatow's kidsthey actually can act and they were excellent in this film. They belonged in the filmnot 'becuase their daddy is the producer'but because they added bigtime in both the many comedy scenes they were in but also in the movie's scattered drama moments. Very adorable kids who blended into this movie effortlessly and definitely added to its charm.So that's the plot and in the end it leaves you with hope that things will get better but never really pounds that point down and giftwraps a sappy happy ending but it doesn't need tothe plot is just a vehicle to tow all of the gags with.And the gags miniskits etc are very funny and very consistentme my wife and most of the theater were laughing through the bulk of the film Stay for the ending creditsthe blooper reel with Melissa McCarthy may be one of the funniest of the entire movie.So that's itI give it a 8well worth seeing in the theater and when it comes out on DVD I'll definitely rent it and see it again.".

The film honestly felt like the script was never completed an editor was never hired and the actors had no direction. It had none of the joy of his other films and not even the natural likability of the stars Rudd Mann Segel could save it. It felt dour and depressing all while under the naturally or unnaturally pleasant skies of Santa Monica.The main couple's Rudd and Mann lives are coming apart because they feel they need to change but find it difficult to change. In the end however they come to the realization that they don't need to change...this is the worst character arc imaginable...characters who go nowhere and are somehow happy about it by the end. But then again these characters start from a place of wealth and privilege not that you can't have wealthy relatable characters so you already begin the story by thinking these characters really don't have that much to complain about or enough to really care. They both have luxury cars they have a family a beautiful house...that's not exactly a starting point for an audience to feel for a set of main characters. Literally all the normally excellent actors seemed to have awful performances that felt jilted tired and unfit I mean try and find John Lithgow giving a bad performance ever this was not a good turn for Megan Fox in comedy at all go down the list...even Jason Segel who rocks almost everything he's in felt misused. The worst part of it all was it was not funny. There were a smattering of laughs for the whole film in the theater I was in. This film was a total and utter train wreck...and I almost feel bad for Apatow except for I spent my money on this film and now I feel bad for myself. I was very close to walking out a few times and I never walk out of films. The two and a half hour run time felt way excessive and basically like a first time director who didn't know how or where to cut. And the beats didn't work the COMEDY BEATS that should be Apatow's strong suit.I had to go out and watch something else the next day just to help erase the memory of this film because it was that awful. Not campy awful not funny awful just plain 'ol awful. I really wish someone had stopped this film at some level and tried to help them fix it because the themes are good the actors are normally good...all the parts could all be good...but somehow this was just the opposite...just bad really really bad. And as a writerdirector you have to put the blame on Apatow for this one.".

	schema:headline " Relationship Modern Marriage and Midlife Crisis";
	schema:reviewBody "Pete Paul Rudd is a family man married with Debbie Leslie Mann and they have two daughters the teenager Sadie Maude Apatow and the girl Charlotte Iris Apatow. Paul and Debbie who lies about her age are turning 40 and they are planning a party for Paul. He lost his job in Sony and now he has a nostalgic record label with only one artist the British rock singer and songwriter Graham Parker that was successful in the period from the 60's to the 80's. Debbie has a fashion store with two employees and she has just found an embezzlement of US 12000.00. She was poisoned by the inefficient Jodi Charlyne Yi and suspects of the productive saleswoman Desi Megan Fox. Debbie has issues with her estranged father Oliver John Lithgow while Pete secretly supports his idle father Larry Albert Brooks. Debbie meets her father and invites him for the party. Pete comes to the edge with the bankruptcy since he needs to sell their home and Debbie finds that she is pregnant but she hides from Pete. In the party Pete has a nervous breakdown but Debbie is there to help him. This is 40 is a dramatic comedy about relationship modern marriage and midlife crisis. I believe that every viewer that is more than forty years old and married with children will identify problems that he or she might have lived. There are many hilarious scenes and references to movies and shows but also moments of drama that are immediately relieved by a joke. It is also funny because I have recently watched all the 117 episodes and not 114 of Lost in five weeks the same way Sadie did. Just as a curiosity Leslie Mann is married with the director and writer Judd Apatow and the two girls Maude and Iris are their daughters. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Bemvindo aos 40 Welcome to the 40".

	schema:headline " Terrible";
	schema:reviewBody "A good rule of thumb is any movie where Jason Segal has the funnier lines probably shouldn't have been made. This seemingly endless stream of hormonal tirades was difficult to say the least. Leslie Mann pulled this off once in Knocked Up. Which was a delightful film by comparison. But in This is 40 I could not find one sympathetic thing about her character or any of the characters for that matter. Part of the problem is KnockedUp was made before this basic cast was in every other film that came out. I kept waiting for Jonah Hill to happen by and suck up what little oxygen Leslie Mann hadn't already used. I am a fan of Judd Apatow. He's a comedy geek's comedy geek. Hence the casting of the brilliant veteran comedy writer Robert Smigel as the buddy of Pete. So I settled in to watch and see what Smigel could do as an actor. But he had two scenes in this nearly two and a half hour film. Guess they cut some of his scenes to make room for some more where Leslie Mann gets angry over nothing and curses and screams for half an hour. I was also excited to see Jim Brooks as Pete's father. He receives lots of screen time and is the second least sympathetic character. I do admire Apatow for having the courage to try and combine work and home by just putting his family on screen. But why so mundane? It's compelling when a film depicts regular people in not so regular situations. This film is made up of regular people who live in southern California and drive BMW's and Lexi and complain constantly about things that happen to everyone. It's exhausting. I will not give any attention to the children in this review as it is clear that they have received far too much attention already. On a strictly laugh o meter scale this film is not completely devoid of humor. Like say Funny People. In fact Funny People makes This is 40 look like The Jerk. Paul Rudd does fine as usualand Megan Fox is great eye candy and hottie relief. Here's hoping that this is the end of Apatow's tacky Cassavetes period.".

I'm in my mid 30's and I found the main characters including the kids to be self centered annoying and most of all depressing. The title of the movie should not be This is 40. It should be This is 18 because the language the acting the situation humor would only appeal to that age group... I cannot stress enough how painfully awful this way too long movie is... This should have never made it into a production. If anything is should of been a one time Saturday Night Life skid. It would probably be fine as that... Nothing more... Do not waste 2hrs of your life on this emotionless drain on your brain... Worst movie of 2013 for me so far.....".

She's obsessed with how she looks like and tries to act like a 20 year old. She has a very irritating voice it's very high pitched  she sounds like she is a 15 year old girl!! Not a great actress either. The adults in this movie act like immaturechildren  get away with their childish antics. Its not really funny. All the funny parts are in the trailer anyways. ALSO is it just me or does Megan Fox always play the hotdumb girl in all her roles! Why doesn't she take on a role of an independent woman someone that would actually be a good role model for young girls! Anyways the characterizations of the women in this movie are terrible representations of how women should be like submissive to their husbands needing to look hot to get a man. Don't watch. awful movie".

	schema:reviewBody "Judd Apatow is undoubtedly directly at the centre of the USA's comedy universe. Discovering and nurturing stars such as Seth Rogen Jason Segel and Jonah Hill and with movies like Superbad Bridesmaids and Anchorman to his name Apatow has earned the power to make movies about anything he wants starring whoever he wants. And so we have This is 40 the fourth film that he has written directed and produced after The 40 Year Old Virgin Knocked Up and the far weaker Funny People. Starring his wife Leslie Mann and two kids Maude and Iris and filmed on the Apatow's street this is bordering on autobiographical even Judd's 90 year old grandmother makes an appearance. The movie follows the story of Pete Paul Rudd essentially playing Apatow and Debbie Mann and their two kids Charlotte and Sadie Maude and Iris Apatow who we met as supporting characters in Knocked Up and whose marriage is flagging after 14 years. The story doesn't get any more complicated than that really. Watching as this welltodo family of four battles through a plethora of first world problems they might have to move from their big house to a slightly smaller big house children spending too much time on the ipad etc for two and a half hours sounds like it would be agonising and boring and yet it isn't. The fact is that this film is so observant of the uppermiddle class to which it's characters belong so honest about the little everyday struggles that they encounter that it feels like it's real and real is funny. Even with hilarious supporting characters played by Megan Fox Melissa McCarthy Jason Segel Chris O'Dowd Lena Dunham and Albert Brooks the real stars here are the family of Apatows who nail the nuances of interfamily relationships with Maude Apatow putting in a particularly brilliant performance as overdramatic older sister Sadie. This Is 40 has been unfairly criticised for overdramatising the problems of a rich LA family saying that the parents come across as mean and the kids as spoilt but that analysis is shallow. This film goes deeper than that the characters aren't upset because they're losing money they're upset because their relationship is falling apart that they have secrets in their marriage that they can't be honest with each other. People seem repulsed by the fact that a comedy about the rich is trying to earn the audience's sympathy but why not? Can a comedy only be emotional if it's about the poor? I was sure that films like Four Weddings and a Funeral and Lost In Translation had already proved that this wasn't the case. But just in case there was any doubt This is 40 is here to do it again.".

This does not mean that writer director Judd Apatow has matured. It's a bit more of a dramedy than some of his other comedic adventures but it's still his typical lowbrow humour spread out for over two hours. The characters are older more assured in who they are but their responses to life are less cultured.Pete eats too many cupcakes makes poor business decisions and doesn't tell his wife that they have to sell their house. Debbie obsesses over younger and hotter bodies nags her husband about their sex life and takes extreme reactions to every little or big thing. Debbie is rude selfish inconsiderate immature and so disconnected from every reasonable woman that there is no humanly possible way to make her likable let alone funny. Pete was slightly better still selfish inconsiderate and immature but at least his jokes were just unfunny rather than rude.The plot in the loosest sense of that word has Pete turning 40 and Debbie is going to throw his birthday party but Pete is preoccupied with his failing business and Debbie is preoccupied with hating him. She is also obsessed with getting a tighter body and ogling them on younger women  this involves feeling up her young employee Megan Fox and hiring a fitness trainer. The main cameo of many returning Apatow players is Jason Segel as the fitness trainer. Why? Because it's supposed to be funny. Everything in the first two hours or so was done solely for the comedy. Some of it was funny Pete is played by Paul Rudd after all and there's a small role for Melissa McCarthy but a lot of it was in the trailer and most of it was just stupid. It was also at this point the twohour mark that Debbie declares All of a sudden we're a magnet of negativity. What did we do? Maybe she wasn't watching the movie but this has been two hours it's not all of a sudden and secondly she is the source of the negativity. This should be the turning point for the film but Debbie still hasn't figured out how horrible of a person she is. That comes later.Very similar to The FiveYear Engagement 2012 another romantic comedy that took way too long to come to its inevitable conclusion This is 40 only gets emotionally resonant when the characters finally make the change for the better. Too bad that in this case the characters were too far from redeemable in the first place.".

I don't think it was entirely due to her performance but the overall theme of the...much too long film. This films best moments are all in the trailers so save the money and just watch the trailers. This is a by the numbers type film... it hits all the beats...unfortunately its just not credible. From the beginning we are suppose to believe this family is dysfunctional...having money issues.... The husband owns a record label...that is struggling to sign profitable artists...of course the owners taste is ....off.... he obsesses over cupcakes yet rides the trek bike and drives a BMW. The wife a dress store owner that has a smoking problem has employees stealing money and having sex while on the clock and the other drives a Lexas and has a personal trainer.... He's going broke yet throws himself a lavish Bday party and takes getaway vacations with the wife...Its like a bad Richard Pryor routine... private part jokes partially nudity gutter humor dysfunctional families Clich mindless waste of time and money.The resolve turns on a dime and makes no sense.... Im still trying to figure out the point...the moral to the story. Sure I liked Mann's partial nudity...that being said..I also think she sold out and aren't sure I think that highly of her for it....Lame".

	schema:reviewBody "Tsui Hark goes back to the well to draw fresh inspiration returning once more to King Hu's classic Dragon Gate Inn  which he already remade rather wonderfully in 1992. The story is given a fresh set of details to flesh it out but the basic skeleton remains the same  evil eunuchs patriotic rebels and independent forces of uncertain allegiance all converge on the eponymous inn where identities are masked and secrets concealed until a game of wits allows the various parties to ascertain where they all stand  and exactly whose ass they need to kick.This is not the first time that Tsui Hark has convinced himself that what one of his classic films really needed was an update with loads of CGI  witness Legend of Zu in 2001 an exercise which failed to convince anybody else of that viewpoint. This time he has an extra decade of Chinese experience in CGI to draw on though and what's more... now he can do it in 3D! Well I will have to take the internet's word for that 'cause I watched in boring old 2D albeit HD. Can he convince us this time that computer graphics are the tool he's been waiting for all along to truly unleash his imagination? No he can't. Aside from a few impressive moments the CGI still looks rather fake and fails to impress or engage as well as the lowbudget special effects wires clever camera work that made the 1992 film such an impressive spectacle. Furthermore he seems to have failed to note the main factor that caused Legend of Zu to rank so much lower in fans' hearts than its 1983 predecessor... all the special effects in the world won't engage an audience if they don't get involved in the story. Welldefined likable or hateable where appropriate characters whose fates we actually care about will encourage us to forgive any weaknesses in the special effects but the converse is rarely true. Flying Swords of Dragon Gate fails to deliver on characters and fails to develop the plot. The film begins by introducing the political intrigues of the court and the rival factions of the Eunuchs then fails to provide any particular relevance to this detail. Jet Li plays a rebel who we assume to be patriotic but doesn't actually offer any explanation whatsoever as to as his motivations his particular plights or much of a character at all though he gets more than most. Various groups are introduced and brought together at the inn then the film sort of flounders for a little bit before everybody just sort of decides its time to start fighting. The sense of intrigue the subtle details the game of wits as these master fighters outsmart and outguess each other... the actual meat of King Hu's original film in other words... pretty much replaced by 'hey one of the good guys happens to look exactly like the chief bad guy!'.Oh well Jet Li's on hand so at least there must be some spectacular action right? Oh yeah I forgot... he got old. There are some nicely choreographed action scenes in places but with too much reliance on CGI of mixed effectiveness.Maybe I'm viewing the older films with a touch of rosetinting or maybe I'm just getting old and tHe KidZ will see the many virtues of the latest attempt to improve a classic that I'm missing. It probably did look quite spectacular in 3Dcapable cinemas... but I am yet to be convinced that that can ever take the place of a well written script or a director who still remembers that he has human actors on set somewhere and that getting a great performance out of them is probably the most important of his job.".

	schema:headline " Thrilling action and the best use of 3D since 'Avatar' pity the frenetic overplotting the underwritten characters and most of all an underused Jet Li";
	schema:reviewBody "Who better to attempt the world's first 3D 'wuxia' movie than Tsui Hark the man is behind some of the genre's most iconic representations like 'The Swordsman' 'Green Snake' and 'Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain' and with the latter also a pioneer for introducing Hollywood style special effects to Chinese cinema. It seems befitting therefore that almost thirty years later Tsui Hark should be the one to import the latest Hollywood fad for the same genre and true enough the veteran director's maiden effort at the third dimension is nothing less than impressive.Like James Cameron Tsui brings his considerable experience as a director to bear on the use of 3D to immerse his viewer into his cinematic vision. Gimmicks aside yes you'll still find all kinds of flying objects wooden beams arrows knives and swords coming straight at you Tsui crafts each shot static or moving meticulously to create depth in every one of them and provide raison d'etre for the use of 3D. Tsui has of course had some generous help from Hollywood expert Chuck Comisky who oversaw the visual effects for 'Avatar' and the result is a milestone for the 'wuxia' genre as well as for Chinese cinema.Alas for all its technical achievements this loose remake of his classic 'New Dragon Gate Inn' unfortunately is let down by more conventional elements like plot and character. As with his earlier movie the setup here is also the gathering of three disparate groups of individuals at a trading post in the middle of the desert. On one hand there is the vigilante Zhao Huai'an Jet Li Zhao's female equivalent Ling Lanqiu Zhou Xun as well as a runaway palace maid Su Mavis Fan impregnated by the Emperor and therefore an assassination target by the Empress to preserve the lineage. On the other there are the formidable Western Bureau troops led by their fearsome commander Yu Huatian Chen Kun who have been sent by the Empress to kill Su and eliminate those opposed to the reigning monarchy.The pursuit of the latter for the former leads their paths to cross with a ragtag group of bandits in search of ancient treasure buried under the sand near the inn. The advent of a oncein60years major sandstorm is supposed to unearth the treasure and among those waiting to get a share of the riches are Gu Shaotang Li Yuchun Yu Huatian's doppelganger White Blade also Chen Kun as well as an intimidating Tartar warrior princess Buludu Gwai Lun Mei and her band of loutish tribesmen. Setting up such a sheer number of characters takes time and a good halfhour is spent on exposition detailing these individuals and their relationships with each other. The effect of this after an exciting first halfhour watching Zhao assassinate the leader of the Eastern Front Gordon Liu and then finding himself outmatched by Yu is like adding a lead weight to the proceedings so much so that what momentum the film had going for it is almost completely lost.Perhaps even more significant is that Jet Li is practically absent during this halfhour and by the time he does reappear to join in the actionpacked finale it's too late for any significant characterisation to allow his crusading warrior Zhao Huai'an to rise above the fray. There is a past romance hinted at with Zhou Xun's Ling but Tsui provides too little elaboration on it and if Jet Li's Zhao is thinly drawn you can pretty much guess that the rest of the characters also suffer the same fate.Not only does this first reunion of Tsui Hark and Jet Li outside the 'Once Upon A Time in China' series fail to create a cinematic icon like Wong FeiHung it also gives Jet Li surprisingly little to do in the action department. As if hemmed in by the movie's title Jet Li is almost always duelling only with his swords while performing some gravitydefying flight through the air with ultimately too little of the lightningquick handtohand combat we've come to love about the action star. Not to say that Yuen Bun's action choreography doesn't thrill it does especially with Tsui's ability to direct elaborate action sequences but one hopes that Yuen who was also behind Tsui's 'New Dragon Gate Inn' back in 1992 and his cochoreographers Lan Ha Han and Sun Jiankui had exploited Jet Li's martial arts prowess for more.While it fails to capitalise on its key asset i.e. Jet Li the film does deliver some thrilling action sequences that blend oldschool choreography with modernday CG wizardry the showdown between Zhao and Yu right in the middle of a raging sandstorm is an excellent example of this combination. Amid the wireful stunts the excellently staged swordplay stands out and it is Zhou Xun rather than Jet Li who impresses with her elegant moves. Kudos too to Choi Sungfai's fluid cinematography and Yau Chiwan's deft editing in all the elaborately staged action sequences especially one which seamlessly intercuts between the action inside the inn and below the inn when the triumvirate first converge.In terms of visual spectacle Tsui Hark is definitely at the top of his game both the action choreography and the initiation of 3D into the 'wuxia' genre easily establishing itself as one of the mustsee classics. Nonetheless for all its technical achievements this latest reworking of the 'Dragon Inn' mythology is let down by its poorly drawn characters and at times its frenetic overplotting of deceptions and doublecrosses. And even as Tsui has more than proved his prowess with newfangled Hollywood magic one wishes that he had also not forgotten his faculty for oldschool elements like plot and character after all it was these that made his 1992 'New Dragon Gate Inn' such an enduring masterpiece.".

And even as Tsui has more than proved his prowess with newfangled Hollywood magic one wishes that he had also not forgotten his faculty for oldschool elements like plot and character after all it was these that made his 1992 'New Dragon Gate Inn' such an enduring masterpiece.";

Almost none of the martial arts scenes were live action and those that were live action were sadly lacking in clarity the director preferring quick cuts and flash over substance.The story itself wasn't bad. It is a bit more complicated than the average kungfu movie which explains the two hour run time of the movie. Sadly much of the depth in the movie felt added on as if they took a chunk from several movies and added them together.Also I have to say the opening sequence reminded me of something your would see at the beginning of a video game rather than an actual movie.I would wait to see this one on video.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Flying Swords of Dragon Inn expands upon the mythos created in the earlier two films and throws in a lot more formidable characters as well as their respective selfish objectives and missions starting with the lead character of Zhou Huai'an Jet Li a vigilante in the Ming Dynasty responsible for a spate of killings of corrupt court officials. With the King forming the East and West Bureaus in the same fashion as the FBI and CIA respectively an incredible set action piece that serves as a prologue has Zhou dispatching the head of the East Bureau in a special appearance by the legendary Gordon Liu to make the case of how powerful Zhou is with his lightning quick reflexes and special moves that we don't see much of and gets that special effects boost as well.You see Zhou disappears for about more than half the movie which is a pity since Jet Li's star billing is used everywhere. Like a wandering swordsman who pops up every now and then to help the poor and the weak the damsel in distress here is a palace handmaiden Mavis Fan who is on the run for carrying what would be the Dragon baby impregnated by a naturally lecherous Emperor whose concubine sets the entire plot in motion for wanting any female with the possibility of producing a bloodline to the throne terminated. With Yu Hua Tian Chen Kun the head of the West Bureau her pillow partner the game is afoot when the handmaiden gets rescued by Ling Lanqiu Zhou Xun the female equivalent of Zhou Huai'an whose brooding demeanour hints at a past romantic liaison with Zhou and who harbours some secrets of the infamous Dragon Inn which is now populated by rag tag characters There are subplots galore in the film whose screenplay is also written by Tsui Hark that will call for your utmost attention in order to keep pace and make sense of it all some properly developed while others relying on your past knowledge of the Dragon Inn mythos as foundation in which this retelling is based on allowing you to connect the dots why certain events are done the way they are now. For instance in Hu's original film there are bloodlines on the run which get congregated at Dragon Inn and this one loosely follows that rationale. And for once we know why various groups descend upon this inn in the middle of nowhere if not for the very ordinary reason of having treasure buried somewhere in the midst of the vast wasteland and to hunt for it meant to exploit the tunnels beneath the inn make sense of some inscribed couplets and depending on 1 in 60 years not 1 in 50 years ponding in Singapore mind you geographic events to allow all the cards to fall into place.However like all great martial arts epic the fun always lies with the villains and Flying Swords boasts a memorable number of them. Chen Kun's Yu Hua Tian has in possession the title Flying Swords that brings back the hey days where gimmicky weapons are the order of the day in swordfighting films and is himself an adversary who knows no mercy. His double role here makes this almost like a Chen Kun starrer and a well deserved one for the performance put in as characters on either side of the fence. His cronies too are as bad as bad can be and are exponents in their own right with Fan Siu Wong as the masked Ma Jing Liang and the Western Bureau second in command Tan Lu Zi Sheng Jian who unfortunately gets outfoxed most of the time.As a martial arts film Flying Swords of Dragon Gate has enough variance in its fighting stances and styles and to exploit 3D naturally has stocked up on its flying dagger numbers to provide for those throwtowardthescreen moments. It's quite hit and miss here as some effects were wondrously too rich and too artificial that takes you out of the movie and may look more in place in a science fiction film instead while others are done just right to blend in with the period surroundings. With a number of Chinese films these days just slapping on special effects like it was butter on bread Culprits being films like Legendary Amazons The Sorcerer and White Snake which also starred Jet Li and just about every period flick coming out in the last year or two this one may have to convince those who are turned off by the earlier shoddy productions. Tsui Hark continues to reinvent himself with each technological leap with his Zu Warriors of the Magic Mountain 1983 not the 2001 monstrosity the Once Upon a Time in China series and now with Detective Dee leading the charge and sealing the deal for his comeback Flying Swords may just be that magic ticket Tsui Hark needs to reestablish himself as one of the greats in Asian cinema after a woeful past decade. It may not be an instant classic but Flying Swords does have the necessary ingredients to make it amongst the game changing tent poles of the genre.".

	schema:headline " HK Neo Reviews Flying Swords of Dragon Gate 3D";
	schema:reviewBody "Flying Swords of Dragon Gate is exactly how to make use of 3D technology. Apart from James Cameron's Avatar the use of 3D has been mostly disappointing. Innovative director Tsui Harks does it again and exceeds all expectations in delivering not only a great movie but uses 3D to maximum effect. In a reunion of sorts Jet Li teams up with Tsui Hark for the first time since the Once Upon a Time in China days. After the staggeringly excellent Detective Dee's last year Hark continues his great form by bringing the audience into his imaginary world with 3 times the realism and some stunning special effects. Every inch of the budget seems to be perfectly used and the action direction is top class. The use of daggers flying swords and martial arts display are all perfectly aided by the 3D effects. It is rare that a remakereimagination of an all time classic New Dragon Gate 1991 can be outdux but Hark achieves the impossible by delivering the most impressive and creative Hong Kong movie of the year. Although Jet Li seems wasted in a role that is far too limited for both his acting and martial arts abilities Zhou Xun impresses in a role that requires little but crucial to the movie. Chen Kun once again impresses in a duo role and Taiwanese Kwai Lunmei adds some flair and style. However if there is one big flaw in the film it is the lack of chemistry between Li and Zhou. Then again it is probably truism by now that Li rarely strikes up chemistry with costars and with Rosamund Kwan Once Upon a Time in China series out of the game it is hard to see which actress can bring down his romantic defenses.Still Flying Swords of Dragon Gate is more than a stellar effort and qualifies as true Asian Blockbuster of the year. It is the kind of movie that will bring the people back to the cinemas. All in all it is probably an understatement to call Tsui Hark a genius but just when all his Hollywood count parts fails to understand 3D technology Hark steps up and above his peers and deliver a sucker punch of a movie. Flying Swords of Dragon Gate is not just a good movie but it is a great movie on all levels. It is what you call a unique movie experience that brings in the world of Wuxia to the maximum effect. I am proud of Tsui Hark's achievements and after watching Flying Swords of Dragon Gate he too should be proud of himself. Simply the film to beat in 2011 Neo rates it 9.510".

So nearly 20 years later when he decided to make a sequel of the original film with a pristine cast top billed by Jet Li Xun Zhou Kun Chen and an assemblage of domestic celebrities from mainland China Hong Kong and Taiwan my expectation was quite high as I rarely watch any Chinese films now also Tsui's previous detectiveaction bigbudgeted vehicle DETECTIVE DEE AND THE MYSTERY OF THE PHANTOM FLAME 2010 a 710 has somewhat rescued him from his career ennui since the millennium so god forgives me if I hadn't prepared for the worst and this film is an utter disaster. The storyline has never been at least fluent enough to let the audience know what is happening and the reactions ignited by various plots are beyond any possible interrelations so at most 45 minutes later I cannot care less about the story and I believe I am not the only one. The cast is quite awful Jet Li is too old to resurrect Tony Leung Ka Fai's original role and Li is literally only 5 years younger so basically it's just a strategy for the sake of the action part and every earth man knows Li is not a talented actor besides his Chinese Kung Fu. So as gifted as Xun Zhou their emotional interaction is for naught. The only saving grace if one must pick is Kun Chen who has two different roles including the unexplained doppelgnger in the dramatis personae at least leaves some vague impression in the shattered hotchpotch of direly fake CGI effects in the desert a treasurehunting chicanery and many other ridiculous and incoherent twists.Gosh I have already dwindled my quota of Chinese films each year to the maximum of 5 and this megalomaniac film could have successfully grabbed tons of money in the box office during the Spring Festival season does baffle me so much is the market really so parched that poor audience would simply take anything would quench their thirst no matter how illogically laughable the quality. I feel so worried and upset towards the future of Chinese film ground the scale of cinemas is enlarging day by day but basically is where tasteless garbages consecutively reside.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first of Tsui's wuxai epics I have seen. Has a very gripping plot with twists you can see happening and some that come out of nowhere leaving you thinking I didn't see that coming. I personally loved how the plot came about and left the viewer surprised a popular review mentions that the film failed to use it's best asset in Jet Li. I disagree mightily Epics in general are about the grand story and not the over saturation of a single character.If anything while I admit I have not seen others in the Dragon Inn series I felt the story wasn't quite big enough. Especially with how the opening scene led you to believe it was going. It could have also done with a slight bit more character development.The action scenes were amazing definitely no complaints there. I felt that one in particular near the ending was a bit over the top but Tsui was lured into using 3D technology as much as possible.Xun Zhao gave the best acting performance and stood out for her strong delivery and dry persona that told the story of her character. She was also able to display other emotions well when the time was needed. Very solid performance from her.Kwan LunMei was also very effective in her role as the Tatar leader and displayed a cool dark screen presence. Overall I rated the movie very high as it was intelligent and had some suspenseful elements that spoke to the story telling which is saying quite a bit as it still had a bit of room for improvement.True Score 8.1".

What it is is nonstop unrealistically stupid badly done CGI.Part I hated the most is that there is better flow of moves in Batman Origins Video Game than in this movie. Good for Batman Origins very very bad for unmemorable Dragon Gate.These is far too much posing stopping pausing centering on badly acted facial expressions ... I really do not like Anime so maybe that is part of the problem here but this thing felt like Cbudget Live Action Anime Roleplay by fans who are not really actors and have no professional experience.".

This is NOT a martial arts movie! What it is is nonstop unrealistically stupid badly done CGI.Part I hated the most is that there is better flow of moves in Batman Origins Video Game than in this movie. Good for Batman Origins very very bad for unmemorable Dragon Gate.These is far too much posing stopping pausing centering on badly acted facial expressions ... I really do not like Anime so maybe that is part of the problem here but this thing felt like Cbudget Live Action Anime Roleplay by fans who are not really actors and have no professional experience.";

I watched this mainly because of Jet Li's presence in the cast and sadly that didn't help. His fights are also injected with too much CGI and over done wire effects. I would have hoped he would pick a better film to make his return into wushu epics. I will go watch Hero or Fearless now to wipe my mind of this general bs.

The fight sequences were over long and at times ridiculous. I know some Chinese films over use wire work and CGI but this one took it even further to show the characters flying through the air having and having amazing powers so that a flick of the hand could cause inanimate objects to do whatever they wanted. Yes despite these amazing powers they were in the end killed by relatively simple means. The sword fights were also ridiculous with a never ending stream of knives appearing from nowhere.This is NOT a Martial Arts film but rather a fantasy more like watching a Video game than a movie.It is a shame because there were some good actors in this film but the director seems to have let things go to his head and lost the plot.This is one DVD for the bargain basket I am afraid.".

Thanks to him I was imagining something terrible and I am glad to have watched the film! I think who saw the New Dragon Inn will enjoy this film more because he will know some of the story and of the Characters. There are better films of course but this is a good movie and absolutely deserves to be watched if you like intrigue and martial arts. Characters are good the plot is not great but IMO better than in the original and the style of fights even if not the best is for me better than in the original because more appropriate to what I started to like since when I watched Hero.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is directed by the legendary Tsui Hark features one of my favourite actors with Jet Li and is about Chinese legends and myths. This sounds quite promising but the final result is only of an average quality and therefor rather disappointing.The main problem is that Tsui Hark and Jet Li have become older but especially the director forgot to progress. He still does his movies the same way he did it in the late eighties or in the early nineties when they became international blockbusters. This style simply fails to impress nowadays. The choreographies are still bombastic and detailed but they feel even more exaggerated and artificial than usual because this movie is completely overloaded with special CGI effects. Jet Li has also become older and doesn't do the impressive fighting scenes he did in the past. He is quite underused in this flick.All these things wouldn't be so bad if Jet Li incarnated a good character. In movies such as Fearless he proved that he is not only an excellent fighter but also a credible actor. If Tsui Hark had created an intriguing story the high amount of effects wouldn't have harmed this movie. That's what the main problem is. The movie includes no interesting story line and is rather confusing. The story is very tough to follow because there are many impostors and conspiracies going on which would normally be interesting but as the amount of intrigues is too elevated the formula simply doesn't work and one gets quite mixed up in the end. A few potentially interesting characters play only minor roles such as the Tartars while I feel almost no empathy with the main actors. Jet Li's acting remains faceless and if there are a few good actors in this film then these are the female ones such as Xun Zhou and especially Gwei LunMei.Both Tsui Hark and Jet Li must though change their styles and skills to still create stunning movies these years. Both deliver a rather lukewarm performance and can't convince. The movie kicks off with a few interesting scenes and special effects but as soon as the story takes places in the desert tavern the movie gets worse. The effects in the final third of the film are overwhelming and unnecessary and make the whole thing rather hard to sit through as it feels like a cheesy Walt Disney production. Any fan of both the main actor and the director should go for the original movies and ignore this one. The People's Republic of China seems to do the same mistakes as Hollywood these days and invests in useless remakes and sequels instead of focusing on fresh stories which I simply can't support as the originals were way better and innovating for their time. This here is for true fans only.".

	schema:reviewBody "Maybe I gave Seven Swords too high of a score after seeing this one.This one is leaning towards a smart sardonic thriller then a wuxai epic  is Tsui Hark going the more subtle route now? There are the obvious and not so obvious twists. The hidden agenda behind an hidden identity. The what you think they know and what you think they know you know kind of stuff. Sometimes each interlude and detail plays out more like a setup to a joke  most of the time dry sometimes a bit overdone.So maybe the writing is deserving more applause. The 3D not so much a distraction then a tool. But yet it feels like Tsui Hark old school humour that is kind of charming if done right.There are hidden back stories good they don't try to explain everything. But some are hurried along like the initial setup of East wing vs West wing.The meat in the middle where all it's happening inside the hostel for me is the gem. Everyone is careful waiting for the wrong move a flaw a signal a sign. The tension is nice.The ending CG extravaganza is a formality to the bacon double cheese burger  to fill you up so it seems it is worth the cost. But still I bought it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Maybe I gave Seven Swords too high of a score after seeing this one.This one is leaning towards a smart sardonic thriller then a wuxai epic  is Tsui Hark going the more subtle route now? There are the obvious and not so obvious twists. The hidden agenda behind an hidden identity. The what you think they know and what you think they know you know kind of stuff. Sometimes each interlude and detail plays out more like a setup to a joke  most of the time dry sometimes a bit overdone.So maybe the writing is deserving more applause. The 3D not so much a distraction then a tool. But yet it feels like Tsui Hark old school humour that is kind of charming if done right.There are hidden back stories good they don't try to explain everything. But some are hurried along like the initial setup of East wing vs West wing.The meat in the middle where all it's happening inside the hostel for me is the gem. Everyone is careful waiting for the wrong move a flaw a signal a sign. The tension is nice.The ending CG extravaganza is a formality to the bacon double cheese burger  to fill you up so it seems it is worth the cost. But still I bought it.";

On top of that the characters kept on throwing up all these different names so it was hard to work out who was who. On the plus side the production looked impressive and you could tell that there was quite a bit of money spent on some of the scenes but I couldn't take the flying on strings action scenes along with the crazy sword fights which went way over the top. Personally I might have enjoyed it more if I knew what was going on but I found it way to confusing and I lost the plot near the beginning. Disappointing!RoundUp Jet Li is quite an impressive actor because he does his own stunts and he has an unique fast fighting style but his performances aren't that emotional and some of his choice of films are really strange. He isn't in the same category as Jackie Chan because of his earlier contribution to Asian cinema but there yet to find someone with the charisma and martial arts skills like Bruce Lee. I suppose it's like people like Bob Marley who really can't me imitated. Anyway I really did have high hopes for this film but I got totally let down because of the confusing storyline and unrealistic action scenes.Budget 35million Worldwide Gross 100millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their Jet Li movies about a clan fighting against evil doers to save some hidden treasure from getting in the wrong hands. 210".

	schema:reviewBody "Famed Asian director Tsui Hark known for the Once Upon Time China series and his most recent Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame returns with an allnew remakereimagining of the Dragon Inn series with Flying Swords of Dragon Gate. This film not only features Hark bringing back the famed wuxia style superstar Jet Li and is the first wuxia film shot entirely in 3D.Flying Sword is set three years after Dragon Inn and the original owner Jade has disappeared and in her place a band of marauders disguised as citizens in hopes to find a fabled lost city. This was a great entry into this genre of martial arts filmmaking. The sets and visuals are as epic as every taking you into the world just like those that came before it. The story is fairly straight forward and not as nearly convoluted as most in this genre but does a have a few moments here and there that veer off on an unstable path but return with little confusion. The cast all do a great job bringing their characters to life and delivering the needed action to make this film work. Much like the original Dragon Inn films in 1992 this hearkens back to the time of over the top wild and crazy action that works on every level. This film sports some of the best martial arts action of this genre in sometime. Somewhere it seemed like they forgot how much fun and great these films were but thankfully Hark is bringing it back. While not getting the chance to witness the 3D in action it is clear from the way this movie is shot that they took full advantage of it. It easily enhanced the 2D version making it more intriguing and fun while never being distracting.For all those bummed about Jet Li's minimal return in Expendables 2 this is a welcomed replacement to get your Li fix. He is in top form reminding everyone where he came from and why we love him so much. As if this great film wasn't enough as is there is even a cameo by the legendary martial arts icon Gordon Liu that will make old school fans of this genre smile. If you like Li or these old school style martial arts films you have to check this film out you will not be disappointed.httpwww.examiner.commovieindallasbobbyblakey".

	schema:headline " Director Tsui Hark bit off more than he could chew...";
	schema:reviewBody "Usually Tsui Hark does a good job in directing action movies but it seems that he tried to bite off a bit too much off the cake with this particular project. Why? Well because the movie in its striving to be an epic swordsman's tale just turned out to be a mediocre story that wanted to accomplish too much and delivered very little.This is a wirefu movie in all of wirefu's glory. Is that bad? Well not necessarily however the extended usage of the wires in the movie ended up being a bit too much as people were constantly in the air and all over the place. It just seemed too strained.The fighting and martial arts was right on the spot though. Thumbs up on that part. They managed to pull that off quite nicely. However and yes there is a however here as well there was just too many weapons breaking into pieces and flying all over the place but miraculously most people were able to parry all these projectiles. Again it ended up being too much and too forced. Personally I ended up being irritated at this as just about every person in the movie was a martial arts 'superhero' of sorts capable of performing grand stunts or blurring maneuvers with weapons.Storywise then Flying Swords of Dragon Gate wasn't overly impressive. The story was easy enough to follow but Tsui Hark tried to implement a bit too many angles on the story adding too many different elements of people with various backgrounds and reasons for being at the inn. Which ultimately and sadly turned out to be a little bit of a jumpy and not overly continuously welltold storyline.As for the people hired to portray the various roles then they had managed to put together a rather good ensemble of Chinese cast. There were some good performances both actingwise and martial artswise.If you enjoy these Chinese tall stories of epic battles sword fights and martial arts then you might find some enjoyment in Flying Swords of Dragon Gate although I will say that there are far better and more impressive movies out there in the same genre. This is not Tsui Hark's best work far from it actually.".

Meanwhile the emperor's chief concubine has had the West Bureau execute three courtesans who got pregnant and ordered them to hunt down a fourth.

There are many others there drawn by a legend which says that a city with lots of treasure will be uncovered during such a sandstorm. By the time the storm arrives the West Bureau has arrived there is also a man who looks almost identical to its leader a group of Mongols and various bandits conflict is inevitable and when it comes things get confusing at times.As this film got underway I quickly prepared to be disappointed as the opening scene featured some very obvious CGI thankfully after that things improved somewhat and the effects towards the end where much better. The story was a little confusing at times with a large cast of characters some of whom look identical ultimately this doesn't matter too much as we can tell who the main characters are except when there is deliberate confusion. There is plenty of solid action which fans of Wuxia style fighting are likely to enjoy. The cast which includes Jet Li does a fine job. Overall this isn't a classic of the genre but it is still well worth watching.These comments are based on watching the film in Mandarin with English subtitles an English dub is also available but I can't comment on its quality.".

But speaking in my own opinion I did enjoy this movie a lot. I first saw this film when I purchased the original Japanese dialog version off the internet. The subtitles I'm afraid were very crummy misspelling and mistranslating many of the words but besides that I followed the storyline pretty well. I have yet to see the English dub however and I do hope that it does the original justice.Fifty years ago Inuyasha and the priestess Kikyo traveled to an island called Houraijima or Mystic Island. There they met six halfdemon hanyou children who have four scars on their back which prevented them from leaving the island. It turns out that four demons called the Shitoushin inflicted these scars on the children. In order to keep their powers the Shitoushin need halfdemons to throw into the furnace and absorb their life force. Inuyasha is also inflicted with these scars and fifty years later he returns to the island along with the whole gang to defeat the four Shitoushin and save the hanyou children.This film is actionpacked with a superb music score and wonderful animation. There's humor here and there the usual jokes such as Kagome's famous Sit! commands and Miroku's usual lechery. Plus we have six new halfdemons who are introduced each with their own unique personalities that we can hatelove. All in all this was a good film that's sure to please any Inuyasha fan so be sure to watch it if you ever get the chance! Note This movie is not an ending to the series and has little or no effect on the series plot so don't watch it if you're hoping for any answered questions".

	schema:reviewBody "Overall its an Inuyasha movie... what do you expect? It's not like they can make a bad Inuyasha movie... although I'd say that this one comes particularly close. There is a lot of action in it but the story line is very weak. In the movie Inuyasha  company are drawn to a mystical island. There they have to parent a bunch of halfdemon kids while fighting four war gods. Sesshomaru and Kikyo get involved and overall its just really weird. Not necessarily confusing but definitely weird not to mention weak.So in conclusion... If you like Inuyasha go see it but don't expect too much from it except lots of action and a weak storyline.6.510".
